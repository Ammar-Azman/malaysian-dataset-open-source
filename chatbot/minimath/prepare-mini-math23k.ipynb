      "\"If $0.8= \\\\frac{y}{186+x}$, find the smallest value of $x$, if $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. I notice that this equation involves fractions and decimals, so I want to clear the fractions and decimals by multiplying both sides by a suitable common multiple.\\nI see that 0.8 is the same as $\\\\frac{8}{10}$, so I can rewrite the equation as $\\\\frac{8}{10}=\\\\frac{y}{186+x}$.\\nTo clear the fractions, I can multiply both sides by the product of the denominators, which is $10(186+x)$.\\nThis gives me $8(186+x)=10y$.\\nTo clear the decimals, I can divide both sides by 10, which gives me $4(186+x)=5y$.\\nNow I have a simpler equation that relates $x$ and $y$ as integers.\\nI want to find the smallest value of $x$, so I want to minimize $186+x$.\\nThis means I want to make $186+x$ a multiple of 5, since 5 is the coefficient of $y$.\\nThe smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than or equal to 186 is 190.\\nSo I can set $186+x=190$, which implies that $x=4$.\\nThis is the smallest value of $x$ that makes the equation true for some positive integer $y$.\\nI can check that $x=4$ works by plugging it back into the original equation and solving for $y$.\\nIf $x=4$, then $\\\\frac{8}{10}=\\\\frac{y}{190}$, which implies that $y=\\\\frac{8}{10}\\\\times 190=152$.\\nThis is a positive integer, so $x=4$ and $y=152$ are valid solutions.\"\r\n"
