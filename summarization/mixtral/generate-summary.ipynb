She also had strange dreams about children, animals, and a cheating husband. She ignored these dreams and considered them just part of her sleep. Her former teacher, who used to bother her, still acted inappropriately after her marriage. Once, he told her that he wanted her, making her uncomfortable. Soon after that, she started experiencing severe stomach pains and abnormal menstrual cycles. She went back to her hometown for treatment and recovered after seven days. When she returned to work, her teacher touched her hand again, which triggered her pain. Despite being unwell, she continued working for three days. On the third day, she suffered a severe abdominal pain and fell in the bathroom. Her husband came from KL that same day to take her back to the mainland for further treatment. Doctors diagnosed her with a magical separation spell, cast by someone close to her workplace, who had a crush on her. The person wanted to separate her from her husband. The speaker is still undergoing treatment as the perpetrator still bothers her at work. She hopes for guidance and prayers from those who are more experienced and knowledgeable.',\n",

Critics argue that these actions show a lack of understanding of democratic policing and a continuation of the police's role as protectors of those in power rather than the rights of citizens. The Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative has emphasized the importance of democratic policing, which rejects colonial-style policing and focuses on protecting the human rights of all. The Malaysian police have been criticized for a lack of institutional independence, efficiency, professionalism, and integrity, with a collapse of public confidence in recent years. It is recommended that the police adopt a new police ethos and mission that embraces democratic policing and restores the fundamental human rights of Malaysians to be free from crime and the fear of crime.\",\n",
       " \"You mentioned experiencing symptoms that led to a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) without a blood test. If you haven't changed sexual partners, you might wonder if the infection could have another cause. Herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2, which enter the body through skin lesions. After the initial infection, the virus remains dormant in the body, and can be transmitted to sexual partners when active. HSV-1 typically affects the mouth and lips, while HSV-2 affects the genital area. Herpes can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy. Taking antiviral medication can reduce the risk of transmission to sexual partners. However, to determine the exact cause of your symptoms, you are strongly encouraged to consult a doctor for more information. Please click here to speak with us confidentially.\",\n",
