Pan-Asian CSD Alliance on improvement to post trade processing infrastructure
Release Date:   04 Jun 2010





To facilitate the Asian bond market development and enhance the attractiveness of Asian debt securities to foreign investors, Bank Negara Malaysia and a group of central banks and central securities depositories (CSDs) in the region together with Euroclear, formed a Task Force with a vision to improve the cross-border post-trade infrastructure in Asia.
The Task Force issued a White Paper [PDF, 170KB] on 4 June 2010, which sets out the development blueprint of a Common Platform Model in Asia. In essence, the Common Platform Model allows Asian CSDs to adopt a set of harmonised procedures and shared technology for debt securities processing in a pragmatic and gradual approach, which would ultimately foster the development of the Asian bond market.
The Task Force would like to invite central banks and CSDs in Asia and other interested stakeholders to study the recommendations in the White Paper, including the longer term development and implications of the Common Platform Model.

Call for Public Feedback: Proposed Basic Motor Cover Framework (Update: Outcome of Public Consultation)
Release Date:   23 Apr 2010





Note: Outcome of Public Consultation on Proposed Third Party Motor Cover Framework 
 
Following the Government's announcement in Budget 2010 on the need to provide adequate access to reasonably priced basic motor insurance coverage, Bank Negara Malaysia is currently working with the relevant authorities in formulating a scheme to provide basic third party bodily injury and death cover at an appropriate level of protection to the public.
Bank Negara Malaysia has undertaken consultations with consumer and transport associations, the Malaysian Bar Council as well as the insurance industry to obtain the first round of feedback on the guiding principles, objectives and proposed features under consideration.
We would also like to seek similar feedback from members of the public. Attached are the presentation slides and FAQs with notes for your reference and information. We would greatly appreciate if you could submit your views and feedback on the ""Proposed Basic Motor Cover Framework"" to our contact points by 14 May 2010, Friday.
Feedback received from all stakeholders will be taken into consideration towards further refining the proposals under consideration.

Bank Negara Malaysia
23 April 2010

Outcome of Public Consultation on Proposed Third Party Motor Cover Framework 
Bank Negara Malaysia, together with the Ministry of Finance, completed initial consultation sessions on the proposed third party motor cover framework with key stakeholders in April 2010 and a consultation paper - explaining the rationale for proposing a basic scheme, guiding principles, objectives and broad features under consideration - was posted on BNM's website for members of the public to provide their feedback on the scheme.
As at end-May 2010, a total of 125 respondents had submitted their feedback via email, memoranda or letters to editors of national newspapers. Feedback was received from members of the public, consumer, transport, and business associations, political parties, Members of Parliament, the Bar Council and lawyers, insurers and insurance agents.
Several issues were highlighted in the feedback received. The majority of respondents concurred that the priority of the reforms to the insurance system in relation to the third party motor cover framework should be on addressing issues of the delays in the motor insurance claims settlement process. The majority were also open to the need for gradual adjustments to the motor insurance premiums to address price misalignments and to the possibility of moving to a risk-based pricing system. There was agreement that this move would encourage safe and responsible driving, as well as ensure the availability of motor insurance coverage in the long term, while spurring competitiveness and increased efficiency among general insurers and takaful operators.
Most respondents also raised concerns on the expected cost to the Government in setting-up a new entity to oversee and manage the new scheme. On the proposal to cap third party bodily injury and death claims, some respondents were in favour of the imposition of reasonable caps on overall claims, while certain segments felt that restricting the rights to, as well as having limits on the amount of compensation, could result in accident victims being insufficiently compensated.
The possibility of adopting a No-Fault-Liability system to replace the existing system as a more equitable approach in ensuring accident victims are promptly compensated has also been raised by some respondents. While those in favour of such a scheme consider it as a solution to the current inefficiencies, others have voiced objections that this may not be a practical system for Malaysia and may not provide sufficient compensation.
Bank Negara Malaysia would like to thank all parties who have contributed their views and opinions. All the feedback are being taken into consideration and further engagement with stakeholders will be undertaken to provide a holistic solution that ensures adequate protection to motorists and road users at reasonable premiums.
The review will therefore involve: resolving the issues on the appropriate overall limit of compensation; enhancing the existing court system to resolve disputes; phasing-in of additional measures to enhance the efficiency in the overall claims settlement process; and instituting gradual premium adjustments over time to reflect the cost of insurance. The infrastructure to support the framework will also be further reviewed to minimise the costs to the Government. This review will take into consideration the constructive feedback that has been received.
In addition, extensive efforts will be undertaken towards significantly improving the overall claims settlement process. This would require the full support of all relevant stakeholders. The final proposal on a new framework for Third Party motor insurance coverage is expected to be submitted to the Government for consideration in December 2010.

Beware of Scams Requesting for Banking Information
Release Date:   28 Jun 2011





Bank Negara Malaysia would like to caution members of the public of the phishing attempts by fraudsters using Bank Negara Malaysia’s name to deceive members of the public in disclosing their personal banking details.

Intended victims receive emails, sms or calls purportedly from Bank Negara Malaysia informing them that Bank Negara Malaysia is now collecting personal banking information to update its database or as a ""fraud department"" alert. 
Once a victim is contacted they would request for the disclosure of personal financial details such as credit or debit cards details including card code verification (CCV) or other personal identification numbers (PIN).

Members of the public are reminded to ignore such request and to refrain from giving personal banking information to anyone under any circumstances. Financial institutions, including credit card issuers and Bank Negara Malaysia and all banking institutions will never request for personal banking information when contacting customers, be it via telephone calls, SMS or emails.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on Payment for Trade in Renminbi
Release Date:   09 Jun 2011





Malaysian companies can now have the option to settle their trade transactions with their counterparts in China in Renminbi (RMB) in addition to other currencies such as the US dollar. All current account (goods and services) transactions are eligible for trade settlement in RMB. Since July 2009, China's government has started the use of RMB for settlement of cross-border trade.
Settlement in RMB may reduce the foreign exchange risk for exporter and importers from China and this can result in better pricing of goods and services transactions for Malaysian companies.
Malaysian companies will also benefit from savings from the currency conversion spreads as it is now a direct quote from RMB to Ringgit.

Implementation of the new PIDM Bill 2010
Release Date:   07 Jan 2011





The new Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM) Bill 2010 was passed by the Parliament and came into operation on 31 December 2010. The new bill provides for enhanced deposit insurance coverage for the protection of financial consumers, with an increased deposit insurance limit of RM250,000 per depositor per member bank. This will protect 99% of retail depositors in full. In addition, foreign currency deposits will now also be covered under the deposit insurance system.
The enhanced deposit insurance coverage takes immediate effect on the expiry of the interim full deposit guarantee that was announced by the Malaysian government as a pre-emptive measure during the period of global financial turbulence in 2009. The Malaysian financial system has remained resilient throughout this period and the full deposit guarantee which has expired on 31 December 2010 was never called upon.
The new bill also provides for the administration of the Takaful and Insurance Benefits Protection System (TIPS) by PIDM. TIPS is an explicit, limited Government protection system which covers takaful and insurance benefits under a framework that is broadly consistent with the deposit insurance system.
For further information, please visit PIDM's website at the following link:

Working Paper : External Risks and Macro-Financial Linkages in the ASEAN-5 Economies
Release Date:   26 Dec 2013





Abstract
Using an SVAR approach, I examine spillovers of 3 external shocks in the ASEAN-5 economies - global demand, commodity price and global financial stress - and the role of domestic bank credit in the transmission of global financial stress to the real economy. I find that external influences drive a majority of the variation in both output and prices in all the economies, although their relative importance varies across countries. An adverse external demand shock leads to lower output and prices, with the output effects proportionate to the countries’ degree of trade openness. Higher commodity prices are inflationary and lead to lower output, except in Malaysia and Indonesia where output initially benefits from exports of primary food and fuel commodities. An adverse external financial shock spills over to domestic financial markets, leads to lower credit and, consequently, to lower output. In countries with large and open financial sectors, such as Singapore, an adverse external financial shock also affects output through lower profits in the financial sector from reduced intermediation activities.

Working Paper : Global Monetary Easing - Spillovers and Lines of Defence
Release Date:   26 Dec 2013





Abstract
The primary aim of the quantitative easing (QE) measures by the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) is to stabilise the financial markets and economic activity in the United States, but it has also generated intense debates over its spillover effects on capital flows towards emerging market economies (EMEs). This paper finds evidence to corroborate the proposition that QE generates non-trivial spillover effects on asset prices, exchange rates and monetary conditions in EMEs. The paper also extended further the analysis by examining policy responses by EMEs in dealing with capital flow surges and and finds that in the case of Brazil and Korea, the implementation of capital flow management measures had helped to lessen the pace of inflows but at the cost of higher volatility in the respective financial markets.

Working Paper : The Marginal Propensity to Consume across Household Income Groups
Release Date:   26 Dec 2013





Abstract
Understanding heterogeneity in the way households respond to income changes is crucial for policymaking, as shocks in the economy often affect specific groups of households differently. Using data from the Household Expenditure Survey (HES), this paper estimates the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of disposable income for Malaysian households and examines how the propensities differ across income brackets. We find evidence that the MPC out of disposable income for lower income households is higher than that for higher income households. The MPCs vary from 0.81 for those earning below RM1,000 to 0.25 for those earning above RM10,000. These MPCs allow policymakers in Malaysia to estimate more precisely the aggregate consumption effects of income shocks that affect households of specific income groups.

Release Date:   07 Nov 2013





Effective date

The consultation period for this concept paper ends on 9 January 2014.
Applicability

Life insurers licensed under the FSA; 
Family takaful operators licensed under the IFSA; and
Financial advisers and Islamic financial advisers approved under the FSA and IFSA.

Summary
Bank Negara Malaysia is issuing a concept paper on the Life Insurance and Family Takaful Framework (the Framework) for public consultation. The concept paper aims to seek feedback from members of the public, industry players, intermediaries and related stakeholders on the proposed enhancements to the life insurance and family takaful industry. The Framework encapsulates initiatives aimed to support a higher level of insurance and takaful penetration in line with Malaysia’s transition to become a high-income economy.
Highlights
The concept paper highlights several key initiatives that would transition the life insurance and takaful industry towards achieving a penetration rate of 75% while at the same time ensuring consumers continue to receive proper advice. These initiatives are broadly categorised as follows: 

Allow greater operational flexibility to promote product innovation while preserving policy/certificate value;
Diversified distribution channels to widen in the delivery of insurance and takaful products; and
Strengthening market conduct to enhance consumers’ protection through instilling greater professionalism in the industry and enhancing product disclosure standards with greater transparency.

The feedback should be addressed to communication@bnm.gov.my

BNM to host the BNM Economics Research Workshop 2014 on ""The Structural Challenges of Achieving Sustained and Inclusive Growth""
Release Date:   21 Nov 2014





Bank Negara Malaysia is organising a research workshop on ""The Structural Challenges of Achieving Sustained and Inclusive Growth"", to be held at the Conference Hall 1, Sasana Kijang, on 1 December 2014.
This event aims to provide a platform for policy-oriented researchers and market participants to examine and debate on the current economic and financial market issues faced by the regional economies. The theme focuses on the key issue of achieving sustained and inclusive growth. Country experiences reveal that social or political resistance to growth models tend to develop when the growth benefits are reaped inequitably. Yet, in an increasingly integrated world with rapid technological changes and shifting competitive advantages, achieving sustained fast-paced economic growth that is also inclusive represents a policy challenge.
The workshop will observe a mixed group of speakers and participants from the regional central banks, think tanks, academicians and the private sector. For more information on the workshop agenda, please click here.

Capital Adequacy Framework for Financial Holding Companies – Discussion paper
Release Date:   23 Oct 2014





Effective Date
The consultation period for this discussion paper ends on 23 December 2014
Applicability
All financial holding companies approved under section 112 of the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) or section 124 of the Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (IFSA)
Summary
This discussion paper sets out the proposals to extend the Capital Adequacy Framework and Capital Adequacy Framework for Islamic Banks to financial holding companies approved under the FSA and IFSA respectively.
The objectives of applying the capital requirements to the financial holding companies at consolidated level are:

to ensure that the group as a whole is adequately capitalised to support its group-wide risks;
to address the multiple gearing of capital and excessive leverage within the financial group which may undermine the financial strength of licensed institutions within the group; and
to achieve greater consistency in disclosed capital ratios between financial groups headed by a bank and by a financial holding company.

This discussion paper shall be read together with the Capital Adequacy Framework and Capital Adequacy Framework for Islamic Banks, which are the base of the proposal.
The Bank invites written feedback on this discussion paper, including suggestions for particular issues or areas to be clarified and any alternative proposals that the Bank should consider. To facilitate the Bank's assessment, please support each comment with a clear rationale, accompanying evidence or illustration, as appropriate.
Additional instructions

In addition to providing general feedback, financial holding companies are required to respond to the specific questions set out throughout this discussion paper.
Financial holding companies are required to compute their capital ratios for their 30 June 2014 financial position using the reporting template provided (Attachment 1)

Feedback must be submitted by 23 December 2014 to:

Concept Papers: Ijarah and Istisna'
Release Date:   24 Jun 2014





As part of the initiatives to strengthen the Shariah-compliance practices among Islamic financial institutions (IFIs), Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) is developing a Shariah-based regulatory policy with the objective to provide a comprehensive guidance to the lslamic financial industry to enhance end-to-end compliance with Shariah and therefore, ensure the integrity and sustainability of the IFI. This Shariah-based regulatory policy consists of two components, namely the Shariah requirements and operational requirements. The Shariah requirements highlight the salient features and essential conditions of specific Shariah contract to facilitate sound understanding of a particular contract by the lFI. The operational requirements set out the expectations with respect to governance and oversight, structuring, risk management, business and market conduct, and financial disclosures.

These Concept Papers (CP) provide both the Shariah and operational requirements for the application of ijarahand istisna' contracts. Whilst the Shariah requirements serve as reference to facilitate in providing feedback and comments, the Bank invites written feedback and comments from the public only on the operational requirements for the application of ijarah and istisna' contracts, including suggestions for particular issues/areas to be clarified/elaborated further and any alternative proposals that the Bank should consider.The feedback must be supported with clear rationale, accompanying evidence or illustration, as appropriate to facilitate effective review of these CP.
Responses shall be submitted by 25 July 2014 and addressed to:

Research Papers : Determinants of Financial Performance: The Case of General Takaful and Insurance Companies in Malaysia
Release Date:   23 Jan 2014





Preserving financial stability is integral in developing financial institutions that are robust, resilient and competitive. This paper investigates the determinants of financial performance of general Islamic and conventional insurance companies in Malaysia using panel data over the period of 2004 to 2007, using investment yield as the performance measure. This measure is related to a number of economic and firm specific variables, which are the profit/interest rate levels, equity returns, size of company, retakaful/reinsurance dependence, solvency margin, liquidity, and contribution/premium growth, chosen based on relevant theory and literature. Three models of panel data estimation are employed for this study. Based on the empirical results, this study finds that size of company, retakaful dependence and solvency margin are statistically significant determinants of the investment performance of the general Islamic insurance companies in Malaysia. For conventional insurance, all factors are statistically significant determinants of investment performance, except for equity returns.

A 2-month celebration of Children's Day at the Bank Negara Malaysia Museum and Art Gallery: 'Children's Day At The Museum'
Release Date:   12 Oct 2015





In conjunction with Malaysia's chairmanship of the ASEAN Summit 2015, Bank Negara Malaysia Museum and Art Gallery is hosting a special two month Children's Day programme titled 'Children's Day At The Museum' (CDATM), themed 'Colours of ASEAN' from October to end November 2015.
A variety of free educational activities with an ASEAN flavour are lined up for children aged 4-17 years from Tuesdays to Saturdays during this two month programme. Workshops and games include the ASEAN Countries Puppet Making Workshop, the ASEAN Commemorative Coin Giant Block Puzzle, Si Kijang Money Box, Si Kijang Puzzle Race, Currency Detective and many more exciting programmes.
In line with the objectives of children's welfare, Bank Negara Malaysia Museum and Art Gallery initiated the 'Stationery Donation Drive' in collaboration with Teach for Malaysia to support their noble cause to provide basic educational materials to underprivileged children. A small crate has been stationed at the Museum Shop (Ground Floor) for members of the public to donate their own gifts of basic educational materials, or alternatively purchase stationery items from the Museum Shop as donations.
The launch of CDATM held on 8 October 2015 was attended by many including Mr Tan Shie Haur (Strategy and Operations Director of Teach for Malaysia) and staff of BNM. The audience was given a sterling choral speaking performance by students of Tunas Kijang along with a delightful costume parade of ASEAN attires by students of the Asia Pacific Smart School.
Children's Day was established by the United Nations General Assembly in 1954 to encourage all countries to institute a day to promote a mutual exchange and understanding among children, and initiate action to benefit and promote the welfare of children.
For more information on the Children's Day programme, please contact the Museum and Art Gallery Reception Counter at extension 2784, or e-mail infomuseum@bnm.gov.my

Enriching Statistics in an Inter-connected and Digital World
Call for Papers
Venue: Sasana Kijang, Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
Date: Tuesday, 17 November 2015
The Third Malaysia Statistics Conference (MyStats2015) is being organised by Department of Statistics, Malaysia in collaboration with Bank Negara Malaysia (Central Bank of Malaysia) and Malaysia Institute of Statistics.
MyStats2015 provides a great opportunity for statisticians, researchers, policymakers and academia actively involved in statistics to discuss the compilation, innovation and usage of statistics to support analysis, surveillance and decision making in a dynamic environment. The conference is structured with one main session, several parallel sessions, and a panel discussion session.
The theme ""Enriching Statistics in an Inter-connected and Digital World"" is very relevant as the world today is highly inter-connected due to greater financial and economic integration as well as the advancement in the information technology, particularly the internet.  The borderless world and the fast transmission of information demand (as well as created) additional or new statistics for analysis, diagnosis and decision making. 
The Programme Committee is now inviting you to contribute papers for the conference.  We encourage statisticians, researchers and practitioners who are actively involved in statistics in academia, industry, national statistical offices, national and international agencies, central banks, and other groups to participate in the conference. Participation in the conference is FREE.
Closing date for submission of abstract: Friday, 10 July 2015
Closing date for submission of final paper: Friday, 18 September 2015
For further information on the submission requirements and procedures for papers, kindly contact the Programme Committee at mystats2015@bnm.gov.my.
We  would  also  appreciate it if  you  could  share this information with your colleagues  and  other  potential  contributors.   We look forward to meeting you in Kuala Lumpur.

Third Annual Bank Negara Malaysia Economics Research Workshop :: Call for Papers
Release Date:   12 May 2015





The ASEAN Economic Community: Vision, Opportunities and Challenges 
9 November 2015, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
CALL FOR PAPERS
INTRODUCTION
Bank Negara Malaysia is pleased to announce the 3rd Annual Bank Negara Malaysia Economics Research Workshop, to be held on 9 November 2015 at Sasana Kijang, Kuala Lumpur. This event will bring together researchers and policymakers to discuss economic and financial market issues faced by the regional economies. The organising committee would like to invite researchers from academia, think-tanks, regional institutions and SEACEN member central banks to participate as paper presenters on theoretical and empirical topics that are of relevance to the workshop's theme.
The objectives of this workshop are to:

Foster greater cooperation among the institutions through an exchange of ideas and sharing of country specific experiences;
Identify policy strategies to address prevailing and emerging challenges, and;
Enhance regional cooperation to address common issues.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP THEME
The theme of this year's workshop is “The ASEAN Economic Community: Vision, Opportunities and Challenges”. The formation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by end-2015 marks a new era of regional cooperation. By removing intra-regional barriers across multiple dimensions (e.g. goods, services and capital), the AEC moves closer to the ideal of having a “single market and production base” defined not by national but regional boundaries. For firms, this elevates market size and efficiency gains as resources flow to where expected returns are highest, in turn leading to improvements in employment and income levels. However, liberalisation also increases competition and induces structural changes that will result in some casualties. What are the opportunities and challenges from the AEC? Some topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Winners and losers from regional integration
Implications for trade and investment
Complementarities of economic and financial market integration
How should regulation, institutions and policy evolve with more regional integration
The role for policy to limit the casualties brought about by this structural change

Migration to PIN-based payment cards for more secure payment transactions
Release Date:   17 Dec 2016





With reference to a recent media report1 and social media postings on claims that cardholders will be charged and will not be able to use their ATM and debit cards if they do not replace their cards with the new PIN-based cards by a specified date, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) would like to clarify that this is not true.
BNM would like to reinforce our earlier message that members of the public will be able to replace their ATM and debit cards at their banks for free. In addition, members of the public who have not replaced their ATM and debit cards by a date specified by their banks, can still continue to use their existing card at the ATMs. With regard to the usage of ATM and debit cards for purchase transactions at point-of-sale (POS) terminals, banks are required to provide cardholders with adequate notice and a reasonable time period for the replacement of cards before disabling the existing cards for such transactions.
Further details on the migration to PIN-based cards can be obtained here . If you have further queries, please contact BNM through the following channels:

Change to PIN-based payment cards for more secure payment transactions
Release Date:   28 Oct 2016





Banking institutions and non-bank payment card issuers are currently replacing the existing signature-based payment cards with the new Personal Identification Number (PIN) based card.  Similar to ATM transactions, cardholders will be required to enter a 6-digit PIN when making payment card transactions at the merchants’ POS terminals.
This is aimed to further enhance the security of the use of payment cards at the merchants’s Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals.
Members of the public are urged to replace their signature based debit, credit, prepaid and charge cards (payment cards) with PIN based payment cards by 1 January 2017.
If you have not obtained your new PIN based payment cards, please contact or visit your bank or non-bank payment card issuer immediately. The new payment cards will be replaced free of charge. 
This will allow you a six month period to adapt to the usage of PIN-based cards at the merchants’ POS terminals.
With effect from 1 July 2017 all payment card transactions conducted using locally issued payment cards at POS terminals in Malaysia can only be completed with a PIN entry. Signature verification will no longer be facilitated.
Using new PIN-based payment cards
Cardholders who have received the new PIN-based payment cards are advised to activate the PIN-based payment cards.
Please select your PIN and start using the PIN-based payment cards at merchants’ POS terminals. Prior to travelling overseas, cardholders are also advised to contact their bank or non-bank payment card issuers for advice on the usage of PIN-based payment cards overseas.
Cardholders should safeguard their PIN and not to disclose the PIN to anyone. In conducting payment transactions, cardholders are also advised to cover the keypad when entering their PIN. The usage of PIN is safer than signature so long as the PIN is kept confidential by cardholders.
In the event a payment card is lost or stolen or there is any compromise to the PIN, cardholders are reminded to immediately report to their banks or non-bank payment card issuers.
For further information, please read the attached Frequently Ask Questions (FAQs) on the migration to PIN-based payment cards and also visit the PIN and Pay website at https://pinandpay.com.my/en/ and the websites of payment card networks as follows:

Summary 
To further encourage innovation and improve the delivery of financial services, the Bank is enhancing its regulatory approach to facilitate the development and adoption of innovative financial technology (fintech) solutions in the financial sector. In this regard, the Bank plans to introduce a regulatory sandbox framework (the Sandbox), under which financial institutions regulated by the Bank and fintech companies looking to carry out businesses regulated by the Bank may be granted certain regulatory flexibilities to experiment with fintech solutions in a production or live environment. These flexibilities will be accompanied by appropriate safeguards to preserve financial stability and promote fair treatment to consumers. This discussion paper sets out the key principles and proposed approach in operationalising the Sandbox.
The Bank invites written comments on the specific questions set out in this discussion paper as well as any general comments on the proposals, including suggestions for particular issues/areas to be clarified or elaborated further and any alternative proposals that the Bank should consider. To facilitate the Bank’s assessment, please support each comment with a clear rationale, accompanying evidence or illustration, as appropriate.

Release Date:   20 Apr 2016





The Housing Market: Issues and Policy Options 
10th October 2016, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
CALL FOR PAPERS
INTRODUCTION
Bank Negara Malaysia is pleased to announce the 4th Annual Bank Negara Malaysia Economics Research Workshop, to be held on 10 October 2016 at Sasana Kijang, Kuala Lumpur. This event aims to bring together researchers and policymakers to discuss economic and financial market issues faced by the regional economies. The organising committee would like to invite researchers from academia, think-tanks, regional institutions and SEACEN member central banks to participate as paper presenters on theoretical and empirical topics that are of relevance to the workshop’s theme.
The objectives of this workshop are to:

Foster greater cooperation among the institutions through an exchange of ideas and sharing of country specific experiences;
Identify policy strategies to address prevailing and emerging challenges, and;
Enhance regional cooperation to address common issues.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP THEME
The theme for this year is “The Housing Market: Issues and Policy Options”. Housing is a unique asset with significant links to the economy. For most households, it is a necessity and constitutes the largest asset and liability on their balance sheets. Mortgage loans also constitute a large portion of the loan portfolio in the banking system. From a macroeconomic point of view, boom/bust cycles in the housing market are associated with post-boom economic downturns that tend to be deeper and with slower recoveries. Critical policy issues thus pertain to the management of property prices at sustainable levels. There are also socio-economic considerations. Because housing is often deemed a necessity, it is commonly accepted that there is a role for policy to ensure that housing remains affordable and inclusive to all household income segments. Developments in the housing market can therefore have far reaching consequences for social, growth and financial stability.
This workshop aims to explore facets of the housing market, such as: structural issues that affect the universal access to housing, regulation of the housing market and the links among the housing market, financial market and the real sector. Some key issues include:

Demand and supply determinants of property prices
The role of credit and housing finance
Financial stability risks from a housing market crash
Affordability assessments across household income groups
The role of monetary, macro-prudential and structural policy

Discussion Paper on Microinsurance and Microtakaful
Release Date:   18 Apr 2016





The Bank is developing a regulatory framework to facilitate the growth of the microinsurance/microtakaful market. This discussion paper provides guidance on the proportionate regulation of microinsurance/microtakaful products and the operating environment that is envisioned for microinsurance/microtakaful in Malaysia.
In the interim, prior to the issuance of the regulatory framework, an interested licensed insurer or licensed takaful operator may apply for proportionate regulatory treatment for a microinsurance or microtakaful product by submitting a product proposal for the Bank's approval. The Bank may collaborate with the licensed insurer or licensed takaful operator to enhance a proposal that has been submitted.
The Bank welcomes industry-led initiatives, either collaboratively or at the individual company level, to develop microinsurance/microtakaful products and business models as well as to promote demand for insurance and takaful protection among low-income households.
The Bank invites comments from all stakeholders and comments may be directed at any time until the finalisation of the framework.

Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process for Takaful Operators
Release Date:   15 Apr 2016





The policy document on Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) for Takaful Operators incorporates the proposals from the Concept Paper on ICAAP for Takaful Operators issued on 28 August 2015, intended to ensure TOs:

maintain adequate capital that take into account all material risks including under stress conditions;
implement sound capital and risk management practices that consider its business strategies and risk appetite; and
sustain adequate Participants’ Risk Funds (PRF) to meet potential claims.

Highlights
The policy document on ICAAP for Takaful Operators outlines three (3) key expectations to address specificities associated with takaful business as follows:

TO to ensure the overall risk assessment process considers the risks associated with Shariah non-compliance arising from the failure to observe Shariah rulings issued by the Shariah Advisory Council and advice by Shariah Committee;
TO to assess the impact of the stress test on financial condition of PRF and consequently the capital adequacy arising from the responsibility to provide Qard to rectify potential deficit in the future; and
TOs to assess the impact of the stress test on financial condition of PRF arising from insufficient allocation of funds from Participants’ Investment Fund (PIF) under the dripping model. The deterioration in PIF may adversely affect the financial condition of PRF to meet the future claims.

Enforcement Action against Company Conducting Illegal Deposit Taking - Koperasi Dinar Dirham Berhad
Release Date:   29 Nov 2017





A joint raiding operation was conducted on Koperasi Dinar Dirham Berhad on 28 November 2017 led by Bank Negara Malaysia together with the National Revenue Recovery Enforcement Team of the Attorney-General’s Chamber (NRRET), Royal Malaysian Police (RMP), Malaysia Co-Operative Societies Commission (SKM) and Cyber Security Malaysia (CSM). Koperasi Dinar Dirham Berhad was suspected to have committed an offence under the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) and the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA). The joint raiding operation is one of the continuous inter-agencies measures to eradicate illegal financial scheme activities.
Nine premises related to Koperasi Dinar Dirham Berhad located in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor and its related affiliates were raided, where relevant documents were seized to assist in investigation. Six company directors suspected to act as mastermind and agents for illegal deposit taking activities were arrested and remanded for two days to assist investigation. The joint raiding operation also resulted in the seizure of 8 vehicles valued more than RM1.5million and freezing of 114 bank accounts in 12 banks amounting to RM15.3 million under the AMLA. A sum of Ringgit and foreign currencies totalling RM1.4 million, as well as 22.5 kg precious metals were seized.

Bank Negara Malaysia & PDRM on Currency Education Initiative
Release Date:   26 Oct 2017






On ground visit to raise awareness on Security Features of Ringgit Banknote
Bank Negara Malaysia officials went on ground to the Taman Connaught Night Market in Kuala Lumpur yesterday with officers from the Commercial Crime Investigation Department of the Royal Malaysian Police. The team engaged with the Committee Leaders of the Taman Connaught Night Market Hawkers’ Association, following news reports of RM100 and RM50 counterfeit notes in the area. The intent of the on the ground visit was to meet the night market hawkers to better understand the situation.
Additionally, the visit was to promote awareness on the security features of the ringgit banknotes, especially higher denomination notes; and to educate on what to do if in possession of a counterfeit banknote. Ten buntings to raise awareness on banknote security features were placed at strategic locations within the night market and hundreds of educational flyers were distributed to vendors and their customers.
Incidents of counterfeit banknotes in Malaysia remain low and are isolated cases. Bank Negara Malaysia monitors these closely and works in partnership with the police to manage them.
Members of the public are advised to be vigilant and check for the security features of banknotes, especially those with higher denomination. Please lodge a police report if you suspect that you are in possession of a counterfeit banknote. It is a criminal offence to print, keep or circulate counterfeit banknotes.
Malaysian banknotes incorporate the latest security features that are difficult to counterfeit. Members of the public, including retailers, are advised to be vigilant when handling banknotes by applying the “Feel, Look, Tilt & Check” guide as follows:

Feel the paper quality and raised print on genuine banknotes

Paper banknotes are textured and polymer banknotes are made of special plastic
Both paper and polymer banknotes have raised print effect on the portrait of the first Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agong and texts  


Look at the banknote under white light background and observe the following features:

3-dimensional portrait watermark, perfect see through register and clear window will be visible
Continuous line of security thread will be visible  


 Tilt the banknotes to inspect the colour change on the hologram stripe and security thread

Security thread that changes colour
Thread with ‘Hibiscus Flower’ icon on RM100 banknote that moves when tilted  


Check the banknotes using simple equipment to inspect the following:

The micro text lettering through magnifying glass; and
The 2-colour fluorescent element, text and logo and security fiber colour (red, yellow and blue) under Ultra Violet (UV) light.



To know more about the features of Malaysian banknotes, the public are encouraged to download the Bank’s My Ringgit Mobile App from the Apple iOS App Store or the Google Play Store. The App provides an interactive guide to the security features of the Malaysian currency.

Ruling of the Shariah Advisory Council
Release Date:   03 Oct 2017





The Shariah Advisory Coucil (SAC) ruled that the contract session for bai` al-sarf refers to the period of time during which the contracting parties enter into a contract, commencing with an offer (ijab), followed by an acceptance (qabul) to exchange monies between each other, and ending by the disengagement of the contracting parties physically or constructively, or through the waiving of rights to revoke the contract (takhayur). The delivery of money in bai` al-sarf shall take place during the contract session.
The practice of the delivery of money in bai` al-sarf, for instance on day two after transaction date (T+2) is construed to have taken place after the contract session. However, this practice may be allowed due to established customary business practice (‘urf tijari) arising from operational constraints. In addition, the delivery of money beyond the contract session may also be allowed in the event of unexpected disruptions.

Exposure Draft on Outsourcing
Release Date:   28 Sep 2017





Bank Negara Malaysia today issued a revised prudential framework on outsourcing arrangements for financial institutions. The framework aims to ensure that risk management practices for outsourcing arrangements remain effective moving forward amid intensification of technological advances in a more globalised and digitised environment.
Concerns over risk associated with outsourcing arrangements have increased in recent years, particularly on cyber-attacks and data security breaches. This has arisen from financial institutions becoming more dependent on technology and more interconnected with the broader and global financial system through shared services and market infrastructure. Robust risk management of outsourcing arrangements is therefore important to protect the critical role of financial institutions in supporting financial intermediation and real economic activities. Further, as the Bank moves towards implementing recovery and resolution planning for the Malaysian financial institutions, over-reliance on service providers may pose significant challenge to the ability of financial institutions to maintain operational continuity of critical functions under conditions of stress.
The proposals in the exposure draft reinforce the Bank’s expectations on broader governance and set out improved processes that must be in place to manage outsourcing arrangements. These include enhanced due diligence on service providers and stronger protection of data confidentiality. The Bank also expects financial institutions to demonstrate that controls over outsourcing risk management arrangements are operating effectively and remain commensurate with risk profiles of financial institution. The revised requirements also ensure the Bank’s continued ability to carry out effective supervisory oversight on financial institutions, including the increasingly complex outsourcing arrangements and concentration to a particular service provider.
The Bank invites written feedback on the proposed regulatory requirements. Responses must be submitted to the Bank by 27 October 2017 to pfpconsult@bnm.gov.my.

Exposure Draft on Net Stable Funding Ratio
Release Date:   28 Sep 2017





Bank Negara Malaysia issued today the exposure draft on Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) for banking institutions. The NSFR is a liquidity standard published by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision which forms part of the Basel III regulatory reforms. The NSFR requires banking institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities. This standard complements the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) which has been phased in since 2015.
The Bank intends to implement the NSFR at no earlier than 1 January 2019. The Bank is cognisant that, at the global level, there is considerable uncertainty in the implementation schedule and divergence from the internationally agreed timeline of 1 January 2018. In deciding the implementation schedule of NSFR, the Bank takes into account the international nature of Malaysian banking institutions and the operational requirements of banking institutions in meeting the NSFR standard, as well as the need to ensure the smooth functioning of intermediation process.
The Malaysian banking system remains resilient. Supported by strong liquid asset buffers, more diversified funding profiles and robust liquidity risk management practices, banking institutions have sufficient safeguards in managing liquidity risk. As at 30 June 2017, the banking system LCR stood at 141% whilst the system NSFR is estimated at above 100%.
The Bank invites public feedback on the proposed regulatory requirements for NSFR. Banking institutions have two months to submit feedback to the exposure draft. Responses must be submitted to the Bank by 27 November 2017 to pfpconsult@bnm.gov.my. Further details can be found in the following documents:

Enforcement Action against Company Conducting Illegal Deposit Taking
Release Date:   20 Sep 2017





A joint raid was conducted on MGSB Berhad led by Bank Negara Malaysia together with the National Revenue Recovery Enforcement Team of the Attorney-General’s Chamber (NRRET), Royal Malaysian Police (RMP) and Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) on 15 September 2017. MGSB Berhad was raided for suspected offence under the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) and the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA). The joint raid was one of the continuous inter-agencies measures to eradicate illegal financial scheme activities.
Raids were also conducted on seven premises related to MGSB Berhad located in Kajang, Bangi, Shah Alam and Kuala Lumpur (Jalan Tun Razak) and its affiliates (company secretary and legal firm). Relevant documents were seized to assist the investigation. Three company directors suspected to be the mastermind and agents for illegal deposit taking activities were arrested and remanded. The joint raiding operation also resulted in the freezing of 54 bank accounts in 11 banks and seizure of cash comprising ringgit and foreign currencies amounting to more than RM700,000 under the AMLA.
Under Section 137(1) of the FSA, it is an offence for any person to accept deposits without a licence. Investigations for money laundering will also be undertaken under the AMLA. Upon conviction, a person is liable to a fine of not less than five times the sum or value of the proceeds of an unlawful activities or instrumentalities or RM5 million, whichever is higher, and imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.

Exposure Draft on Leverage Ratio
Release Date:   16 Aug 2017





This Exposure Draft sets out the Bank’s proposals for the Leverage Ratio (LR) framework for banking institutions, which is part of the Basel III regulatory reforms.
The LR is a non-risk based capital measure intended to serve as a backstop to the risk-based Capital Adequacy Framework, as well as to restrict the build-up of excessive leverage by banking institutions.
Under the proposals, banking institutions will be required to comply with a minimum LR of 3% effective 1 January 2018.
Submission of feedback:

The Bank invites written feedback on the proposed regulatory requirements, including suggestions on areas to be clarified and alternative proposals that the Bank should consider. The written feedback should be constructive and supported with clear rationale, including accompanying evidence, empirical analysis or illustrations where appropriate;
In addition to providing general feedback, banking institutions are requested to respond to specific questions set out throughout this Exposure Draft; and
In addition to existing obligations under Basel III Observation Period Reporting (Net Stable Funding Ratio and Leverage Ratio), banking institutions are required to report LR positions (at the entity, consolidated and Skim Perbankan Islam levels) as at 30 June 2017, based on the parameters in this Exposure Draft and using the reporting template provided. Please attach this to your written feedback under paragraph (a) and (b).

Responses must be submitted to the Bank by 16 September 2017.

Strategy Paper on Value-based Intermediation: Strengthening the Roles and Impact of Islamic Finance
Release Date:   20 Jul 2017





Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) in collaboration with the Islamic finance industry today released a Strategy Paper on Value-based Intermediation (VBI). This paper articulates strategies to strengthen the roles and impact of Islamic banking institutions (IBIs) towards a sustainable financial ecosystem.
The strategies promote the application of VBI practices which will lead to an improved suite of products and services offered by IBIs - for better facilitation of entrepreneurship, community well-being, sustainable environment and economic growth, without compromising on shareholders’ returns.   
The intended outcomes of VBI are broadly similar to the objectives set by frameworks such as the Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG), Sustainable, Responsible, Impact Investing (SRI) and ethical finance. However, VBI is rooted in Shariah, which determines its underlying values, moral compass and priorities. With the adoption of VBI, practitioners will need to consider the impact of their activities and actions not only to financial consumers, but a wider range of stakeholders.
These strategies are expected to be adopted and implemented based on each IBI’s readiness.
The Bank invites constructive feedback from interested parties to further enrich the content of the Strategy Paper. Please submit written feedback by 31 August 2017 to the following email: vbi@bnm.gov.my.
The full strategy paper can be found on the following link:

Call for Papers: Fifth Annual Bank Negara Malaysia Economics Research Workshop ""Macroeconomic Prospects in the Digital Economy"" - 20th November 2017, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia
Release Date:   14 Jul 2017





INTRODUCTION

Bank Negara Malaysia is pleased to announce the 5th Annual Bank Negara Malaysia Economics Research Workshop, to be held on 20 November 2017 at Sasana Kijang, Kuala Lumpur. This event aims to bring together researchers and policymakers to discuss economic and financial market issues faced by the regional economies. The organising committee would like to invite researchers from academia, think-tanks, regional institutions and SEACEN member central banks to participate as paper presenters on theoretical and empirical topics that are of relevance to the workshop's theme.
The objectives of this workshop are to:

Foster greater cooperation among the institutions through an exchange of ideas and sharing of country specific experiences;
Identify policy strategies to address prevailing and emerging challenges, and;
Enhance regional cooperation to address common issues.

DESCRIPTION OF THE WORKSHOP THEME

The theme for this year's Workshop is ""Macroeconomic Prospects in the Digital Economy"". The current phase of industrialisation is seeing the adoption of digital technologies by firms and consumers alike. For companies, 3D printing and robotics are improving productivity in manufacturing, while data analytics made possible by access to large data volumes and computational power facilitate identification of market preferences to fine-tune product offerings. Meanwhile, improved connectivity is allowing consumers to benefit from better price transparency and convenience in purchasing goods and services. This trend will have profound effects on macroeconomic prospects and the labour market. Digitisation and automation increases productivity and wages of skilled workers, but also displace labour in tasks made redundant by these changes. Meanwhile, traditional brick and mortar models of retail are being challenged by lower cost and more efficient online platforms. This creative destruction effect of digitisation bodes well for longer-run growth prospects at the cost of a potentially disruptive short-run adjustment.
This workshop aims to explore issues and the role of government pertaining to growth prospects, labour market dynamics and broader social welfare implications in the context of this modernizing economic landscape. Some possible topics include:

The impact of digitisation on productivity and potential output
Factors affecting the pace and extent of adoption of digital technologies
Direct and indirect effects of the sharing economy
Distributional and welfare implications of the digital economy
The impact of digitisation on manufacturing
The effects of digitisation on inflation dynamics and implications for monetary policy

Beware of financial scams promising unrealistic high returns
Release Date:   29 Apr 2017





Members of the public are advised to be careful before participating in get rich quick schemes. Be alert and look out for the following common features:

The approach by the operators may have been made by mail, telephone, Internet or in person, but the intention is always the same, that is, to take money from unsuspecting victim for goods or services that they have no intention to provide.
Schemes which promise interest rates, returns or profits, which are much higher than the returns offered by licensed financial institutions for their deposits.
The promises of high returns are aimed at attracting the members of the public to participate in the schemes and the investors may not be given copies of any documentation including agreements by the operators.
There is also no assurance that the operators of such schemes can continue to pay the high returns.
At the beginning of such schemes, the operators are able to use money received from subsequent depositors to pay high returns or to repay the principal amount to the earlier depositors.
However, the operators could not invest the deposits in equally or more lucrative ventures or investments and therefore unable to sustain the high returns or repayment promised to their depositors.
Please note that these schemes will fail eventually when there are no new deposits being continually received by the operators. At such time, the ""get-rich-quick"" schemes will collapse and the depositors or investors will lose their investments.

Liberalisation of Motor Insurance
Release Date:   21 Apr 2017





The first phase of the Liberalisation of the Motor and Fire Tariff was introduced on 1 July 2016. During this phase, insurers and takaful operators were given the flexibility to offer new motor products and add-on covers at market-based pricing.
Effective 1 July 2017, premium pricing for Motor Comprehensive; and Motor Third Party Fire and Theft products will be liberalised where premium pricing will be determined by individual insurers and takaful operators.
Premium will take into account broader risk factors that will drive fairer pricing; greater innovation on new products tailored to consumer needs with improved services; and sustainable motor insurance protection for consumers over the long-term at competitive prices.

Bank Negara Malaysia would like to advise the public that only licensed entities may carry on insurance business or takaful business in Malaysia.

Exposure draft on Credit Risk
Release Date:   20 Jan 2017





This Exposure Draft sets out the Bank’s proposed regulatory requirements on credit risk management for licensed persons, prescribed development financial institutions and financial holding companies.

In particular, the proposals–

clarify and reinforce expectations and requirements on board-level governance arrangements and the risk management function, particularly within the context of credit decision-making;
introduce requirements to strengthen the management of exceptional credits;
prescribe minimum standard for credit loss estimation; and
enhance expectations on the management of concentration risk, country and transfer risk, as well as group-wide credit risk oversight.

The Bank invites written feedback on the proposed regulatory requirements, including suggestions on areas to be clarified and alternative proposals. The written feedback should be supported with clear rationale, accompanying evidence or illustrations, as appropriate to facilitate an effective review of this Exposure Draft.
In addition to providing general feedback, financial institutions are requested to respond to the specific questions set out throughout this Exposure Draft.

Call for Papers: 2017 Summer Conference on “Threats to Globalisation in the Aftermath of the Crisis”
Release Date:   04 Jan 2017





Conference Call for Papers : Bank Negara Malaysia, International Monetary Fund and the IMF Economic Review
Submission Deadline: 15 March 2017
Theme: Threats to Globalisation in the Aftermath of the Crisis
Venue and Date : Kuala Lumpur, 25-26 July 2017
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the IMF Economic Review are jointly organising the 2017 IMF Summer Conference on “Threats to Globalisation in the Aftermath of the Crisis”, to be held on 25-26 July 2017 at Sasana Kijang, Bank Negara Malaysia.
The Great Recession delivered the first large setback to globalisation in decades.  After the Great Trade Collapse, international trade flows did not return to trend, and global trade is undergoing a slowdown.  Globalisation appears under threat from both economic and political forces.  On the market side, the persistently weak global demand may have had a role in the current slowdown in global trade.  Financial market volatility may also have had an impact on international goods trade by affecting export entry decisions.  On the policy side, resistance to globalisation is increasing: the use of antidumping duties and other ad hoc forms of protectionism, opposition to trade agreements across the political spectrum, and anti-immigration sentiment are on the rise.
The organising committee is now inviting paper submissions for the conference.  The conference will seek research on: (i) the recent past and medium-term future of international trade; (ii) the impact of protectionism and financial market turbulence on trade; and (iii) the labour market impact of both international trade and migration. We are particularly interested in papers that address the following topics and questions:

The global slowdown in trade and finance. What are the causes of the current trade slowdown?  Is there a capital flow slowdown?  Are there large secular changes in the composition of capital flows?  Has the relationship between real synchronisation and financial integration changed?
Trade consequences of “Secular Stagnation” and protractedly low external demand.  Is there a missing generation of exporters?  What are the implications for selection into exporting and medium-run trade dynamics?
Protectionism, income inequality, and globalisation.  Does higher inequality lead to more demand for protectionism?  How does higher inequality affect international asset markets?   What is the effect of protectionism on global supply chains?  What policies can ensure that the gains from globalisation are spread more evenly?
Trade implications of asset market dynamics.  What are the implications for domestic and export market entry of financial frictions and shocks?  How does international market liquidity affect goods trade?  How do multinational and trade links affect stock market co-movements across countries?
Migration, remittances and welfare.  What is the impact of immigration on labour markets in recipient countries?  How does emigration affect remittances and inequality in origin countries?

Submissions that focus on advanced economies, emerging economies, and Asia-Pacific economies are welcome.
The organising committee comprising Fabio Ghironi (University of Washington and guest editor, IMF Economic Review), Andrei Levchenko (University of Michigan and guest editor, IMF Economic Review), Cheng Hoon Lim (IMF), Hasni Mohamad Sha'ari (BNM), Emine Boz (IMF and IMF Economic Review), Linda Tesar (University of Michigan and IMF Economic Review) and Boon Hwa Tng (BNM), invite submissions in these and related areas.
Please send submissions in Adobe PDF format to: BNMIMF2017@IMF.ORG. Please also contact this email address if you are willing to participate as a discussant.  Selected papers will be considered for publication in a special issue of the IMF Economic Review.  Along with your submission, please indicate whether you also want to contribute to this issue (also submissions that are not being submitted to the IMF Economic Review are welcome).
Deadline for paper submissions is 15 March 2017 (authors of accepted papers will be informed by 15 April 2017).  Preference will be given to submissions of finished papers.  The conference will fund travel and local accommodation for speakers and discussants.

Ruling of the Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 188th Meeting
Release Date:   22 Nov 2018





The Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 188th meeting on 30th October 2018 ruled that the Financial Retakaful (FinRe) proposal based on the concept ofhibah bithawab (gift with reward in return) between a retakaful operator (RTO) and a takaful operator (TO) is not permissible due to the following reasons:

In principle, the application ofhibah bithawab is a form oftabarru` and is an act of appreciation(mukaramah) and affection(widad). Therefore, it is unsuitable to be applied in the business context which is motivated by profit as it alters the concept ofhibah bithawab fromtabarru` to an exchange contract.
In this regard,hibah bithawab with a business motive is not allowed. Nevertheless, the application of tabarru` contract intakaful (Participant Risk Fund)for the purpose of mutual indemnity and not for business or substantial profit generation is allowed.
In addition, both the components of gift(hibah) and reward(thawab) which take the form of cash/monetary, may lead to a transaction with the element of riba.
The concept ofhibah bithawab shall not be applied on the basis of necessity(darurah) or need (hajah) as there are other alternative Shariah concepts which are more suitable to be applied in the proposed FinRe model.

Guidance Documents on Value-based Intermediation: Strengthening the Roles and Impact of Islamic Finance
Release Date:   03 Oct 2018





The Bank today issued 3 guidance documents to facilitate the practical adoption of Value-based Intermediation (VBI). The VBI aims to re-orient Islamic finance business models towards realising the objectives of Shariah that generate positive and sustainable impact to the economy, community and environment through practices, processes, offerings and conduct.

The Implementation Guide for VBI provides guidance on practical value-based banking practices, as reference to Islamic financial institutions that intend to embark on the Value-based Intermediation initiative. It also outlines the phases of implementation and deliberates on key implementation challenges alongside some pragmatic solutions;

The VBI Financing and Investment Impact Assessment Framework (VBIAF) facilitates the implementation of an impact-based risk management system for assessing the financing and investment activities of Islamic banking institutions in line with their respective VBI commitment. (This paper is jointly developed with The World Bank and INCEIF); and

The VBI Scorecard provides an overview that covers purposes, key components of assessment and proposed measurement methodology. (This paper is jointly developed with the Global Alliance for Banking on Values)

The Bank welcomes constructive feedback on the VBIAF and VBI Scorecard documents.
Responses in the form of written feedback are to be submitted to vbi@bnm.gov.my by 30 November 2018.

Enforcement Action Against Illegal Money Services Business Operators in Johor Bahru
Release Date:   25 Apr 2018





On 24 April 2018, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) raided four premises owned by Famirah Sukses Wisata (JM06933714-V), suspected for carrying out illegal retail remittance business activities without license granted under section 7(1) of Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA), which is an offence under section 4(1) of MSBA. Relevant documents and cash amounting to RM139,922.89 were seized for the purpose of the investigation. The raids were conducted in various places in Johor, including:

Kota Tinggi Pandan, Johor Bahru
Bestari Bestmart, Skudai
TJ Mart, Senai
Taman Air Biru, Pasir Gudang

In the same raiding operations, eleven illegal immigrants who were involved in manning the premises were detained in collaboration with the Immigration Department of Malaysia for breaching the Immigration Act 1959/63 (Act 155).
This is part of the continuous enforcement actions undertaken by BNM to protect members of the public against any financial loss when dealing with informal channels. Members of the public are advised not to conduct any money changing or remittance transactions with illegal money services business operators and their agents. Any person who conducts transactions with an illegal money services business operator does so at his own risk, and appropriate legal action can be taken against him by the relevant authorities. Members of the public should conduct their transactions only with licensed money services business operators which are listed on BNM's website (www.bnm.gov.my).
Any person or company who commits an offence under section 4(1) of the MSBA shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding RM5 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to both.

Social Media Message on ATM Cash Withdrawal
Release Date:   04 Apr 2018





There is a message circulating in the social media advising the public to perform cash withdrawals using the Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) of their own banks instead of the ATMs of other banks purportedly due to issues with MEPS. Specifically, it alleged that there were ATM withdrawals where the cash amount failed to be dispensed even though the customers' bank accounts had been deducted.

Over the past six months, the MEPS Shared ATM Network has continuously and reliably served its customers by facilitating interbank cash withdrawals and funds transfers at over 11,000 ATMs in Malaysia, with 100 percent system availability recorded.

Members of the public who have any difficulties with their respective ATM transactions are advised to lodge their complaints promptly with their respective issuing banks. The contact details are at the back of every ATM card issued in Malaysia.

If any such complaints are not resolved within a reasonable period, the public can also lodge a complaint with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM). BNM is monitoring this matter closely and will not hesitate to take all necessary actions to uphold the public interest in this matter.

Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework (ICTF)
Release Date:   16 Mar 2018





Bank Negara Malaysia (“the Bank”) has today issued the Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework (ICTF), which has taken into account feedback received during the public consultation period on the Exposure Draft released on 7 December 2017.
The ICTF seeks to foster an efficient, competitive and innovative payment landscape in Malaysia by enabling the interoperability of credit transfer services and promoting collaborative competition (co-opetition) between banks and non-bank electronic money (e-money) issuers through fair and open access to shared payment infrastructure.
Credit transfer services, particularly when offered through the use of mobile devices, have the potential to complement debit cards as a cost-effective and convenient alternative to cash and cheques. In this regard, the growing penetration of smartphones and the availability of various mobile payment solutions offered by banking institutions and non-bank e-money issuers have the potential to accelerate the migration to electronic payments (e-payments) and advance financial inclusion by enabling every adult in Malaysia to make or receive payments electronically.
The ICTF outlines requirements aimed at-

enabling interoperability of credit transfer services leveraging on shared payment infrastructure to expand network reach and avoid market fragmentation;
ensuring fair and open access to shared payment infrastructure to promote a level playing field and foster collaboration at the infrastructure level;
facilitating effective oversight of shared payment infrastructure to maintain the safety and integrity of credit transfer systems and to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system;
encouraging innovation through the establishment of innovation sandbox facilities and publication of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) by an operator of a shared payment infrastructure;
establishing risk management measures proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the activities and risk profile of the respective providers of credit transfer services; and
strengthening customer protection and fostering confidence in the use of credit transfer services.

Discussion Paper on Responsibility Mapping
Release Date:   23 Feb 2018





The Bank today issued a discussion paper on Responsibility Mapping which sets out its thinking for a framework relating to responsibilities of individuals holding senior leadership positions in financial institutions.
Organisational culture flows from the values established by the leaders of financial institutions, through their actions, decisions and attitudes. Given this significant influence, the Corporate Governance standards require the board and senior management to promote a sound corporate culture which reinforces ethical, prudent and professional behaviour. Building on this, the Bank intends to develop a framework to clarify the roles, responsibilities and accountability of individuals in senior roles. The Bank believes that such a framework will incentivise these individuals to take greater ownership in fostering a sound culture and addressing misconduct risk. To this end, this discussion paper sets out broad ideas for:-

identifying the senior roles within each financial institution;
assigning responsibilities of the senior roles to specific individuals; and
holding individuals in senior roles to account.

The Bank invites written feedback on this discussion paper, particularly on the specific questions raised throughout the document. Responses may include suggestions on areas to be clarified or alternatives that the Bank should consider. To facilitate an effective consultation process, the feedback should be supported with clear reasons, including accompanying evidence or illustrations where appropriate.
Responses must be submitted to the Bank by 20 April 2018.

Credit Risk
Release Date:   22 Jan 2018





The Bank has issued the policy document on Credit Risk for banking institutions, insurers and takaful operators, and financial holding companies. The revised standard is a culmination of the Bank’s comprehensive review of the existing regulatory framework, Best Practices for the Management of Credit Risk guidelines. The revised standard aims to further elevate credit risk management practices across the industry, taking into account developments in the size and diversity of product offerings, greater internationalisation of the financial system and the growing role of domestic capital markets as an alternative source of financing.
The standard also addresses requirements that will support the effective implementation of the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards 9: Financial Instruments (MFRS 9) by financial institutions, and promote alignment with prudential objectives.
Key changes to the revised policy document include:-

clarity on governance expectations in respect of the involvement of the board and the risk management function in credit decision-making, management of problem credits and the independent credit review function;
expanded requirements on the management of exceptional credits and concentration risk;
strengthened requirements on credit risk measurement to promote greater sophistication in loss estimation approaches; and
new expectations for the management of country risk, transfer risk and group-wide credit risk oversight.

The policy document will take effect beginning 1 July 2018 for banks on an entity basis and 1 July 2019 on a consolidated basis. Insurers and takaful operators are required to comply with the standard on 1 January 2021 on both entity and consolidated basis.

Ruling of the Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 194th and 195th Meeting
Release Date:   20 Dec 2019





The Shariah Advisory Coucil (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 194th meeting on 25 June 2019 and its 195th meeting on 31 July 2019 resolved that the ar-rahnu product structure offered by Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) through the combination of qard (loan), rahn (pledge), wadi`ah (safekeeping) and ujrah (fee) does not fulfil the Shariah requirements in Rahn Policy Document due to the following:

The interconditionality and interdependency between the loan contract and the elements of pledge, safekeeping and fee in the product structure gives rise to the issues of qard jarra naf`an (loan that benefits the lender) and bai` wa salaf (combination of sales contract with a loan) which are prohibited in Shariah. In the ar-rahnu structure, each contract will not take effect without the other contracts. For instance, the loan will only be provided with the condition that customers safekeep their gold with the Islamic financial institution (IFI) where a safekeeping fee is charged. Such structure where the safekeeping fee charged is connected to the loan provided indirectly raises the issue of qard jarra naf`an; and
The combination between the pledge and the loan contract in the ar-rahnu structure for the purpose of profit generation is not in line with the objective of both contracts (muqtada ‘aqd) in which the former is for pledging while the latter is for charity.

The SAC at its 195th meeting ruled the following:

The SAC ruling decided at the 194th meeting on 25 June 2019 regarding prohibition of ar-rahnu based on the above structure will take effect on 1 February 2020;
IFIs are temporarily allowed to apply the views of their respective Shariah Committee on the ar-rahnu product structure up until the date of the SAC ruling comes into effect; and
Any new and outstanding ar-rahnu financing including the income generated before the above SAC ruling takes effect is allowed to continue until the maturity of the financing, based on the previous decision of the respective Shariah Committee of IFIs.

On 4 December 2019, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) in collaboration with the Royal Malaysia Police raided five premises in Johor for carrying out money services business without a license under section 7(1) of Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA). This is an offence under section 4(1) of MSBA and also constitutes a money laundering offence under section 4(1) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds on Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA).
Relevant documents and cash amounting to RM300,000 were seized to assist the investigation. The raids were conducted at various locations in Johor, including in Kota Tinggi Pandan, Senai and Kempas.
Any person or company who commits an offence under section 4(1) of the MSBA shall on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding RM5 million or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both. Under the AMLA, any person who commits a money laundering offence shall on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 15 years and a fine of not less than five times the sum or value of the proceeds or RM5 million, whichever is the higher. 
Members of the public are advised not to deal with or conduct any money changing or remittance transaction with illegal money services business operators and their agents.
Any person who conducts transactions with an illegal money services business operator does so at their own risk, and appropriate legal actions can be taken against them by the relevant authorities. Members of the public should conduct their transactions only with licensed money services business operators which are listed on BNM's website (www.bnm.gov.my). ­­­­

Information on Local Currency Settlement Framework
Release Date:   30 Aug 2019





As part of the strengthening regional financial integration with countries in the ASEAN region, Bank Negara Malaysia established Ringgit-Baht Local Currency Settlement Framework (LCSF) with Bank of Thailand (BOT) and Ringgit-Rupiah LCSF with Bank Indonesia (BI) in March 2016 and December 2017, respectively.
The frameworks aim to encourage the use of local currencies for settlement of trade and investment among the three countries hence reducing reliance on major currencies. In effect, Malaysian entities can access financial services that offer products denominated in Rupiah and Baht in Malaysia to manage their FX risk better, and vice versa.
Further details of the Ringgit-Baht LCSF and Ringgit-Rupiah LCSF are in the attached info-sheet.

Release Date:   02 Jul 2019





Starting 1 July 2019, Bank Negara Malaysia will introduce mandatory testing and disclosure of sustainability of coverage for investment-linked products (sustainability test) by insurers and takaful operators.

To improve transparency on the active management of the sustainability of cover by insurers/takaful operators.
To ensure that consumers are provided with sufficient and timely information to actively monitor and manage investment-linked policies/certificates.

Bank Negara Malaysia sets out requirement on investment-linked products to ensure insurers and takaful operators accord fair treatment to consumers in preserving the value of the customers’ investment-linked policies/certificates.  
To achieve this, Bank Negara Malaysia requires insurers and takaful operators to:

Maintain strong governance in the management of investment-linked business.
Ensure professional conduct in the sales and marketing of investment-linked policies/takaful certificates.
Enhance product transparency and disclosure to enable policy owners/takaful participants to make informed decisions when purchasing.

What should investment-linked policy owners/takaful participants do?
For existing owners of investment-linked policies/certificates and consumers who have purchased an investment policy/certificate before 1 July 2019, you should:

Understand the term of your contract and how long your coverage is expected to last, based on the current level of premium/contribution.
Contact your insurer/takaful operator or agents (insurance/takaful/bancassurance) for further clarification, if necessary.
Receive a letter from your insurer/takaful operator providing information on sustainability of coverage from 1 July 2019.

Exposure Draft on Domestic Systemically Important Banks Framework
Release Date:   03 Apr 2019





Bank Negara Malaysia today issued an Exposure Draft which sets out the Bank’s proposals on the Domestic Systemically Important Banks policy framework. The policy framework, which forms part of the Basel III regulatory reforms, aims to strengthen existing policy tools to address risks posed by domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs).

The Exposure Draft outlines the following:
i.   the assessment methodology to identify D-SIBs in Malaysia;
ii.  higher loss absorbency requirements applicable to D-SIBs; and
iii. reporting requirements applicable to financial institutions in regard to the framework.
The Bank invites written feedback on the proposed policy framework. In addition, financial institutions which are apex entities (as defined in the Exposure Draft) are required to prepare and submit information based on the reporting template provided for the period ending 31 December 2018.

Enforcement Action Against Illegal Money Services Business Operators in Kuala Lumpur
Release Date:   14 Feb 2019





On 12 February 2019, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) raided eight premises conducting money changing and remittance business activities without a license granted under section 7(1) of Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA), which is an offence under section 4(1) of MSBA.
Any person or company who commits an offence under section 4(1) of the MSBA shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding RM5 million or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or to both. Relevant documents and computer peripherals were seized for the purpose of assisting investigations. The raids were conducted at premises located along Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Jalan Dato’ Keramat, Kuala Lumpur.
The entities are:

Anver Cahaya Enterprise (002422813-D)
Kawzar Enterprise (002222493-K)
Mabruk Mohaideen Enterprise (PG0413789-U)
Nisha Khan Enterprise (002616692-V)

The raiding exercise was conducted in collaboration with the Royal Malaysia Police and the Immigration Department of Malaysia (JIM). Five illegal immigrants who were involved in manning the premises and customers of the illegal entities were detained by JIM for investigations under the Immigration Act 1959/63 (Act 155).
The raiding exercise is part of the continuous enforcement actions undertaken by BNM to protect members of the public against potential financial losses when dealing with unlicensed entities. As such, members of the public are advised not to deal or conduct any money changing or remittance transactions with illegal money services business operators and their agents.
Any person who conducts transactions with an illegal money services business operator does so at his own risk, and appropriate legal action can be taken against him by the relevant authorities. Members of the public are advised to refer to the list of licensed money services business operators on BNM's website (www.bnm.gov.my).

The Financial Markets Committee[1] (FMC) has been appointed as the committee to oversee the development of an alternative reference rate (ARR) for Malaysia and to deliberate on the continuity of Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR).
Financial benchmark reforms are underway internationally to improve the integrity of global interest rate benchmarks or reference rates, in line with the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) recommendation. The Bank envisages the identified ARR will run in parallel with the existing KLIBOR, thus providing sufficient time for market participants and stakeholders to prepare for the adoption of ARR.
The FMC comprises representatives from Bank Negara Malaysia, Securities Commission Malaysia, financial institutions, insurers, fund managers and corporate treasurers. It will be the key forum to discuss the latest international developments on financial benchmarks and is responsible for providing recommendations on the strategic direction for the financial benchmark rates in Malaysia.
The first key task for the committee would be to conduct an initial public consultation on the identification of a suitable ARR and enhancements to the KLIBOR framework if it is retained. The FMC will also deliberate on industry-wide standards to facilitate the adoption of ARR for financial contracts currently referencing KLIBOR.
Regular updates on the progress achieved by the FMC, including its assessment and recommendations, will be published for reference by all market participants.
 
 

[1] The Financial Markets Committee is a committee established by BNM in May 2016 and comprises representatives from Bank Negara Malaysia, financial institutions, corporations, financial service providers and other institutions which have prominent roles or participation in the financial markets.

The Shariah Advisory Council of Bank Negara Malaysia (the SAC) 30th Special meeting
Release Date:   10 Aug 2020





The Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 30th special meeting on 14 July 2020 has made a ruling on practices of restructuring of Islamic financing facility during the COVID-19 crisis.

Restructuring of an Islamic financing facility based on original Shariah contracts

	Restructuring of an Islamic financing facility based on the original Shariah contract(s) may be undertaken using a supplementary agreement that is cross referred to the terms and conditions of the original agreement. No new agreement is required. This is intended to reduce the cost and challenges to customers, and operational burden on Islamic financial institutions (IFIs).

	A new agreement is required if the restructuring involves -


the application of a different Shariah contract – for example a house financing that is originally based on musharakah mutanaqisah (diminishing partnership) is being restructured using ijarah; or
a combination of multiple financing based on various Shariah contracts into a new single Shariah contract as part of a debt rationalisation exercise.

 

Restructuring of an Islamic financing facility into a conventional loan (or vice versa)

	IFIs are allowed to restructure a conventional loan into an Islamic financing facility. However, restructuring of an Islamic financing into conventional loan is not allowed. In cases where the customer chooses to restructure his existing Islamic financing facility to a conventional loan, it is the customer’s prerogative and choice to do so. In this situation, the customer’s choice is beyond the responsibility and control of the IFI.


Compounding profit on restructuring

	IFIs are not allowed to include and account for any accrued profit on an original financing as the new principal amount for the restructured facility. Such practice aims to avoid multiplying of profits charges on debts (compounded profits). Therefore, in implementing a restructuring:


the new principal amount for the restructured facility is equivalent to the outstanding principal amount of the original facility, provided there is no additional financing;
IFIs are allowed to charge a new profit rate on the new principal amount; and
amount of accrued profit and late payment charges (where applicable) on the existing financing can be carried forward and added to the total debt obligation, but this amount cannot be capitalised in the calculation of new profit.

Ruling of the Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of the Bank Negara Malaysia at its 201 Meeting and 26th Special Meeting Statement
Release Date:   19 May 2020





The Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 201st meeting and 26th special meeting on 29 January and 30 January 2020 has made a ruling that electronic money (e-money) is a permissible payment instrument under Shariah, provided that the e-money has to be structured based on appropriate Shariah contract(s) to preserve the rights and obligations of the contracting parties.
One of the applicable Shariah contracts for e-money is the agency contract (wakalah), whereby the approved issuer acts as an agent to make payment on behalf of the user (wakil bi ad-daf`i) to the merchant. Therefore, the funds received from the user shall be placed in a Shariah compliant trust account or a dedicated deposit account as required pursuant to section 137 of the Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (IFSA).  An approved issuer is required to comply with the Guideline on Electronic Money (the Guideline) issued by Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) dated 31 July 2008 (including revisions from time to time). This includes, amongst others, the requirement on utilisation of the funds for investment purpose and any return generated belongs to the approved issuer, subject to the condition set forth in the Guideline. In this regard, the funds may be construed as a form of loan (qard) from the user to the approved issuer.
Since the approved issuer acts merely as an agent to facilitate payment on behalf of the user to the merchant, it is the user’s responsibility to ensure that the e-money is used for Shariah compliant transactions.

Reiteration of Our Statements on Moratorium
Release Date:   30 Apr 2020





We refer to our statements on the moratorium measure issued on 25 March 2020 and on additional steps to operationalise the moratorium for hire-purchase loans and fixed rate Islamic financing released today.
The statement today is to address procedural issues which will give legal effect to the moratorium in accordance with the Hire-Purchase Act 1967 and Shariah requirements.
BNM wishes to reiterate that borrowers do not need to apply for the moratorium. They only need to complete the documentation required to give legal effect on the moratorium. Borrowers will be advised by their banks on the next few simple steps to do this.
The moratorium is meant to ease cash flows for borrowers who are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As highlighted in BNM’s announcement on 25 March, borrowers were advised that interest/profit will continue to accrue on deferred payments and they should consider this in deciding whether they wish to take up the moratorium.
The 25 March 2020 statement reads:
“It is important to note that the interest/profit will continue to accrue on loan/financing repayments that are deferred and borrowers will need to honour the deferred repayments in the future. Borrowers should therefore ensure that they understand and discuss with their banking institutions on the options available to resume their scheduled repayments after the deferment period. Individuals and SMEs that do not wish or need to avail of these flexibilities can continue with their current repayment structures.”
Customers who do not wish to take up the moratorium can still do so by informing their banks.

On 11 November 2021, a joint enforcement action was taken against i-Serve Online Mall Sdn. Bhd. and its related affiliates for suspicion of committing various offences, including under the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) and the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 (AMLA).
22 premises linked to i-Serve Online Mall Sdn. Bhd. and its related affiliates located in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor were raided, and relevant documents were seized to assist in the joint investigation. The raids also resulted in the freezing of 45 bank accounts in 7 banks and seizing of cash, totalling RM118.7 million.
This joint enforcement action is part of an inter-agency collaboration to eradicate financial crimes in Malaysia. It was coordinated by the National Anti-Financial Crime Centre (NFCC) with Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) as the lead agency, along with Securities Commission Malaysia (SC), Companies Commission Malaysia, Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, the Royal Malaysia Police and CyberSecurity Malaysia.
Members of the public are advised that under section 137(1) of the FSA, it is an offence for any person to accept deposits without a licence. Investigations for money laundering offences will also be undertaken under the AMLA. If convicted, the person may be imposed a fine of not less than five times the sum or value of the proceeds of unlawful activities at the time the offence was committed or RM5 million, whichever is higher, and imprisonment not exceeding 15 years.
As a safeguard, members of the public are reminded to only place deposits and/or invest with parties licensed or registered by the relevant authorities.
BNM and SC strongly urge the public to be vigilant when investing with local or foreign companies offering various investment opportunities which promise high returns. If members of the public are aware or have been approached with such investment opportunities promoted on social media, via e-mails or telephone, they are encouraged to report the matter by contacting either BNM or SC at:

The Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 214th meeting on 30 June 2021 has ruled that Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) are not allowed to include and account for any accrued profit from the original financing in the new principal amount of R&R financing. This is because such practice will amplify the amount of profit on debts (compounding profit). Therefore, IFIs shall ensure that in executing R&R financing:

the new principal amount of the R&R financing shall be equivalent to the outstanding principal amount of the original facility, if there is no additional financing involved;
the amount of accrued profit and late payment charges (where applicable) from the original financing can be added to the total new debt obligation, but this amount cannot be capitalised in the calculation of the new profit; and
the prohibition is applicable to R&R financing with all customers (both musir and mu’sir).

Globally, risk-free rates (RFRs) will replace LIBOR for major currencies from January 2022 onwards. In line with this global development, Bank Negara Malaysia requires banks to cease new issuance of LIBOR-referencing contracts by 31 December 2021. The e-brochure emphasises the urgency for bank customers to be prepared for the transition from LIBOR to RFRs.

The policy document sets out the Bank’s expectations and policy requirements on the development and maintenance of recovery plans for financial institutions. Under the proposed framework, each financial institution will be required to identify and plan for the execution of a suite of recovery options to restore its long-term viability under a range of idiosyncratic and system-wide stress events.
The information and assessment contained in recovery plans will also serve as an important starting point for Perbadanan Insurans Deposit Malaysia (PIDM) - as the resolution authority for its member institutions – to improve the resolvability of member institutions and operationalise feasible and credible resolution plans.

The Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 213th meeting on 27 April 2021 has ruled that the method to measure qard (interest-free loan) transaction between shareholders’ fund and takaful fund under MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and MFRS 9 Financial Instruments requirements is allowed. This is because the total repayment of the qard amount will not increase even if the time value of money (TVM) principle is applied in the measurement method. This ruling is subject to comprehensive disclosure in the notes to the financial statements as follows:

The requirement for takaful operator to provide qard from shareholders’ fund in the event a deficit occurs in the takaful fund;
The nature of qard contract, the qard original amount that has been provided to the takaful fund and the expected repayment period for the qard upon availability of surplus in the takaful fund; and
Explanation on the accounting measurement in respect of TVM application to determine the present value and future value of qard and the impact to the original amount of qard and fair value adjustment required to achieve the original amount. The explanation should also cover the “rights of shareholders’ fund to receive the original qard amount” and the “obligation of takaful fund to repay the original qard amount”, of which the amount remains unchanged throughout the qard repayment period.

Summary 
This Discussion Paper explores proposed enhancements to the design of the capital adequacy framework for licensed insurers and licensed takaful operators, as part of the Bank’s multi-phased review of the overall solvency framework. These proposed enhancements aim to ensure that the framework remains effective under changing market conditions and facilitates consistent and comparable capital adequacy measurement across the insurance and takaful industry, where appropriate. In developing the proposals, the Bank has also taken into consideration the developments in global capital standards. 
This Discussion Paper seeks to initiate discussions and solicit feedback from ITOs on the following four key areas:

recognition of the loss absorbing capacity of management actions under Total Capital Available;
appropriate target risk level for calibration of capital charges;
comprehensiveness of the risk components under Total Capital Required and the appropriateness of the approach for measuring these risks; and
feasibility of introducing a single formula for calculating the Capital Adequacy Ratio for ITOs, which promotes greater comparability of capital adequacy across the two industries but reflects uniqueness between insurance and takaful business models.

The Bank invites written feedback on this Discussion Paper, including suggestions for particular areas to be clarified or enhanced and any alternative proposals that the Bank should consider. To facilitate a constructive consultation process, the feedback should be supported with clear justifications, especially on the practical aspects, and accompanying evidence or illustrations, where appropriate.
In addition to providing general feedback, it is highly recommended that respondents also provide feedback to the specific questions set out in this Discussion Paper. 
 
Responses must be submitted electronically as per the template provided to pfpconsult@bnm.gov.my by 30 September 2021.

Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy
Release Date:   30 Apr 2021





Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy
The Discussion Paper on Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy was issued on 27 December 2019 to facilitate financial institutions in assessing and classifying economic activities that contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Bank received written feedback from respondents, including financial institutions, asset management companies, rating agencies and non-governmental organisations, during the consultation period. The Bank has since been working collaboratively with the Joint Committee on Climate Change (JC3) Risk Management Sub-Committee to incorporate the feedback received and enhance the discussion paper.
The final issuance of the Climate Change and Principle-based Taxonomy guidance document features major enhancements in the following areas:


Strengthened the guidance document with the introduction of a progressive system of transition categories (Climate Supporting, Transitioning and Watchlist) to acknowledge concrete transition efforts and commitments by businesses to adopt sustainable practices; and


Provided greater clarity and guidance for the assessment of guiding principles including the incorporation of broader environmental outcomes through the principle of no significant harm, with specific focus on how business operations affect pollution, biodiversity and resource efficiency.


Financial institutions can refer to the first cohort of the Value-based Intermediation Financing and Investment Impact Assessment Framework (VBIAF) Sectoral Guides on Palm Oil, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency for guidance on sectoral/ activity-based metrics, and climate-related and environmental risks mitigation measures. The second cohort of the VBIAF Sectoral Guides on Oil and Gas, Construction and Infrastructure, as well as Manufacturing sector will be published by the end of 2021.

Ruling of the Bank's Shariah Advisory Council on the Adoption of Risk-Free Rate
Release Date:   23 Mar 2021





The Shariah Advisory Council (SAC) of Bank Negara Malaysia at its 210th meeting on 23 December 2020 has ruled that the adoption of risk-free rate (RFR) as an alternative benchmark rate to LIBOR, or as a fallback benchmark replacement rate after the permanent cessation of LIBOR, is permissible based on the following justification:

The compounding methodology is merely an arithmetic method in determining the term rate which does not affect compliance of the transactions with Shariah requirements;and
Uncertainty (gharar) from the adoption of average RFR or backward-looking term rate at the point of payment is mitigated via proper determination and disclosure of the ceiling price and formula to derive the periodic payment amount to the customer at the inception of the contract.

In transitioning to the alternative RFR, Shariah Committee of each IFI needs to determine the appropriateness of invoking the deemed consent mechanism to signify customers’ consent on the incorporation of the fallback provision in the contract’s terms and conditions.

Specifically for takaful operators, the disclosure requirements have been strengthened to reflect specificities of takaful. Requirements have also been aligned with recommendations by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) and latest ruling by the Shariah Advisory Council relating to application of MFRS 17 to takaful businesses (i.e. columnar presentation of financial statements and qard measurement).

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) hosted the Third Roundtable Meeting between Centralised Shariah Advisory Authorities in Islamic Finance (CSAAs)[1] on 21 December 2021. The meeting was held virtually and participated by more than 50 delegates from 16 countries[2] and three standard-setting bodies[3].
The meeting was chaired by the Chairman of the BNM Shariah Advisory Council, Tan Sri Dr. Mohd Daud Bakar. It aims to further strengthen connectivity and foster mutual respect among Shariah boards at both central bank and national levels.
The following outcomes were highlighted during the meeting:

Given the important role of CSAAs in mainstreaming Islamic finance, having a broader picture on Islamic finance development in their countries is critical. This mainly include industry-wide issues which could not be resolved by individual Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) and their respective Shariah boards. Such areas include providing Shariah guidance in navigating through any unprecedented crisis, developing Shariah parameters on rectification of Shariah non-compliant (SNC) events and incomes, as well as promoting the best ethical behaviour among Shariah board members and management of IFIs in preserving the Shariah sanctity of their operations.
	 
CSAAs should strive to build greater coordination with other regulators and Governments in driving future-proof initiatives for the Islamic finance industry. It is critical for CSAAs to address challenges including those arising from misalignment of regulatory frameworks with Shariah principles. For example, to address the impact of climate change, CSAAs can collaborate with the Government and other relevant regulators to issue a national green framework that is consistent with Shariah principles. CSAAs may also guide regulators in enhancing laws and regulatory policies to suit the development of their respective Islamic finance industry.
	 
On Shariah governance, the meeting acknowledged the importance of a sound framework to ensure quality Shariah boards in terms of behaviour, duty of care and attitude towards fulfilling their mandates. The meeting also recognised the key roles of a competent Shariah Secretariat in supporting the effective functioning of its Shariah advisory board, at both national and institution levels.
	 
The meeting agreed for more focus to be given on key strategic issues, maqasid Shariah and action-oriented commitments in supporting sustainable finance for future meetings.

 

[1] The CSAA is established to deliberate on Shariah matters in Islamic finance. Each country adopts a different model and approach in establishing their respective Shariah advisory authority, to commensurate with the size and complexity of its Islamic finance industry as well as the local custom. The role of the Shariah advisory authority has been pivotal in preserving the Shariah sanctity and public confidence on Islamic financial transactions, creating a conducive environment for the industry to innovate and grow.

Summary
The Insurers/Takaful Operators-Repairers Code of Conduct (the Code) intends to establish minimum standards on fair, timely and professional conduct. This is to promote more effective collaboration between general insurers/takaful operators (ITOs) and repairers. Additionally, the Code also provides for the establishment of an ITOs-Repairers Independent Dispute Resolution Framework to resolve disputes between ITOs and Repairers in a fair, transparent and timely manner. This is aimed at enhancing public trust and confidence in the motor claims and repair industries.
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has held a series of engagements in the first half of 2023 to obtain preliminary feedback on the draft Code. The engagements were held with all ITOs and their associations, as well as with representatives of repairers that are members of the Federation of Automobile Workshop Owners’ Association of Malaysia (FAWOAM).
The initial feedback received from these stakeholders have been incorporated into the draft Code where relevant and appropriate.
To ensure comprehensiveness of the Code, BNM invites written feedback on the draft Code from all stakeholders, particularly from all repairers nationwide, including franchise repairers as well as vehicle manufacturers. The written feedback may include suggestions on any issue or area, or alternative proposals which the Bank should consider. Your feedback is crucial in ensuring a comprehensive Code which serves the interest of all parties involved.
Upon finalisation of the Code, all repairers nationwide are then welcome to be a participant to the Code, and therefore are required to comply with the Code accordingly. In our capacity as the regulator of the ITO industry, BNM will require all ITOs to abide by the requirements of the Code. The code includes minimum requirements expected to be incorporated into ITO’s Service Level Agreements with its panel of repairers. This is to ensure improved consumer outcomes, and enhance levels of professionalism and fair conduct in the business dealings between ITOs with their panel repairers.
As a guide to reading the Code, the requirements that use the term ‘shall’ or ‘must’ are intended to be mandatory obligations to be complied with by ITOs and repairers who have agreed to be participant of the Code. Meanwhile, the use of ‘should’ or ‘may’ is intended to be non-mandatory, serving as additional guidance or clarification on the intended regulatory expectation.
All submissions are to be submitted by 19 January 2024 through this link. 
Submissions received may be made public unless confidentiality is specifically requested for the whole or any part of the submission. Should there be any queries or clarification required in preparing your feedback, you may direct it to Azlinda Arshad and Ariana Ng Chor Yee at conductpolicy@bnm.gov.my.

Inclusion of eight new datasets in the Monthly Highlights and Statistics
New Terms of Use for BNM datasets to support the Government’s open data initiative

Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) today published eight new datasets and their metadata in the Monthly Highlights and Statistics (MHS) publication.
This enhancement follows a holistic review of BNM’s published datasets. It is also in line with the open data ecosystem development initiative under the Financial Sector Blueprint 2022-2026 and the Government’s open data agenda. The main objective of the review is to enhance the availability and accessibility of BNM datasets to support data-driven decision-making. The other objectives are to develop new insights, as well as identify collaborative and innovative opportunities.
Eight New Datasets 
The eight new datasets (see table) were selected based on historical data demands from various stakeholders. Feedback was also gathered through a public consultation survey conducted in August 2022. BNM also benchmarked published datasets of other central banks.

In addition to these eight new datasets, BNM has also published a more detailed dataset for Total Loan/Financing by Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards 9 (MFRS 9) and Total Provisions with segmentation by classification exposure. This is in line with international best practices.
All datasets are made available today except for the Loan/Financing by Location dataset that will be published in the second quarter of 2024.
New Terms of Use 
BNM has also introduced a new Terms of Use (TOU) for its datasets. This allows users to use the data for commercial and non-commercial purposes. The new TOU is applicable to data in which BNM is the primary compiler. Previously, datasets were bound by the general TOU for BNM website to be used for informational purpose only.    
To better respond to evolving data demands, BNM will continue to enhance public availability of and access to its datasets. This is done through periodic review against international best practices and engagement with stakeholders.
The public may contact BNMLINK via web form at bnmlink.bnm.gov.my or call 1-300-88-5465 for further enquiries.

Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) had on 18 May 2023, imposed an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)[1] of RM600,000 on TNG Digital Sdn. Bhd. (TNGD) for contravening the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) read together with:

b) the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions policy document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD).
TNGD had reported to the Bank that it had, on separate occasions, onboarded two sanctioned individuals under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities (Declaration of Specified Entities and Reporting Requirements) (Amendments) Order 2014. These were in breach of section 48(1) of the FSA read together with the following:
a) AML/CFT Sector 4 PD in respect of the first sanctioned person where TNGD failed to conduct sanctions screening on the names of its customers; and
b) AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD in respect of the second sanctioned person where TNGD failed to ascertain and make further enquiries that its customer matched with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions List or the Minister of Home Affairs Domestic List.
The AMP amount was determined by considering relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including assessment of the remedial actions taken to address the non- compliances.
TNGD paid RM600,000 for the AMP imposed by the Bank on 31 May 2023.
 

[1] The Bank imposed the AMP pursuant to section 234(3)(b) of the FSA. [2] The AML/CFT Sector 4 PD was in effect from 15 September 2013 to 31 December 2019 and has since been superseded by Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions policy document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD), which took effect on 1 January 2020.

Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) had, on 29 December 2022, imposed an Administrative Monetary Penalty (AMP)[1] of RM260,000 on MPI Generali Insurans Berhad (MPGB) for non- compliance with the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) read together with the Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions policy document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD).

This is in breach of subsection 48(1) of FSA read together with AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD.
The AMP amount was determined by considering relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, which include assessment of MPGB’s controls, first-time non-compliance of a similar nature by MPGB and actions taken to address the breaches.
Additionally, the Bank had also directed MPGB to undertake a comprehensive review of its sanction screening processes, and MPGB has since addressed the supervisory concerns satisfactorily.
MPGB paid RM260,000 for the AMP imposed by the Bank on 6 January 2023.
 

[1] The Bank imposed the AMP pursuant to section 234(3)(b)(i) of FSA.

Enforcement Action Publication Notice (P.N. 05/2023)
Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) had, on 12 April 2022, imposed an administrative monetary penalty (AMP)[1] of RM134,400 on Mandiri International Remittance Sdn. Bhd. (MISB) for contravening the Money Services Business Act 2011 (MSBA) read together with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism – Money Services Business (Sector 3) policy document[2] (AML/CFT Sector 3 PD).
During an on-site examination, the Bank discovered that a number of MISB’s customers had conducted remittance transactions on behalf of third parties. Further examination on these customers revealed that MISB had failed to identify and verify the beneficial owners (BOs) for the remittance transactions conducted as follows -
a) MISB failed to obtain identification information in the manner required under AML/CFT Sector 3 PD;
b) MISB failed to obtain a copy of BO’s identification document for transactions with value of RM3,000 and above; and
c) MISB failed to obtain any form of authorisation from the BOs confirming that the remittance transactions were conducted on their behalf.
These failures are in breach of section 74(3) of the MSBA read together with AML/CFT Sector 3 PD.
The AMP amount was determined by taking into account relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, including MISB’s past compliance record and the remedial actions taken to address the non-compliances.
MISB paid RM134,400 for the AMP imposed by the Bank on 7 April 2023[3].
 

[1] The Bank issued the AMP pursuant to section 75(2)(b) of the MSBA.
[2] The AML/CFT PD Sector 3 PD was in effect from 15 September 2013 to 31 December 2019 and has, since 1 January 2020, been replaced with Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions policy document (AML/CFT and TFS for FIs PD).
[3] The Bank had granted an extended payment deadline to MISB in consideration of the pandemic impact.

Following a joint enforcement action[4] taken against the above entities on suspicion of committing various offences, BNM’s investigation revealed that between June 2018 and September 2021, the respective entities had accepted deposits from the public and had consequentially engaged directly in transactions that involved proceeds of such illegal deposit-taking activities. This was undertaken through schemes where monies were accepted from the public on terms under which the monies would be repaid in full, in breach of the FSA.
In accordance with BNM’s governance and approved frameworks, the total compound amount was determined by considering factors such as the severity of offences committed and all aggravating and mitigating factors.
On 16 November 2022, the entities paid the total amount of compound of RM50 million imposed by BNM.
I-Serve Group has been instructed to ensure that it does not operate any scheme or a semblance of a scheme that accepts deposits from the public, in contravention of section 137(1) of the FSA.
 

[1] Section 137(1) of the FSA provides that no person shall accept deposits except under a licence granted under section 10 regardless of whether the transaction is described as a loan, an advance, an investment, a savings, a sale, or a sale and repurchase or by whatever name called.
[2] For offence of accepting deposits without a licence under section 137 of the FSA.
[3] For offence of money laundering under section 4(1) of the AMLA.
[4] Refer to BNM’s Public Notice “Joint Enforcement Action against Companies Suspected to be Involved in Financial Crime Activities” dated 15 Nov 2021: https://www.bnm.gov.my/-/joint-enforcement-action-20211111

The implementation of the 1st Financial Inclusion Framework (2011–2020) has led to significant improvements in the accessibility and take-up of basic financial services in Malaysia. Despite the progress made, several barriers and challenges need to be addressed to run the last mile in progressing financial inclusion.
Aligned to meet the goals envisioned in the Financial Sector Blueprint (2022–2026) to elevate the financial well-being of households and businesses, Bank Negara Malaysia developed the 2nd Financial Inclusion Framework (2023–2026) as a four-year strategic roadmap and principle-based guidance to advance financial inclusion in Malaysia. The Framework also takes into consideration alignment of strategies towards new emerging growth angles in financial services, and achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Environmental, Sustainability and Governance (ESG) propositions for higher value creation.
The Bank has consulted key stakeholders in developing the Framework. Constructive feedback and suggestions have been received during the consultation period and have been incorporated in the issuance of the Framework.

Enforcement Action Publication Notice 01/2019 (P.N.01/2019)
Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) had on 14 January 2019, imposed an administrative monetary penalty (AMP) of RM2,700,000 pursuant to section 234(3)(b) of the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA) on J.P. Morgan Chase Bank Berhad (JPMCB) for exceeding the single counterparty exposure limit (SCEL) under section 50(1) of the FSA read together with paragraph 8.1(b) of the SCEL Policy Document dated 9 July 2014. Under section 234(3)(b) of the FSA, JPMCB can be liable to a maximum fine of RM5,000,000.00 for each breach committed.
The above requirement states that the SCEL shall be 25% of the banking institution’s total capital, and a limit as may be approved by the Bank which shall not exceed 50% of the banking institution’s total capital in the case of exposures to a counterparty who is a related banking entity. JPMCB breached the applicable SCEL for exposures to its related banking entity on 22 January 2018.
The AMP amount was determined taking into account relevant aggravating and mitigating factors. The breach in 2018 was a recurring breach. However, the Bank noted that JPMCB had voluntarily informed the Bank of the breach and taken remedial steps to reduce its exposure within the regulatory limits.
The Bank has further directed JPMCB to undertake a holistic review of the adequacy and effectiveness of its internal SCEL policy and procedures, including the measurement framework for single counterparty exposures which JPMCB has undertaken. This should serve to inform measures by JPMCB to strengthen its management of limits and prevent a recurrence of breaches in future.
On 18 January 2019, JPMCB paid RM2,700,000 for the AMP imposed by the Bank.

Enforcement Action Publication Notice 01/2023 (P.N. 01/2023)
Bank Negara Malaysia (the Bank) had on 1 March 2022, imposed a total compound[1] of RM151,200 on Wawasan Ilham (M) Sdn. Bhd.

Additionally, it was also found that WISB failed to conduct customer due diligence on its customers in relation to money changing transactions which were above RM3,000. These failures are in breach of requirements set out in section 27(1) of the MSBA read together with paragraph 5(a) of MSB Duties and section 74(3) of the MSBA read together with the AML/CFT Sector 3 PD, respectively.
The compound and AMP amount were determined by taking into account relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, which include WISB’s conduct in addressing the non-compliances and WISB’s commitment to prevent recurrence of similar non-compliances.

[1] The Bank issued the compound pursuant to section 88(1) of the MSBA.

On 24 June 2014, the Bank granted conditional approval for CBP to continue accepting Islamic deposits from non-members under section 291(2) of IFSA. One condition was the requirement for CBP to maintain, at all times, a minimum loan loss coverage ratio (LLCR) of 100%, beginning 31 December 2014 (LLCR requirement). CBP’s failure to comply with the LLCR requirement from September 2019 until June 2021 is therefore in breach of section 291(2) of IFSA.
The AMP amount was determined by taking into account relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, which include the consideration of:
(i) CBP’s controls;
(ii) the period of recurring non-compliance by CBP with conditions imposed by the Bank;
(iii) profit gained as a result of the non-compliance; and
(iv) the adequacy of the remedial measures by CBP in addressing the noncompliance.
CBP paid RM828,000 for the AMP imposed by the Bank on 7 October 2022.
 
[1] The Bank imposed the AMP pursuant to section 245(3)(b)(i) of IFSA.

Summary
The discussion paper explores Bank Negara Malaysia’s (the Bank) proposed features of the Financial Inclusion Framework 2023-2026 (Framework).
The implementation of the Financial Inclusion Framework 2011-2020 has led to significant improvements in the accessibility and take-up of basic financial services in Malaysia. Despite the progress made, several barriers and challenges need to be addressed to run the last mile in progressing financial inclusion. The Framework will also take into consideration alignment of strategies towards new emerging growth angles in financial services, and achievement of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Environmental, Sustainability and Governance (ESG) propositions for higher value creation.
Developed to align with the Financial Sector Blueprint 2022-2026, the Framework serves as a four-year strategic roadmap and principle-based guidance to advance financial inclusion. The vision of the Framework is to provide a more expansive and holistic approach to achieve broader development outcomes and elevating the financial well-being and standard of living of all residents in Malaysia.
The Bank invites written feedback on this discussion paper, including suggestions on areas to be clarified and alternative proposals that the Bank should consider. The written feedback should be supported by a clear rationale, accompanying evidence or practical examples, where appropriate, to facilitate greater understanding of its context.

This revised policy document is an enhanced version of the Policy Document on Fair Treatment of Financial Consumers (FTFC) issued by Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) in November 2019. It sets out existing requirements and guidance for financial service providers (FSPs) to treat financial consumers fairly by adopting high standards of responsible and professional conduct and embedding a culture where the interests of financial consumers are an integral part of FSP’s business strategies and operations.
This revised policy document introduces a new principle and specific requirements for FSPs to consider and respond to the interests and needs of vulnerable consumers in conducting its business and operations. FSPs are expected to provide the appropriate support to vulnerable consumers, consistent with fair treatment of financial consumer outcomes. Throughout the revised policy document, BNM has supplemented existing and new requirements with illustrations of good and poor practices to facilitate industry implementation.
Highlights 
For ease of reference, key revisions made to the policy document on FTFC include:


Enhancements to the definitions of “representatives” and “agents” and the inclusion of the definitions of “persons with disabilities” and “vulnerable consumer” under paragraph 5.2;


Enhancements to the specification of “financial consumer” under paragraph 7.1;


Inclusion of new Outcome 7 to ensure vulnerable consumers are treated fairly and equitably by the FSP, and the FSP’s staff, representatives and agents under paragraph 8.1(g);


Enhancements to the role of the board and senior management in demonstrating a commitment to the fair treatment of vulnerable consumers, including establishing and maintaining appropriate policies, processes and accountability structures under paragraphs 10.2 to 10.4;


Inclusion of principle 7 to set out new requirements on the fair treatment of vulnerable consumers under paragraphs 16.1 to 16.28;


Enhancements of existing and inclusion of new good and poor practices throughout the policy document to illustrate BNM’s expectations and assist FSPs in understanding and complying with the policy document’s requirements;


Enhancements of fair outcomes to financial consumers under Appendix 1;


Enhancements to the illustration of the Treat Customers Fairly Charter under Appendix 2; and


Inclusion of new good practices by FSPs in dealing with persons with disabilities and other vulnerable consumers, where relevant, under Appendix 5.


BNM has also responded to key feedback received on the Exposure Draft on Fair Treatment of Vulnerable Consumers issued in February 2023, which is accessible through the document attached below. In addition, BNM will enhance the existing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the FTFC document for issuance soon.

	The DDQ contains a foundational set of questions for mandatory adoption by FIs, in assessing compliance with GP3 and GP4, specifically client's negative impact on environment and climate (i.e., no significant harm) and measures undertaken to remediate the negative impact (i.e., remedial measures to transition). First published in April 2023, the DDQ has been refined to include GP3's scope on GHG emissions, as well as improve clarity and user-friendliness. 
Guidance Notes (GN) to facilitate adoption of DDQ for GP3 & GP4: 
	The GN provides detailed guidance to support the adoption of DDQ for GP3 & GP4 assessment.  The document has been updated to include relevant data sources in the Climate Data Catalogue published by the Joint Committee on Climate Change Sub-Committee 5 (JC3 SC5) as well as other relevant assessment tools and references. 
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs): 
	The FAQ entails commonly asked questions on CCPT assessment. The document has been updated to include clarification on expectations entailed in BNM’s Dear CEO letter (CCPT Review 2023 - Observations and Expectations on Financial Institutions) issued on 14 November 2023.
