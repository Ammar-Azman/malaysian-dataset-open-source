       "'As you reach your ninth month of pregnancy in your final trimester, your doctor\\xa0will give you an internal exam to check\\xa0your cervix for any early signs of labour (e.g. if you’re dilated) and during this check-up she will also see if your \\nbaby’s head is engaged\\n.\\n\\n\\nAfter\\xa0confirming whether your cervix has dilated (opened up) and effaced (thinned out) and if it has started\\xa0to soften and move to the front of the vagina, she\\xa0might be able to\\xa0give you an estimate date as to\\xa0when you can expect to deliver.\\n\\n\\nBut how dilated do you have to be and what does it mean if you are 1cm dilated?\\n\\n\\nCervix dilation\\n\\n\\nIf you touch the tip of your nose, that is pretty similar to how your cervix feels before labour.\\n\\n\\nNormally it will also be slightly firm and closed, so as to protect your growing baby from the outside world.\\n\\n\\nBut as your body prepares for labour, y\\nour cervix will get very soft, \\nstart to dilate and\\xa0\\nalso thins out (otherwise known as cervical effacement).\\n\\n\\nSo before your baby can make her grand debut, your cervix must be completely dilated and thinned out.\\n\\n\\nCervical effacement\\n\\n\\nNot only does your cervix have to be open all the way, but it also needs to thin out completely for your baby to be born.\\n\\n\\nAs your labour progresses, your hard and long cervix will gradually thin out over time.\\n\\n\\nCervical effacement is measured in percentage, so when your cervix is 100% effaced, that’s when it is thin enough (paper thin, in fact!) for your bub to easily pass through.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe patient, because your cervix can be dilated for weeks before you even go into labour\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIs it a sign that you’re going into labour?\\n\\n\\nYou might think that being at least 1cm dilated means that you’ll be giving birth some time soon, but this is not usually the case.\\n\\n\\nCervix dilation does not indicate when exactly you will go into labour or how fast your\\n\\xa0labour will be — in fact,\\n\\xa0you can even be dilated by a few centimetres for a few weeks before going into labour!\\n\\n\\nHowever, even if your cervix is still completely closed, you could possibly go into labour the very same day, because every woman’s body is different and each pregnancy is unique.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen your cervix is 10cm dilated, it is the same size as a bagel!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1cm to 10cm dilated\\n\\n\\nWhen you go into labour, your cervix will stretch from 0cm to be fully dilated at 10cm.\\n\\n\\nA vaginal exam will determine your cervix dilation and is measured by how many finger widths can fit into the opening of your cervix.\\n\\n\\nIf the tip of one finger can fit, this means that your cervix is 1cm dilated; if two finger tips can fit, that means it is 2cm.\\n\\n\\nAfter which, the distance the two fingers can stretch apart will indicate further cervix dilation.\\n\\n\\nBut what exactly happens at 1cm, all the way up to 10cm?\\n\\n\\n1cm dilated\\n\\n\\nYour cervix is the size of a single Cheerio and you can have your \\nhospital bag\\n on standby because your body is getting ready to give birth.\\n\\n\\n4cm dilated\\n\\n\\nBy now, your cervix is about the same size as a Ritz cracker — but i\\nf this is your first pregnancy, it might take you a little longer to\\xa0go through the early stages of labour.\\n\\n\\n7cm dilated\\n\\n\\nWould you believe that your cervix is now around the same diameter as a soda can?\\n\\n\\n“\\nActive labour\\n” would have started by now, causing your cervix to dilate faster, so your contractions will be stronger, longer, more regular and painful!\\n\\n\\n10cm dilated\\n\\n\\nOnce you are 10cm dilated, your cervix is considered fully open and is the same size as a bagel!\\nPartner Stories\\nMenjadi ibu bapa\\nIbu-Ibu, Ini Cara Untuk Kembali Yakin Dengan Diri Sendiri Selepas Pembedahan C-Section!
