I’m not the biggest girl on the market but I’m definitely bigger than all the girls [Calvin Klein] has ever worked with, so that is really intimidating. She wasn’t sure, she said of the shoot, what was expected from her in terms of her size or shape.\\n\\n\\nRefreshingly, what was expected of her was the same thing that was expected of Lara Stone: to take a beautiful picture.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmotional discomfort, when accepted, rises, crests and falls in a series of waves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou must learn one thing.
