I’m hoping this news also mean that we, the bikers in Malaysia are able to get to see this bike too brought here by Kawasaki Malaysia.  \nThe design cues are now brings much more familiar face since it is taken from the silhouette of its bigger brother, the Kawasaki Ninja 250R. The headlamp and side profile really looks like it is from Ninja 250R.\nMeter cluster features the big RPM meter on the center for easy monitoring of the engine performance to get the perfect shift every time. The speedometer there maxes at 200km/h which I think is able to be achieved with this bike since it is 2-stroker. Fuel level meter at the right side also help to give the rider information about the fuel. Kawasaki are known for bikes without fuel meter since they like to use fuel indicator that only lit up when the fuel is low.\n\nThe rear end is also updated with new tail lamp (LED?) that I see can be make to become fenderless easily.\nIn the end, we, as the riders in Malaysia, always keep this question in our head; will it come to Malaysia?\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2011/12/02/kawasaki-akan-produksi-30-ribu-new-ninja-150rr-facelift/\nAdvertisements",

I previously have own Honda Icon 110 which is equipped with the conventional sliding gear mechanism starter system that give a brutal sound every time I hit the ‘START’ button on my bike. The sound sometimes scares my friend who borrowed my bike who thinks that something is wrong with my Icon 110. A silent starter system is something that I really want at that time.  \nMy Honda Icon with the conventional sliding gear starter\nThe introduction of the ACG Starter system to Honda Vario 125 is a good strategy since there are many competitors that are offering more tech with lower cost. ACG Starter has already being used by Honda PCX 125 previously.\n\nIt works by having a stator core and brushless rotor system that is directly attached to the crankshaft of the engine. There is no friction between this two component since it is never touched each other. Hence, this make a super silent starter system.\n\nThe ACG Starter system not only works to start the motor but also works as the alternator for engine to provide the power for battery recharge. The engine will cut-off the power of the stator as soon as the bike is started and magneto rotor core are now generating the electric since it is moving by the movement of the crankshaft.\n\nThis not only works as a super silent starter system but also save the weight of the bike by not having additional magneto and stator core for the electrical system and battery charging.

        "Honda \n\nHonda Electric-Powered Blade Snow Thrower “Yukios e (SB800e)” in Japan \n\n\nPosted on October 16, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nHonda Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that it will begin sales of a rechargeable electric-powered blade snow thrower, Yukios e (SB800e), in Japan in mid-November 2014 through Honda power products dealers (including authorized Honda agricultural power products dealers, home centers and motorcycle dealers.) The easy-to-operate Yukios e is designed for quiet and speedy snow removal for household use or for small-sized parking lots or other facilities.  \n\nYukios e was developed based on an existing Yukios (SB800) model, a gasoline-powered blade snow thrower that removes snow by pushing and piling it up to the side. Outstanding quietness and ease-of-use, which only an electric-power model can provide, were pursued through the adoption of a rechargeable battery and DC brushless motor for the power unit. Yukios e is easily recharged through a household electric outlet and yet features the class-topping*1 snow removal capability among electric-powered snow throwers in the market, making it suitable for novice users and for residential area snow removal during the early-morning and nighttime hours.\n\n*1\nAmong all walk-behind electric-powered blade snow throwers available in the market as of October 2014 (based on Honda internal research)\n\nKey features of Yukios e (SB800e)\n\nPursuit of the customer’s piece-of-mind and ease-of-use\n\n\nEasy and smooth operation for starting-up: The user only needs to push the key in and turn the power switch from the “off” position to “on.”\nThe Yukios e can be operated only with the drive lever and speed-change lever, therefore even a novice user can use it fully without confusion.\nYukios e will start moving forward when the user applies a gentle squeeze to the drive lever, and it stops when the user lets go of the lever. Detailed speed adjustments are possible by changing the angles of the grip on the drive lever.\nThe blade can be lifted up and put down lightly and easily with the up-and-down operation of handles. The vertical angle of the blade also can be adjusted easily.\nRecharging of the battery is also easy. The user connects an easy-to-handle/easy-to-carry dedicated battery with a large-sized handgrip to the recharger and plugs into a household electric outlet (100V). For each recharging, Yukios e will gain duration of approximately one hour. The recharging takes approximately 6 to 12 hours (time required for recharging varies depending on the temperature of the environment where recharging is done).\nThe user can check the remaining battery level on a three-lamp LED indicator light located near his/her hand.\n\n\n\n\nQuietness unique to electric-powered snow thrower\n\n\nYukios e realizes outstanding quietness unique to an electric-power model, making it easier for the user who needs to remove snow in early-morning or nighttime hours or in a residential area.\n\n\n\n\nOutstanding snow removal capability\n\n\n\nWhen it is fully charged, Yukios e is capable of removing snow form an area approximately 250m2 (equivalent to a parking area for approximately 16 cars)*2.\nA chamfered scraper attached at the bottom of the blade reduces the friction between the blade and the ground surface, enabling smooth snow removal.\nSide plates, adopted for both sides of the blade, increase an ability to cut into the snow and reduces the amount of snow left behind.\n\n\n\n*2\nCalculated based on the assumption that a fully-charged Yukios e was used for removal of 20cm-high fresh snow on a paved surface (based on Honda internal research, the measurement value will vary depending on the quality of snow and other conditions). For parking space calculation, a per-car space of 2.5m X 6m was used.\n\n\n\n\nDesign concept\n\n\nAdopting a white head cover designed to pursue a smart form with a low center of gravity, the exterior design of Yukios e expresses a sense of ease and friendliness as an easy-to-operate snow thrower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey specifications of Yukios e (SB800e)\n\n\n\n\nType\nElectric-powered blade snow thrower\n\n\nProduct name\nYukios e (SB800e)\n\n\nModel name/type (category)\nSB800e/J\n\n\nSize (mm)\nLength\n1,320\n\n\nWidth\n820\n\n\nHeight\n975\n\n\nBody weight (total weight) (kg)\n69\n\n\nClearing width (mm)\n800\n\n\nBlade height (mm)\n330\n\n\nMaximum speed (km/h)\nForward approximately 4\nBackward: approximately 0\n(variable-speed)\n\n\nMotor\nType\nDC brushless motor X 1\n\n\nMaximum output\n24V860W\n\n\nBattery\nType (5-hour Ah)\nValve-regulated lead-acid battery (24V-20Ah)\n\n\nWeight\n(battery pack weight) (kg)\n16\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Yamaha MT-25 has been spied in Indonesia to be the naked/street version of the supersports YZF-R25. A super easy way to see whether this is a naked/street bike is to look at the headlight. If the headlight is attached to move along with the direction of the handlebar, then, it is a naked/street bike. Let just say street bike. We can also see the lower seating to make traffic stop-go easier to manage.  \nA street version of YZF-R25 is a nice thing to have and easy on the implementation too. It is due to the sharing of common parts. The engine is the same along with the overall chassis. Yamaha only need to tune or mod few parts to make it street bike.\nThe exposed Race-blu diamond frame adds the nice style to the bike overall look. The exposed engine also makes it more raw in appearance.\nThe decals on the bike shows the word ‘MT-25‘, which is the same as the ‘Dark’ series from Yamaha like the 3-cylinder MT-09, 2-cylinder MT-07 and beginner 1-cylinder MT-125. This MT-25 will be addition to the already popular ‘Dark’ bikes.\nThe price of the bike is spied to be at Rp 45 million which is RM12,344.32 if converted directly. Seeing the price has already coming out, is this the indication that this delicious Yamaha MT-25 going to be released soon?\nSource: TMCBlog\n \nAdvertisements",

Riders can bring their bike to the apartment and park it inside the house with the built in garage. This is a very nice idea. I always wanted to put Cagiva Mito SP525 in my living room as a centerpiece because I think it would be looking perfectly beautiful.  In Japan, people are riding more bikes and bicycle as an alternative to cars to beat the traffic and the high cost of ownership of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.nakae-a.jp/works/2011/02/ne-apartment.html\nAdvertisements",

        "Bridgestone\nmotogp \n\nBridgestone MotoGP™ Preview – Round 1: Qatar, Losail \n\n\nPosted on March 19, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nThe 2014 MotoGP™ season is set to start this weekend amidst a huge buzz of excitement at Qatar’s Losail International Circuit, as Bridgestone embarks on its sixth season as Official Tyre Supplier to the world’s premier class of motorcycle road racing. \n\nTwenty-three riders will take part in MotoGP™ for the 2014 season, which will span eighteen races across thirteen countries. Adding to the anticipation for the 2014 season opener, Bridgestone’s new tyre classification system will make its debut in Qatar, with Green (Extra-soft), White (Soft), Black (Medium) and Red (Hard) coloured markings to be utilised throughout the season, making it easier for fans to see which tyre options the riders are using.\n\nThree factors make the Losail circuit one of the most slippery on the MotoGP™ calendar; cool track temperatures, the potential for wind-blown sand on the track, and high humidity levels after the sun sets. The sand on track can also be quite abrasive, so Bridgestone’s tyre allocation must ensure high levels of grip and warm-up performance, together with good durability. \n\nThe circuit features ten right-hand corners and just six left-handers, so asymmetric rear slicks with harder rubber on the right shoulders are provided here. Open-class riders at Qatar will be allocated the soft and medium compound asymmetric rear slicks, while Factory-class riders will be able to use the medium and hard asymmetric rears. Front slick tyre options for the season opener are the soft and hard compounds to ensure the riders can manage the changeable grip and abrasion levels that occur at this circuit. \n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“The 2014 season is Bridgestone’s sixth campaign as Official Tyre Supplier to MotoGP, and during this time Qatar has been the venue for the season opener. This weekend we will debut our new tyre colour marking system and I believe this will be a welcome change for fans, and will make the sport more attractive to the millions of people watching the action around the globe. After a busy pre-season, everyone at Bridgestone is excited to start the season, and I look forward to our range of 2014 specification tyres getting their first taste of competitive action this weekend. We’ve made a large effort to push the boundaries of motorcycle tyre development with our latest range of tyres, and it is thanks to the efforts of the riders and teams over the past couple months of testing that we arrive at the first race of Qatar fully prepared for the season ahead.\n\n“This weekend also sees the first round of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup take place, and Bridgestone is proud to be supporting this series which gives young Asian riders a great opportunity to take their first steps towards a MotoGP ride. I’d like to extend my best wishes for a safe and successful campaign to all the riders competing in this year’s MotoGP and Asia Talent Cup championships.”\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Division\n“Qatar is the only night race on the calendar and as a result, track temperatures are usually quite low. These low temperatures would suggest using softer rubber compounds, but often there is abrasive sand on the track surface which makes durability a priority. This combination of low temperature and high abrasion makes it very tough for tyres, especially on the right shoulders, as they have to be soft enough to provide grip in the low track temperature but hard enough to resist wear. The front tyres also need sufficient stability for the heavy braking points at this circuit.\n\n“Although the layout of the Losail circuit is only moderately severe on tyres, the combination of low temperatures, on-track sand and the elevated humidity levels that can occur mean that overall, this is quite a challenging circuit for tyre development. This weekend will be the first time our 2014 MotoGP tyres will be used in a race situation, and following a large development programme over the past few months I am confident that our 2014 specification slicks are well suited to the performance demands of both the factory and open-class machines.”\nAdvertisements",
        "review\nshinko\nsr877\ntayar motor\ntyre \n\nShinko Evo SR877 Motorcycle Tyre Review (UPDATED!) \n\n\nPosted on May 15, 2011May 20, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nShinko Evo SR877\nI have been riding my Lagenda 115ZR for about a month with Shinko Evo SR877 and the results is great.\nIn one sentence I can say; Shinko SR877 makes me drive faster because it grips and make stopping better.\nThis tyre has made me ride better since the tyre is grippy and this helps greatly in accelerating and stopping. There is one situation that I have encounter while I was riding my bike near the traffic light road that proven the grip of this tyre. A bus have stopped abruptly in front of me while I was following it closely to overtake it, at that time the space on the right can’t be used since there is a car there so, what I can do is to brake as hard as I can and hope the bike will stop. And yes, the bike stops well without any skidding and the danger is aborted. I think this is due to the medium-soft compound used for this Shinko Evo SR877. With that in mind, I don’t mean for you to do this while using Shinko tyre or any tyre that matter since that is the situation is not planned. Drive safely and always wear the helmet!  \n\nBefore installing this tyre, I have sent my bike to get the tyre changed to Shinko SR877, but the mechanic there inflate the tyre way above the recommended pressure that is 330kPa for the front tyre and 360kPa for the rear. What really dangerous by having to much tyre pressure is that  you will lose grip from the tyre especially on the wet road condition since overinflated tyre have very little tyre contact to the road. I have checked the manual instruction from the manual book that comes with the bike to check the proper pressure and found that it only need 200kPa for the front and 225kPa for the rear.\nLagenda 115ZR Recommended Tyre Pressure\nAnyway, after further riding with this tyre, I found out the best tyre pressure for the front is 220kPa and 230kPa for the rear. What I can feel with this tyre pressure is that it give a good balance for straight line acceleration and great cornering confidence. The feedback for the tyre are great and very controllable, added with superb handling of Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR, I personally this is the most balanced combination. Great for grip and great for durability. This is based on my preference of riding so, you can have difference opinion about this tyre pressure.\nAt the fuel stop after test riding the Shinko Evo SR877\nBraking\nSince the tyre is using medium soft compound, the braking is great. I can stop faster and can apply harder brakes without skidding. Anyway, every tyre has it limit, so, don’t try to brake very hard on this tyre over its limit.\nSpeed and stability\nI have been riding with this tyre for medium distance riding (110km) and the tyre really works well. The top speed of my bike is only at 105km/h and on that speed, the stability of the tyre are great. It maintains the straight line perfectly with minimal vibration (this can also be contributed from the correct tyre pressure as overinflated tyre will feel very bumpy). If motorcycle wheel are like car wheel, that can be balanced using a machine (balancing), I think it would be a much smoother ride on high speed. Cub prix bikes like the one by SCK Motor uses balancing to get better rolling balance of the wheels.\nHandling and cornering\nYamaha Lagenda 115ZR in my opinion is already a superb handling bike. So, by using this Shinko Evo SR877 tyre, the difference is minimal. The cornering are still great and the handling are still confidence as ever. The problem is I’m afraid I just might got to be overconfident.\nBeautiful tread pattern and rare since Shinko is not easy to find \nI’m not a professional rider that have the authority to tell whether this tyre is recommended for you or not. I’m just a biker that I think like most of MM readers. A biker that uses bike everyday to go to work or class, not a racer, but care for their ride. So, in my humble opinion this tyre by Shinko with the model name of Evo SR877 are as good as what I required.\nThis review are made based on my knowledge about tyres and bikes, so, if my opinion differs that you all, I hope that can be taken as a compromise. If you have anything to add or ask, just comment it on the comment from below.\nHappy riding!\nTo buy this tyre online, you can contact Yoshi Marketing here: [email protected]\nUPDATE (16/05/2011): Yoshi Marketing is giving away a set of tyre in the size of 70/90-17 and 80/90-17 in our MotoMalaya FB Fan Page. Check it out!\nFor more information, read my previous post about Shinko Evo SR877 here:\n1. Preview: Shinko EVO SR877 70/90-17 and 80/90-17 Motorcycle Tyre\n2.

The NAZA Blade TBR 2013 Edition, available in 650cc and 250cc variants, is based on the recently launched and widely popular NAZA Bikes Blade.\nTBR Asia was officially appointed Malaysian distributor for Two Brothers Racing, a company world renowned for their after-market exhaust system and high performance accessories for bikes, in October 2011. The NAZA Blade TBR 2013 Edition has been jointly-developed by Two Brothers Racing, USA, and NAZA Bikes, Malaysia, with racing performance and good aesthetics in mind.\nThe NAZA Blade TBR Edition is a stylish upgrade of the original model, which boasts a signature Two Brothers Racing high performance exhaust system that is lighter than the standard exhaust and increases the bike’s horsepower by 5%. NAZA Blade TBR 2013 Edition – 250R and 650R are priced at RM18,000.00 and RM 26,000.00, respectively.  \n\nWith custom designed decals that are poised to attract the attention of riders and enthusiasts alike, the NAZA Blade TBR Edition is set to impress. Bold livery with TBR logos, strong colours and edgy designs line the fairings to give the bike a truly unique Two Brothers Racing flavour. Other upgrades include a newly designed seat and an upgraded brake line; however this is only available for the NAZA Blade 650R TBR 2013 Edition.\nThe NAZA Blade range consisting of the naked bike, cruiser and sports bike of 250cc and sports bike of 650cc variants are great line-up from NAZA that caters to bikers who are seeking the 250 cc and 650cc models at affordable pricing.

Double front disc brakes come with the sports model.\n\nNAZA Bikes expects potential buyers and enthusiasts to benefit from the bundled enhancements, which come with 1-year limited warranty.   NAZA Blade is the product of a technology collaboration with Hysoung, a Korean motorcycle manufacturer, and when compared to other bikes in its category, it is the most affordable option on the market that also ensures quality is not compromised.\n“The NAZA Blade 250cc sports bike has been the best seller in the market since 2011 with more than 120 units sales monthly capturing almost 50% market share.  Thus far, NAZA Bikes has seen a total of 1000 units of NAZA Blade sold in 2012,” said Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, Joint Group Executive Chairman of NAZA Group of Companies.\n\n“The ASEAN motorcycle market in 2012 is expected to reach 13 million units. The 250cc to 800cc range has experienced the biggest unprecedented growth in practically every market – especially in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. It is a great opportunity for NAZA to become one of the key players in this range of bikes and we are taking every possible measure to ensure that we keep up with the trend,” continued Datuk Wira SM Faisal.\nNAZA Bikes has set a target for sales of the 250cc NAZA Blade at 2400 units to take on 60% of the market share.

The names of the first two bikes produced at NAZA Bikes, the ‘NAZA Symphony’ and the ‘NAZA Gemilang’ were personally chosen by Tun Abdullah in 2003.

This definitely adds more enjoyment for the riders. Power also has increased to 5% and that is a good number for this special edition bike.

One of the attending participant is Racing Boy. Here, they bring their show bike that is Yamaha 135LC equipped with many of their latest parts offering. The show bike looks great in matte black.\nI have write a short review about it and 11 more pictures after the jump\n\nThe front mods includes the usage of RB FG511 forged rim that cost about MYR2600+ along with 300mm gold brake disc plate (01-DS5291F-GL). Brake caliper is 4-piston version II series attached to the master pump with Goodrich brake hose.\nThe rear section got an upgrade in the swing arm with the installation of RB alloy swing arm(MYR380) in orange colour. RB chain tensioner (MYR120) also being used to complement the overall swing arm orange colour. If wonder what is the size of the sprocket, it is at 33T428  for the rear. The front sprocket is not visible for me to look at it.\nRear disc brake caliper is 2-piston (MYR200) from RB latest series to grip the 220mm orange disc plate (MYR180). Goodrich brake hose (MYR150) is again use to make sure the brake fluid can flow from the master pump to the brake caliper.\nGT Racing exhaust is equipped for the exhaust gases to exit from the combustion chamber.\nRB white monoshock suspension(MYR200) is being used to absorb the bump from the road. This suspension is much firmer than the stock suspension, so, it can perform better on cornering at high speed. Anyway, comfort are going to be sacrifice as it is not as absorbing as the stock suspension.\nSolcar security key system(MYR180) is used by this show bike for added security and also add more style.\nKOSO Uma Racing Speedometer (MYR400) are used for better information display for the rider and add nice function with the availability of the gear shift light on the top center of the meter. This meter also able to show many more function like, battery voltage, engine temperature and many more.\nThe overall orange/black look are further finished with the use of RB orange hand grip (MYR40) and RB gold brake lever (MYR100).\nIn my opinion, this bike modified bike by RB are nice and simple with all the important thing are modded beautifully. The orange/black colour combination fits well and looks very professional.\nAre you inspired now?\nPrice are estimation only, might be cheaper or more expensive.\nAdvertisements",

It is an icon and represents an important part of Ducati’s history, with over 250.000 Monsters around the world.\nThe new Monster 795 ABS is an exciting addition to the Monster line-up.\nMonster 795 ABS is an iconic motorcycle which offers user-friendliness and great control, increasing the riding pleasure and raising safety standards even further.\nDucati Monster 795 ABS (anti-lock braking system) provides a confidence-inspiring feel for the rider. Style, performance and safety come together in the Monster 795 ABS.\n Seat height\n\nThe riding position of the Monster 795 ABS has been specifically designed to put you firmly in control. The seat height is only 770mm (30.3in), making it easier for get both feet firmly planted on the ground, to enable the rider a steady position, footed and confident.\n\nCustomization:\n\nDressed in Ducati red, with a bright red Trellis frame, the Monster 795 ABS can be further personalized with the Monster Art program and Logomania.\n\nEngine:\n\n\nThe engine of the Monster 795 ABS is the legendary Desmodue, air cooled, L-Twin engine whose 87 hp gives it that unmistakable Ducati sound. Developed for an incredibly flexible power delivery, the 795 Desmodromic engine provides enough torque to exit the most challenging of corners.

The Monster 795 produces 87hp (64kW) @ 8250rpm and 57,9 lb-ft (8,0kgm) of torque @ 6250rpm\n\n\nBrembo brakes\n\n\nThe latest in Brembo braking hardware delivers exceptional braking power front and rear to improve rider safety. At the front, 320mm floating discs are gripped by four-piston, radially mounted calipers, while a 245mm floating rear disc works in combination with a twin-piston caliper.\n\n\nSachs rear suspension\n\n\nAt the rear, a Sachs monoshock unit with progressive linkage provide a wide spectrum of both spring and damping settings.\n\n\nLightweight 3-spoke wheels\n\n\nLightweight 3-spoke aluminum alloy wheels increase agility and reduce rider effort. The 3.50×17 front wheel wears a 120/60ZR tyre while the 4.50×17 rear wheel runs 160/60ZR rubber. By resisting the temptation to over-tyre the795 for styling’s sake, the end result is light, predictable and confidence inspiring steering qualities at a wide range of speeds with truly outstanding stability\n\n\nAluminum swingarm\n\n\nThe GP-style swingarm is chill-cast using aluminum in its most noble form. Gravity cast and heat treated, the component achieves the best mechanical characteristics as well as reduced final weight for improved handling.\n\n\nWeight:\n\nThe dry weight of 169kgs (373lb) has dramatic effects not only on maneuverability and ease of use, but also by contributing directly to increased performance, braking and acceleration, making life simpler in the crowded cities all over Asia.\n\nHandling:\n\nAn immensely strong but light tubular steel Trellis frame with aluminum rear sub-frame is the visual and structural backbone of the Monster. Delivering unparalleled rigidity with minimal mass, the chassis design is pure Ducati in its ingenuity and simplicity. A separate, all aluminum sub-frame saves weight and adds a pleasing continuity with the aluminum footrest hangers and matte finished swingarm.\n\nWheels:\n\nThe 17” wheels are in the 3 spoke style and produced in lightweight aluminum to keep the unsprung weight low and handling, braking and acceleration performances high. They roll on the 120/60 and 160/60 Pirelli Angel ST tyres. \n\nBrakes:\nFront brake:\n\n2 x 320mm discs, 4-piston radial caliper ABS as standard equipment;\n\nRear brake:\n\n245mm disc, 2-piston caliper ABS as standard equipment\n\nInstruments: \n\nDigital unit displaying: speedometer, rev counter, time, scheduled maintenance warning, oil temperature, trip fuel, lap time, warning light for low oil pressure, fuel level, fuel reserve, neutral, turn signals, overrev, immobilizer.

Premium helmets can be considered as the expensive helmets because the price tag is about 50 times higher than normal helmet (taking example of MS88 helmet at RM30 x 50 = RM1,500). Few things relate to this premium helmet quality. We can see the use of better material for the shell, more comfortable inner padding, outstanding paint quality and proven race track performance. This particular Arai SZ-Ram 4 Nakasuga is one of the beautiful livery that we can see in the SZ-Ram 4 lineup. It got that beautiful BIG eyes on the top of the visor and matching combination of red, white, yellow, black and silver colour all around the helmet.  \n\nThere is also the full face version of it based on the Arai Quantum J model. The livery are actually from MotoGP rider, Katsuyuki Nakasuga helmet. Katsuyuki Nakasuga was with Yamaha Austria Racing team in 2012 and the picture shows the livery with him wearing it for the race.\n\nA helmet design that lives on is hard to be replicate its level of beauty and level of desirability. It lives on and luckily still able to be bought even at this time. Arai SZ-Ram 4 is priced at RM1,900.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4-ARAI-SZ-RAM4-Nakasuga-61-62/dp/B00EVLXUCY, https://www.facebook.com/pages/Yamaha-Austria-Racing-Team/88338184820, http://global.rakuten.com/en/store/tsuuhanyarou/item/arai-nakasuga/?s-id=borderless_recommend_item_en\nAdvertisements",
        "1199 Superleggera\n1200cc\nducati\nPanigale 1199\ntechnical specification \n\n2014 Ducati 1199 Superleggera – limited to 500 units of this superlight Italian performance [UPDATED: Gallery and Tech Specs included] \n\n\nPosted on October 22, 2013October 23, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n2014 Ducati 1199 Superleggera\nCelebrating the Italian manufacturer’s commitment to performance technology and lightweight  construction, Ducati now proudly introduces its latest limited edition dream model, the highly exclusive  1199 Superleggera.  The new machine combines a precious cocktail of materials such as titanium, magnesium and carbon fibre to set the  highest power-to-weight ratio of any  production motorcycle in history.  Producing more than  200hp and weighing-in at just  155kg* (341.7lb*), Ducati  showcase their innovative  engineering and stylish approach to design, while affirming the maxim: “Authentic Italian Performance”. The Superleggera follows in the successful wheel tracks of previous iconic limited editions,  like the Desmosedici RR, with  its exclusivity  boldly underlined  with just 500 examples of this extraordinary machine being assembled at Ducati’s headquarters in Bologna, Italy, each with its own individual number  inscribed on the top clamp.  With its baseline  starting from  the  already impressive  1199 Panigale  ‘R’ specification, the Superleggera incorporates a  magnesium  monocoque  frame and forged Marchesini magnesium wheels  before taking lightweight to the extreme with  a carbon fibre rear sub-frame and bodywork, lithium-ion battery (LIB) and full titanium exhaust system  with stainless steel headers.  Many of the bolts and fasteners on both engine and chassis are also fashioned in titanium.    Additional  enhancements include lightweight Öhlins FL916  front suspension with fully-machined fork bottoms and an Öhlins TTX36 rear suspension with titanium spring. The Superleggera’s Brembo M50 Monobloc brakes inherit a racing-style  MCS  19-21  front  master cylinder  and remote adjuster  and its final drive gets upgraded with  a lightweight  Ergal  rear sprocket, and  World Superbike-spec  520  drive chain.  Finer attention to detail is hidden in the shape of the carbon fibre body work, which is moulded with the same high-penetration form normally provided by the “R” spec add-on aero-kit.\nThe Superquadro engine, which sports titanium con-rods and inlet valves, now  adds titanium exhaust valves,  and, for the first time on a Ducati street engine,  special  two-ring pistons. These pistons, usually found on racing Superbikes, use short skirts and only two rings (compression and oil), allowing them to dramatically reduce mass and friction. To further increase performance, the combustion chamber is also modified to Superbike specs by a new piston crown that  increases compression ratio. Added to this is  a super-lightened  crankshaft,  precision balanced  using  dense tungsten inserts.  The  enhancements result in an incredible output of more than 200hp as it rolls out of Ducati’s Borgo Panigale factory in Bologna, Italy. The Superleggera’s outstanding power-to-weight ratio can be enhanced even further with the supplied track-only Race Kit**. The kit, which increases power by 5hp and reduces weight by  2.5kg  (5.5  lb),  consists of a titanium Akrapovič  race exhaust system including silencers and 2-in-1 collector,  high racing windscreen, dedicated dust cover, front and rear paddock  stands,  machined mirror fill-caps,  and removal kits for the registration plate holder, and sidestand.\nThe model’s electronics are also upgraded thanks to the new system for managing front-wheel lift Ducati  Wheelie Control (DWC)  which is  based on an Inertial Platform. This DWC system, along with Ducati  Traction Control (DTC) and Engine Brake Control (EBC), is optimized with new automatic calibration of rear-tyre size and final transmission ratio. The Ducati Data Analysis+ (DDA+) system adds an additional sensor  and software channel to record and display vehicle lean angles. This impressive array of included  electronics is  completed by a set of race-derived, handlebar mounted control buttons to enable rapid, on-track adjustments to the levels of the pre-selected channels of DTS, DWC, or EBC. Appropriate to its highly exclusive status as one of the most exotic and desirable Ducatis of all time, the  1199 Superleggera is exquisitely dressed  in  Ducati  Corse  Red  base livery, complemented with  forged and  machined magnesium wheels.\n*Dry weight **Track use only\n1199 Superleggera features\nChassis\n\n  Magnesium monocoque\n  Magnesium wheels\n  Carbon-fibre rear sub-frame\n  Öhlins FL916 front suspension\n  Öhlins TTX36 rear suspension with titanium spring\n  Single-sided swingarm with 4-way adjustable pivot\n  Brembo MCS 19-21 front master cylinder\n  Carbon fibre bodywork\n  Individual number engraved on the top clamp\n\nEngine\n\n  Superquadro: L-twin cylinder, 4 titanium valves per cylinder, Desmodromic, liquid cooled\n  World Superbike-style pistons with 2 rings and crown modified for an increased compression ratio\n  Lightweight crankshaft with tungsten balance inserts\n  Titanium connecting rods\n  Full titanium exhaust system\n\nElectronics\n\n  Ducati Traction Control with automatic tyre size recalibration (DTC)\n  Ducati Wheelie Control (DWC)\n  Dedicated handlebar buttons for on-track adjustment of DTC, DWC or EBC\n  Ducati Data Analyser+ with lean sensor (DDA+)\n  Ducati Quick Shifter (DQS)\n  Engine Brake Control (EBC)\n  Riding Modes\n  Ride-by-Wire\n  Full LED lighting\n  Full TFT instrumentation\n  Lithium-ion battery (LIB)\n\nRace kit\n\n  Dust cover\n  Front and rear paddock stands\n  License plate holder removal kit\n  High racing windscreen\n  Sidestand removal kit\n  Machined mirror fill-caps\n  Full race exhaust system by Akrapovič.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Ducati 1199 Superleggera Technical Specifications:\n\nAdvertisements",
        "1000cc\nf4\nF4 R\nmv agusta \n\nThe MV Agusta F4 R Corsa Corta Has Arrived \n\n\nPosted on October 6, 2011October 6, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nMV Agusta F4 R Corsa Corta\nThe new MV Agusta F4 R 2012 has been designed to offer clients a superbike with extreme performance. The key feature of the F4 R is, in fact, the new “Corsa Corta” engine capable of extraordinary performance and already employed on the F4 RR, the top of the MV Agusta superbike range.\nThe new 4 cylinder inline with radial valves is the pulsing heart of the MV Agusta F4 R. The thermodynamics have been completely redesigned, starting from the new low inertia crankshaft which makes it possible to use a super over-square bore and stroke ratio. In this way, the MV F4 R is capable of reaching rpm worthy of a pure racing motorcycle. The engine capacity of 998cc has been obtained by using a bore of 79 mm and a stroke of only 50.9 mm. In this way  it is possible to achieve an extremely high 13700 rpm rev limit while at the same time lowering the linear velocity of the piston from 24.9 m/s to 23 m/s improving reliability.  \nIn order to reach the stratospheric homologated power of 195.2 hp (against the 201 hp of the super powerful RR version) at 13000 rpm, every component was thoroughly engineered. The cylinder head uses completely new ports and employs larger valves both on the inlet and exhaust. For the first time on a mass production motorcycle, all the valves are made of titanium, allowing the weight of these to be reduced regardless of the increase in diameter (from 28.6 to 31.8 mm for exhaust and from 24.6 to 26 mm for the exhaust). The engine “breathes” in a more efficient way thanks to the use of a new 4-2-1-4 primary section of the exhaust system. In addition to assuring optimized engine efficiency, this new exhaust system offers an absolutely unique sound that is even more captivating then in previous versions. The fuel system employs 4 throttle bodies with a 49mm diameter and double fuel injectors per cylinder coupled with the unique MV Agusta TSS (Torque Shift System) variable intake runners.\nThe new engine of the MV Agusta F4 R was designed with the scope of reducing the internal friction to a minimum: the transmission’s new primary gear ratio allowed a drastic reduction in rpm of both generator and water pump, thereby limiting the absorbed power. This extraordinary engine utilizes the unique features that have become trademarks to MV Agusta including a removable 6-speed gearbox and a slipper clutch which assures precise control even during the most violent braking manoeuvres. The electronic management system has been continuously evolved, the traction control employs a new algorithm and maintains the two rider selectable engine maps, all of which are now comfortably adjustable  by means of the new control situated on the left handlebar.\nThe new MV Agusta F4 R remains, naturally, faithful to the structural tradition of mixing a steel tubular trellis to cast aluminium side-plates. The steering head angle is set at 23.5°, perfect for providing control, manoeuvrability, and stability. Also confirmed is the exceptional rear single-sided swingarm, a real engineering jewel that weighs only 5 kg, a record for this type of element.\nThe MV F4 R retains its notoriety for excellence in the area of suspension. The Marzocchi upside down forks, with 50 mm stanchions, is derived directly from the units used in competition, they are adjustable in spring preload as well as the hydraulic extension and compression. The forged ultra-light front axle carrier is also especially made for the F4 R and uses a rapid release system for the wheel, reminiscent of the first F4, the legendary Serie Oro that adopted this same technical solution. The rear Sachs shock absorber is equipped with a nitrogen reservoir (separated and integrated within the body) and is adjustable in extension, compression and spring preload. The shock linkage allows the ride height to be adjusted depending on the desired setup, rider preferences to further tune the bike to specific riding conditions and tracks.\nThe Brembo front brake system, with “monoblock” radial calipers is, without a doubt, the best system for motorcycles currently on the market, coupled to a master cylinder with integrated reservoir made specifically to demanding MV specifications.\nThe 320 mm diameter floating double front discs use an ultra light flange which are 5 mm thick to reduce inertia forces and non suspended masses. The rear brake system is made exclusively for MV with a stainless steel 220 mm diameter disc and 4 piston calliper.\nThe new F4 R, already on sale at official dealers, is available in 2 colours: red/grey and white/medium grey, at a price of 18800 € including tax in Italy (Every country could have a price variation due to local import duties and taxes).\nvia: www.mvagusta.com\nAdvertisements",

The new Suzuki GSX-S lineup carries the spirit of the Suzuki GSX-R to the street, with shared technology and components packaged into a chassis designed specifically for street riding comfort.\nHowever, the Suzuki GSX-S1000 and Suzuki GSX-S1000F aren’t just stripped down versions of the supersport Suzuki GSX-R1000, they have been specifically redeveloped for the street. The difference between the Suzuki GSX-S1000 and the Suzuki GSX-S1000F is that the former is a naked model while the latter is faired.  \n2015 Suzuki GSX-S1000F\nThe Suzuki GSX-S series is powered by a street-tuned version of the four-stroke, liquid-cooled, DOHC, 999cc, inline-four engine that became a legend in the Suzuki GSX-R1000. The newly honed engine delivers smooth throttle response and immediate, controlled acceleration, so you experience adrenaline rushing performance. Focused on making big power through the low and mid-range, this engine also uses cams optimized to deliver street-dominating power.\nCore Features\nThree mode traction control system:\nSuzuki’s advanced traction control system lets the rider control the throttle with more confidence in diverse conditions, so it makes sports riding more enjoyable and less tiring. The system checks the front and rear wheel speeds, throttle position sensor, crank position sensor, and the gear position sensor 250 times a second. Traction control has 3 modes. Mode 1 is lowest sensitivity level most suitable for skilled riders or in conditions that have good road surface grip (sport riding on good, smooth roads). Mode 2 is next sensitivity level suitable for most riders and road conditions (most riding conditions, urban riding). Mode 3 is highest sensitivity level suitable for road conditions where the grip may be limited (wet or cold surfaces). The rider can set the system to any of three modes or turn it off.\nAntilock braking system (ABS):\nThe ABS system helps the rider stay in control. It monitors wheel speeds 50 times per wheel rotation and matches stopping power to the available traction. The ABS control unit has a compact, lightweight design that helps make the bike nimble.\n43mm KYB inverted front forks:\nNewly specified 43mm KYB inverted front forks give a ride that is sporty yet plush. They have fully adjustable damping, rebound, compression and spring preload.\nHigh performance braking:\nThe Suzuki GSX-S series has the same top-of-the-line radial-mount Brembo monobloc calipers as the current Suzuki GSX-R1000. The calipers each have four opposed 32mm pistons acting on a 310mm floating-mount disc for strong stopping power.\nNaked aggression in an all-new form:\nThe Suzuki GSX-S series is designed to look wild, rugged, and aggressive. The bike’s overall shape evokes images of a crouching beast, with LED position lights shaped to represent its fangs. And a combination of black and body coloured parts emphasize the bike’s assertive, sporty attitude.\nA comprehensive instrument cluster:\nA lightweight, brightness adjustable LCD readouts including: speedometer, tachometer, odometer, dual trip meters, gear position, coolant and ambient temperatures, riding range, average fuel consumption, instantaneous fuel consumption, traction control, and a clock. The display is flanked by LED indicators for the turn signals, high beam, malfunction, ABS, traction control, coolant temperature and oil pressure.\nThe Suzuki GSX-S series comes with a choice of red, blue & gray colours. Basic Sales Price is an attractive RM68,400 for the Suzuki GSX-S1000 ABS and RM74,400 for the Suzuki GSX-S1000F ABS (both prices excluding GST).\nTo find a Suzuki Authorized Dealer closest to you or to inquire further details, kindly contact Suzuki Assemblers Malaysia Sdn Bhd at 04-3977 453 (Sales & Marketing Division) or 04-3977 091 (Spare Parts Division) or visit www.suzuki.com.my.\nAdvertisements",

It is confirmed that it is being launched on 18th March. It is also confirmed that we will get the 5-speed manual clutch with Mikuni BS25 carburetor (the same with 2011 Jupiter MX in Indonesia). The power figures that has been upped to 12.3hp and 12Nm of torque from the auto clutch version at only 11.97hp (12hp as stated in the paper) and 11.79Nm of torque (the auto clutch also gets the Mikuni BS25 carburetor). The 2010 Yamaha 135LC only comes with Mikuni VN22 carburetor that provides 11.32hp of power and 11.65Nm of torque.\nThe bike is also confirmed to features the wider wheels, two-piston caliper for the front brake and rear disc brake (single-piston caliper, I think). The tyre that is equipped for 2011 Jupiter MX in Indonesia is from IRC with the size of 70/90-17 x 2.15 38P for the front and 100/70-17 x 2.50 44P for the rear wheel. That is WIDE! In Malaysia, I think, the tyre might be supplied by Vee Rubber which is the OEM tyre manufacturer for HLYM bikes.\n4 more high resolution and slow loading images for you to read after the jump\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Furthermore, the Wave Dash R is available in a luminous orange with Respol Honda’s trademark styling,” said Mr Satoshi Okada, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda.\nHe said the new Wave Dash is built on four cornerstones – Dashing, Advanced Style, Sporty and High-Performance – and offers an adrenaline-filled ride while maintaining excellent fuel economy, affordability, reliability and durability.\nMore importantly, both the Wave Dash R and S feature tubeless tyres – a first for Honda Cubs – for improved safety.\n“Another attraction is the inclusion of double-disk brakes for the Wave Dash R, which is a first for the 110 cc segment,” Mr Okada said.  \nWinning Performance\nBoth the Wave Dash R and S are powered by an advanced 4-stroke 110cc engine that produces a maximum horsepower of 6.18kW (8.39PS) at 7,500 rpm and a maximum torque of 8.15 Nm (0.83kgf.m) at 5,500rpm, while maintaining Honda’s excellent fuel-efficiency standards.\nMoreover, the new Wave Dash’ gearing ratios offer a smooth performance and excellent ride characteristics. The engine is also compliant with EURO 2 standards for low CO2 emissions.\n \nClass-leading Safety Standards\nSafety isn’t compromised either in the new Wave Dash as both feature 17-inch durable tubeless tyres. The tubeless tyres prevent the sudden dissipation of air in the unfortunate event of a tyre puncture, which in turn allows the rider to safely bring the bike to a stop.\nAdditionally, the new Wave Dash R is equipped with double disc brakes which offer superior braking performance during emergencies or other unfavourable conditions. The new Wave Dash S is equipped with a single disc brake.\nMotorsport-inspired Styling\nBoth the Wave Dash R and S feature motorsport-inspired aesthetics to truly reflect the exciting and dynamic ride the bikes have to offer. The new Wave Dash features a new stylish white halogen headlight that makes the bike hard to miss while on the move or at a standstill.\nIn addition, a distinctive crystal eyeline winker design and bright illuminated tail light with multi-reflectors enhance the visibility of the new Wave Dash for trailing motorists while raising the bike’s sporty presence on the street.\nThe sporty design also extends to a wide-angled multi-function speedometer with a clear display, 3D leg shields which improves aerodynamics and protects the rider from road debris, sporty exhaust muffler, exhaust heat shield and five-spoke sport rims.\nThe Wave Dash R and S are available in Vivacity Red, Pearl Magellanic Black, Luminous Orange and Force Silver Metallic while the Repsol Honda-inspired Luminous Orange is exclusively available for the Wave Dash R.

RR stands for ‘Race Replica’ or is it ‘Race Ready’?. At that time, Honda dominated the Motorcycle Grand Prix by winning almost every races by the rider, Mick Doohan, with his NSR500 bike. NSR are nomenclature used by Honda for its 2-stroke bike. This means that the 90’s are the heaven of 2-strokes bike along with the recognition in the racing world. But now, there are fewer and fewer 2-stroke bikes involve in racing and much more fewer are going to be produced. Luckily, Aprilia still holding on to produce the RS125.\nEurope Union has stopped the import and production of 2-stroke bike above 50cc in 2003. That leaves a lot of biker in Greece, UK and many more not to enjoy the need for speed of these great bikes.\nIn Malaysia, this bike is still available in used condition. As pictured above, I have found one in immaculate condition on mudah.my at RM5500 which is reasonably priced, but could be cheaper.\nWhile reading on the net about this bike, I have stumbled upon this blog which blogs about NSR150RR.

        "250cc\n250RR Mono\n250SL\nKawasaki\nZ250SL \n\n2014 Kawasaki Z250SL Officially Launched in Indonesia – the supernaked of RR Mono – Rp. 38,9 million (RM10,978) \n\n\nPosted on May 1, 2014May 2, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe family of Kawasaki Z series has become bigger with the introduction of this Z250SL in Indonesia for the world premiere. Few months ago, we just got to know the presence of the Kawasaki RR Mono or 250SL as the full-fairing supersports which is also unveiled in Indonesia. This single-cylinder bike is going to be marketed with its brother, Z250 which is 2-cylinder bike. Now, there are more choices for customer to choose in the 250cc category.\n\nZ250SL comes with the same chassis as the RR Mono which is the beautiful Trellis-like frame (in the tech specs it is called diamond type, but I’ll call it Trellis anyway). Compared to the supersports RR Mono, the frame are now much more visible to the eyes as the bike is naked type that shows the muscle and the chassis under it. At 148 kg (Non-ABS model), the Z250SL is almost 20 kg lighter than the Z250. The light weight is a significant factor in the bike’s nimble handling.  \n\nThe exposure of the Trellis frame gives it a little bit of Italian kind of feel since this kind of frame is favourite for Italian manufacturers especially Ducati. The frame are exposed nicely with the metal grey colour that separates it from the black engine casing.\n\nThe 4-stroke engine as we already know from the RR Mono introduction, comes from KLX250. The engine provides 28hp maximum power at 9,700RPM with 22.6Nm from 8,200RPM.\n\nCompared to the 2-cylinder Ninja 250, this Z250SL engine is only 4hp less than the 32hp engine of the Ninja. Z250SL got the usual DOHC 4-valve liquid-cooled engine for that performance needs.\n\nRear suspension are handled with the monoshock Uni-Trak suspension for better handling of the bike in slow or fast riding condition. Similar technology are also used by Honda with the name Pro-Link.\n\nAll-digital instrument panel gives the cockpit a modern, sporty look. Its easy-to-read features include a digital bar-graph tachometer, digital speedometer, odometer, dual trip meters, clock, and fuel gauge. Amber backlighting contributes to the Z image and facilitates instrument visibility at night.\n\nThe handlebar are flat and wide for that nimble handling. You can flick it easily in traffic to change direction. The handlebar are also easy to manage for everyday riding if compared to the supersports 250SL.\n\nLike other models in the Z Series, the Z250SL’s aggressive styling hints at its sporty potential. Following a “slim and sexy” design theme, the contrast between its flared and waisted sections gives the bike a dynamic, hourglass figure. Its parts were all designed to be as compact as possible, and are mounted as closely as possible to the frame to further reinforce the bike’s slim design as well as adding to high quality looks.\n\nFront and rear disc brakes offer impressive stopping performance. Petal disc design adds to the sporty Kawasaki looks.\n\nFor additional rider reassurance, an ABS model is also available. Its high-spec system was designed specially for motorcycles and features the world’s smallest ABS unit. Independent front/rear activation maximises rider control for aggressive, sporty riding.\n\nKawasaki Z250SL is one fierce contender in naked 250cc category as it got that slim body and chassis, good looks, great 1-cylinder engine from KLX250 and lower price than the Z250, Ninja 250 and even the RR Mono. With all that great specs and interesting features, we wonder whether this will come to Malaysia or not. In my humble opinion (and close observation of Kawasaki strategy in Malaysia), I think it should arrive here soon.\n2014 Kawasaki Z250SL price is Rp 38,9 million (RM10,978 direct conversion bro).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2014 Kawasaki Z250SL Tech Specs\n\n\nEngine type:      Liquid-cooled, 4-stroke 1 Cylinder DOHC\n\n\nDisplacement :    249 cm³\n\n\nBore x stroke :    72.0 x 61.2 mm\n\n\nCompression ratio:     11.3:1\n\n\nValve/Induction system:    DOHC, 4 valves\n\n\nFuel system     Fuel injection: ø38 mm x 1\n\n\nIgnition :  Keihin, Transistorized Ignition\n\n\nElectric: Starting\n\n\nLubrication : Forced lubrication, wet sump\n\n\nMaximum power 20.6 kW / 9,700 rpm\n\n\nMaximum torque 22,6 N·m { kgf·m} / 8,200 rpm\nSS 400m : 15,5 s\n\n\nSS 200m : 9,7 s\n\n\nMax Speed : 153 km/h\n\n\nTransmission 6-speed, return\n\n\nFinal Drive Sealed chain\n\n\nPrimary reduction ratio 2.800 (84/30)\n\n\nGear ratios: 1st 3.000 (393/11)\n\n\nGear ratios: 2nd 1.933 (29/159)\n\n\nGear ratios: 3rd 1.444 (31/22)\n\n\nGear ratios: 4th 1.217 (28/23)\n\n\nGear ratios: 5th 1.045 (23/22)\n\n\nGear ratios: 6th 0.923 (24/26)\n\n\nFinal reduction ratio 3.000 (42/14)\n\n\nClutch : Wet multi-disc, manual\n\n\nFrame type Tube diamond\n\n\nRake/Trail 24° / 90 mm\n\n\nWheel travel, front 110 mm\n\n\nWheel travel, rear 116 mm\n\n\nTyre, front 100/80-17 M/C (52S)\n\n\nTyre, rear 130/70-17 M/C (62S)\n\n\nSteering angle, left / right 36° / 36°\n\n\nSuspension, front  telescopic fork\n\n\nSuspension, rear Bottom-Link Uni-Trak swing arm\n\n\nBrakes, front Single 263 mm petal disc.

        "Dainese\nJacket\nRiding Gear \n\nDainese Champions – Valentino Rossi, Guy Martin, Andrea Iannone And Nicky Hayden – Present The 2014 Collection Of Jackets Featuring Gore-Tex® Membranes \n\n\nPosted on March 27, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nDiscover the new Dainese GORE-TEX® jackets with Valentino Rossi, Guy Martin, Andrea Iannone and Nicky Hayden. With their claim of “I’m a racer..and I wanna be”, the four Dainese riders invite you to discover the features of the GORE-TEX® jackets from the 2014 collection.\nThe CARVE MASTER GORE-TEX® jacket has an aggressive look and was designed for those who use their bikes for sports and medium range touring, and for whom ergonomics, comfort and functionality are important. The sporting nature of the jacket is underlined by leather covered thermoplastic pads on the shoulders and by the design that resembles race suit tops.\nMade entirely from Mugello elasticised fabric and with plenty of scope for adjustment, the Carve Master jacket provides exceptional mobility. Reflective inserts are positioned in key locations to ensure high visibility and improved safety on the road.   \n\nThe RIDDER GORE-TEX® jacket was designed for motorcyclists looking for a technical garment to use on long trips, but that will also protect from the rain and cold temperatures. RIDDER has been designed to offer excellent comfort; it has a laminated GORE-TEX® membrane, is waterproof and breathable and has a removable thermal lining.\nAt the same time it is among the lightest jackets in the category so it does not over strain the body and restrict movement. It also features a padded removable collar, ventilation on the chest and back, many fit adjustments, the possibility of including the Chest Protector and reflective inserts make this jacket an inseparable travelling companion.\n\nFor the City market, Dainese has the CONCORDE GORE-TEX® jacket, which with its laminated GORE-TEX® membrane and soft outer fabric, facilitate quick drying and reduce wind-chill. Thanks to exceptional soft Pro-Shape guards made from an innovative material that adapts perfectly to the body and offers a ratio of impact energy absorption to weight, far in excess of our competitors.\nThis hooded jacket offers a similar fit to non-technical garments, while maintaining contained volume near the protectors. Attention to detail includes the reflective inserts and the black metal opaque logo, which perfectly set off the look of this jacket.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 15 Motegi: Dovizioso destroys Motegi lap record to take pole position in Japan \n\n\nPosted on October 12, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nDucati Team’s Andrea Dovizioso continued the scintillating pace he showed yesterday at Motegi to smash the existing circuit lap record by four-tenths of a second and claim pole position for tomorrow’s Japanese Grand Prix.\nIn an incredibly competitive Qualifying Practice 2 session where the top ten riders set personal best lap times within half a second of each other, Dovizioso put together the perfect lap to set a time of 1’44.502 to finish 0.055 seconds ahead of Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi, who qualified in second place. Third quickest in qualifying was Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa, the Repsol Honda rider setting a personal best lap time of 1’44.755. Both Rossi and Pedrosa set their quickest lap using the combination of the soft compound rear and medium compound front slicks, while Dovizioso used the extra-soft rear and medium compound front slicks on his way to pole position. Today’s Qualifying Practice 2 was run at a fierce pace with the top eight ranked riders in the session setting personal best lap times under the existing Circuit Best Lap time at Motegi.\nWarmer conditions were present today at Motegi resulting in higher track temperatures than yesterday, with a peak recording of 40°C in the afternoon Free Practice 4 session. All three rear slick options were utilised today by the riders and although all the compound selections are viable race options, today’s feedback indicates that the extra-soft compound rear slick for the Open-class riders, and the soft compound rear slick for the Ducati, Honda and Yamaha riders will be the most popular race tyres. Front tyre choice for almost the entire grid for tomorrow’s race will be the medium compound front slick due to its good braking character and consistent performance.   \nSlightly cooler temperatures are forecast for tomorrow’s twenty-four lap Japanese Grand Prix which will start at 1400 local time (GMT +9).\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“We had another full day of fine conditions today which meant that the riders were able to spend a lot of time working out their race tyre choice, while also improving upon their pace from yesterday. The soft compound rear slick is likely to be the most popular choice tomorrow as it offers the most consistent performance over race distance for the Ducati, Honda, Yamaha and also some Open-class riders this weekend. Just like yesterday, the medium compound front slick was preferred by the majority of the riders, and even though temperatures are expected to be cooler tomorrow, I believe this will be by far the most popular race choice. So far this weekend our tyre allocation has performed excellently, with the top eight riders in QP2 lapping under the existing lap record, and race record pace being shown in the practice sessions. These are encouraging signs that we will have an exciting Japanese Grand Prix tomorrow.”\nJapanese MotoGP™ QP2 times – Riders that qualified from QP1 shaded in grey\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nQualifying Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n1’44.502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n1’44.557\n\n\n0.055\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n1’44.755\n\n\n0.253\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n1’44.775\n\n\n0.273\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n1’44.784\n\n\n0.282\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n1’44.854\n\n\n0.352\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n1’44.867\n\n\n0.365\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n1’44.898\n\n\n0.396\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nStefan BRADL\n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n\n\n1’45.005\n\n\n0.503\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n1’45.044\n\n\n0.542\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n1’45.315\n\n\n0.813\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n1’45.677\n\n\n1.175\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

So, here it is.This gear set has a better gear ratio for the great power that comes with the modified 125Z engine. Usually, this gear set is used in drag racing with the front and rear sprocket modified to have higher ratio for better pickup. You can also use this one for track racing with the front sprocket set to 15T and rear 37T. This is a good ratio to be used with this gear set.Also, SKF high speed bearing is a good addition to be used with this item for better power delivery at high RPM.\n\nItem are available for sale here\nRelated post:IKK Racing Engine Gear Set for Yamaha 125Z\nAdvertisements",
        "125z\n250cc\n400cc\nX-Max 125\nX-Max 250\nX-Max 400 \n\n2014 Yamaha X-Max 125, 250 and 400 in Europe – the smaller brother of T-Max – starts from £3,999 (RM21,734.90) \n\n\nPosted on July 15, 2014July 15, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha T-Max 530 is a maxi-scooter most riders knows on their head. Some are thinking what if the design of the T-Max trickle down to a smaller capacity scooter. You have your question answered with this Yamaha X-Max 125  that packs the iconic maxi-scooter look of the T-Max.\nThe scooter is equipped with 124cc of 1-cylinder liquid-cooled 4-stroke SOHC engine that can provide healthy power at 10.55kW (14.15hp) at 9,000RPM and torque at 11.94Nm at 6,750RPM. The fuel delivery system is fuel-injection so fuel efficiency are now taken care of.\nSince this is a scooter as we know it, it features automatic transmission that is carried out by V-Belt drive.\nNot just that, the X-Max 125 also features 267mm front disc brake with 2-piston caliper and at the rear 240mm disc brake with 1-caliper system (or 245mm for ABS version).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tyre size is quite unusual here as it is 15-inch at the front and smaller 14-inch at the rear. But in Malaysia, I think, this will be modified to fit 17-inch tyre for easier maintainance and also for better looks (only if it is going to be available here).\nOne of the interesting features of this bike is actually about the size of the fuel tank at 13.2 liter! That is super large for a bike with this 125cc category. So far, the biggest tank I have ever know is the Yamaha 125Z 2-stroke bike at 11 liter, but this X-Max 125 really breaks new ground with that tank capacity. I think, the tank can last you for a week riding on and off to work at 30km/day.\n2014 Yamaha X-MAX 250 ABS EU Matt Grey\nAnother variant is the Yamaha X-Max 250 with of course bigger engine at 249cc. It is 1-cylinder liquid-cooled 4-stroke SOHC. The power is rated at 15kW (20.12hp) at 7,500RPM and torque at 21Nm at 6,000RPM. Other than that, it features the same braking system setup like the X-Max 125. One highlight here is about the meter that are fully digital that looks modern and can give lots of information to the rider.\n2014 Yamaha X-MAX 400 MOMODESIGN Power Black\nYamaha X-Max 400 is also here with an extra special design name Yamaha X-Max Momo Design. Momo Design is a design house based in Italy. It carries the 1-cylinder liquid-cooled 4-stroke 395cc engine with 23.18kW (31.08hp) at 7,500RPM and torque 33.88Nm at 6,000RPM  for strong acceleration and higher crusing speed.\nThe underseat storage is large as it can carry 2 full-face helmets. The seat are duo tone that makes it different that the two models above.\nBraking are now given more power with front dual 267mm floating disc brake with dual 2-piston caliper to ensure the maximum safety of the rider. You can even opt for ABS version.\nWill this makes it to Malaysia? I don’t know about that. Just hopes so.\nPrice for the X-Max 125 starts from £3,999 (RM21,734.90).\n2014 Yamaha X-Max 125 Technical Specification:\n\nEngine\n\n\n\n\n\nEngine type\n\n\nSingle cylinder, liquid-cooled, 4-stroke, SOHC\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement\n\n\n124cc\n\n\n\n\nBore x stroke\n\n\n52 mm x 58.6 mm\n\n\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\n\n11.2 : 1\n\n\n\n\nMaximum power\n\n\n10.55 kW @ 9,000 rpm\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Torque\n\n\n11.94 Nm @ 6,750 rpm\n\n\n\n\nLubrication system\n\n\nWet sump\n\n\n\n\nFuel system\n\n\nElectronic Fuel Injection\n\n\n\n\nIgnition system\n\n\nTCI\n\n\n\n\nStarter system\n\n\nElectric\n\n\n\n\nTransmission system\n\n\nV-Belt Automatic\n\n\n\n\n\nChassis\n\n\n\n\n\nFront suspension system\n\n\nTelescopic fork\n\n\n\n\nFront travel\n\n\n110 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear suspension system\n\n\nUnit Swing\n\n\n\n\nRear Travel\n\n\n84 mm\n\n\n\n\nFront brake\n\n\nSingle Disc, Ø 267 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear brake\n\n\nSingle Disc, Ø 240 mm / Ø 245 mm (ABS)\n\n\n\n\nFront tyre\n\n\n120/70-15\n\n\n\n\nRear tyre\n\n\n140/70-14\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall length\n\n\n2,160 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall width\n\n\n790 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall height\n\n\n1,385 mm\n\n\n\n\nSeat height\n\n\n792 mm\n\n\n\n\nWheelbase\n\n\n1,525 mm\n\n\n\n\nMinimum ground clearance\n\n\n125 mm\n\n\n\n\nWet Weight\n\n\n169 kg /ABS173 kg\n\n\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n\n\n13.2 litres\n\n\n\n\n \n\n2014 Yamaha X-Max 250 Technical Specification:\nEngine\n\n\n\n\n\nEngine type\n\n\nSingle cylinder, liquid-cooled, 4-stroke, SOHC\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement\n\n\n249cc\n\n\n\n\nBore x stroke\n\n\n69.0 mm x 66.8 mm\n\n\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\n\n10 : 1\n\n\n\n\nMaximum power\n\n\n15 kW @ 7,500 rpm\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Torque\n\n\n21 Nm @ 6,000 rpm\n\n\n\n\nLubrication system\n\n\nWet sump\n\n\n\n\nFuel system\n\n\nElectronic Fuel Injection\n\n\n\n\nIgnition system\n\n\nTCI\n\n\n\n\nStarter system\n\n\nElectric\n\n\n\n\nTransmission system\n\n\nV-Belt Automatic\n\n\n\n\n\nChassis\n\n\n\n\n\nFront suspension system\n\n\nTelescopic fork\n\n\n\n\nFront travel\n\n\n110 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear suspension system\n\n\nUnit Swing\n\n\n\n\nRear Travel\n\n\n84 mm\n\n\n\n\nFront brake\n\n\nSingle Disc, Ø 267 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear brake\n\n\nSingle Disc, Ø 240 mm / Ø 245 mm (ABS)\n\n\n\n\nFront tyre\n\n\n120/70-15\n\n\n\n\nRear tyre\n\n\n140/70-14\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall length\n\n\n2,160 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall width\n\n\n790 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall height\n\n\n1,385 mm\n\n\n\n\nSeat height\n\n\n785 mm\n\n\n\n\nWheelbase\n\n\n1,545 mm\n\n\n\n\nMinimum ground clearance\n\n\n125 mm\n\n\n\n\nWet Weight\n\n\n178 kg /ABS182 kg\n\n\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n\n\n13.2 litres\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Yamaha X-Max 400 Momo Design Technical Specification\n\nEngine\n\n\n\n\n\nEngine type\n\n\nSingle cylinder, liquid-cooled, 4-stroke, DOHC\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement\n\n\n395cc\n\n\n\n\nBore x stroke\n\n\n83.0 mm x 73.0 mm\n\n\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\n\n10.6 ± 0.4 : 1\n\n\n\n\nMaximum power\n\n\n23.18 kW @ 7,500 rpm\n\n\n\n\nMaximum Torque\n\n\n33.88 Nm @ 6,000 rpm\n\n\n\n\nLubrication system\n\n\nWet sump\n\n\n\n\nFuel system\n\n\nFuel Injection\n\n\n\n\nIgnition system\n\n\nECU\n\n\n\n\nStarter system\n\n\nElectric\n\n\n\n\nTransmission system\n\n\nV-Belt Automatic\n\n\n\n\n\nChassis\n\n\n\n\n\nFront suspension system\n\n\nTelescopic fork\n\n\n\n\nFront travel\n\n\n110 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear suspension system\n\n\nUnit Swing\n\n\n\n\nRear Travel\n\n\n110 mm\n\n\n\n\nFront brake\n\n\nHydraulic dual disc, Ø 267 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear brake\n\n\nHydraulic single disc, Ø 267 mm\n\n\n\n\nFront tyre\n\n\n120/70-15\n\n\n\n\nRear tyre\n\n\n150/70-13\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall length\n\n\n2,190 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall width\n\n\n790 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall height\n\n\n1,120 mm\n\n\n\n\nSeat height\n\n\n785 mm\n\n\n\n\nWheelbase\n\n\n1,565 mm\n\n\n\n\nMinimum ground clearance\n\n\n105 mm\n\n\n\n\nWet Weight\n\n\n211 kg\n\n\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n\n\n14.0 litres\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.yamaha-motor.eu/eu/products/scooters/sport/xmax125.aspx\nAdvertisements",

        "Honda \n\nHonda’s New RM222 Million Motorcycle Production Plant in Penang \n\n\nPosted on March 24, 2013March 24, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nConstruction of Boon Siew Honda’s new one-stop motorcycle production facility, which started in the third quarter of 2011, is now completed and fully operational.\nThe 222 million Ringgit one-stop production plant in Batu Kawan, Penang was officiated by the Yang Berhormat Dato’ Sri Mustapa bin Mohamed, Minister of International Trade and Industry Malaysia on 12 March. Satoshi Okada, the Managing Director of Boon Siew Honda accompanied the Minister on a guided tour to introduce various advanced technologies the company brought in from overseas to raise production capacity and ensure stringent quality control. Also present were President & CEO of Honda Motor Co., Ltd. Takanobu Ito as well as Oriental Holdings Group Executive Chairman and Boon Siew Honda Chairman, Dato’ Seri Loh Cheng Yean.  \nThe new facility occupies a 23.7ha site and is five times larger than the previous Mak Mandin plant in Butterworth with an annual production capacity of 300,000 units. It marks a significant milestone in the company’s plan to consolidate Manufacturing, Sales, Customer Service, Spare Parts and Safety Riding into one integrated location for management efficiency and greater customer satisfaction.\nThe facility deploys highly efficient production system with the use of advanced technologies such as a solar photovoltaic system, high coating efficiency technologies and an efficient electro deposition coating line for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The new streamlined processes not only increase productivity but contribute to greater energy savings and reduction of manpower and material wastage.\nSolar Photovoltaic System – 32m2 of solar photovoltaic modules are installed on the car park shelter roof to produce 5000kWh/year of renewable energy. Besides benefiting from reduced grid energy usage, the advanced solar photovoltaic technology from Honda Soltec Japan also contributes to reducing an estimated 3.5 tonnes/year of carbon dioxide – the main cause of green house effect. The solar photovoltaic system uses CIGS (Copper, Indium, Gallium, Selenium) solar cell that is 2 to 3 μm thick, about 1/40 the thickness of a strand of hair. Thus, it uses less raw materials to produce, yet delivers more stable energy output from dawn to dusk for general power usage of the new plant.\nTwin-Gun Painting – Developed by Japan and improved by Honda’s two-wheeler plants overseas, this Twin-Gun technology is the first of its kind for two-wheeler in the world. Coupled with Rotating Painting Process, precise paint thickness of 3μ is achieved compared to 8μ using manual operation, while coating efficiency increased from 15% to 45%.\nRotating Painting Process – Complements the automated Twin-Gun robotic arm to achieve uniform paint finishing with minimal paint wastage, while reducing the time and operational personnel required to raise production efficiency.\n\nShape Conforming Painting Robot – Developed in Japan, the system automatically adjust the painting process to match the product shape. This increases painting efficiency by 35%, at the same time, reduces 50% of material cost compared to manual operation.\nEngine Receiving Jig – Developed in Japan and first to be introduced in Malaysia. Unlike existing jig which needs jig replacement for every model change, It helps to reduce 22 sec of man-hour per unit and RM160,000 per model while achieving greater improvement of operational efficiency.\nEmission Lab – Equipped with advanced exhaust gas measurement system to ensure full ECE compliance in the new plant. The facility allows for regular tests and verification of production units’ emission levels to inspect the value of CO2, maintenance quality and engine operational efficiency according to ECE regulation. The lab also facilitates inspection and improvement on preliminary fuel supply system for new production model. With cooperation among Honda Motor Kumamoto Factory, Thai Honda and Honda R&D in Thailand, Boon Siew Honda is now able to conduct detailed emission analysis and defects detection based on correlation data received.\n\nThe Final Inspection Facility – In order to effectively perform quality and operation efficiency inspection on complete build units (CBU), various new inspection facilities had been brought in. These include test stand, speedometer tester, brake tester and headlight tester. Safety during operation of inspection and accuracy of inspection are further improved and defect extraction is now possible.\nFor assurance of top quality standard, the new plant is also equipped with a 400m test course and an emission lab to ensure compliance with the ECE regulations for exhaust emission in Malaysia.\nThe new plant will continue to produce the current motorcycle models – EX5 Dream, Wave Dash, Wave 100, Wave 110, Future, PCX, Spacy and Icon – for the local market. With availability of the new cutting-edge facility and the latest advances in Honda’s manufacturing technologies, Boon Siew Honda aims to expand its capabilities to assemble medium engine capacity and high value-added models to cater for more diversified market segments in the country.\nSince local production of Honda motorcycles started in 1969, a total of 4.4million units have been manufactured. Honda maintains its leadership with a market share of 47% in 2012.\nFor more information, visit www.boonsiewhonda.com.my or call the Boon Siew Honda Toll-Free number at 1800-88-3993 (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm, except for public holidays).\nAbout the New Plant\n\n\n\nLocation\nPenang, Malaysia\n\n\nStart of Production\nFebruary of 2013\n\n\nProduction Capacity\n300,000 units/year (2-Shift)\n\n\nEmployment\nApproximately 1,100 associates (including temporary staff)\n\n\nTotal Floor Space\n44,426m2\n\n\nLot Size\n237,056m2\n\n\nCapitalization Ratio\n51% Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\n49% Oriental Holdings Bhd.\n\n\nRepresentative\nSatoshi Okada, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer\n\n\nBusiness\nMotorcycle Production, Sales, Service and Spare Parts\n\n\nMotorcycle Dealers\nApproximately 900 dealership\n(including multi-brand selling shop)\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It is fitted with a new 700cc engine which is said to deliver more power and fuel-efficient.\nNewly developed 700cc engine (6-speed transmission)\nCheck out the official press release below  \nTOKYO, Japan, September 26, 2011 – Honda Motor Co., Ltd. has announced the development of a new motorcycle engine with powerful torque in the low- to mid-speed range and top class, fuel-efficient environment performance, along with a second-generation Dual Clutch Transmission. This new engine is a liquid-cooled, 700cc, 4-stroke, in-line, 2-cylinder engine that fits into the mid-class range (displacement between 500 and 750cc) popular in Europe. Fuel economy exceeds 27km/L,*1 best in the mid-class range, and achieves an approximate 40%*2 improvement over other sports models in its class.\nNewly developed 700cc engine (Second-generation Dual Clutch Transmission)\nThis new engine can be coupled with a newly developed lightweight, compact second-generation Dual Clutch Transmission, featuring a smooth, direct feel and excellent transmission efficiency, in addition to a 6-speed manual transmission.\nThis new engine will be mounted on three models based on different concepts, which are slated for exhibition at EICMA2011(69th International Motorcycle Exhibition) to be held in November in Milan, Italy.\nHonda developed this new motorcycle engine in order to realize a set of motorcycles based on its new concept of offering outstanding fuel efficiency in the mid-class while delivering powerful, throbbing torque in the normal range for touring and urban riding.\nDevelopment was performed to meet these requirements:\n\nAn engine that is easy to handle with plentiful torque in the range normally used, and which also delivers a pleasant, throbbing feel during sporty rides\nTop-class, fuel-efficient environmental performance best suited for the next-generation mid-class engine\nA lightweight, compact design that allows more freedom in the body layout and provides highly convenient space\n\nHonda determined the engine layout after examining a variety of engine types from numerous perspectives and decided on an in-line, 700cc, 2-cylinder engine with a 62º forward lean (cylinder assembly angle). To meet a wide variety of uses, two transmissions can be coupled with this engine: the second generation of Honda’s innovative Dual Clutch Transmission, and a 6-speed manual transmission.\n\n*1\nWMTC mode (Honda calculations)\n*2\nHonda calculations\n\n= Main Features of the New Engine =\nHigher combustion efficiency and lower friction\n\n\nA wide variety of low friction technologies that aid better fuel economy are incorporated: To improve fuel efficiency through better-controlled combustion while realizing a powerful ride in the low- to mid-rpm ranges, the bore-stroke ratio is set at 73×80mm. An ideal combustion chamber shape and optimum valve timing also contribute to achieve stable combustion. Resin coating is applied to the pistons, and lightweight aluminum material is employed for the first time in a motorcycle in the friction-reducing roller rocker arm.\n\n\nUneven-interval firing and uniaxial primary balancer\n\n\nAdoption of uneven-interval firing with a 270° phase crank and uniaxial primary balancer help realize an engine with a pleasant throbbing feel that also reduces vibration.\n\n\nBranch intake port inside the cylinder head, valve timing\n\n\nThe layout of a branch intake port inside the cylinder head was chosen to have only one intake channel for two cylinders. This design creates deliberate interference between the two cylinders’ intake processes to achieve precisely calculated changes to combustion timing.\nIn addition, to change the valve timing between the two in-line cylinders with one camshaft, the specifications provide for a cam with two timing routines for the intake valve. Through these measures, subtle combustion changes can be generated to give the engine a delightful, pulsating feel.\n\n\nExhaust emission purification system\n\n\nTo maximize the efficiency of exhaust emission purification so that the catalyzer, a three-way catalyst, can be started promptly after the engine starts, the catalyzer has been placed directly beneath the exhaust ports. This design lets the combustion gas pass through the catalyst while the gas is still hot. In addition, a combination of measures, including the adoption of an electronically-controlled fuel injection system (PGM-FI),*3 allows the engine to achieve an emission level approximately half the European emission standards (Euro 3).*4 The resulting environmental performance is ranked among the top in the world without compromising powerful, smooth output.\n\n\n*3\nPGM-FI (Programmed Fuel Injection System) is a Honda registered trademark\n*4\nHonda calculations\n\n\nSecond-generation Dual Clutch Transmission\n\nThe Dual Clutch Transmission, developed for the first time by Honda for motorcycles and installed on the VFR1200F, is now lighter and more compact through a simplified hydraulic circuit and other design enhancements. A learning function has been added to each selected running mode to detect a variety of riding environments from city streets to mountain passes and automatically performs the most suitable shift control. Although it is an automatic transmission, the Dual Clutch Transmission delivers fuel economy on a par with manual transmissions as a result of its excellent transmission efficiency.\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nLorenzo Conquers New Qualifying Format for Stunning Pole in Qatar \n\n\nPosted on April 7, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nReigning MotoGP World Champion Jorge Lorenzo became the first MotoGP rider to take pole position under the new qualifying format tonight at the Losail International Circuit for tomorrow’s Grand Prix of Qatar. The new quick-fire format allowing just 15 minutes for the riders to deliver their best lap proved an intense session. Lorenzo was quick to move to the top of the time sheets with a fats lap only to be relegated to third by rival Dani Pedrosa and then fellow Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow. The Champion then responded with a stunning 1’54.714 second lap, over two tenths clear of Crutchlow in second to take his first pole of the season.\nHaving set a threatening pace over the practice sessions Valentino Rossi looked promising for a strong qualifying session. Unfortunately the Italian nine-time World Champion was held up in traffic on his second outing with a fresh tyre and was unable to make it to the front row for tomorrow’s race. Rossi will start his first Grand Prix back with Yamaha from the fourth row in seventh place.  \n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – 1st, Time – 1’54.714\n“I’m really happy, for three or four laps we pushed to the limit. I knew Cal was really fast over one lap so I had to push to the maximum. I’m very happy with this pole position. The important thing is that the Yamaha works here at this track. I think for the first time of the new qualifying format it has been very positive and for the fans it is very good to watch. For the riders you are a little more nervous and you have less time to make a fast lap. I knew I was competitive but the ten minutes before the qualifying we had some problems with the set up of the bike so it was more difficult to make the time. We had to change to yesterday’s setting. The important thing is it make a good start tomorrow. The last simulations I made were better than yesterday so I’m quite confident for the start. If there are problems in the first laps we have to be patient and wait for the middle of the race.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – 7th, Time – 1’55.711\n“The qualifying was not fantastic for us, especially as we lost the second row. Our performance during free practice was better than this, we’ll wait for tomorrow. Unfortunately in the qualifying session with the second tyre where we had to improve I was stuck in traffic so I could not improve my lap time and I lost some positions. For sure tomorrow it becomes more difficult to start from further behind but we have a good pace so we can be quite competitive.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“The new qualifying system has been run for the first time and Jorge got the pole. It was very exciting I have to say. Everything is focused on just 15 minutes so you are more nervous than with an hour qualification. He did very well and was happy with his performance and with the bike also. We are looking forward to tomorrow’s race. There are three or four guys who are strong, but we will try to win the race and if not be on the podium! The first challenge is the start and we’ll see from there.”\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“There’s no better way to start the season than with a pole. The lap that Jorge did was amazing. He could have gone even faster but anyway what he has done is really great. The pace he has is really good and I think we can be pretty optimistic for tomorrow. Unfortunately Vale had some traffic during his last tyre and that compromised his possibility to do two fast laps. He has to start from the third row but he is a fighter and what we have seen from the last two days means we know he can do well. We are ready for tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013 MotoGP Qatar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLosail Circuit 06/04/2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nJorge Lorenzo\nYamaha\nESP\n1’54.714\n\n\n2\nCal Crutchlow\nYamaha\nGBR\n1’54.916\n\n\n3\nDaniel Pedrosa\nHonda\nESP\n1’55.151\n\n\n4\nAndrea Dovizioso\nDucati\nITA\n1’55.160\n\n\n5\nStefan Bradl\nHonda\nGER\n1’55.477\n\n\n6\nMarquez Marc\nHonda\nESP\n1’55.645\n\n\n7\nValentino Rossi\nYamaha\nITA\n1’55.711\n\n\n8\nAlvaro Bautista\nHonda\nESP\n1’55.870\n\n\n9\nBradley Smith\nYamaha\nGBR\n1’56.315\n\n\n10\nAndrea Iannone\nDucati\nITA\n1’56.523\n\n\n11\nNicky Hayden\nDucati\nUSA\n1’56.667\n\n\n12\nAleix Espargaro\nART\nESP\n1’57.064\n\n\n13\nBen Spies\nDucati\nUSA\n1’57.440\n\n\n14\nRandy De Puniet\nART\nFRA\n1’57.551\n\n\n15\nLukas Pesek\nIoda-Suter\nCZE\n1’57.926\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It was a very long wait and now, I have bought myself a first model 2010 Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR. Even though this is a first model bike, it has less specialty than the first model Yamaha 125Z and first model Yamaha 135LC since both have many parts made in Japan. For example, the first model Yamaha 135LC engine is fully made in Japan, whereby now it is being made in countries like Indonesia, Vietnam or Thailand. It is not that the second model or the newer is not good, just that it is not as special as owning the first model with parts made in Japan. This holds true also for Yamaha 125Z and ZR whereby we can see the CDI for the first model have no cut-off and have Yamaha logo on it, but now is the M logo and CDI has been RPM/speed limited. First model Yamaha 125ZR also features the most sought out item that is the three-spoke Enkei-1 sport rim. Enkei-1 sport rim is definitely durable and can withstand strong impact from the road and much more lighter. Also after that, there are Enkei-1 samurai 6-spoke sport rim which is also durable and lightweight. I have interviewed many 125Z/ZR riders and mechanics about this and they agreed that Enkei-1 wheels are really that good. Now, there is no more Enkei-1 production wheels and most of the owner of this wheels have lost the wheels due to theft. It is common to see that Enkei-1 3-spoke and 5-spoke sport rim to reach MYR1000+ in Malaysia most popular online store that is Mudah.my. So, in my deepest thought, I know that I’m making a good decision to buy this first model Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR, even though it is not fully made in Japan. Now, let’s start my Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR review.\nIn terms of design, Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR is one of the most heavily designed moped ever from Yamaha. Simplicity is not taken into consideration here. Everything about luxury and techno-style. This may raise some concerns among riders that like to see their bike simple and functional like Honda EX-5, well then, this bike is not for you. You need to be someone who are adventurous and like to try something new. The part that is  most talked about the design is the tail lamp. Some have said the Yamaha engineer has over-designed the tail lamp. It is new and it is different, but it serve a function. The tail lamp has now been increased in terms of height that makes it easily seen by the other vehicles coming from behind of the Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR. It is much higher than Yamaha 135LC tail lamp and almost with the same height as the Yamaha 125Z. Also, the side profile (when you look at the bike from the side) have a very forward stance bike that makes it look fast even though it is not moving. Young, fast and stylish is what this bike is all about.\nI liked the fact that Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR speedometer will light up in blue as soon as the ignition key in turn to ‘ON’ position. This is not available for Yamaha Lagenda 115Z. The speedometer feels a little heavy compared to Yamaha 135LC, but this one is not confirmed yet. The gear position lamp is also very visible in orange colour, but sometime I confuse it with right turn signal but no big deal. Other than that, the meter cluster of this Lagenda 115ZR is very visible and the information provided by the display is sufficient and well thought of.\nThe sitting position is the same with other bike, but the best part is the addition of collapsible footrest that is slanted inward about 5 degree. This position give a very well planted foot position and keeps your foot from slipping out from the the footrest. The seat is the same with other Yamaha moped products that is the anti slip seat.\nTop speed for this bike is not being tested yet, after 1000km, I’ll update this post.\nOne feeling that I get from riding this bike is that it makes me want to ride more to explore this bike. When I was riding from Shah Alam to Banting (55km) in a drizzle, it never makes me want to stop. The rains pours and I just keep riding with my raincoat on. I can say this bike is fun to drive even though not as comfortable as 2010 Honda Wave 110RS (I have ride this bike, it is the most comfortable moped ever!). Compare to Honda Wave 110RS, Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR is not so comfortable but fun, whereby Honda Wave 110RS is comfortable but the feeling is sterile (this is my own opinion, so, sorry if any Honda owners feels the pinch).\nRaincoat, wallet and handphone are easily keep inside this bike the underseat compartment that provides 7.0 liter of storage. I’m guessing you can also keep one bag of Nikon D90 with kit lens inside it. Be careful though as rain water can seap into the compartment slowly. Not much, but it can cause your concerns.\nRide and handling of this bike is superb. The handle is very directive and follows your command. No sense of slipping over with this bike. Compared to my Modenas CT110 which tends to wobble on sharp corners, this one just eat it through like it is mean to do it. It is firm and in control. What this mean is that, taking corners are now safer and the riders can feel more confident. With that in mind, the suspension feels hard and not so comfortable. I suspect this is due to the suspension that is not still in run-in condition. Anyway, this is just 0-55km review, I think the handling will get much better after the bike gets 1000km which makes the suspension a little softer and much more responsive. I’ve got bumpy feeling while riding this bike on straight line and this feeling is the same when I changed my Yamaha RX-Z front suspension to a new one, but it will disappear after a few hundred km of riding. I’ll try to post some more review after my bike hit 500km.\nOne more reason that makes me buy this bike is because Yamaha Malaysia usually adjust (increase) the bike price few times a year. For now, Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR is just RM400 more than the Yamaha Lagenda 110ZR. With the increase in displacement and features, I’m guessing this bike will get a price hike in few more months.\nMaybe some of you might say that I’m crazy to buy and own many bikes (this Lagenda is being purchased even before my current Modenas CT110 reach 1000km), but this is my passion. I like riding underbone bikes very much and there are too much story from my early age up to this point about the underbone bike.\nIf you want to buy this bike, I strongly recommend you to buy this at GT Max Motor in Seksyen 25, Shah Alam. I just plonked down RM1500 for the downpayment and for 24-month loan, I just need to pay RM230. Additional RM200 is needed if you want to get first party all-rider insurance coverage. I paid mine. Also, you’ll get a free helmet (MS88 with visor or Swan helmet), free front fork lock, padlock, rain suit and a mystery gift (I got a Rossi cap) when you buy the bike there. GT Max Motor I think provide the cheapest loan available and it is actually loan provided by the shop, not by Aeon. At the time of my purchase, the plate number is WUD for KL and BKW for Selangor.\nRemember, all of my writing here is based on experience with this bike and from my opinion which you all can disagree with it. I just write what I think. So, please don’t go buy the bike because of my review or blame me if the review is not so accurate with your experience with the bike. Also, please note that I have slight bias to Yamaha bike.\nIf you have any question about this bike, you can ask in the comment section and I’ll try to answer it. Thanks!\nUPDATE 19/08/2010: The bumpy feeling from the bike on straight line is not because of the suspension! It is actually because the rear tyre is not installed correctly. In some part of the tyre, there are uneven bump that makes my ride bumpy and shaky. I’ll be going to fix this soon and update you more.\nUPDATE 17/09/2010: The tyre has been fixed. The mechanic has done these step to repair it:\n1. Deflate the tyre\n2. Apply some oil to the part which not pop up correctly\n3. Remove the tube valve\n4. Inflating the tyre until there is loud pop from the tyre that popped to the rim\n5. Installing the tube valve and inflating the tyre again to the correct pressure.\nAfter that, my Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR ride has become very smooth and easy to get top speed. It also makes my my ride more comfortable and enjoyable.\nUPDATE (02/02/2011): Read the part 2 review for 55-1,046km here: http://motomalaya.net/blog/2011/02/02/my-yamaha-lagenda-115zr-55-1406km-review/\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 9 German MotoGP: Marquez resumes Sachsenring domination by topping German Grand Prix practice \n\n\nPosted on July 11, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nAt a circuit where he hasn’t been beaten for the last five seasons, Repsol Honda Team’s Marc Marquez continued his fine form at Sachsenring by topping the timesheets in Friday’s free practice sessions at the German Grand Prix.\n\nHaving topped the morning Free Practice 1 session, Marquez found extra pace in the afternoon FP2 session and set a lap time of 1’21.621 to lead on combined times by 0.119 seconds from Monster Yamaha Tech 3’s Bradley Smith, whose best time of 1’21.740 made him second quickest today. Third quickest was Ducati Team’s Andrea Iannone with a personal best time of 1’21.824. The three quickest riders today set times quicker the existing Circuit Record Lap of 1’21.846 set by Dani Pedrosa in 2011.\n\n\nCool ambient temperatures and a strong breeze throughout the day made for challenging conditions for the riders, with today’s peak track temperature of 38°C being recorded towards the end of FP2. In order to cope well with the short, yet technical Sachsenring circuit in the cool conditions, three different front slick specifications were utilised by the riders today; the soft, asymmetric and medium front slick options. Although all riders started the day using the soft compound front slick to ensure maximum warm-up performance in FP1, the most popular front tyre during FP2 was the newly-developed asymmetric front slick that is available for the first time at Sachsenring. This option provided good heat-retention and edge grip on the lesser-used right shoulder with good cornering stability on the left shoulder. Rear tyre choice focused on the soft compound for the factory Aprilia and open-class riders, while the factory Ducati, Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha riders mainly used the medium compound rear slick. With warmer temperatures forecast for tomorrow, evaluation of the hard compound rear slick is expected to take place during FP4 which commences at 1330 local time (GMT +2) tomorrow.\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“The riders had to face challenging conditions today, with cool temperatures in the morning and strong winds in the afternoon. Thankfully, our tyre allocation is working well here in Germany so the riders could cope sufficiently with these challenges. As well as offering our asymmetric front option for the first time this year, at Sachsenring we also took the decision to add a fourth front slick option to our allocation, the hard compound front slick, as we could have significantly warmer weather tomorrow and Sunday. So far this weekend our tyre allocation is working as we had hoped, with the riders reacting positively to our asymmetric front slick and the overall level of rider safety and performance on offer being good. It is too early to know what the preferred race tyre options are, but further testing in what should be warmer temperatures tomorrow afternoon will give us a clearer picture on what tyre options will figure in Sunday’s thirty-lap race.”\n\n\nGerman MotoGP: Top ten combined Free Practice 1 & 2 times \n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nCombined FP1&2 Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n1’21.621 (FP2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n1’21.740 (FP2)\n\n\n0.119\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n1’21.824 (FP2)\n\n\n0.203\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n1’21.886 (FP2)\n\n\n0.265\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n1’21.889 (FP2)\n\n\n0.268\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nTeam SUZUKI ECSTAR\n\n\n1’22.095 (FP2)\n\n\n0.474\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n1’22.102 (FP1)\n\n\n0.481\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nScott REDDING\n\n\nEG 0,0 Marc VDS\n\n\n1’22.167 (FP1)\n\n\n0.546\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nYonny HERNANDEZ\n\n\nOcto Pramac Racing\n\n\n1’22.196 (FP2)\n\n\n0.575\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n1’22.340 (FP2)\n\n\n0.719\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 9 German: Marquez maintains his momentum with stunning Sachsenring victory \n\n\nPosted on July 14, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Marc Marquez heads to the summer break with a perfect win record after mastering mixed track conditions at Sachsenring to claim his ninth victory of the 2014 MotoGP season.\nMemories from the last round at Assen came flooding back for the riders as the heavens opened just before the thirty-lap German Grand Prix was due to commence, resulting in sections of the circuit being wet at the start of the race. The mixed conditions left the riders having to face a decision on whether to start with slick or wet tyres, with nine riders starting from the grid on slick tyres, and the remaining fourteen starters starting from pit lane on slick tyres after pitting-in on wet tyres during the warm up lap.\nAfter a chaotic start to the race, Marquez adapted to the drying track best and by the fifth lap had taken the race lead. Despite the less than ideal track conditions, Marquez was able to lap faster than he did in completely dry conditions last year and his quickest lap of the race near the end of the Grand Prix was just two-tenths shy of the Circuit Record Lap. On the other Repsol Honda, Dani Pedrosa also lapped at a fearsome pace to take second place just 1.466 seconds behind his teammate, while Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo made a fine return to form by finishing in third place for his third podium of the year.  \nThe Sachsenring circuit still had some damp patches at the start of the race, resulting in twelve of the twenty-three riders opting for the soft compound front slick to ensure maximum grip and warm-up performance in the challenging conditions. Of the other ten riders, all except one selected the medium compound front slick with GO&FUN Honda Gresini’s Scott Redding the only rider to select the hard compound front slick. All riders selected their softer rear slick option for the race, with the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders using the medium compound rear, and the Ducati and Open-class riders selecting the soft compound rear slick.\nMarquez’s amazing first half of the season has him sitting seventy-seven points clear in the MotoGP rider’s classification, while Pedrosa now sits in second place and seven points clear of Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi who claimed fourth place in Germany.\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“This is the second Grand Prix in a row where unsettled weather has created an unusual start to the race, but once again Marc showed his fighting spirit to take a very impressive victory. In the end there can be only one winner, but there were many great performances out there today and the result was lots of exciting action throughout the field. Although we now have a four week break from MotoGP, it will still be a busy time for Bridgestone. We have a lot to prepare for the second half of the MotoGP season, and also in a couple of weeks’ time we have the challenge of trying to extend our record winning-streak as a tyre manufacturer at the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race to nine consecutive victories.”\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“Just like at the last race at Assen, today we had a race that started with mixed track conditions, but this time the track was dry enough to allow all the riders to start on slick tyres. However, there were still some wet patches during the opening laps – particularly in turn twelve – so it was good to see that the riders were able to manage the tricky conditions on their slick tyres. We’ve worked hard to broaden the operating temperature range of our slicks and today was evidence that this has been a real boost to rider safety. MotoGP may be taking a four week break, but our technical development team will still be working hard back in Japan as we look to develop some new tyre technology for the riders to test in the second half of the season.”\nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“It looked more or less like the Assen race but in the end we had to come to the pits to change our bikes because we could see the track was becoming dry. In the end my strategy was to do the same thing as Dani and Valentino as they are my main rivals, and I saw they stayed on wet tyres so I did the same. The race was nice in the beginning as there was a lot of overtaking then in the second half of the race I had a great battle with Dani. I’m really happy with this victory and now it’s time to relax and enjoy my holiday time.”\nGerman MotoGP™: Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n41’47.664\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n41’49.130\n\n\n1.466\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n41’57.981\n\n\n10.317\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’06.858\n\n\n19.194\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n42’11.173\n\n\n23.509\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n42’15.473\n\n\n27.809\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n42’20.917\n\n\n33.253\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n42’21.532\n\n\n33.868\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n42’21.895\n\n\n34.231\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n42’22.340\n\n\n34.676\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

This maybe due to 2-stroke have simpler design, lighter weight and more power. \nSome also chose 4-stroke engine. Honda EX5, Yamaha Lagenda and Yamaha LC135 belong to this group of engine. 4-stroke produce less pollution and gives less noisy exhaust sound. One of my friend who owns LC135 tells me that he really loves the bike because he can cruise up to 140 km/h furiosly but still be almost silent.\nThere are two person who chose both engine as their favourite and only one person didn’t like engines.

        "100cc\nmodenas\nMR1\ntechnical specification \n\nOfficial: Modenas Kriss MR1 100cc – RM2,948 (technical specs included) \n\n\nPosted on December 15, 2011December 18, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nActually, the word MR1 refers to ‘Motosikal Rakyat 1Malaysia’ (1Malaysia People’s Bike). The price of the this is very aggressive at RM2,948 which puts it along the rank of Honda EX5 (RM3,998) and its own Modenas CT100. The CT100 is priced at RM3,398 with electric starter and both 100cc.  \nFrom the brochure above, it can be seen that MR1 comes in two flavor; Model E and Model F. The Model F is the upmarket version where it comes with electric starter and for this, I think this one should have a price higher than the recommended RM2,948. But if the price is at RM3,100, this mean it will have a very slight difference when compared to Modenas CT100.\nThe panel meter looks familiar for all the Kriss family. Large speedometer with easy to read fuel indicator and four lights on the top of it that includes the normal high beam, neutral gear position indicator, top gear position indicator and turn signal indicator.\n\nThe overall design of this bike takes the cues from the Modenas Kriss 120 which is one of the popular bike from them long time ago. The most recognizable feature is the tail light that have some kind of fighter jet exhaust pipe cover that enclose it.\nThe engine used are the workhorse that are proven in terms of durability and fuel efficiency. The same engine are fitted to Kriss 100 and CT100. Maybe Modenas team decide that, if the thing works well, why change it?\nLow price are very attractive and this could be the ‘People’s Bike’ as what the team wants it to be.

It used to correct the car body basic geometry by filling the gap between the sub frame bolts, sub frame and the car body bolt hole. Car engine, transmission, suspension and the body shelf are mounted on the sub frame. Thus, correcting the geometry setup with Stiff Ring, the car handling will be improved significantly.   \n\nFrom the picture you can see the bolt used to tighten the sub frame and the car body has a gap in between. This will cause the sub frame and body to be miss-aligned and thus lead to a handling problem and produce noise on the uneven road surface.\nWith the Stiff Ring in proper place, the gap is filled up to stop the movement of the sub frame and the car body forever and provide ideal alignment between both, as a result of a perfect geometry setup.\n\nSpeed Mod Stiff Ring is manufactured in Malaysia, thus the cost is reduced compares to other imported brands. We have used special formula alloy aluminium material without compromise to the quality and effect of the Stiff Ring. Our product is strictly controlled under strong Quality Control. There is no doubt to our Stiff Ring quality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice for Stiff Ring is about RM220-380.\nCheck out further explanation by the Stiff Ring itself here: http://www.stiffring.com/\nAdvertisements",

        "Michelin\nparts\nPilot Street Radial\ntyre \n\nMichelin Pilot Street Radial – the best wet grip in the category \n\n\nPosted on May 11, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nAnother variant available at the launch is this Michelin Pilot Street Radial. As the name suggests, this Pilot Street Radial is made with radial-ply type compared to the Pilot Street that is made using bias-ply. What is the difference if you might ask. Here I embed a video to explain about it and you can watch it for better understanding of the differences: \n\nThen, you might ask what is the benefits of the radial tyres compared to bias tyre? Bias-ply are use for lower cost tyre and good for heavy load and low to medium speed. The disadvantages of the bias-ply tyre is that it cannot absorb the bumps on the road as good as radial tyre. Also, when used on high speed, the bias-ply tyre tends to deformed and making the contact area is lower than what it should be.\n\nRadial-ply tyre on the other hand is very good on absorbing the shocks and bumps on the road. On high speed the tyre is less prone to be deformed and can maintain its contact area at this condition. The contact area of the radial-ply tyre are much wider compared to the bias-ply tyre, but the bias-ply tyre have a longer contact area.\n\nMichelin is targeting this bike for bike enthusiasts that needs high performance tyre for safety, stability at high speed and at the same time providing long tyre life.\nMichelin is targeting the Pilot Street Radial to be used on the roads and also on the city. Higher end bikes from 150cc-300cc are the main bike target for the use of this radial-ply tyre. In the picture above, we can also see the Honda CB300R but that one is nowhere to be found in the 5 countries that we have seen before. \nMichelin shown us the DEKRA results of the wet grip test of the Pilot Street Radial and found out that it is the best among all the competitor in its category. It even beat the lovable Bridgestone Battlax BT090 which we all know has been used in Malaysian Cub Prix.\nSilica integration is one of the reason the wet grip is perform very well. What Silica can do is that it makes the tyre grips well in wet condition, but at the same time still having a great durability for the 30% more tyre life.\nThe radial-ply architecture of the tyre is made slightly sharper to ensure handling precision under normal riding positions. Common sense dictates that the sharper the tyre profile, the less contact area it can have, but you should remember that radial-ply tyre have wider contact area compared to bias-ply tyre. Again, the radial-ply tyre ensure that the tyre can stay in shape even in high speed riding condition.\nThere are 3 SKU (Stock Keeping Units) available. All of the SKUs bear the H speed index which means that it is rated for 210km/h maximum speed stress. With that sizes from 130-140 width, this should be a great one to install on the Kawasaki Ninja 250R and Honda CBR 250R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

This CBR300R are said to be the global model, so it might also comes to Malaysia. In Malaysia, we have the CBR250R and this 2014 model also have the 250cc variant with the same styling. The one in shown in the picture above is splashed with Honda Repsol team with the background of Marc Marquez on the Honda RC213V which should makes it appeal to any riders when Marquez just won his first race in MotoGP Qatar.  \n\nIt still comes with the single cylinder setup carried from the last year configuration but the overall styling is very well polished. This could be the design that Honda should make in the first place. It looks much more modern and fit the style of Honda. Also available is the HRC Tricolor that could make the bike look faster and easier to notice.\n\nOne of the most prominent changes is the use of the double headlight cluster that is looking similar with the 2006 Kawasaki ZX6R, but there is some differences that sets it apart. We can see that the headlight is much sharper. This double headlight design has been used previously with the CBR150R before it has been taken out from the market in Malaysia.\n\nCBR300R comes with ABS variant for better braking in difficult situation. Thai riders are lucky to have this ABS model to choose. It is easy to notice the ABS brake system by looking at the disc brake plate that have the circular conjugated hole on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery riders especially the Honda fans in Malaysia are waiting for this, so Boon Siew Honda, if you are listening, please bring this on and make the price below RM15k. It would be the bike of choice in 250cc category (300cc variant will not likely make its way here).\nvia: https://www.facebook.com/pages/CBRsCLUB/146087678787581\nAdvertisements",

HLYD was to concentrate on sales, marketing and distribution of motorcycles. In 1979 HLYM set-up its first assembly plant in Shah Alam. Operations HLYM rolled out its first locally assembled model, the RX100 in December, 1979. In the following year three other models, namely Y80, DX100 and DT125 were introduced. The Shah Alam plant was producing 3,500 units per month. In respond to the government’s call to increase local content with the support from local SMIs, Allied Auto Parts Sdn Bhd (AAP) was established in 1981 to produce stamping, welding, plating and machining parts for Yamaha motorcycles. In the 1980s HLYM assembled the RXS, Passola, Y80, Y88, RXZ and 100 Sport. In 1988, HLYM witnessed a historical event with the 500,000 Yamaha motorcycle roll-out from the Shah Alam facility.

This was in response to the government’s call to invest in R&D. With the strong Yamaha sales, and capacity constraints faced at the factory,  the 100 million Ringgit Hong Leong Yamaha Complex was set-up in 1997. Located prominently in Bukit Rahman Putra in Sungai Buloh and sprawling across 36 acres, the complex housed the Hong Leong Yamaha Distributor, Hong Leong Yamaha Motor, Hong Leong Yamaha Research and Allied Auto Parts. To facilitate the increase of assembly capacity, AAP merged with Hong Leong Yamaha Motor in 1997. The production capacity grew to 15,000 bikes a month. The new millennium heralded the roll-out of Yamaha SRV, SR Lagenda, Nouvo, Lagenda 110, Ego, Nouvo S, 125Z, Lagenda 110Z and 135LC.

This culminated with the HLYM being conferred with an award for TPM Excellence 1st Category by the prestigious Japan Institute of Plant Maintenance. In 2004, HLYM celebrated its 25th anniversary, paying tribute to its loyal customers, dealers, vendors, business partners and employees.

Check it out:\nBorn from MotoGP\nWith an exclusive new colour scheme based on Yamaha’s Assen TT-winning MotoGP bike, the WGP 50th Anniversary R1 celebrates Yamaha’s remarkable Grand Prix heritage. Featuring an innovative crossplane-crankshaft with an uneven firing interval, the R1 kicks out high levels of linear torque for superior traction. Using the MotoGP-developed TCS, R1 riders can now adjust the performance characteristics of the 998cc in-line 4-cylinder engine for more exciting cornering on the highway and reduced lap times on the circuit. A compact aluminium Deltabox chassis delivers precision handling – and for optimised high speed performance the latest R1 is equipped with a new front cowl.\nRace-bred technology, race-bred style\n\n\n\nThe WGP 50th Anniversary R1 looks better than ever in our famous red, white and black factory-bike colour scheme! A WSB championship winner first time out, the crossplane-crankshaft R1 is the leading 1000cc in-line 4-cylinder bike on the street or track. For more controllable performance the latest YZF-R1 runs with a MotoGP-developed Traction Control System (TCS). Equipped with 6-modes, the new TCS reinforces the rider’s trust in the bike’s abilities, enabling you to unleash its full potential at the flick of a switch. With race-bred technology and race-bred style, nothing comes close to the look or feel of the new 50th Anniversary R1!  \n\n\n\n\n\nMotoGP-inspired design\nYamaha’s total commitment to racing has been the lifeblood of the company for over 50 years. Equipped with a short-wheelbase Deltabox chassis, crossplane-crankshaft engine and high-tech electronic control systems, the breathtaking R1 is the embodiment of everything that we have learnt in MotoGP and WSB.\n\n\n\n6-mode Traction Control System (TCS)\nBy instantaneously adjusting throttle opening, fuel injection volume and ignition timing when rear wheel spin occurs, the new switchable 6-mode TCS reinforces your trust in the R1’s cornering potential – and allows the rider to extract optimum levels of traction and controllability in different surface and weather conditions.\n\n\n\nCrossplane crankshaft\nThe R1 engine stands head and shoulders above the crowd thanks to its special crossplane crankshaft, which gives an asymmetric firing interval. Developed from our YZR-M1 MotoGP racer, this class-leading design produces a more linear torque output, allowing the rider to find more traction and lay down the high levels of power more effectively.\n\n\n\nCompact short-wheelbase Deltabox chassis\nThe compact short-wheelbase Deltabox frame has been constructed using a range of gravity die-cast, CF die-cast and extruded aluminium components in order to achieve an idealised balance of rigidity. This sophisticated formula gives the R1 rider remarkable surface feedback for a clear performance advantage on the road and track.\n\n\n\nAerodynamic front cowl\nFor improved aerodynamics the latest R1 is equipped with a new front cowl design with a slightly higher nose, while the menacing-looking ‘eyes’ have been restyled to give even more presence. New LED position lamps benefit from a reflective finish along the lower edge of the eyes to give the R1 a more intense and forceful appearance.\n\n\n\nYCC-I and YCC-T\nThe R1 is equipped with one of the industry’s most advanced intake systems. Its YCC-I (Yamaha Chip Controlled Intake) system features electronically-controlled variable-length funnels which work in association with the Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T) to deliver super-efficient combustion and a smooth and linear power output over a wide rev range.\n\n\n\nExclusive ownership benefits\nWGP 50th Anniversary R1 owners will be presented with an exclusive Ownership Certificate to authenticate their bike’s pedigree – and you’ll also join the mailing list for the Yamaha ‘Insider’ magazine containing the very latest factory news, racing information and interviews.\nSource: http://www.yamaha-motor.co.uk/uk/products/motorcycles/supersport/yzf-r1-wgp-50th-anniversary.aspx?view=features\n\nAdvertisements",

You don’t even see that happening in MotoGP or any other race in the world for that matter.\n\nThe 14 lap race saw a group of nine riders break away from the rest of the field, with pole sitter Atiratphuvapat and Sasaki dicing at the front, as well as Japanese rider Masaki, who was the first to set a fastest lap, which also lowered the SAATC track record by 1.7 seconds.\n\nStrong winds however brought top speeds down, which also meant that riders could not match the qualifying times they had set.\nThere was some drama when Malaysian riders Azman and Rostam crashed out of the leading group under braking at the first corner.\n\nRostam got on the brakes a little too late than expected, and ended up crashing into Azman. Rostam’s bike was also damaged beyond repair, which means he will be racing on a new bike for Race 2 today. Both riders walked away uninjured.\n\nThe leading group of Atiratphuvapat, Izdihar, Chantra, Kunimine, Masaki and Sasaki were constantly swapping positions and at times were six-wide in the braking zone. It was clear the race would come down to the very last corner.\nOn the last lap Sasaki made a break, with only Masaki sticking with the leader, but one of the characteristics of the Losail circuit is the long home straight, with the finish line a long way from the final corner. This means that the rider who exits the final corner first, is often not the one to take the race win as riders have a chance to take advantage of each others slipstreams.\n\nSo it was on this occasion, with Sasaki leading out of turn 16 onto the straight and Masaki on his back wheel. They were so close as they approached the line that they actually touched, and in fact were overtaken by both Kunimine and Chantra, who seemed to come from nowhere, to knock Sasaki down to third.\n\nDespite missing out on the race win, Ayumu Sasaki remains the leader of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup after Race 3 of the scheduled 12. The Japanese rider has a lead of 10 and 11 points respectively over Atiratphuvapat and Chantra.\n\nAdvertisements",
        "K3 iTrack\nreview\nshinko \n\nReview: Shinko K3 iTrack Motorcycle Tyre – premium tyres at its best \n\n\nPosted on March 6, 2013March 7, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nI have riding with the Shinko K3 iTrack for some time now and I got to say that this one is definitely better than the stock tyre that I have before. K3 iTrack is designed in Seoul and made in Jeju, doesn’t that make you feel a bit K-pop? Hehe. After installing the tyre, the feeling of the ride is very different (in a good way, of course). The bike are vibrating less and the straight line stability is superb, it is almost better than what I remember when riding it as new bike. The size of the tyre that I’ve been using is 80/90-17 (stock size is 70/90-17) for the front and 100/70-17 for the rear (same as stock size). The tread pattern of this K3 iTrack is beautiful and designed like that for the balance of dry and wet riding. The groove on the center moves all the way to side and then placed with another tread block alternatingly for optimum grip on dry condition and having aqua channel enough for the wet condition riding.On the very side of the K3 iTrack, there is a triangle pattern for grips when taking extreme angle cornering. \n\nI have been riding with Shinko SR877 previously and the result were very satisfying. This K3 iTrack is the upgrade of the SR877, and Shinko has really make it a good one. The tyre feels very connected on the road and gives a great response of the grip. Never have I skidded with this K3 iTrack, but mind you, I’m not a speed demon. Cornering is always great with K3 iTrack, it grips and easily be controlled for lower bank angle.\nShinko is a new name for some of us, but they have been long in the business of making good tyres with affordable prices. This Shinko K3 iTrack is a premium tyre that we would like recommend to you all. We have been testing it for daily ride and we can say that this Shinko K3 iTrack is one of the premium tyre that perform at its best for the road (not on race track). Anyway, the price is not cheap. Check the price below:\n100/70-17 MYR 192.31\n110/70-17 MYR 215.39\n130/70-17 MYR 238.46\nAdvertisements",
        "800cc\nF 800 GS \n\n2013 BMW F 800 GS Adventure \n\n\nPosted on January 5, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nBMW Motorrad is the most successful manufacturer of large-capacity touring enduros and, with the F 700 GS and F 800 GS, leads the way in the mid-size category, too.\nThe new F 800 GS Adventure builds on this position. Based on the dynamic, off-road-oriented F 800 GS, the Adventure model offers an optimal combination of agility, touring practicality and off-road capability. Following the tradition of the popular boxer-engined GS Adventure models, it provides off-road-oriented touring aficionados, world travellers and enduro fans with an authentic GS Adventure experience in the mid-size segment.\nThe F 800 GS Adventure is powered by the characterful, liquid-cooled 798 cc four-valve twin-cylinder engine as featured on the F 800 GS, with electronic fuel injection, closed-loop catalytic converter and six-speed transmission. Developing unchanged maximum power of 63 kW (85 hp) at 7,500 rpm, and with maximum torque of 83 Nm at 5,750 rpm, this power plant impresses with quick and lively response, powerful torque and low fuel consumption.  \nEngineered and equipped for world travel.\nLike the F 800 GS, the Adventure model too features a robust, torsionally resistant tubular steel spaceframe, although the rear subframe is reinforced to cater for the larger, 24-litre tank (8 litres more than on the F 800 GS model), which increases the bike’s range. Like the F 800 GS, the Adventure model is equipped with ABS as standard, while further safety- and performance-enhancing systems – Automatic Stability Control (ASC) and Electronic Suspension Adjustment (ESA) – are available as factory-fitted optional extras, or as special accessories. These features position the BMW F 800 GS Adventure, along with the F 800 GS, as the safest mid-size touring enduro on the market.\nAs another optional extra, the new F 800 GS Adventure is available with Enduro mode as part of a package featuring ASC.  At the press of a button, the rider can increase the slip threshold of the ABS and ASC systems when heading off-road, for an even more dynamic riding experience and with improved acceleration and braking on loose terrain.\nThe F 800 GS Adventure boasts a new, masculine bodywork styling that underlines its globetrotting abilities, while a new, very comfortable bench seat, a larger windscreen for improved protection against the elements and hand protectors also support this image. Other new standard specification on the F 800 GS Adventure includes wide enduro footrests, an adjustable, reinforced foot brake lever, an engine protection bar and a pannier rack which also functions as a tank protection bar.\nBMW F 800 GS Adventure “Launch Edition”.\nThe new F 800 GS Adventure will first hit the market in a 1,000-unit “Launch Edition”. The highlight of the F 800 GS Adventure “Launch Edition” is its Sandrover matt paintwork in combination with three equipment packages. The Comfort package comprises an onboard computer, heated grips and a centre stand. The Enduro package comes with ASC plus Enduro mode, and the Special accessories package features a lockable aluminium case set, a topcase holder and BMW Motorrad Navigator Adventure including holder and cable.\n \nHighlights of the new BMW F 800 GS Adventure compared to the F 800 GS:\n\nBased on the same versatile overall concept as the F 800 GS, with powerful twin-cylinder engine and agile suspension, but with enhanced off-road and globetrotting abilities.\nRobust and masculine GS Adventure bodywork styling.\nBalanced proportions, despite large rear tank.\nLarger, 24-litre fuel tank (+ 8 litres).\nExtended range (by approx. 120 km / 75 miles).\nABS as standard, ASC as a factory-fitted optional extra or as a special accessory.\nEnduro mode as a new optional extra, in combination with ASC.\nElectronic Suspension Adjustment (ESA) as a factory-fitted optional extra.\nReinforced rear subframe.\nEven more comfortable bench seat.\nLarge windscreen.\nWide enduro footrests.\nAdjustable, reinforced foot brake lever.\nEngine protection bar.\nPannier rack also serves as a tank protection bar.\nWide range of special accessories and ex-works optional extras.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey technical differences at a glance:\n \n\n\n\n\nBMW F 800 GS Adventure\nBMW F 800 GS\n\n\n\n\nTank volume\n24 litres\n16 litres\n\n\nStandard seat height\n890 mm\n880 mm\n\n\nlow seat height\n860 mm\n850 mm\n\n\nLower option\nno\nyes, 820 mm\n\n\nDIN unladen weight\n229 kg\n214 kg\n\n\nMax load\n225 kg\n230 kg\n\n\nDimensions L / W / H\n2,305 / 925 / 1,450 mm\n2,300 / 920 / 1,345 mm\n\n\nFuel consumption\n\n\n\n\n90 / 120 km/h\n4.3 / 5.7 l\n3.8 / 5.2 l\n\n\n55 / 75 mph\n65.7 / 49.5 mpg imp\n74.3 / 54.3 mpg imp\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Not just the exterior has been given the update for 2013, Yamaha also has made some changes in the engine as well. The previous model can give 11.1kW(15.2PS), but now this Lightning can brings it to 12.2kW (16.59PS).\n2013 Yamaha Vixion Lightning Ultra Brave Spirit\nFrom the minisite, Yamaha tells us that the fuel injection and electrical system has been tweaked for this Lightning. Also added is the Oxygen sensor. I thought, the combination of this 3 things (FI, electrical and O2 sensor) gives more power to this bike, but the O2 sensor actually works to make the emission cleaner and meets the Euro spec. So, this means that only the tweak of the FI and electrical system that helps the power increase from the previous model.\n2013 Yamaha Vixion Lightning White Reddish Lightning\nOther than that we can also see that this bike also using new kind of exhaust muffler (as in the minisite) that can contribute to the increase in power.

I got the chance to meet him at the Shah Alam Bike Week and he is very friendly to be interviewed.\nHis bike there was dirty and looks like it haven’t being washed for a long time, I wonder why he didn’t clean his bike. He said that he only wash his bike once and that is the time when the bike is still in Malaysia. The reason why the bike is dirty and why he didn’t wash his bike is because the bike actually carries all the dirt along the journey to 24 countries. There is a dirt from Nepal, dirt from London, dirt from Thailand and many more countries. So, I think, that is a great reason why he didn’t wash his bike.\nHadi also tells me that the longest ride in a day that he has ever made is about 800km+. That is a very long journey in a day a rider can take. I’m sure the butt hurts. That is why long distance journey are also called ‘Iron Butt Ride’. Bro Hadi also admits that the butt does hurts.\nWhen asked about maintenance of the bike, he said that he use to change the engine oil every 2,000km and he always try not to exceed this mileage as it can cause major engine problem. So far this method works. Anyway, he also tells me that for every 1000km, the oil inside the engine will be reduced, so a top up oil is always needed. He also needs to prepare for tyre puncture and for this, tube is always carried as a backup even he uses the tubeless type tyre. For small puncture, the tubeless tyre can easily be repaired, but the tube are for situation where small repair are not possible. This can helps in an unexpected situation. Sprocket set also need to be changed and regularly maintained as it is prone to attracts dirt such as sands that can make the sprocket become loose (wear and tear). One more thing that needs to be maintained is the air filter especially when traveling in snowy condition and sandy dunes. Bro Hadi tells me that in one occasion, he managed to scoop a handful of dirt inside the air filter. How does he knows the air filter needs to be cleaned? He said that the bike will be come throttle-heavy and slow to response since the air are now not easy to get to the carburetor.\nListening to his stories directly from himself are really inspiring and full of education. It makes me want to go further and travel long distance too. Thanks bro Hadi!\n2 more pictures and link to his site after the jump  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://iamalaysian.com/\nAdvertisements",

This system is one of the benefit that is obtained from the use of ACG alternator system that also works as a starter for the engine. Previously, we have known that ACG system provides silent starting mechanism of the engine. Now, the same ACG are used to take the Click 125i to the next level of fuel-efficiency by the application of “Idling Stop’. This means that this bike with shut of the engine ignition in case of idling such as in traffic light stops. It will shut down the engine when the engine is idle for 3 seconds. Why 3 seconds? This is due to rider intention that might be taking U-turn or just stopping momentarily at STOP sign before continuing to move.\nHonda Click 125i right now seems like the almost perfect automatic bike under 125cc category right now I think. It got all the advanced features that mainly reserved for higher priced bikes with design that looks amazingly great.

I managed to snap 77 pictures and a video for all of you to check it out!  \n\nIt feels good to know that Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia (HLYM) still producing this legendary 2-stroke bike from their factory for all Malaysian riders to get a taste of it. As far as I know, Malaysia is the only country in the world that still have this 125ZR on sale in new condition. I would like to thanks HLYM for their effort to continue selling this bike. Previously, we have heard rumors that it is going to be stopped in production after the news about the Yamaha RX-Z has been stopped in production last year. Well, that rumors is NOT true, it still on sale up to this day.\n\nOne of the most radical changes that has been done to this bike is the body-coloured wheel. It means that the wheel have the same colour with the body, that is the Yamaha Racing Blue colour. This suits it well since the name of it is GP Edition. Also, this might means that this bike is in limited unit production. It can disappears as soon as in 2 month only as what we have seen in the previous limited edition Yamaha 135LC ES GP Edition.\nYou might ask, what is the differences with the normal Y125ZR in the red and black colour? Actually, nothing have changed in terms of engine setup or chassis setup. It is primarily about the cosmetic changes. I think it is a good time to update the livery of this Y125ZR since it hasn’t been updated for more than 3 years. The last livery update is in 2009.\n\nIt still comes with 2-piston caliper for both front and rear brakes. The front brake is equipped with 297mm disc plate and the rear with 190mm disc plate. Good enough for this lightweight rocket to be stopped in hurry.\n\nFront face are shown with the clear lens headlight and signal lamp. Maybe you need to mod this to become smoky a bit. It stills looks great though in this clear type lens. The taillight also in clear type lens cover.\nThe price of Yamaha 125ZR GP Edition is RM7500 – 7900 OTR with 1st-party all rider insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

Despite the cooler yet humid weather, the biggest surprise came from Helmi Azman who snatched pole position. Helmi’s improved pace saw him clock a laptime of 1:47.775 set in the last few minutes of the session, with Helmi standing as the only rider to break the 1:48.00 mark.  \nAdam Norrodin (MAS) finished 6th\nThe session also saw Adam Norrodin qualify strongly in fourth with his fastest laptime of 1:48.134. Shafiq Rasol, on the other hand, appeared to be struggling for pace, qualifying in eighth spot with his fastest time of 1:48.624.\nRider #3, Shafiq Rasol finished 9th and scores 7 points\nPasir Gudang native Fakhrusy Rostam however just missed out on the top 10 when he qualified eleventh, whilst rookie Azroy Anuar had to deal with disappointment after crashing out early on the session, forcing him to start from the back of the grid during the afternoon’s scheduled Race 1.\nDespite having scored pole position, the home ground advantage held by Thai riders Somkiat Chantra and Nakarin ‘Chip’ Atiratphuvapat proved too much for Helmi as soon as the lights went out for Race 1. Though he has shown an improved race craft, a subsequent contact with one of the Japanese riders fighting in the lead group ended Helmi’s top run. Nevertheless, Helmi ended the race in eighth, scoring crucial championship points.\nAdam Norrodin also showed his improved race craft and quicker pace as he was fighting in the six-way battle for the lead throughout the race. Adam would eventually finish in sixth, earning him several championship points as well. And, despite struggling for pace, Shafiq Rasol also ended his first race of the season scoring championship points too with his ninth place finish.\nRookie Azroy Anuar may be down in the classification in fourteenth, but the rookie has to be commended for finishing his first race in the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 series, amassing more experience in the hot seat of the Honda NSF250R. Only Fakhrusy Rostam crashed out early on in the race following a contact with Japanese rookie rider Ryusei Yamanaka.\nWith Helmi still holding the advantage of starting from pole position, perhaps Team Malaysia would fare out better for Race 2 tomorrow.

        "1000cc\nmotogp\nYamaha \n\n2014 Movistar Yamaha MotoGP YZR-M1 unveiled \n\n\nPosted on March 20, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP kick started the Qatar MotoGP weekend this afternoon by taking the covers off the 2014 YZR-M1 in front of the world’s key motorcycle media.\nRiders Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi were joined on the Losail circuit start grid by Kouichi Tsuji, General Manager of Yamaha Motor Co.’s Motorsports Division, Yamaha Motor Racing’s Managing Director Lin Jarvis and Telefónica Spain’s Director of Media, Luis Velo to reveal the new livery.\nThe first two months of the year have seen a flurry of activity for the team, highlighted by the recent ground breaking five-year title sponsorship agreement that launches the team Yamaha Movistar MotoGP ahead of the 2014 season.\nThe new year has also seen the announcement of other new sponsors to the Team including EURASIAN BANK and FIAT PROFESSIONAL along with renewals and continued partnerships with ENEOS, SEMAKIN DI DEPAN (Yamaha Motor Indonesia), MONSTER ENERGY, SUISSEGAS, YAMALUBE AND TW STEEL.   \n\nPre-season testing on track has been very positive. With the exception of a rear grip issues at Sepang, both Lorenzo, Rossi and the 2014 YZR-M1 have shown great promise and speed in the shakedown ahead of this season’s title challenge.\nNow the wait is over and the riders will take to the track under the floodlights of the Losail circuit in Qatar in just 24hrs to begin practice for round one of the 2014 MotoGP World Championship, the Commercial Bank Grand Prix of Qatar.\nThe track has proved to be a great season starter for Lorenzo, the double premier class world champion having taken consecutive victories in the last two races. Lorenzo has always started from the front row and never finished off the podium in Qatar.\nNine-time world champion Rossi has an equally impressive record at the Losail circuit, claiming three wins and taking second last year after a fantastic battle with then rookie Marc Marquez in his first MotoGP race.\n\nBuilt in the desert on the outskirts of Qatar’s capital city Doha, the Losail International Circuit has hosted a MotoGP round since 2004. The track celebrated the first ever night-time Grand Prix in 2008 and continues to be the only night race on the calendar. The 5.4km track is well suited to the YZR-M1 with a fast flowing nature. With a main straight over a kilometre in length and a combination of medium and high-speed corners the track is guaranteed to provide an exciting spectacle to start the season.\nUnlike normal race weekends this weekend’s practice will be run from Thursday to Saturday, ensuring the riders get the optimum track conditions in the evening sessions.\n \n\n\n\n\nHiroyuki Yanagi – President, Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd\n“In February, we held a press conference in Malaysia to discuss Yamaha’s close relationship with motor sports. Indeed, racing is in Yamaha’s DNA. Racing is even embodied in our brand message, “Revs your Heart”. Like the thrill people feel when they hear engine revs rise, Yamaha strives to inspire people with exciting moments and great experiences based on unique Yamaha initiatives spanning many racing forums. One of our most important missions is to succeed in MotoGP, the pinnacle of motorcycle racing. We are now preparing for this year’s campaign, when we hope to capture the MotoGP championship. I am very pleased to announce that the Yamaha Factory MotoGP Team has entered a five-year partnership with Movistar, the Spanish mobile phone operator owned by Telefonica España. From this year, they will race as the “Movistar Yamaha MotoGP” team. We are delighted to make this announcement, because we look forward to building a strong partnership with Movistar in MotoGP. Partnering with Movistar is a major step towards achieving our goals. With superstars Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi on board, we expect to enjoy many fine performances by Movistar Yamaha MotoGP, ultimately leading to the championship. With the racing season upon us, please look forward to big things from Yamaha!”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n“Finally we can start the engines! The forthcoming championship is about to kick off and that sounds great after a long winter. As we were able to improve our performance at Phillip Island with the new tyres I feel quite confident for the very first race. I undertook three surgeries during the wintertime to take out some plates and metal pieces from the collarbone and the hand so I returned to full fitness quite late. In general I feel nearly at 100% and I guess in Qatar we won’t have any problems to push to the maximum. Concerning the track needless to say this is a good layout for both my Yamaha and me. I won here the past two races in a row and this is a circuit that suits in a good way the M1. The only thing we have to wait and see is the behaviour of the new tyres; especially on this surface; there is usually plenty of sand because it’s surround by the desert. The championship is going to be even tighter than last season was and at the beginning just Márquez begins as the favorite contender. Afterwards I guess Dani or me are in a good position but also Valentino who is even hungrier than in 2013. Regarding Marc’s pace we should wait before saying anything about it. He is so strong and quick. Maybe he won’t start at a perfect level but I’m pretty sure he is going to be close to 100%. This 2014 season is going to be exciting and thrilling. I start in a very good position, filled with positive energy and optimism. The bike with the new changes is working really well and we solved the little problem of the engine, fixing the electronics in order to mitigate the aggressive behavior on the starts. Now it’s response is softer than at the beginning of the season in Malaysia and also we can count on a “complete” seamless gearbox, that is also a good news for us. I’m really looking forward to tomorrow, following the unveiling of the new Movistar Yamaha MotoGP livery. I love the new bike and the new colours. Posing with the new bike today has been the best incentive to kick-off the season!”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n“I’m so happy because we are finally here at the start of the first race weekend of the year. We have worked very hard in the testing to make some of my issues from last year better and we have found some really good speed. I have been able to be very competitive and been with the fastest riders during testing. I’m very happy with the work done to my M1 over the winter that has helped me to be fast; we have a competitive bike to fight for the podium this weekend. I have a great feeling with the bike and I can’t wait to start the season tomorrow. Our competitors are also quite fast and so I think there are going to be some very exciting races. I am really looking forward to some great battles and fighting for the podium! When I received the news of the arrival of Movistar, I was very happy. It is a great thing to start the year with such a fantastic sponsorship announcement. We must all be very happy for that. Yamaha are very excited, and I am as well. I hope that Movistar will enjoy the journey with us this year and bring luck and podiums! Surely it is a greater incentive to do even better. As for the bike and the new livery, I like it a lot. It’s really nice, really “racing!”. We start the season in the best possible way, showing our fans a beautiful livery. Now we must do our best to collect good results on track!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLin Jarvis – Managing Director, Yamaha Motor Racing\n“This is one of the most exciting starts to a season that I can remember. This winter has been very intense behind the scenes. Our engineers have been working tirelessly to improve every aspect of the bike’s performance and our riders have been preparing themselves physically and mentally for this very important new season. Our management team have also been working non-stop to conclude all discussions and negotiations back in the office, and our Team staff and Marketing and Communications staff have been working frantically, burning the midnight oil to get the Team ready today with our new Movistar Yamaha MotoGP branding. It is great to welcome Movistar back in the world of MotoGP and I am delighted to have so many passionate sponsors and partners on board with us for this new campaign. We will do our maximum to get the results everybody craves for. We are ready, we are hungry and we are excited to go racing!”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLuis Velo – Director of Media, Telefónica Spain\n“Our sponsorship of Yamaha’s MotoGP Team is an investment in Movistar’s relationship with the motoring world in general and MotoGP in particular. We want to contribute to the sport, and there is no better way to do it than by accompanying Yamaha and their two champions Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi on their journey. Being part of this team is one more milestone in Movistar’s global activity to support the development of the MotoGP World Championship, of which we are already part, thanks to the Movistar TV’s brand new channel, Movistar MotoGP. With exclusive contents from Wednesday to Sunday each GP week, and by offering a unique way of watching the championship to our audience, we are trying to support a sport with which we share DNA.”\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It does the same sort of thing that a turbocharger does, but it does it without moving parts. \n If you have read How Two-stroke Engines Work, then you know that the exhaust and intake parts of the cycle overlap. As the piston moves down, it uncovers the exhaust port first to let most of the exhaust out. Then it opens the intake port to let fuel/oil/air in. With a correctly-tuned expansion chamber in place, two things happen to help the intake process: \n\nAs the exhaust gases expand into the expansion chamber, they create a vacuum at the exhaust port. This vacuum pulls fuel/oil/air into the cylinder. \nAs the shock wave of the exhaust pulse hits the end of the expansion chamber, it echoes back, pushing any fuel/oil/air that got pulled through the exhaust port back into the cylinder. This page has a nice graphic that describes the process. \n\n By pulling extra fuel/oil/air through the cylinder and then pushing it back in, the expansion port has the effect of stuffing more fuel/oil/air into the cylinder on each stroke. This gives the engine extra power in the same way that a turbocharger does. \n Here are some interesting links: \n\nHow Two-stroke Engines Work \nHow Turbochargers Work \nBuilding your own racing Expansion Chambers \nExhaust Pipe “Theory”  \nTuned Pipes \n\nAdvertisements",

        "car\nGT-R Nismo\nNissan \n\nRevealed: Nissan GT-R Nismo – the fastest production Godzilla \n\n\nPosted on November 24, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nRecords fall and dreams come true with the debut of the Nissan GT-R Nismo. This race-oriented model delivers “factory tuned” supercar dynamics with revolutionary enhanced aerodynamics and ultra-precise handling. The Nissan GT-R is already established as one of the best performing supercars in the automotive sphere, and now Nissan has drawn on decades of racing experience gathered by Nismo, the brand’s motorsport specialists, to develop the ultimate Nissan GT-R.\nThe Nissan GT-R Nismo features exclusive styling that embraces the longstanding racing philosophy of form following function. It has numerous motorsports-inspired technologies to enhance the car’s performance through optimised aerodynamics, suspension and powertrain, creating a well-balanced machine that is at home on both the road and track.\nThe Nissan GT-R Nismo will be available in Japan in late February 2014, U.S. and Europe later in 2014.\nNissan CEO Carlos Ghosn says this is the fastest Nissan GT-R ever. “With a 7:08.679 lap time, we can authoritatively say that the Nissan GT-R Nismo* holds the volume production car lap record at the Nürburgring Nordschliefe, which is the gold standard of high performance achievement.”  \nNissan GT-R Nismo Overview – Flagship of the Nismo lineup\n1. Mechanical Features\nNissan GT-R Nismo employs innovation, uncompromising engineering and motorsports-inspired technologies to achieve new levels of power, speed and handling.\nEngine\n\nUnder the hood, the 3.8-litre V6 VR38DETT engine benefits from the know-how that Nismo has gained from participating in such events as the world-renowned Nürburgring 24 hour race. Engine power has risen and is now rated at 600hp (441kw) and 481 lb ft (652 Nm) of torque.\nNew high-flow, large diameter turbochargers, which are used for GT3 racing, improve breathing, while optimised individual ignition timing control for each cylinder and upgraded fuel pump improve combustion.\n\nChassis\n\nThe suspension setup,is inspired by that of the Nismo racing GT-R and tuned for stunning agility, road-holding and handling finesse, without compromising refinement.\nThe springs and custom-developed Bilstein DampTronic dampers in the front and rear suspension are specially tuned to deliver exceptional grip levels and progressive handling response at the limit. Three suspension modes can be selected: Comfort, Normal and R, for circuit applications.\nExclusive Nismo tyres – developed by Dunlop – exhibit outstanding grip and handling characteristics. Front: 255/40 ZRF20; rear 285/35 ZRF20.\nSpecially-developed links fitted to the front double wishbone suspension increase castor trail to optimise wheel position during high-G cornering and improve straight-line and cornering stability. Additionally, large high-rigidity bolts are used to increase stiffness of the wheel-hub attachment area.\nTo minimize body-roll during cornering and changes of direction, the Nissan GT-R Nismo features a 17.3 mm hollow rear anti-roll bar which raises roll stiffness while reducing weight.\n\nBody construction\n\nIncreased rigidity in the bodyshell is achieved using adhesive bonding in addition to spot welding leading to precise suspension response under extreme load, the Nismo “factory tuned” enhancement.\n\n2. Exterior design – Exclusive styling with improved aerodynamics\n\nUsing the latest Computational Fluid Dynamic simulation techniques to analyse airflow, Nismo has developed an aero package that improves road-holding, minimises the negative impact of drag, while giving the car a menacing and muscular appearance.\nTogether, the front bumper, engine undercover strake and carbon rear spoiler increase downforce, lowering the centre of gravity and generating an additional 100kg (at 300km/h) compared to the freshly updated 2014 GT-R model. The car’s aerodynamic characteristics are tuned to ensure the downforce is equally spread front to rear at all speeds for progressive handling characteristics. A widened front bumper configuration and elongated yet tapered rear bumper design keep the drag to Cd 0.26, the same as that of 2014 Nissan GT-R.\nThe Nissan GT-R Nismo will be available in five body colors: Brilliant White Pearl, Meteor Flake Pearl Black, Ultimate Metallic Silver and Vibrant Red. And unique to the GT-R Nismo model, a Dark Matte Grey accentuates the car’s imposing exterior muscularity.\nThe GT-R Nismo’s black 6-spoke wheels are inspired by Nissan’s legendary GT500 race car.\n\n3. Interior\n\nThe Nissan GT-R Nismo cockpit inspires driver confidence through both its craftsmanship and optimised driving position.\nErgonomically sculpted carbon-fibre-backed reclining RECARO seats (Europe/Japan) comfortably, yet firmly, support the driver and front-seat passenger.\nNismo racers influenced the design of the steering wheel which is dressed in Alcantara®, with three spokes, red centre mark and red stitching to give the best combination of grip, feedback and comfort.\nThe combi meter has carbon-like finish, and tachometer features a red design. The meter hood is also dressed with Alcantara®.\nInterior trim features include discreet red stitching on the seats, centre console, door trim and steering wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Nismo\n\nNismo, a short form of “Nissan Motorsports,” is the performance brand for Nissan, and is one of the company’s purveyors of innovation and excitement.\nNismo offers products featuring innovative technology and high performance to a wide range of customers for street use. Nismo cars provide an exciting driving experience with motorsports-inspired aerodynamics and styling, enhanced handling characteristics and unmatched agility.\nIn the motorsports world, Nismo competes in the highest forms of GT and sports-car racing, such as Japan’s Super GT Series and the World Endurance Championships (WEC), as well as providing engines to teams that compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the European Le Mans Series (ELMS). In 2012, the Nissan GT-R captured the Super GT championship for the second straight year.\n\n*: Nissan GT-R Nismo with track options\n* Autech Japan is responsible for the planning and production of Nissan GT-R Nismo, which requires vehicle registration in person.\nAdvertisements",

Both models will be available at all Impian Honda Showrooms. “These twin offerings will meet the diverse profiles of bike enthusiasts, with one machine for rough-and-tough use, and the other for a complete sense of control. One common denominator for these bikes is that each model is built upon the essence of realising dreams,” said Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda, Mr. Satoshi Okada.\nThe New CBR1000RR The superbike made for precision built handling, suitable for racetrack and regular riding The new CBR1000RR is made for bike aficionados who desire rides at exhilarating speeds, with maximum control. The new CBR1000RR embodies the principles of compact dimensions, a light and stylish frame and mass centralization. Whilst the CBR1000RR retains its powerful 999cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke DOHC inline 4-cylinder engine and new Programmed Dual Sequential Fuel Injection system (PGM-DSFI) make riding smoother and easy to maneuver. Its assisted slipper clutch feature increases chassis stability when decelerating and handling corners. New suspension settings mean smoother and more accurate response with Showa’s advanced Balance Free Rear Cushion that uses a double tube design. Its Big Piston Front Fork also uses Showa’s technology, reducing internal pressures for smoother damping and enhances stability during hard braking. Elegant 12-spoke cast aluminium wheels provide more consistent rigidity, working with the forks for improved handling.  \n\nThe new CBR1000RR’s four-piece aluminium frame balances the strength, rigidity and lightness required for both superb handling and a strong power-to-weight ratio. The frame also contributes to the centralisation of mass, typical of Honda’s racing and road-going bikes. The new second generation Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) delivers high-speed stability and low-speed responsiveness in steering. Multi-function LCD instruments communicate everything, from gear position to coolant temperature and speed, whilst the customisable tachometer is easy to read in all light conditions. The tachometer is viewable in four modes – Conventional, Reversed, Peak Hold & Single Segment. The 5-level shift LED indicator displays preset rpms once they are reached – great for maximising performance and ensuring optimum gear shifting. The new CBR1000RR is available starting 14 August 2012 in Pearl Sunbeam White at the nett selling price of RM96,500.00 and Victory Red and Graphite Black at the nett selling price of RM95,900.00. The new CBR1000RR C-ABS, which is equipped with Honda’s electronically-controlled Combined Anti-Lock Brake System, is available at the nett selling price of RM107,600 for Pearl Sunbeam White and RM107,000 for Victory Red and Graphite Black.\nThe New CRF250L A dual-purpose bike that is sharp on the street and fun on the dirt The new CRF250L is the image of ruggedness and versatility – light, nimble and ergonomically appealing. Based on the legendary XL series, this multi-purpose bike combines competition-level off-road performance with responsive handling and practicality. The new CRF250L is equipped with a semi-double cradle steel frame chassis that provides the strength and toughness needed for off-road riding. Its wheelbase design gives the machine excellent stability and agility supporting two adults plus a 5kg load. The chassis encases a newly developed liquid-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder 250cc DOHC engine that produces consistent torque at low rpm and excellent performance at high rpm; making power delivery well balanced throughout a broad rev range. The lightweight and compact engine is also responsive, due to the internal dimensions of the throttle body and exhaust pipe. Combustion efficiency is enhanced with an iridium spark plug along with precise metering fuel from the Programmed Fuel Injection system (PGM-FI). The new CRF250L has a new six-speed gearbox and clutch, designed to cope with the extra stress off-road riding can produce. With its reputation as an off-road traveler, the new CRF250L has superb handling capabilities, maintaining correct rigidity balance, which is suitable for use over a wide range of terrain and speeds. The braced handlebar provides an upright and relaxed riding posture, with plenty of leverage, and 45° turning angles on either side give a tight turning circle – useful for dealing with urban traffic or tight trails. Its brake system has also been tuned to offer a high level of controllability, making maneuvers precise and giving full control to the rider. Pro-Link rear suspension and Showa shock absorbers, together with the new CRF250L’s 21-inch front and 18-inch rear wheels add to this great sense of control, increasing stability on rough terrain. The slim fuel tank can hold 7.7 litres, and enclosed with a comfortable flat seat offering choices of riding position for maximum control. Seat height is 875mm. The cooling system uses a 10.7 kW heat-release radiator protected with a polypropylene grill baffled to improve airflow. A thin guide-ring cooling fan is used to keep temperatures even at low speeds – useful when in traffic or tricky off-road situations. Carbon emissions are managed with an O2 Lambda sensor, which works together with a secondary air injection system – making this bike Euro III Emission Regulations compliant. The Honda CRF250L comes in Extreme Red at the nett selling price of RM22,688.00 and will be available at the end of August.

It features low dust for longer lasting braking feel and better grip for shorter braking distance.\nIn my previous experience with cheap brake shoe, they tend to have less brake feel and I need to press hard on the brake lever to make the brake work. On further analysis, I’ve found that the cheap brake shoe is not made to fit the roundness of the hub of the bike, hence less brake shoe contact to the hub.\nThis elig have almost perfect roundness and you should benefit from the better grip of it.\nelig brake parts are also available for many more bike such as Honda Wave, Suzuki Shogun, Modenas, Kawasaki and many more.\nTwo more pictures after the jump.\nAdvertisements",

        "600cc\nRecursion Concept\nsuzuki \n\n2013 Suzuki Recursion Concept – 588cc turbo parallel-twin engine \n\n\nPosted on December 3, 2013December 3, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nSuzuki revealed this beauty at the 43rd Tokyo Motorshow and makes us drooling for it. The concept named Recursion, comes with an unusual engine configuration for this time of the year that includes a forced induction. The engine is 588cc parallel-twin with intercooler turbo that should provides massive power from it.\nThere was many turbo bikes earlier like the Honda CX650 Turbo, but the idea does not last long and forgotten years after its introduction. The problem lies in the way turbo works, for car it is okay but for motorcycle, it is not as easy what we think. More power means more enjoyment, but this is not the case for motorcycle. Turbo works at certain RPM after the turbocharger gets enough inertia to force the air to the engine cylinder.  \nLet say the turbo works after 3,500 RPM. This means that you’ll get a surge of power boost after the engine hits more than 3,500RPM. Now, imagine this; you are braking to take a corner and the RPM drops to 1,500 RPM, so now the turbocharger spins slow and didn’t provide the forced induction to the cylinder, after you exits the corner, you blip the throttle fast enough and the engine now rams from 1,500RPM to 5,000RPM. You’ll get a power shock when the engine hits 3,500RPM and that can snap the handle violently if you are not used to it. And this is one of the reason of why the turbo engine for motorcycle does not last long in the production.\nTo see that Suzuki comes with this turbo engine, I hope the effect of the power shock is minimised. If not, we can see it to stays as concept as it is now. Other than that, the higher cost of turbo engine production makes it a second choice when riders buying bikes.\nStill, this is a good concept in my opinion and hope Suzuki comes out with a great engine to go with it.\nAdvertisements",

        "800cc\n899 Panigale\n900cc \n\n2014 Ducati 899 Panigale – the ‘Minigale’ at 148HP \n\n\nPosted on September 13, 2013September 13, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nThe new 899 Panigale – Supermid perfection\nThe introduction of the highly-anticipated Ducati 899 Panigale provides a new way to access the exclusive world of Ducati Superbikes with a “Supermid” version designed to provide the thrill of the new generation flagship model with the refined character of an everyday streetbike. The brand new Superquadro engine features a revised bore and stroke for a broad power delivery, producing 148hp (109kW) with a torque of 73lb-ft (10.1kgm). The super-smooth power unit continues to be a fully stressed member of the innovative Panigale monocoque construction, achieving both an outstanding power-to-weight ratio and ride-enhancing agility with a dry weight of 169kg (372.5lb). An 1199 silhouette underlines the family DNA, while the Ducati Quick Shift (DQS) and the fully integrated Riding Mode technologies of Ride-by-Wire, triple stage ABS, Ducati Traction Control (DTC) and Engine Brake Control (EBC) continue the benchmark ingenuity introduced with the award-winning Panigale. Ducati’s constant pursuit of perfection now offers all-round performance for connoisseurs with an authentic and stylish way to enter the world of high performance. The 899 Panigale is available in traditional Ducati red with black wheels or a stunning arctic white silk with red wheels.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best of both worlds\nDucati is passionately committed to further development of the Panigale concept both on the track and on the street and the 899 represents a “Supermid” version,  intended to be a method of entry into the world of premium performance. With carefully designed, rider-friendly features, like increased seat cushioning and shorter final drive gearing for enhanced mid-range rideability, the new model achieves a successful mix of authentic Italian performance with everyday usability, offering the very best of both worlds in absolute style. The innovative “monocoque” frame solution  and  the new 899 “Superquadro” L-twin engine uses race-derived electronics to continue the “bred for the track and trained for the road”  mentality. This initiative further demonstrates  how  innovative Ducati World Championship level technology  has a direct contribution to ride improvement and safety enhancement. With the click of a button, Ducati’s Riding Mode concept delivers performance with enhanced rider confidence by combining a number of class-leading technologies. The latest-generation sports ABS system, Ducati Traction Control (DTC), Ducati Quick-Shift (DQS), Ducati’s race-derived Engine Brake Control (EBC) and Ride-by-Wire (RbW) are now all programmed into seamless, electronic rider assistance. Pronounced “Pan-ee-gah-lee”, the model represented  a change in  Ducati Superbike tradition,  adding a name to its engine capacity designation and making a significant association to its historic roots in the Borgo Panigale area of Bologna. In an Italian territory known as “Motor Valley” and where high performance and racing runs through the veins of its passionate people, Ducati have underlined their  pride in being world ambassadors for the “Made in Italy” title by immortalizing their birthplace in the name of the new  generation Superbike.\n\n\nUnmistakably Ducati\nEvery detail of the Panigale pays tribute to the rich heritage of racing on which Ducati is built. Components\nthat are not only functionally efficient, but also minimalist, essential and beautifully engineered into pieces of\nautomotive art.\nClimb aboard the Panigale and take hold of the bars and the feeling of pure racing is everywhere. The finely\nformed top-clamp with weight-saving hollows and recesses immediately communicates Italian engineering\nat its very best.  Radial brake and clutch pumps, Ducati’s precise switchgear and full Ride-by-Wire twistgrip\ngive a race-driven sense of minimalism further enhanced with the monocoque-integral steering head flowing\ninto the front sub-frame and minimalist instrumentation.\nThe twin headlamps, with LED positioning lights,  are integrated with the frontal intake ducts, while the twin\nrear lights are moulded  perfectly around the recessed seat air ducts and illuminate with an attractive\nlight-guide surround effect, enhanced with LED brake lights. Front LED indicators are integrated into the mirror\nbodies and rear indicators, which are also LED*, are styled with clear lenses.\nThe majority of the frontal air ducts feed the main airbox, while a small splitter diverts air also into the fairing\nbodywork to ensure efficient cooling for the onboard electronics. The carefully executed shape at the rear of\nthe fairing  enables a highly efficient exit from the radiator area, protecting the Superquadro’s power output\nand further reducing aerodynamic resistance.  The sleek shape of the seat and tail-piece is accentuated by\nthe under-engine location of the exhaust system, further enhancing the aggressive stance of a true Ducati\nSuperbike. *Country specific\nEngine\nThe 899 Superquadro\nDucati’s latest power-plant, the 899 Superquadro, represents another major step forward in  twin-cylinder\ndesign and technology, generating  superb  Ducati performance with super smooth  power delivery.  Providing\n148hp (109kW) @ 10,750rpm and 10kgm (73lb-ft) @ 9,000rpm, the new engine achieves a perfect balance\nof drive and fluidity using a bore and stroke of 100mm x 57.2mm (3.93in x 2.25in). The Desmodromic,\n90° L-twin  inherits  the 1199’s structural design to enable full integration with the monocoque chassis   while\nboasting an ownership-friendly 24,000km (15,000 miles) between major services.\nEngine architecture\nMirroring the innovative 1199, the 899 engine is a fully stressed member of the chassis, with its architecture\ncalculated to provide the best possible vehicle construction for layout, weight distribution and strength. The\ncylinders, which remain at 90° to each other,  are rotated  backwards around the crankcases,  positioning the\nfront cylinder  at    21° from horizontal  and enabling  the engine to be positioned further forwards for  optimum\nfront / rear weight distribution  and  perfectly positioning the  cylinder head attachment points for the\nPanigale’s monocoque frame.\nThe crankcases, which are vacuum die-cast using Vacural® technology to ensure optimal weight saving,\nconsistent wall thickness and increased strength, also incorporate the outer water-jacket of the “cylinder”,\neliminating the jointing face that used to exist at the base of the cylinders. Instead, the Superquadro has\nseparate nikasil-coated “wet-liners” inserted into the tops of the crankcase apertures. This design enables\nsecure fixing of the cylinder head directly to the crankcase, improved sealing and enhanced heat dissipation\nfrom the thin cylinder-liners directly into the surrounding coolant.  The clutch casing, sump and cam covers\nare all cast in aluminium.\nThe  899 Superquadro  crankcases use shell main bearings for the crankshaft,  enabling  an increase in\ndiameter of the crank journals for enhanced rigidity and an increase  in  the crankcase section around the\nmain bearing area for improved strength. The shell bearings are force-fed oil from internal drillings within the\nmain bearing pillars to keep the new crankshaft well lubricated and the oil is quickly scavenged back into the\nsump with  a highly efficient GP-style vacuum pump.  The pump is driven by the main oil pump shaft and\neffectively maintains constant vacuum in the crankcase area below the pistons, reducing atmospheric\nresistance during the down-stroke of the piston and controlling the internal “breathing” of the engine.\nSupermid precision\nIn calculating the optimum configuration for  a “Supermid” 899 version of the Superquadro,  Ducati engineers\nselected  a bore and stroke of 100mm x 57.2mm (3.93in x 2.25in). The  combination  of power and ridability\nresulted in an impressive output of 148hp (109kW) @ 10,750rpm and 73 lb-ft (10.1kgm) @ 9,000rpm.\nThe bore and stroke ratio  achieves  an attractive balance of torque while allowing sufficient area for the\nhighly efficient valve diameters of  41.8mm (1.64in)  inlet and 34mm  (1.33in)  exhaust.  The valves are\nactuated by  ‘super-finished’  and diamond-like carbon (DLC) coated  rocker arms for reduced friction and\nfatigue.\nThe 899’s  volumetric efficiency is achieved with the help of oval throttle bodies measuring an equivalent\ndiameter of 62mm (2.44in) that feed air across a single injector per cylinder positioned below the\nRide-by-Wire controlled butterfly.  The new engine also inherits the 1199’s secondary air system, maintaining\nperformance-optimised fuel mapping for smoother cycle-to-cycle engine operation, without compromising\nemissions.\nDesmodromic valve control\nDucati’s  Desmo system actuates valve closure mechanically with the same method and accuracy as it\nopens, enabling steep cam profiles, radical cam timings, large valves and high operating speeds.  This\nsystem is used in every Ducati engine and constantly proven on Ducati Corse’s World  Superbike and\nDesmosedici GP motorcycles.\nThe Desmodromic assembly is driven by a combined chain and gear-drive arrangement with a conventional\nbush-type chain running  from the crankshaft to the cylinder head,  where a single sprocket positioned\nbetween inlet and  exhaust camshafts  is attached back-to-back to a gear wheel mounted on its own short,\ndedicated shaft. The attached gear meshes directly with gears on the ends of both the inlet and exhaust\ncamshafts, which are also designed with +/-  position adjustment for ultra-precise  cam-calibration. The cam\nchain provides a highly efficient point-to-point drive route and, tensioned automatically, provides continuous\nreliability, further reducing the cost of routine maintenance.\nOn the end of each exhaust cam drive gear is a centrifugal flyweight which retracts at speeds below tick -over\nto rotate a “protrusion” from the concentric section of the cam, thus creating sufficient valve lift to act as\na de-compressor. This ingenious device enables the Superquadro engine to be started easily without using\na larger battery and starter motor, which has further helped the reduction of overall vehicle weight. When the\nengine starts and the camshafts begin to rotate at tick-over speed, the centrifugal flyweight flicks out,\nretracting the “protrusion” back into the cam and allowing complete valve closure for full compression. This\ninnovative feature further underlines the lengths to which designers and engineers have worked together in\nthe single-minded pursuit of weight-saving.\nTransmission\nThe 899 Superquadro engine adopts the same gearbox as  the 1199, capitalising on the extensive work\ncarried out in  increasing  dimensions  between the centres  of the six-speed gearbox shafts  to  enable  larger\ndiameter, stronger gears to transmit the enhanced power output.\nChassis\nMonocoque technology\nThe  899 Panigale’s chassis  continues  Ducati’s innovative and courageous step forward in motorcycle\ndesign, merging multiple parts into one compact and lightweight component, while re-evaluating rider\nposture with a revised ergonomic triangle.  The extremely compact monocoque construction  integrates the\nairbox to become  one of the key elements in reducing the overall dry weight  to an impressive of  169kg\n(372.5lb).\nUsing the Superquadro engine  as a stressed member of the chassis, the short and strong aluminium\nmonocoque is die-cast  in  aluminium and attaches to the cylinder heads protruding forward to house the\nsteering head bearings and forming the airbox. Continuing the concept  of  component minimisation,  the\nairbox is capped-off and sealed by the underside of the 17 litre (4.5 US gallon) steel fuel tank.\nWhile the cylinders remain true to Ducati’s signature 90° L-twin configuration, the  Superquadro  engine has\neffectively  rotated the top-end backwards around the crankshaft  to enable engineers to  position the engine\nperfectly for optimum front/rear weight bias. With a front-end geometry of 24° of rake and  96mm (3.78in) of\ntrail, a brand    new,  fully die-cast aluminium,  double-sided swingarm  provides  the wheelbase of 1,426mm\n(56.14in) setting the weight distribution of the 899 Panigale at 52% front and 48% rear.\nWith the exhaust system located below the engine, the steel tubular  rear sub-frame  maintains a clean line\nand attaches directly to the Superquadro engine, while the lightweight,  aluminium  front sub-frame attaches\ndirectly to the monocoque frame, providing secure support for the headlamp, instrumentation and fairing.\nThis centralisation of mass substantially contributes to overall vehicle agility.\nSuspension\nThe 899 Panigale is eqiuipped with 43mm Showa  BPF  usd forks, fully adjustable in spring pre-load and\ncompression and rebound damping.  The bodies are finished in titanium grey and the sliders in chrome and\nfeature forged radial calliper mountings on the fork feet. The Showa Big Piston Fork (BPF) enhances\ndamping control at low suspension speeds by flowing more oil at lower pressures and reducing the range\nover which the damping fluid has to flow during comp

Inside a standard CDI circuit, there is a circuit breaker or rev-limiter or cut-off switch which limit the revolution of the engine. How does it work? Read on the article taken from Wikipedia. This article is about electrical circuit breaker but it can be used to relate to rev-limiter or cut-off switch in engines. In fact, we can’t get away from electrical system when we are discussing about engines.\nA device to open or close an electric power circuit either during normal power system operation or during abnormal conditions. A circuit breaker serves in the course of normal system operation to energize or deenergize loads. During abnormal conditions, when excessive current develops, a circuit breaker opens to protect equipment and surroundings from possible damage due to excess current. These abnormal currents are usually the result of short circuits created by lightning, accidents, deterioration of equipment, or sustained overloads.\nFormerly, all circuit breakers were electromechanical devices. In these breakers a mechanism operates one or more pairs of contacts to make or break the circuit. The mechanism is powered either electromagnetically, pneumatically, or hydraulically. The contacts are located in a part termed the interrupter. When the contacts are parted, opening the metallic conductive circuit, an electric arc is created between the contacts. This arc is a high-temperature ionized gas with an electrical conductivity comparable to graphite. Thus the current continues to flow through the arc. The function of the interrupter is to extinguish the arc, completing circuit-breaking action.\nIn oil circuit breakers, the arc is drawn in oil. The intense heat of the arc decomposes the oil, generating high pressure that produces a fluid flow through the arc to carry energy away. At transmission voltages below 345 kV, oil breakers used to be popular. They are increasingly losing ground to gas-blast circuit breakers such as air-blast breakers and SF6 circuit breakers.\nIn air-blast circuit breakers, air is compressed to high pressures. When the contacts part, a blast valve is opened to discharge the high-pressure air to ambient, thus creating a very-high-velocity flow near the arc to dissipate the energy. In SF6 circuit breakers, the same principle is employed, with SF6 as the medium instead of air. In the “puffer” SF6 breaker, the motion of the contacts compresses the gas and forces it to flow through an orifice into the neighborhood of the arc. Both types of SF6 breakers have been developed for ehv (extra high voltage) transmission systems.\nTwo other types of circuit breakers have been developed. The vacuum breaker, another electromechanical device, uses the rapid dielectric recovery and high dielectric strength of vacuum. A pair of contacts is hermetically sealed in a vacuum envelope. Actuating motion is transmitted through bellows to the movable contact. When the contacts are parted, an arc is produced and supported by metallic vapor boiled from the electrodes. Vapor particles expand into the vacuum and condense on solid surfaces. At a natural current zero the vapor particles disappear, and the arc is extinguished. Vacuum breakers of up to 242 kV have been built.\nThe other type of breaker uses a thyristor, a semiconductor device which in the off state prevents current from flowing but which can be turned on with a small electric current through a third electrode, the gate. At the natural current zero, conduction ceases, as it does in arc interrupters. This type of breaker does not require a mechanism. Semiconductor breakers have been built to carry continuous currents up to 10,000 A.\nAdvertisements",

        "200cc\nKawasaki\nPulsar 200NS \n\nRumors: Kawasaki Bajaj Pulsar 200NS to replace Kawasaki Ninja KRR ZX150 \n\n\nPosted on September 20, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nA round of rumors again which you should take it as a possibility or even just a wrong info. Here I share to you anyway since this is what I got from the insider. OK. Some riders said that in 2014 there will be no more 2-stroke bike for sale as new bike in Malaysia. Currently there are two popular 2-stroke bike in Malaysia that is the Yamaha 125ZR and Kawasaki Ninja KRR ZX150 that are still on sale. Due next year, some said that the Kawasaki Ninja KRR ZX150 will be stopped in production and replace with another bike. The current Ninja KRR ZX150 is at 30HP which is powerful compared to other 4-stroke bike. It is said that it is going to be replaced with 23PS Kawasaki Bajaj Pulsar 200NS. We have never heard of Bajaj here in Malaysia yet, but Kawasaki have some JV with Bajaj of India to produce bikes. For now, the Kawasaki Bajaj Pulsar 200NS is marketed specifically for the Indonesian as of the press release. To see it coming to Malaysia is logical but there are some issue of acceptance of a bike that is not 100% made by Kawasaki as we always see. Below is the press release of the Kawasaki Bajaj Pulsar 200NS:  \nToday at the Jakarta Fair*, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. is happy to announce as one of its new models for 2013 the “Pulsar 200NS,” a 200cc naked sports model for the Indonesian market, under the new Kawasaki Bajaj brand.\nKawasaki has worked on the “Pulsar 200NS” with India’s Bajaj (Bajaj Auto Ltd. of Maharashtra, India) to make a number of improvements for the Indonesian market. Sales are scheduled to start at the end of July.\nKawasaki and Bajaj have had a collaborative relationship since 1985, working together on bike development and sales.  In the Indonesian sports bike market, the models with the greatest sales volumes are those 200cc and under. Until now, Kawasaki’s line-up in this category was incomplete. Conversely, Bajaj’s Pulsar 200NS was doing well in the Indian market. Thus, the relationship between Kawasaki and Bajaj was taken to the next level. Working closely together, almost 200 improvements were made to the bike to ensure it would measure up to Kawasaki’s strict standards for durability and quality. The new Pulsar 200NS is being released under the new “Kawasaki Bajaj” brand.\nDesign elements for the new Pulsar 200NS were inspired by the latest European trends. The compact front cowl, and radiator shrouds that blend seamlessly with the fuel tank and flow smoothly to the tail section leave a fresh yet powerful impression. The design will meet the needs of a wider range of customers than current Kawasaki models, accommodating even entry-level riders.\nThis model will be produced at Bajaj’s Chakan Plant in Maharashtra, India.

This racing engine block for Yamaha LC135/Sniper/X1R is made from Taiwan. The durability of if is known and able to sustain long distance and endurance from the biker.\nThis racing engine block kit consist of engine block, piston, piston ring and piston pin.\nThere are two sizes available for the engine block that is 58.5mm and 60.0mm. The standard size of the Yamaha LC135 engine block is 54mm.\nOversize block gives more fuel to burn inside the combustion chamber, thus giving more power. Also, heat is generate more than standard condition with standard engine block. This one doesn’t give any problem to the LC135 since it is liquid cooled.\nTuning of carburetor is also essential when you change the engine block. What is needed to be tuned is the main jet and pilot jet only. Standard main jet for Yamaha LC135 is 105 and pilot jet 20.0. So, what you need to do is to change that main jet and pilot jet to a bigger size. Main jet upgrade size is available in 110, 115, 120 and 125. Changing to the maximum size is not always the best idea. Try 110 first, then upgrade to larger size until you get a good speed all around and smooth running engine. If not, your carb is going to be too rich or too lean with fuel. Pilot jet upgrade comes in size 22.5 and 25.0. Also, try the small one first until you get the best mix. Tuning carb is essential to get the most efficient fuel delivery to the engine block combustion chamber.\nAfter that, you also need to change your exhaust to high performance exhaust to get a better airflow of the exhaust gas. AHM, YY Pang etc is a good exhaust to choose from.\nThanks for reading and happy tuning!\n\nPiston is included\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n\nY1-2, that’s what written on the side wall\n(Click to enlarge)\n\n\n135 5YP, the same wording as the standard block.

        "1000cc\n1100cc\nDiavel\nducati \n\n2015 Ducati Diavel – sharper styling and new Testastretta 11° Dual Spark 162hp engine – estimated RM120k \n\n\nPosted on March 4, 2014March 5, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe new Ducati Diavel – Make a bold statement\nDucati’s latest Diavel introduces many new features to the highly awarded sport cruiser, including a new engine and exhaust system and styling refinements that combine the model’s muscular and assertive look with an elegance and sophistication now synonymous with the premium Italian brand. The new Diavel now makes a bold statement and strengthens Ducati’s Performance Redefined mantra by using latest technologies to produce super-smooth performance with enhanced comfort and usability.\nCustom shop beauty, state-of-the-art technology, innovative design and extraordinary riding pleasure remain masterfully blended into the Diavel, a motorcycle that has firmly set a benchmark in the sport cruiser segment, just reward for the innovative designers and engineers that created it. Built to have a commanding presence, though lightweight and agile like all Ducatis, the Diavel takes the man-motorcycle relationship to another level in absolute comfort. For connoisseurs of technology, the latest generation Testastretta 11° Dual Spark engine combines with full LED illumination, ABS, Ducati Traction Control and Ducati Riding Modes to deliver a confidence-inspiring superiority, while new styling, 162hp and 205kg* (452lb) of pure Ducati drives a comfortable sport lifestyle previously only dreamt of.\nMerging the worlds of power and style is now achieved with convincing precision. A specially engineered 240 section rear tyre combined with Ducati chassis technology serves up mind-blowing handling and lean angles which defy the laws of physics, whether carving through curves on your favourite road or simply cruising the boulevards.\nWith its laid-back street ergonomics, blistering performance and commanding style, the new Diavel now rolls out dressed in stylish Dark Stealth livery, a black trellis frame and black wheels. The Diavel Carbon offers the choice of traditional Ducati Red over Matte Carbon with red frame or the stunning new Star White over Matte Carbon with white frame, both with black, forged wheels by Marchesini, turned and milled to expose the natural aluminium.  \n\n \n2015 Diavel new features overview\nAll Diavel models\n· New Testastretta 11° DS engine\n· New exhausts system\n· Full LED illumination\n· New headlamp cover and mounting\n· New bar-risers\n· New radiator covers\n· New seat\n· New fuel gauge and side-stand TFT instrumentation icons\nDiavel\n· Body: Dark Stealth\n· Frame: Black\n· Wheels: Black\n· Silencers: Black\nDiavel Carbon\n· Colour 1:\no Body: “red carbon” (gloss red over matte carbon weave) \no Frame: Ducati red\n· Colour 2:\no Body: Star White (white over matte carbon weave) \no Frame: Ducati white\n· Wheels: Black. Marchesini, forged, turned and milled to expose the natural aluminium\n· Silencers: Stainless-steel silver\n\nDIAVEL DESIGN\nBasic instincts\nThe Diavel project was born when Ducati designers applied their wish-list of bike “basic instincts” to a blank canvas. With a “what if?” approach to creating a dream bike, they sketched inspiring shapes which became a lower and longer motorcycle. “The challenge of building a muscular silhouette over a pure-bred competition motor had to be met with determination and a delicate touch, and the result is a frontal area that looks like a power athlete on the starting blocks,” explained the team at Ducati Design responsible for the project. “With the front wheel kept close to the Diavel’s body and using the short tail of a sport bike, we were able to blend this muscular design with a chassis that matched.”\nIf the stance of a Streetfigher is that of “anger,” the stance of the Diavel is of readiness, dominance, and confidence bordering on superiority. With lateral radiators adding muscle to its broad “shoulders,” which then taper down across the engine and into the belly-fairing with oil cooler, the athlete took shape.\nA massive 240 section rear tyre was a perfect example of how Diavel designers used a no-compromise attitude when applying their wish list of features. The sheer width of rubber communicates so much power and style that the R&D team vowed to find a way to make it handle – even if they knew the image would send a seismic shock through the industry. Ducati’s philosophy for innovation has always been to push the boundaries of design in the name of exciting motorcycles. Sometimes “gut feelings” are what count, and having the strength to commit to them shows the bold statement that Ducati has made. The Diavel is a true Ducati, born from a passion for motorcycling and designed to deliver authentic Ducati performance in every respect. “Diavel”\nThe name “Diavel” was inspired by the Bolognese dialect word for “devil”. One day, early in the development process of the bike, the first prototype was assembled and wheeled out in front of a group of Ducati engineers and technicians who were viewing the complete motorcycle for the first time. One person looking from the rear of the bike saw its silhouette and exclaimed in Bolognese dialect: “Ignurànt comm’ al diavel!” Which means: “Evil, just like the devil!”\nReminiscent of how the “Monster” was named, the Diavel follows the same Bolognese tradition, shaping the future of motorcycling while staying faithful to its heritage. \nRider and passenger comfort The Diavel’s twin-level seat is wide, comfortable and now a little longer with a new shape and horizontally-\nribbed seat upholstery beautifully formed to fit the flowing lines of the machine, further enhanced with red stitching on the Carbon red model. The low 770mm (30.3in) seat and low slung chassis set-up that weighs in at just 210kg (463lb) – 205kg (452lb) for the Diavel Carbon – enables the rider to get both feet on the ground for a sure-footed and confident stance. The seat also comes with a stylish and easily removable single seat cover, which is formed in carbon fibre on the Diavel Carbon.\nPassengers of the Diavel and Diavel Carbon will appreciate the way the slender passenger footpegs ingeniously fold down from the rear sub-frame as well as the innovative, T-bar shaped grab-rail assembly, which slides out from the rear of the seat. Deployed from a mechanism under the seat, the grab-rail provides a comfortable and confidence-inspiring grip for the passenger, while the shape perfectly blends into the lines of the tail-piece when retracted. Both passenger-friendly features are crafted in forged aluminium and shot-\npeened for strength and uniform finish before being black anodised to become almost invisible when folded away.\n\nNew LED Lighting\nThe new Diavel now extends its LED lighting package with a full LED headlamp to complement the\ncharacteristic twin vertical strips of LED lights, that provide tail and brake light illumination and directional indicators at the rear. The rear LED strips follow the precise line of the under-seat panelling, providing great visibility of the rear-end while keeping the external lines of the bike clean. The front directional indicators are clear lens LED, now updated to solid strip technology mounted vertically down the leading edge of the also restyled lateral radiator covers. Mounted in a brand new brushed-aluminium outer body, the totally redesigned headlamp gives the new Diavel immediate identity using stylish LED positioning lights to create a stunning surround effect for optimum visibility.\nInnovative number plate mount\nEmploying the double strip of multi-functional LEDs for the rear lighting of the Diavel required an innovative solution for the mounting of the number plate. The unique design uses mounts on the rear hub of the single-\nsided swingarm to extend an elegant framework around the 240 section rear tyre, enabling a central mounting of the plate. The framework carries a hidden power feed to dedicated LED illumination for the number plate, eliminating any reliance on the main rear lights and enabling a clean feature around the rear of the seat.\nFuel tank and air Intakes\nThe Diavel’s 17l (4.5 gal US) fuel tank represents an integral part of the bike’s overall styling. Its wide, long lines sweep down from the headlamp assembly into the seat and rear sub-frame to create a seamless profile. While the focal point of the tank is the high resolution display panel, the steel tank skin and well-\nsculpted knee panels add a solid feel to the Diavel and a high tech composite look to the Diavel Carbon.\nOn each side of the front of the tank and feeding the engine’s large airbox are muscular looking intake ducts, now further enlarged on the new Diavel and formed in black anodised, brushed-aluminium. Their design is completely functional and contributes to the performance of the Diavel Testastretta 11° DS power plant.\nControls\nThe Diavel handlebar shape and arrangement leaves the rider feeling comfortable and in command, while a brand new bar-riser and air-deflector design further enhance the clean and minimalist look to the entire cockpit area. Wide, black-finished, tapered section aluminium bars with custom designed, integral brake and clutch master-cylinders by Brembo complete with milled reservoir tops, blend functionality with a custom shop level of attention to detail, while stylish, forged-aluminium supported mirrors deliver a generous view to the rear.\nSwitchgear control uses Ducati’s slim-line bodies, housing easy-to-use switches and buttons and a unique weapons-like “trigger catch” that slides down to cover the starter button when activating the kill-switch. While the indicator cancel button doubles as a scroll-and-select for fast and easy Riding Mode changes, switches above and below serve to navigate the high-resolution display control panel. \n\n\nDIAVEL PERFORMANCE\nThe new Diavel Testastretta 11° DS engine The heart of the new Diavel is Ducati’s new Testastretta 11° DS engine, which harnesses the famous 1198’s immense power and now makes it even smoother with even more torque, an ingenious step forward in balancing high-performance with an enjoyable ride. With its 162hp @9,250rpm and increased torque of 96.2lb-ft (130.5Nm) @8,000rpm, the Diavel Testastretta 11° DS engine is all about authentic Ducati Desmodromic performance.\nThe revised intake and exhaus ports combined with radical adjustment of the cam timing have enabled Ducati to achieve a fantastic torque curve at low rpm, which remains strong through a wider rev-range. The increase in bottom-end torque is managed by Ducati’s Ride-by-Wire (RbW) system to considerably enhance the Diavel’s effortless ridability while ensuring plenty of power remains on tap ready to be unleashed. A number of well-proven technical advancements in Ducati’s twin-cylinder technology have been combined with the 1198’s torque-laden 106mm x 67.9mm bore and stroke to create an exciting, customisable and user-friendly character for the new Diavel.\nBreathing through elliptical Ride-by-Wire throttle bodies, the 1198 Testastretta 11° DS uses the latest fue injector positioning to target spray directly onto the rear of the hot intake valve instead of the relatively cold surface of the intake port wall. The enhanced vaporisation achieved as the fuel hits the valve, fully atomises the incoming charge, eliminating the chance of compromised combustion efficiency experienced if droplets of fuel enter in liquid form. With the delivery of a fully vaporised inlet charge, the concept of Dual Spark (DS) with two spark plugs per cylinder-head, provides a twin flame-front that ensures complete and efficien combustion across a shorter period of time.\nNew pistons with an 1198 Superbike-style crown shape further enhance that combustion with a higher 12.5:1 compression ratio. The new engine, which is cooled by twin lateral radiators – positioned on either side of the bike and fed with highly efficient and stylish air ducts, also uses Ducati’s secondary air system, maintaining performance- optimised fuel mapping for smoother cycle-to-cycle engine operation, without compromising emissions. The Testastretta 11° engine effectively took the original fire-breathing 1198 Superbike power plant and re- engineered it with increased user-friendliness. Engineers achieved this to great effect by reducing the amount of valve over-lap from around 41° – typical in performance engines that operate constantly at high RPM – to just 11°, which reduced peak horse-power slightly, but considerably enhanced mid-range and overall smoothness.\nThe massive 58mm (2.28in) section exhaust headers lead the 2-1-2 system through power-enhancing equa lengths before terminating in brand new short, slash-cut silencers, stylishly angled to match the rear wheel’s radius and underlining the focus on custom detail. The new stainless steel silencers are finished in black for the Diavel and natural brushed stainless steel for the Diavel Carbon. The engine management system dedicates a lambda probe to each header, providing precise fueling, while the catalytic converters provide Euro 3 conformity and the electronically controlled mid-section valve optimises exhaust pressures throughout the rev-range. The Diavel’s gearbox uses high-strength materials to manage the power output and enhanced grip generated by the 240 section rear tyre, which also requires the use of a 16mm longer gearbox output shaft for drive chain routing.\nThe transmission features an oil bath clutch with “slipper” function and super-light feel at the lever. Its design uses a progressive self-servo mechanism that presses the plates together when under drive from the engine, enabling the reduction of the clutch spring rates. This results in a much lighter clutch lever at the handlebar, ideal in stop-start traffic or during long journeys. When the drive force is reversed (over-run), the same mechanism reduces the pressure on the clutch plates, enabling them to provide a race-like “slipper” action, which reduces the destabilizing effect of the rear-end under aggressive down-shifting and provides a much smoother feeling when closing the throttle or down-shifting under normal riding conditions. The Diavel’s clutch and alternator covers are specially styled with enhanced detail and shaping and the cam belt covers with an aluminium mid-section.\n\nThe new Diavel’s Testastretta 11° DS engine reaches another milestone in Ducati’s constant investment in quality by enabling the distance between major service intervals (valve clearance check) to be set at an owner-friendly 30,000 kilometres (18,000 miles). \nDIAVEL CHASSIS\nFrame assembly\nThe Ducati Trellis frame uses large diameter, light gauge tubing with two lateral die-cast aluminium sections that flow into the rear subframe. This achieves massive torsional rigidity while remaining lightweight and compact. The two sections form a rear-end structure by attaching onto either side of a complex techno-\npolymer component. The long, die-cast aluminium, single-sided swingarm provides great “feel” at the rear-\nend with a wheelbase of 1590mm (62.6in) and a stance that provides lean angles of up to 41°.\nSuspension The Diavel uses black-bodied 50mm Marzocchi front forks, fully adjustable for spring pre-load, compression and rebound damping. They are gripped by a slash-cut triple-clamp – cast aluminium for the lower and forged for the upper – with a rubber-mounted riser to tapered alloy bars. With a rake of 28°, trail of 130mm (5.12in) and an offset of 24mm (0.945in), the set-up provides a sure-footed and agile front-end for incredible handling and 70° of total steering lock for maximum manoeuvrability. Both Diavel and Diavel Carbon use the same suspension with fork sliders black-finished in super low-friction diamond-like carbon (DLC).\nAll versions of the Diavel have a Sachs rear suspension unit slung low under the chassis in a horizontal position, operated by a progressive pull-rod linkage from the swingarm. Adjustable in compression and rebound damping, the unit uses a handy control for easy spring pre-load adjustment.\nWheels and tyres\nThe Diavel rolls on stunning, custom 14-spoke wheels with machine-finished detailing. The front rim is 3.5×17, while the rear, which is “flow-formed” for enhanced structure and lightness, boasts a massive 8×17 rim. The Diavel Carbon has custom shop-finished, lightweight, forged, turned and milled rims by Marchesini\nthat not only score an impressive total weight saving of 5.5lb (2.5kg), but also look spectacular. These highly intricate nine-spoke wheels highlight the delicate machining in natural aluminium set against a black finish. Ducati’s technical partner, Pirelli, worked with the Diavel’s designers and engineers to develop the incredible Diablo Rosso II tyres. While the front uses a conventional 120/70×17 section with a tread pattern designed for enhanced wet weather performance, the 240/45×17 rear represents the latest innovation in tyre design with a sport-oriented profile being applied to custom-style width.\nThe massive rear employs bi-compound technology to enable high grip levels at full lean angle while providing high mileage and uses Enhanced Patch Technology (EPT) to maximise the contact patch at all angles. The tread pattern and compounds deliver great performance in all conditions, especially the wet.\nThis tyre design enabled Ducati to achieve the style they had envisioned for the Diavel without compromising the authentic Ducati performance of the chassis. This partnership of parallel development between chassis and tyre design contributed massively to Ducati “changing the rules” in this segment. \nBraking system & ABS The Diavel front brakes use Brembo’s incredibly powerful Monobloc callipers, which deliver outstanding performance actuated by integral alloy master cylinders with unique shape reservoirs sporting milled tops. The 4-piston, twin radially-mounted callipers grip 320mm discs, while a single 265mm disc on the rear is gripped by a two piston calliper, also by Brembo. The Diavel Carbon uses specially milled aluminium disc carriers which have natural aluminium coloured recesses machined around the weight saving cut-outs in contrast to the carrier’s black finish around the centre. Typical of Ducati, these top-of-the-range components provide outstanding levels of braking and set a benchmark in this category. The system is equipped with the latest, most compact, Ducati Bosch-Brembo ABS system as original equipment on both versions, providing a major contribution towards performance control. Top Brembo components combined with Bosch ABS, the special Diavel chassis configuration and Pirelli’s Enhanced Patch Technology (EPT) result in a braking performance even greater than that of the awesome Ducati Superbikes.\nDIAVEL TECHNOLOGY\nLateral radiators\nThe technical solution employed for keeping the frontal lines of the Diavel clean was to place two highly efficient lateral radiators on either side of the bike. These well-ducted units, located beneath the fuel tank, are aerodynamically designed to draw air flow through the radiators and are assisted by high-flow electric fans when required. The design combines form and function to enhance the muscular shape of the bike.\nSplit-level instrumentation The Diavel’s instrumentation is a masterpiece of cutting-edge technology with an upper LCD display mounted on the bar-riser, providing main information such as speed and rpm, warning lights, time and temperature and a lower, full colour Thin Film Transistor (TFT) display styled into t he fuel tank to provide a clear account of the current Riding Mode, gear selection and DTC setting as well as total mileage and trips. Used on mobile phones and computers, TFT technology is a variant of LCD and displays easy-to-read high resolution graphics. The Diavel’s TFT display goes one step further by using the sensitivity of its surrounding light to decide upon black or white background colour. When stationary, the lower display also doubles as the latest user-friendly control panel to personalise DTC and RbW settings within each Riding Mode before saving.\nConstantly developing its instrumentation technologies further, Ducati now introduces new fuel gauge and side-stand warning icons to the Diavel’s TFT display. Positioned in the top left corner of the display, the new fuel gauge is animated with five graphic bars to signify fuel capacity, gradually reducing the number of bars until the icon changes from green to yellow when capacity is down to just one bar, simultaneously illuminating the fuel reserve warning list. The fuel icon is programmed to start flashing if the fuel capacity is falls to 1.1 litres or less. The side-stand icon illuminates in the central area of the display to remind riders that the stand is deployed and functions in parallel to the usual safety system, which kills the engine if a gear is selected while the stand is still deployed.\nHands-free ignition\nThe Diavel’s ignition is actuated by an electronic key in the rider’s pocket, which communicates with the motorcycle when within a distance of approximately 2 metres (6.5ft). The motorcycle recognises the dedicated key code and automatically enables the bike’s systems. Pressing the key-on switch then activates all systems to “on” and the engine is ready to be started. The electronic key, which internally consists of a radio circuit, externally doubles as a mechanical flip-key, required to open the seat and fuel tank cap. When parking the motorcycle, an electronic lock can be actuated on the steering simply by applying full steering-\nlock and pressing the ignition-off button a second time.\nRide-by-Wire\nThe Ride-by-Wire (RbW) system is an electronic interface between the Diavel’s twistgrip and engine, which configures an ideal power response depending on the Riding Mode selected. The twistgrip no longer has a throttle cable connected directly to the throttle body butterflies, but instead delivers a signal to a control unit, which in turn operates the butterfly opening electronically. The RbW system uses three different mappings to regulate the power delivery: 162hp with a sports-type delivery, 162hp with a progressive delivery suitable for touring, and 100hp with progressive delivery for city use. \nRiding Modes\nThe Diavel incorporates the very latest in innovative Ducati technologies, including electronic Riding Modes. Selectable from the left-hand switchgear – even while riding – the choice of three pre-set modes are programmed to instantly change the character of the Diavel. The three modes are enabled by combining class-leading technologies such as Ride-by-Wire (RbW) and Ducati Traction Control (DTC). The RbW system administers different mappings to regulate power delivery by interpreting the rider’s throttle input, while the world-beating DTC uses eight levels of system interaction to enhance control by reducing rear wheel-spin under heavy acceleration. Although each mode has pre-set values of RbW and DTC, each of these two elements can be finely adjusted within each of the three Riding Modes and saved to create a personalised riding experience.\nSport\nThe Sport Riding Mode provides the Diavel rider with an adrenalin-fuelled 162hp ride and enables the rider to have full-on throttle response for maximum acceleration. Ensuring the full Testastretta 11° experience, the Sport mode also lowers the DTC system intervention to level 1 for riders who prefer their performance a little closer to the traction limit.\nTouring\nThe Touring Riding Mode is also programmed to produce 162hp, however, with a smoother, more user-\nfriendly power delivery. Rear end traction is enhanced by increasing DTC system intervention to level 3, specifically intended for an enjoyable and relaxing ride ideal for long distance and ensuring maximum comfort for both the rider and passenger.\nUrban\nAs riding on city streets can require more attention to the surroundings than to throttle inputs, the Urban Riding Mode instantly changes the Diavel to provide a manageable and confident ride. Power output is reduced to 100hp and DTC is further enhanced to level 5 to provide a higher system intervention during the most chaotic of stop-start traffic.\n\nDucati Traction Control\nThe racing-derived Ducati Traction Control (DTC) is a highly intelligent system which acts as a filter between the rider’s right hand and the rear tyre. Within milliseconds, DTC is able to detect and control rear wheel-\nspin, considerably increasing the bike’s active safety and performance. DTC is an integral part of the pre-\nprogrammed Riding Modes on the Ducati Diavel and enables riders to fully enjoy the power of the Testastretta 11° engine.\nThe system offers eight levels of “sensitivity”, each programmed with an amount of rear wheel-spin tolerance. These levels are in line with progressive levels of riding skills classified from one to eight. Level one is programmed to offer the least amount of interaction for sport-oriented riders, while level eight uses the most amount of interaction for complete confidence. DTC levels are factory pre-set in each of the three Riding Modes, but can be individually customised and saved to suit the rider by accessing the new user-friendly set-up menu. A “default” option is available to easily return all settings to factory pre-sets.\n \nDUCATI DIAVEL CARBON\nPerformance combined with style The 205kg (452lb) Diavel Carbon embodies the true nature of the Diavel concept, where performance combines with style to celebrate Italian engineering at its best. Lightweight composites and milled aluminium components meld the two worlds of sport and style with features that are both visually beautiful and functionally high-performance.\nThe Diavel Carbon comes in stunning “Red Carbon” (gloss red over matte carbon) with red frame or the brand new Star White Carbon (gloss white over matte carbon) and white frame. Carbon fibre is used for the tank panels, single-seat cover and front mudguard, reducing weight and applying a race-like feature that runs deep in the DNA of Ducati.\nHelping the Diavel Carbon to accelerate faster, stop sooner and change direction with even more agility is a valuable 5.5lb (2.5kg) saving of “unsprung weight” by using beautifully forged, lightweight Marchesini wheels. The wheels, which are finished in black, are machine-turned and milled for maximum weight reduction and intricately engineered decoration. The black disc carriers undergo a similar milling process to enhance the recess around the weight saving cut-outs, the natural aluminium colour contrasting effectively against the original black carrier.\nDiavel colours and defining features\nThe new Diavel is exclusively dressed in Dark Stealth livery with a continuing theme of black trellis frame and wheels and matching black-finished silencers. The Diavel Carbon offers the choice of traditional Ducati Red with high-tech Matte Carbon and red frame or the stunning new Star White with Matte Carbon and white frame. Both Carbon Diavel models roll on black, forged wheels by Marchesini, turned and milled to expose the natural aluminium.\nAll models feature tank-side air-ducts and headlamp body in black anodised, brushed aluminium and black- finished foot control pedals, bars and mirrors. Additionally, all three colour versions are equipped with stylish, horizontally-ribbed seat upholstery with prominent red stitching on the Diavel Carbon red model. \n Text and images: Official Ducati Diavel press release\nAdvertisements",

This win is the fifth time for it.\nThe official press release from MotoGP.com is after the jump. \nAlmost 85,000 MotoGP™, fans were gathered at the Mugello Circuit on the 3rd of July last year to witness the Gran Premio d’Italia TIM, which saw then reigning World Champion, Jorge Lorenzo, take his second victory of the season after battling with his eventual successor as title holder, Casey Stoner.\nOnce again, the Italian venue provided a thrilling spectacle in all three World Championship classes and, despite the weekend being marred by intermittent rain, riders were able to fully enjoy the improved grip levels thanks to the recently laid new tarmac. Off-track, teams and staff were able to work in excellent conditions in a paddock upgraded to MotoGP standards over the past few years.\nProud of the recognition given to the Mugello Circuit, track CEO Paolo Poli declared: “I consider this award recognition of Italian excellence around the world. This is proof that Italy is able to answer – with the strength of tradition and innovation – to global challenges defining this difficult historical period. The Italian Grand Prix will remain the most important event of our sporting calendar in years to come. In addition, we will continue our positive relationship with Dorna and IRTA, whose professionalism has allowed motorcycle racing to be more successful and popular than ever.”\nIRTA President Herve Poncharal noted: “The best Grand Prix is voted by the teams, and the teams talk to the riders, mechanics and press officers. So it’s not only the track, it’s everything, how everybody feels about the Grand Prix and how everybody feels at home there. So I’m personally very happy that they’ve won it for the fifth time. I’m delighted to think we’re going to go back there quite soon and this is well-deserved.”\nLast year, Dorna Sports S.L and the Mugello circuit reached agreement on a new five-year deal, meaning the Italian Grand Prix will continue to be held at the Tuscan circuit until at least 2016. In 2012, the Tuscan circuit will host the 9th round of the MotoGP World Championship on the 15th of July.\nAdvertisements",

This kind of switch is easy to be moved from left to right and also easy to push to kill the signal. The one from 135LC, for me, is not ergonomic and not user-friendly. The signal switch type is specific for this 135LC and I think it should be change next time if this bike got updated. I don’t like the center kill switch knob that protrude from the center of the signal switch. This make using it for lighting up the left signal lamp is difficult. Now, I know why sometimes riders didn’t use signal lamp when taking left turn or even right turn.\nThe low-hi beam switch from 115ZR are also much better than the 135LC and have better look. The low-hi switch are easy to use and sometimes you even forgot how well it is being designed since it didn’t get in your way when you want to use it. It just works.\nOne more nice features of the 115ZR switch panel is that there is illumination of the icon on the panel. Very good attention to detail by 115ZR designer.\nAdvertisements",

        "700cc\nXSR700\nYamaha \n\n2016 Yamaha XSR700 – this is the Japanese modern retro you are looking for \n\n\nPosted on July 24, 2015July 24, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nMade from the base model of the MT-07, Yamaha engineers proves that they can still have the idea of interesting retro styled bike. Yamaha introduces the XSR700 fitted with the 270-degree crankshaft crossplane philosophy. It burns 698cc of fuel in the configuration of 2-inline 4-stroke liquid-cooled engine. The power is rated at 55.0 kW (74.8PS) @ 9,000 rpm and 68.0 Nm (6.9 kg-m) @ 6,500 rpm.  Why retro? For me, the design is timeless. It will always looks good in any era.\nThe tagline for this XSR700 is ‘Born Tomorrow’ which I think refers to the technology that is cutting edge but styling that feels 60-70s. The use of the digital meter here shows that XSR700 is NOT trying to hide its age by using a much advanced meter style. Enclosed in circular shape, it still looks good and ‘in place’. This must have been a perfect combination of modern and retro. Some bikes are just trying to much to be retro and left out the tech behind.\nThe rear lights remind me of the Yamaha Bolt which features a circular design with LED lights inside it. The round headlight adds the simplicity and makes it still feels retro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is not left behind with the use of dual disc brake at the front sized 282mm bitten by 4-piston caliper on each side.

Riders Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi arrive in perfect form, World Champion Lorenzo leading the 2013 standings and teammate Rossi right behind in second after a dazzling performance by both riders at the season opener in Qatar two weeks ago.   \nThis will be the debut COTA MotoGP race with only a very few riders having ever visited the track before. Lorenzo and Rossi are among those few having enjoyed a private test at the circuit in pre-season. Created by leading circuit designer Hermann Tilke, the track will challenge the MotoGP grid over 21 laps with an incredible 41 metre elevation change as it winds through an impressive 20 separate turns over its 5.513km length. The track enjoys a variety of styles including fast sweeping sections and stop-and-go hairpin turns.\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\nQatar was stunning for us. A great start of a really competitive season. It’s always crucial to make a good beginning but Losail was just the first race of a long season. Now we have to change our mindset, we go to the USA and we visit a completely different track, not just the layout but also for the asphalt, the climate and some different circumstances.  The Austin track has a very long straight and several corners in first gear where you are need good acceleration and traction. There we will have to work really hard from the first session to cut away the distance to our competitors. Anyway, I keep my confidence that we can also make a good result there. I want to win at Austin and that’s my mentality although I know in the USA it will be much more complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\nAustin will not be an easy race but for sure the podium in Qatar is giving us extra motivation. We have done a great job there and we can go to Austin with some more certainty. Our competitors will be very strong but our goal will be to bring home points. I am confident, I really like the track and my first impression, when we tested there, was that the circuit is beautiful. The track lay-out is very special: there is some downhill and uphill and the first braking zone is very technical. For me turn two is the best though and after when you enter into the chicane. The straight is very long, which is good for overtaking. I really look forward to racing at COTA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“I couldn’t go a few weeks ago to the test at COTA but what I hear about the track is that the feelings are much more different to the other circuits. Maybe it is because it’s new, with a special layout. We won at Qatar, this was a fantastic start for us and also for Yamaha but we have to think ahead and the season is long and hard. In theory, Austin is not really a circuit that will benefit us. Anyway, we will see how much we can improve our performance compared with the test and see about our pace over there. Finally, this is racing and you never know until Sunday!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\nWe are going to Austin now in a different shape to one month ago. The data we collected there will help us to prepare the base set up with which we will start the practices and also for sure the results in Qatar will be helpful too. The latest modifications we’ve made to our bikes are going to help. Austin for us is not going to be an easy race but for sure it’s going to be better than the test.

        "700cc\nducati\nMonster \n\nDucati Monster 795 to be Unveiled on 20th October in Sepang, Malaysia \n\n\nPosted on October 7, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nDucati’s first serious bid to tap into the booming Asian market is to happen this month itself, with launch of an affordable new Monster, the world’s best-known naked motorcycle.  \nDubbed the 795, this new Monster will be priced significantly lower than the Monster 796, which is already available in India. As suggested by the name, the 795 retains all the 796’s Monster DNA, tweaked to play its new role, so bringing the brand within closer reach of Indian power bikers.\nThe 795 will benefit from lower import duties for being assembled at Ducati’s new Thailand plant that goes live shortly. However, don’t think of this as a cheap Ducati, for the 795 will retain complete Ducati quality standards in terms of design, engineering and performance.\nThe Thailand facility will be a Ducati assembly station, with motorcycles assembled here being designed and engineered in Italy, with every engine brought in from the Borgo Panigale factory, Bologna. Assembly of motorcycles in Thailand will be entrusted to Ducati-trained technicians and subject to the highest quality standards, with use of a majority of European components.\nThe L-twin, air-cooled and twin-valve engine is expected to sport shortstroke dimensions, a Desmodromic valve train, and perhaps lower power output than the 87bhp currently offered by the 796. Although torque and engine character will remain strong, we do hope Ducati is able to gear the new bike to suit our region – the 796 suffers tall gear ratios that make it less than ideal to ride in Indian conditions. Expect a trellis frame with a dual-side swingarm on the Monster 795 instead of the 796’s single-side swingarm.\nThe Monster 795 is rumoured to be unveiled alongside the Malaysian MotoGP, October 20-21, a fitting venue for this Asian market model.\nvia autoshift.net via AutoCarIndia via www.monster.ducati.com\nAdvertisements",

You need to look hard and you’ll be rewarded. This time, my friend, Charles from USA, has send me the link of this mini monster with CBR150R engine fitted.  I’m seeing one of the cleanest execution made for this Dax to install a new heart for it. It looks like it mean to be there.Big air filter fills up the side view of the bike. The size of the engine is exaggerated with the stock small sized wheel. Considering the CBR150R comes with DOHC setup, it just make the technical aspect of the bike become better. It is also liqud-cooled, so you can travel longer distance with less trouble of overheating.\nThe rear end features double-exhaust flaming out from the side with big muffler in carbon fiber. The wheels are coloured in bright orange so you won’t missed the view of this bike if it come near you. This monkey bike is no monkey business at all.\nThe stock tank can fill up 2.3 liters of fuel but Andre has modded it so that now it is able to fit in 10 liters of petrol! Big tanks mean longer riding distance with lower fuel station stops. Nice idea for touring!\nAnd here is the word by the owner itself (andrekoopmans):\nDouble Overhead camshaft engine, 150 cc, liquid cooled, 4 valves, 28 Keihin CV carburator with K&N filter, double open carbon fiber exhausts. 22 Horsepower at 11000 RPM. only 78 kg (!) Topspeed 140 Km/h. The only one in the world ! The engine came from a Honda CBR 150 R. The under-side of the dax-frame is completely build by myself. The biggest part of the whole frame is petrol-tank now, so instead of the original 2,3 litres I can tank almost 10 litres of petrol now ! Exhaust systeme is also homemade, the parts of it came from a crashed Ducati racer. The rear-fork is made much stronger to stay in one pease with the increased power. Standard engine was a 6 horsepower 110 cc SOHC-engine. Every orange part is powdercoated, the tires are Michelin semi-slicks. It was a nice job and it is a delight to ride this little beast, because of the double open race-exhaust together with the 28 Keihin and shouting K&N, it sounds like a superbike at full battle ! But it is also possible make a nice and pleasant tour.\nThe picture is All Rights Reserved to andrekoopmans.

This bike is equipped with 4-stroke 125cc engine that is said to focus for power and fuel efficiency. The compression ratio for this bike is quite high at 9.6:1, compared to Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR at 9.3:1 and Honda Wave RS at 9.0:1. Higher compression ratio can give higher power without the additional displacement needed. Simply said, it means it gives more powerful kick at each of the power stroke.\nSuzuki Axelo comes in two model Axelo S and Axelo R. The latter (Axelo R) features manual hand clutch version which is a great addition to this line-up since it provides better traction control for sportier riding style. The Axelo S comes in automatic clutch for easier operation in city driving. One more great features available from this Axelo is the usage of rear disc brake for both models. This will add more safety for riders as disc brake are definitely better than drum brakes in terms of power and maintenance. The Axelo R as I can see is only available in blue colour, while the Axelo S version has three colours to choose from that is red, blue and black.\nCheck out 3 more pictures, more specs and price of the Suzuki Axelo after the jump  \n\n\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n\nEngine Type\n4-stroke, air-cooled, SOHC\n\n\nBore x Stroke\n53.5mm x 55.2mm\n\n\nPiston Displacement\n124cm³\n\n\nCompression Ratio\n9.6 : 1\n\n\nCarburetor\nMIKUNI VM 18\n\n\nStarter System\nElectric Starter & Kick starter\n\n\nLubrication System\nWet Sump\n\n\nClutch\nWet Shoe, Automatic, Centrifugal Type – Axelo R\nWet, Multi-plate Type – Axelo S\n\n\nDrive System\nRK-M 428, 100 links\n\n\nFront Suspension\nTelescopic, Coil Spring, Oil-damped\n\n\nRear Suspension\nSwingarm Type, Coil Spring, Oil-damped\n\n\nFront Tyre Size\n70/90 – 17 M/C 38P\n\n\nRear Tyre Size\n80/90 – 17 M/C 44P\n\n\nIgnition Type\nDigital (DC-CDI)\n\n\nSpark Plug\nDENSO: U20FS-U, NGK: C6HSA\n\n\nBattery\n12V 10.8KC (3AH)/10HR\n\n\nBattery\n12V 10.8KC (3AH)/10HR\n\n\nFuel Tank\n4.1L\n\n\nEngine Oil\nWithout Filter Change – 800ml\nWith Filter Change – 900ml\n\n\nOverall Length\n1,895 mm\n\n\nOverall Width\n715 mm\n\n\nOverall Height\n1,075 mm\n\n\nWheelbase\n1,220 mm\n\n\nKerb Weight\n108 kg\n\n\nPrice*\n\nBasic Sales Price* : RM\n\nBasic Sales Price*: RMNote: * Basic Sales Price Only in Peninsular Malaysia ( Exclude road tax, registration, insurance & Others charges)\nPrice Subjected to change without prior notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuzuki are now offering free Suzuki helmet and Suzuki riding jacket for Axelo buyer until 31st October 2011.

No doubt, I am really excited and looking forward to this new challenge,” said Khairul during the Asia Dream Cup Moto3 test at the Pasir Gudang Circuit in Johor today.\nWhen asked about his thoughts about competing in two different championships at the same time, Khairul added, “For sure flying in and out of the country is going to be tough and tiring. In fact, it would be easier to just focus on one championship. However, the management believes Cub Prix is necessary because it helps keep my competitive edge. After all, the Moto3 championship has only eight rounds with a lot of spare time in between.”\nKhairul will make his debut in the FIM CEV Repsol Moto3 Junior World Championship  when he attends the pre-season test at the Jerez Circuit in Spain on the 27th and 28th February.\nAdvertisements",

These two 2012 models kick off the beginning of an exciting new season for Honda.\n“This pair of 2012 new-model releases really illustrates the great diversity we have in styles of machinery for Honda customers,” said Powersports Press Manager Bill Savino. “Both the Gold Wing and Foreman serve as the newest extensions of incredibly popular models that have built up large and loyal fan bases in their respective fields over the years. The Gold Wing now expands its reputation as the premier touring motorcycle in the world, while the Foreman is the newest iteration in a full line of machines built to work—but are also ready to lead the way to good times when a day off comes around. With these two especially popular models we’re starting off the 2012 model year in a big way, and we’re equally excited about the additional new releases to follow later this year.”\nThe first opportunities to view these new Honda models will be at the International Motorcycle Show in Greenville, South Carolina, February 25-27 and Daytona Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida, March 5-12.\nMore detailed information and images of Honda’s model line can be found on powersports.honda.com or see your local Honda powersports dealer.\n– Gold Wing: The Gold Standard For Two-Wheeled Journeys\nLong acknowledged as the pinnacle of two-up motorcycling, the 2012 Gold Wing® continues its remarkable legacy. Its travel-oriented creds include the latest generation of sophisticated electronic amenities, starting with an updated and innovative GPS navigation system with user-friendly programmability for sharing favorite ride routes with friends and other riders, which can be accessed online via computer. The Gold Wing also now incorporates a built-in MP3/iPod® interface for a new SRS CS Auto™ technology surround-sound system for a premium listening experience. In addition to its renowned power-laden yet refined drivetrain and delightfully sporty handling, the 2012 Gold Wing also brings upgraded styling, increased luggage capacity, greater protection from wind and weather, revised suspension settings for enhanced ride compliance, and unparalleled comfort for both rider and passenger.

For 2012, the Foreman line of ATVs boasts a brand-new liquid-cooled 475cc single-cylinder OHV four-stroke engine that’s powerful enough for taking on those extra-tough jobs. The introduction of a new fuel injection system with 36mm throttle body for instant throttle response, consistent performance at high altitude, and hassle-free cold-weather starting adds to the Foreman’s performance package. The rolling chassis has been re-engineered as well, featuring an all-new and lighter rear suspension system incorporating a single, high-quality shock for increased comfort, precision, and work capabilities, plus a shorter wheelbase for agile handling and a tighter turning radius. With a wide variety of choices in configuration including manual shifting or Honda’s renowned Electric Shift Program (ESP®) that delivers push-button convenience for shifting, plus the option of Electric Power Steering (EPS) there’s a model to suit everybody. Throw in new body styling with a more aggressive look and you have one full-sized machine that will carry you through a week’s worth of chores with ease, then beg for some playtime adventuring come the weekend.

We don’t have anything to expect at first and thought that it is only an accessory to add style to the bike. At first, the fitment of the handguard looks odd and unusual. In fact, I have never seen any Yamaha 135LC fitted with this thing.  \n\nThen, after a few riding test for daily use of going to work and back, we found that it has great benefits! First thing that we notice is that the handguard can protect you from the cold wind breeze in the morning. You should know that my friend is already wearing a hand glove every time he ride the bike. In this case, the handguard makes driving in the morning is much more comfortable and you can drive much faster without feeling cold in the hand.\n\nThe handguard also comes with a strip of LED light that is powered by a set of AAA battery with included in the package. You don’t have to do any additional wiring for the lighting. It works separately. This light looks great in the dark and can makes your bike more visible in low light conditions.\n\nOther than that, it also protects from the debris or dust from the road hitting your hand directly.

Tickets are priced at RM100 for the Main Grandstand North for the early bird and still available right now to buy. This could be one of the most awaited race series that motorcycle fans from Malaysia are waiting for.\n\nThe cheapest tickets available is at RM30 for the C2 Hillstand and that is affordable enough for everyone to start saving now. Based on my comparison to the tickets price, it seems that overall ticket price on every place for WSBK is much cheaper than the tickets for MotoGP. This maybe due to their(SIC) perception about WSBK than is less popular than the MotoGP, but in my humble opinion, I think, there are many more people wanted to see the production bike being pushed to the limit on the track. After the race ended, they can just go back to the shop to check out their favourite production that they like from WSBK race, which they cannot do if it was MotoGP.\nMotoGP is interesting too but the bikes are not production bikes, so the races are quite irrelevant to us who wants to look for something that we can buy afterwards. There is a saying,’You win on Sunday, you sell on Monday’. Whether it is WSBK or MotoGP, I’ll heading for both of the races. Maybe F1 too.

The bike may be a new face here on our local ground but MiniGP racing had started in the 90s being hugely popular in countries such as USA and Italy. Smaller in dimension, the MiniGP is specifically designed for Grand Prix racing, which makes it an ideal machine for riders to hone their skills on. Pitrides Motorsports, the company that introduced Kayo MiniGP to Malaysia, has received positive feedback from experienced racers and national riders who have tested the bike (http://malaysian-riders.com/2014/08/07/malaysian-moto2-riders-supportsthe-minigp/).  \nA few months after the Kayo MiniGP was up for rental at the Speedway Plus Circuit, the number of enthusiasts increased rapidly and thus the Malaysia MiniGP Club (MMC) was formed. The club had since organized several races namely the “MiniGP Component Test (MCT)” and the “MMC Time Attack Challenge”. The same bikes used in these races had also been rented out to several training programs run by privateers with no problems to any of the machines. This has proven the capability of the bike as a reliable machine for circuit racing.\n\nThe “1 Minimoto Challenge, Malaysia 2014” race series will create a stage for MiniGP and other two wheelers riders to demonstrate their talents and compete with international riders. In the first round of its season, MMC has invited MiniGP club riders from neighboring countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and China to participate in this event. The Speedway Plus Circuit is an exciting challenge for our foreign friends as many of them will be riding in this well-known track for the first time. Apart from the MiniGP, the challenge includes race categories for Pocket Bikes, Supermoto CKD and Supermoto Open bikes. The event is highly anticipated by motorcycle enthusiasts nationwide as it will showcase some of the best local talents from the two wheelers motorsports arena. Members of the Media are invited to enter the MiniGP Demo Challenge for a firsthand experience and to explore the full capacity of the Kayo MiniGP MR150. \n\nThe Malaysian Ministry of Youth and Sports (KBS) has shown their support by endorsing the “1 Minimoto Challenge, Malaysia 2014” and are here to officiate the event. Furthermore, not only the participants will have a chance to win prizes at the event, the Smart Mata mobile application called “Smart-I”, a personal guide to extraordinary travel experiences in one of the world’s most exciting travel destination, endorsed by the Ministry of Tourism Malaysia & Visit Malaysia 2014, will run a lucky draw for a chance of winning an ipad and mobile phone at the event.\nThis event will be followed by a final round in October 2014. Stay tuned as we continue to reveal the best that Kayo MiniGP has to offer.\nAdvertisements",

M600 looks small and much more beginners friendly in terms of weight and ride height. I’m an underbone rider and never had the chance to ride a big bikes like this, but after trying to seat in and leaning it to about 45 degree to the side, I think this bike is easy to handle.

Why? \n\n\nPosted on October 21, 2008 by eddy \n\n\nMaintainance-free battery for motorcycles\nBattery is not a very important aspect for bikers who drive RX-Z, 125Z and Honda EX5. This is because the battery is only used for signal indicator, fuel indicator and to drain the excessive voltage from the magnet to it.But, it is very important for those who use electric starter bike such as LC135, FZ-150i, Lagenda and scooters. The problem is the battery is always dead at the time when we needed it the most. Why is this happening?There can be three basic reason of why the battery can be dead:1. Battery itself is condemned (cannot retain the charge anymore).Solution: Replace the battery.\n2. The alternator (or cut-off) is damaged (cannot charge the battery anymore).Solution: Replace the alternator.\n3. The bike is not used regularly and used a lot in start stop condition. When this happen, the battery is drained more than it could be charged by the alternator.Solution: Charge the battery and use the bike regularly. If not, sell the bike to the one who needs it the most than you.\n\nAdvertisements",

It is a good time to see Suzuki GSX-R1000 that has been one of the best sports bike available officially in Malaysia. The four bikes are Suzuki GSX-R1000, Suzuki Hayabusa, Suzuki GSX-1250FA and Suzuki V-Strom 100 ABS.  \n\nPriced at RM96,900, this 182.50hp bike will excite your senses for speed. Suzuki has been known as the introducer of the twin spar aluminium frame that provides lightweight but strong chassis. This method has been used and copied until this day.\n\nThis red and white Hayabusa needs no introduction anymore since it is known as one of the fastest production bike with 194hp inline-four 4-stroke engine. This could be the bike you would have in your garage if you want top performing production bike in the world along with the ZX14R for you to get your heart racing. Price for the Hayabusa is RM99,000.\n\nV-Strom 1000 ABS make its way too for the fun naked touring bike priced at RM79,999. It comes with 1,037cc inline-four engine with power expected to be more than 100hp (no official data provided). This is an upgrade from the V-Strom 650 earlier.\n\nThe cheapest of the lot is the GSX-1250FA in sports tourer category at RM72,900 where it provides 97hp but with plenty of torque at 108Nm from the low RPM range at 3,700RPM. For comparison, GSX-R1000 will give 110Nm but you need to rev it up to 10,000RPM to get its optimum power. This definitely will give a great pulling power even you are cruising at 3rd gear to overtake a truck or some other big vehicle on your journey.\nimages from: http://www.suzuki.com.my/v3/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=388&Itemid=486\nprices via: https://www.facebook.com/sinarturbo\nAdvertisements",

Looking at the above picture from AsphalatandRubber, I’m not sure whether it refers to the Ninja 300 or not since it is looking identical to the Ninja 250R. Confirmed, it is Ninja 300 picture as released by motoblog.it. \nThen, we are asking this question, what will happen to the newly refresh 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R? Well, the Ninja 250R will be selling alongside the Ninja 300. This will make the choices for biker become much harder, the thing that can separate you between the choices is money. But wait, there is also Ninja 400R which is based on the ER6n.\nThere not many bikes with 300cc in the market right now, and if any of the manufacturer can make a good bike out of the capacity, we as riders will be very happy.\nRead more about it at: AsphaltandRubber\nAdvertisements",

Sementara Modenas Z650 pula ditawarkan pada harga RM34,500 bagi warna Metallic Spark Black dan RM35,200 bagi Metallic Matte Graphenesteel Gray. \n\nKedua-dua model ini dikuasakan enjin parallel-twin 649cc yang menawarkan 67.3hp pada 8,000rpm dan 65.7Nm pada 6,500rpm.\nMenariknya, kedua-duanya merupakan model terbaru yang diperkenalkan untuk pasaran global pada September tahun lalu. Hasilnya, kedua-dua model ini dilengkapi fungsi Kawasaki Traction Control (KTRC) tiga peringkat yang boleh diselaraskan mengikut kesesuaian. \n\nDalam mod 1, sistem tersebut akan mengukur kadar pusingan tayar bagi meningkatkan tahap cengkaman sewaktu masuk dan keluar dari selekoh.\nSementara itu mod 2 pula boleh diaktifkan sekiranya menunggang di atas permukaan licin – jalan basah, berpasir dan berbatu. Mod 2 akan memastikan ‘traction control’ bertindak lebih cepat bagi mengimbangkan motosikal.\n\nBagi yang mahukan cabaran dan tunggangan lasak terutamanya di litar, pengguna juga boleh menyahaktifkan KTRC sekaligus.\nPengguna boleh akses fungsi KTRC menerusi paparan skrin TFT berwarna yang disertakan.\n\nPenggunaan kerangka jenis steel trellis juga dikekalkan dan dipadankan bersama fork teleskopik 41mm di depan dan penyerap hentakan jenis ‘back-link’ di belakang.\nAdvertisements",

As we all know, the benefit of using of the 2-stroke engine is in the lightweight construction and higher output about 40% more powerful than equivalent 4-stroke engine. For example, motocross racing in USA has replaced 250cc 2-stroke bike with equivalently powerful 450cc 4-stroke bike. Engines with 2-stroke system are much easier to maintain as they are fewer parts to look out for, whereby 4-stroke engine need more love and care.\nThis DKW 2-stroke car is an amazing machine to be heard. It sounds very much like the high RPM racing engine car like the Audi R8 race car. You need to view the video to hear the engine in action.

        "motogp\nYamaha \n\nYamaha One Two as Rossi Returns to the Top in Jerez \n\n\nPosted on March 25, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe second day of the final pre-season MotoGP test was again played out in difficult weather conditions yesterday with riders having to splash through a water-filled morning before being able to enjoy some dry track time later in the afternoon. Valentino Rossi was finally given the conditions that allowed him to show his pleasure at being back on the YZR-M1. In the afternoon’s dry spell and on a European circuit he knows well, the nine time Champion rose quickly to the top of the timesheets, staying there until the close of the day and reminding everyone that the special relationship between ‘the doctor’ and the M1 has not lost its magic.\nTeammate Jorge Lorenzo, Saturday’s fastest rider in the wet, was just 0.015 seconds behind Rossi as today’s session ended, the reigning World Champion continuing to stay on the pace at the sharp end of the time scores. Tech3 Satellite rider Cal Crutchlow was next in the standings, making a Yamaha 1,2,3.  \n \n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – 1st, 39 laps, Time – 1’39.525\n“Yesterday was very positive for us, I’m so happy, especially because we used a different style of setting. It is very important for us to understand this setting, which can help and effect my riding style to ride the bike in a better way and stay more constant, especially with good lap times on old tyres. To make the first position with a time of 39.5 is good and also staying at the level of Jorge more or less. Me and my team are very happy with the pace and I think we will try to continue to work on this way.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – 2nd, 34 laps, Time -1’39.540\n“The track was dry but not in perfect condition yesterday, there was not so much grip on the track and we had some problems on the acceleration of the corners where the bike was not very stable. In general it was a very positive test. We worked on suspension and electronics and we saw that compared to Austin the Yamahas’ were much more competitive. We ended in the three first positions and that is good for the motivation of the brand. The track is not in the best condition, it’s dry but it’s not perfect because of the rain. I think we have to focus on getting more stability on acceleration and get more comfortable with race pace.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“We are of course happy that it dried up and that we were able to do, I think 40 laps yesterday in dry conditions, lap times were not so bad. We are still not so satisfied with the set up so we will continue to work on that. Lap time wise you know Cal, Vale and Jorge are very close and in front of Honda which we are of course very happy with, but everything is quite tight! We need to work on more on the set up tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“Finally we managed to have a good and helpful practice yesterday. We were able work very well on the base set up and we had quite good results. Now we are ready to swap everything to the last new items to test today. We will confirm the difference between the two chassis’ and decide which one to use in Qatar. We didn’t have any problems yesterday, just good steps made by trying different settings. It has been a very positive day.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCrutchlow storms into top three at Jerez\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow took full advantage of improved weather conditions to storm into the top three on a second day of MotoGP testing in Jerez that was dominated by Yamaha’s 2013 YZR-M1 machine. Although there was no repeat of Saturday’s torrential rain, much brighter skies and a strong wind didn’t dry the track quickly enough for any meaningful testing to commence until after 1pm. Having waited patiently to start crucial set-up work on his YZR-M1 machine, Crutchlow was able to quickly find a fast pace and a 1.41.247 on only his third lap moved him into second position. As track conditions and grip levels improved, Crutchlow was able to improve his pace to a 1.39.574 that secured him a brilliant third position on the timesheets with a gap of just 49 thousandths of a second behind factory Yamaha duo Valentino Rossi and Jorge Lorenzo.\nThe majority of the afternoon session took place in sunny but breezy skies but the grey clouds that were a constant feature yesterday returned with 90 minutes of track time left and rain started to fall again. The showers quickly stopped but with conditions far from ideal, Crutchlow took no further part in proceedings.\nA dry track presented rookie Bradley Smith with the ideal opportunity to put in vital laps on slick tyres after Saturday’s rain had restricted him to just 14-laps on Bridgestone’s wet weather rubber. Smith was able to complete 41 laps in the afternoon and gain valuable time on track as he continued to adapt to the YZR-M1 machine. He set a personal best time of 1.41.398 that left him less than 0.1s outside of the top 10 and only 0.7 s away from the top six. He also grasped the chance to pursue nine-times World Champion Valentino Rossi for a short spell, learning how to improve his riding technique to suit the heavier and more powerful YZR-M1 after a two-year spell in the Moto2 category.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow, 3rd, 44 laps, Time – 1’39.574\n“I am very happy with how yesterday went and it was good to get in some laps in the dry. We had a few things to try with the bike and the weather meant we could assess what was positive and negative. It wasn’t easy at the start because the track was really dirty and then later on it got quite cold and slippery, but we got some important work completed on the set-up. My Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team did a great job and I am sure with some small adjustments tomorrow we can be faster. The pleasing aspect of yesterday was I was very consistent and that makes me confident for when we come back for the race here. The fact that the top three was filled by Yamaha also bodes well for the race in a few weeks. I am right in the mix with the factory bikes again and this is very satisfying for me.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith, 12th – 41 laps, Time – 1’41.398\n“Yesterday was positive because I really need dry track time and also to get some data of riding the bike on a track other than Sepang. I felt much happier than in Malaysia because it is a track I definitely like and we can see from the top three that it suits the Yamaha very well too. Immediately from the first exit I felt comfortable and knew my reference points quicker. It was easier for me to pick up the pace and we made some really good improvements and progress during the first four exits. We tried some set-up modifications to get an idea about my feedback and at that point we realized that we were going in the wrong direction and just as we came back to what I liked it started raining and that was a shame. I still need to improve a lot but the gap to the first six is not as big as Sepang and that is a positive. I followed Valentino for a short time yesterday and it was a very interesting experience. I could pick up some things about riding technique and I could understand that I need to be a little smoother.”\n\n\n\n\nJerez Day Two Test Times:\n1.

        "250cc\nCRF250L\nHonda \n\n2012 Honda CRF250L on sale in Japan starting 14th May – Malaysia by the end of the year \n\n\nPosted on April 19, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nTOKYO, Japan, April 13, 2012 – Honda announced the start of sales in Japan on May 14, 2012, of a new 250-cc on/off-road model, the CRF250L, which offers an agile ride in a wide range of riding environments from urban to offroad riding.  \nUnder the slogan, “‘New On & Off Gear, your right buddy on the road’ to make ‘On’ (daily life) more convenient and ‘Off’ (weekends) more enjoyable,” the development team, by pursuing total balance and driving stability to the utmost, created a vehicle that enables a broad spectrum of users from beginners to experienced riders to enjoy the sheer fun of handling the machine.\n\nThe CRF250L is powered by a liquid-cooled 250-cc 4-stroke DOHC single-cylinder engine with powerful output in the low-to-mid rpm range. Low-friction technologies including an offset cylinder are also employed to realize the excellent fuel efficiency of 44.3 km/L (measured at a constant speed of 60 km/h on a level road).\n\nA newly-designed frame makes use of the steel twin-tube structure to offer the rider a nimble ride while ensuring both agility and stability. In addition, an agile, high-performance run-through ability in a wide range of situations from urban riding to off road is realized through the adoption of an inverted suspension with a 250-mm cushion stroke for the front and the Pro-Link suspension with 240 mm of axle travel for the rear.\n\nStyling has been refined to be sharper and more aggressive while inheriting the basic concept of Honda’s CRF motocrosser series, resulting in a design that asserts a Honda identity fitting for a new-era CRF. Customers are offered a choice of two color schemes: Extreme Red to present an aggressive image or Ross White for those who wish to impart a cool image.\nMain Features of the CRF250L\nEngine\n\n\nThe engine aims for powerful output that can be handled with equal ease on on-road and off-road. While achieving powerful torque from the low rpm range to high, the CRF250L’s engine also boasts output characteristics expressing the smooth rev-up that typifies a liquid-cooled 4-stroke DOHC engine. The Programmed Fuel Injection System (PGM-FI*), the O2 sensor, catalyzer fitted inside the muffler, and the newly applied low-friction technologies embedded in such components as the offset cylinder and the roller rocker arm all form a synergy that delivers high environmental performance along with excellent fuel efficiency of 44.3 km/L (measured at a constant speed of 60 km/h on a level road).\n\n\n*\nPGM-FI is a registered trademark of Honda.\n\n\n\n\nVehicle body/suspension\n\n\nThe newly-designed frame makes use of a steel twin-tube design to offer a nimble ride while ensuring both agility and stability, and the oval cross-sectional shape of the main pipe helps boost rigidity while enabling a slim vehicle body. The inverted front suspension employs a Separate Function Front Fork having an inner tube diameter of 43 mm and a cushion stroke of 250 mm in a design that secures both light weight and high rigidity to deliver excellent operability and high driving stability. The aluminum monoblock cast swing arm yields high strength and proper rigidity balance and is paired with a Pro-Link rear suspension having 240 mm of axle travel providing the rider with impressive agility and high road-holding capability from urban riding to off road.\n\n\nStyling\n\n\nStyling has been refined into a sharper and more aggressive tone while inheriting the concept of “centralized mass with triangular proportions,” a key feature and basic principle of Honda’s CRF motocrosser series. This design asserts a Honda identity befitting the CRF for a new era. A surface encompassing tank shrouds, side covers, and a rear fender has been made flush to project an even sharper image. Meanwhile, the muffler cover and tool box on the left side add accent to the design by forming a shape reminiscent of a side racing number plate. The body comes in one of two colors, Extreme Red featuring a red seat to impose an aggressive image and Ross White with a silver seat to emanate a sense of coolness.\n\n\nKey equipment\n\n\nA headlight visor that enhances a tough and muscular look and a multi-reflector headlight (60/55 W) with superb visibility\nA multifunctional digital meter that incorporates a fuel meter, a clock, and trip/odometer\nSkid plates that prevent mud, flying gravel, and other elements from damaging the engine\nA handle turning angle that extends to 45° on both left and right in a design made for maneuverability\nCargo hooks in the rear fender section to make loading convenient\nFuel tank with a capacity of 7.7 liters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nModel name\nCRF250L\n\n\nVehicle name/type\nHonda/JBK-MD38\n\n\nDimensions (L×W×H) (mm)\n2,195×815×1,195\n\n\nWheelbase (mm)\n1,445\n\n\nGround clearance (mm)\n255\n\n\nSeat height (mm)\n875\n\n\nCurb weight (kg)\n143\n\n\nRiding capacity (No. of occupants)\n2\n\n\nMinimum turning radius (m)\n2.3\n\n\nEngine type\nMD38E, Liquid-cooled 4-stroke DOHC 4-valve single cylinder\n\n\nTotal displacement (cm3)\n249\n\n\nBore × Stroke (mm)\n76.0×55.0\n\n\nCompression ratio\n10.7\n\n\nMaximum output (kW[PS]/rpm)\n17[23]/8,500\n\n\nMaximum torque (N･m[kgf･m]/rpm)\n22[2.2]/7,000\n\n\nFuel efficiency (km/L)\n44.3\n(constant speed of 60 km/h on a level road)\n\n\nFuel supply system\nElectronic\n< Programmed Fuel Injection System (PGM-FI) >\n\n\nStarter type\nSelf starter\n\n\nIgnition type\nFull-transistor battery ignition\n\n\nLubricating type\nWet sump\n\n\nFuel tank capacity (L)\n7.7\n\n\nClutch type\nWet multiplate with coil springs\n\n\nTransmission type\nConstant mesh 6-speed return\n\n\nTransmission gear ratios\n1st\n3.333\n\n\n2nd\n2.117\n\n\n3rd\n1.571\n\n\n4th\n1.304\n\n\n5th\n1.115\n\n\n6th\n0.962\n\n\nReduction gear ratio\n(primary/secondary)\n2.807/2.857\n\n\nCaster angle (°) /Trail (mm)\n27°35´/113\n\n\nTire size\nFront\n3.00-21 51P\n\n\nRear\n120/80-18M/C 62P\n\n\nBrake type\nFront\nHydraulic disc\n\n\nRear\nHydraulic disc\n\n\nSuspension type\nFront\nTelescopic (Inverted)\n\n\nRear\nSwing arm (Pro-Link suspension system)\n\n\nFrame type\nSemi-double cradle\n\n\n\n\n*\nManufacturer: Thai Honda Manufacturing Co., Ltd.\nManufacturing country: Thailand\nImporter from Thailand: Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\nvia: http://world.honda.com/CRF250L/?r=m\n\nAdvertisements",

The difference can be seen at the teeth count of both of the gear box. Usually this teeth count is being measured in terms of gear ratios. CMS Hi-Way Racing Gear Box uses a lower ratio compared to stock gear box as this is due to power delivery from the engine is better for a modified Yamaha 135LC and this helps the bike to deliver better power at all RPM range.\nThe installation of this CMS Hi-Way Racing Gear Box is very straight forward and just a matter of plug-and-play.

        "motogp \n\nJerez Welcomes Yamaha as MotoGP Returns to Europe \n\n\nPosted on May 1, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing riders Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi arrive in Southern Spain this week for the first European Grand Prix of the 2013 season, the Gran Premio Bwin de España on the 5th May at the Circuito de Velocidad de Jerez de la Frontera.\nWith two rounds gone, reigning world Champion Lorenzo arrives currently tied on points at the top of the Championship standings with fellow Spaniard and premier class rookie Marc Marquez. After a challenging race weekend in Austin with a track not best suited to the capabilities of the YZR-M1, Lorenzo will be keen to begin his weekend in Jerez, the Andalucian track has accorded him and impressive run of victories with two 250cc wins in 2006 and 2007 and a further two premier class victories in 2010 and 2011. Last year saw him take second on the podium, just 0.9 seconds from a third potential premier class win. Lorenzo still holds the Jerez record for the fastest lap and the best pole, both from 2008. The 2013 Championship challenger made his MotoGP debut in the 125cc class at Jerez, although he was forced to miss the first qualifying session because he was too young. The future star turned 15yrs of age before the second session, going out to ride in front of his home crowd for his first Grand Prix experience.   \nValentino Rossi arrives eager to attack the European tracks he knows intimately aboard his YZR-M1. Rossi sits in fourth in standings after Qatar and Austin, just 11 points adrift of the top spot. The nine-time World Champion has an impressive record at Jerez with a staggering six premier class wins and two additional victories in the 125cc and 250cc classes. In 13 starts at Jerez Rossi has taken nine podium finishes.\nThe Jerez circuit was built in 1986 with the first Grand Prix taking place one year later. The 4.423km Jerez circuit sits within a natural amphitheatre and is characterised by numerous quick direction changes and few hard braking points.\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\nWe arrive in Jerez, a nice track that is really special for all the Spanish riders involved in this Championship and always supported by the huge crowd on the grandstands. We have to keep calm and think about the Championship because it is so long.   Normally Jerez is a better track for Yamaha but you never know with this level of riding where you are going to find your best circuit.   Jerez is smaller than Austin and the straight is much shorter, this will give us less disadvantage. The flowing corners will also help us a lot. Jerez is one of my favourite tracks and we will be competitive there for sure.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n”Jerez will be a very important race. I believe and hope that we can be very fast as we have been in testing. We will have to work well and aim for the podium. We still have something to do, especially for the set up of the bike but we have some ideas. Furthermore on Monday after the race we will be testing there and we’ll have the opportunity to try different things. Jerez, Le Mans and Mugello are all circuits that are favourable to us and where we will be fine.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\nJerez is one of our favourite tracks, bus also for our major rivals I would say. Our bike should work better there than it did in Austin. So we hope to be much more competitive in Jerez. The grip is a completely different level but everybody will have better grip on that track. Hopefully we are able to close the gap and to compete, to fight and to get the benefit of extra grip as we did in Qatar. The podium is our goal. There are many races to go and the podium is our aim for every one.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n”We have great expectations for Jerez, we had a really good test there so we know we can already start with a good set up. Both riders were very fast and consistent during the three days we rode there pre-season. We are really looking forward to this coming weekend and we are confident of a good result. After the race there will be other tests and it will be very important to try new things.  ”\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\nAge 25\nLives Barcelona (Spain)\nBike Yamaha\nGP victories 45 (24 x MotoGP, 17 x 250cc, 4 x 125cc)\nFirst GP victory Brazil, 2003 (125cc)\nFirst GP Jerez, Spain, 2002 (125cc)\nGP starts 181 (87 x MotoGP, 48 x 250cc, 46 x 125cc)\nPole position 52 (26 x MotoGP, 23 x 250cc, 3 x 125cc)\nWorld Championships 4 (MotoGP 2010/12, 250cc, 2006/7)\nValentino Rossi\nAge 34\nLives Tavullia (Italy)\nBike Yamaha\nGP victories 105 (79 x MotoGP/500cc, 14 x 250cc, 12 x 125cc)\nFirst GP victory Czec Republic, 1996 (125cc)\nFirst GP Malaysia, 1996 (125cc)\nGP starts 278 (218 x MotoGP/500cc, 30 x 250cc, 30 x 125cc)\nPole position 59 (49 x MotoGP/500cc, 5 x 250cc, 5 x 125cc)\nWorld Championships 9 (MotoGP 2009/08/05/04/03/02, 500cc 2001, 250cc 1999, 125cc 1997)\nCircuit information\nTechnical Informations\nCircuit Jerez de la Frontera\nLocation Jerez de la Frontera, Spain\nLength (m) 4423\nWidth (m) 11\nTurns 13\nTurns righ 8\nTurns left 5\nPole position left\nAdvertisements",

        "Bridgestone\nparts \n\nBridgestone unveils second generation “Air Free Concept Tyre” \n\n\nPosted on December 12, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nIs this the future of tyre technology? Non-pneumatic tyre? Tyre that doesn’t needs air? That is an interesting concept to think of. Without the need of air, there is no more possibility of tyre puncture which will definitely helps for worry-free ride. The spokes holding up the tyre in the inner part are from thermoresin plastic that is recyclable, that adds up to more parts that can be recycled other than the center hub. Along with the low rolling friction with the tyre, there will be lower needs to use the engine power to move the vehicle.\nThere will be some more years before we can really see this kind of air-free tyre available for the masses. Further reading is provided by the official release by Bridgestone:  \n\nBridgestone Corporation revealed its second generation “Air Free Concept (Non-Pneumatic) Tyre” at last month’s 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. The revolutionary new design features improved load-bearing capabilities, environmental design and driving performance. The latest improvements to the “Air Free Concept Tyre” brings Bridgestone one step closer to a viable, commercially available air free tyre.\nSpecial Features of “Air Free Concept Tyre”\nWith a unique structure of spokes stretching along the inner sides of the tyres supporting the weight of the vehicle, there is no need to periodically refill the tyres with air, meaning that the tyres require less maintenance. At the same time the worry of punctures is eliminated. In addition, the spoke structure is made from thermoplastic resin*1 and, along with the rubber in the tread portion, the materials used in the tyres are recyclable, contributing to the efficient use of resources. Further, by pursuing extremely low rolling resistance and contributing to reductions in CO2 emissions through use of proprietary technologies, Bridgestone believes it is possible to achieve even higher levels of environmental friendliness and safety. Bridgestone is pursuing this technological development with the aim of achieving a “cradle to cradle” process that proactively maximizes the cyclical use of resources from worn tyres into new tyres and the use of recyclable resources.\nNew technologies used in and special features of the second generation tyres are as follows.\n1.       Increased Versatility Through Improved Load-Bearing Capabilities and Driving Performance\nBridgestone is further optimizing the spoke structure by using high-strength but flexible high-performance resin as a material and employing finite element method (FEM) simulations in the design to reduce stress and deformation in the inner part of the tyre. By doing so, the second generation of “Air Free Concept tyre” has increased versatility through improved load-bearing capabilities and driving performance compared with the first generation *2. High-speed travel (maximum 60 km/h) in ultralight vehicles*3 has also become possible.\n2.       Pursuing Low Rolling Resistance to Reduce CO2 Emissions\nAbout 90% of energy loss from tyre rolling resistance comes from repeated changes in the shape of tyres as they roll. In the second generation of airless tyres, Bridgestone has succeeded in making a significant reduction in energy loss by using proprietary materials technologies and simplifying the structure of the tyres. As a result, these “Air Free Concept tyre” have achieved the same level of low rolling resistance as our pneumatic fuel-efficient tyres, making possible a contribution to reductions in CO2 emissions.\nThe Bridgestone Group’s Environmental Mission Statement outlines its goal to help contribute to a more sustainable society, with particular emphasis on three areas: ecological conservation, resource conservation, and reduction of CO2 emissions. The statement clarifies the direction of the Group’s long-term environmental aspirations as it pushes forward with a variety of activities that contribute to environmental preservation. Bridgestone is advancing development of the “Air Free Concept tyre” as a more environmentally friendly product than existing tyres and aims to bring about commercial use in a wide range of vehicles as soon as possible.\nBridgestone believes that through effective resource usage and efficient operations alongside reduced CO2 emissions from improved fuel efficiency, as part of its aim to achieve a balance between its business and the environment, it can continue to offer attractive products to its customers far into the future. The Company will continue to implement multiple technological innovations to help bring about a more sustainable society.\n\n\nvia: http://www.bridgestonemotorsport.com/championships/other/news/3038/bridgestone_reveals_second_generation__air_free_concept_tyre_\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nLorenzo Takes 100th MotoGP Podium in Texas \n\n\nPosted on April 26, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing rider Jorge Lorenzo took third position on the podium today in the Grand Prix of The Americas, his 100th career podium finish. A less than perfect start from third on the front row saw the current World Champion lose position approaching turn one but he was quick to come back as the race settled in. Lorenzo was able to maintain third position to the finish line, holding distance to fellow Yamaha Cal Crutchlow behind in fourth and close down the gap to the front to just over three seconds at the flag. The result delivers an incredible 100th podium finish for the four-time World Champion ten years after he scored his first with victory in Brazil in 2003. The sixteen points brings his 2013 season total to 41 after two races, joint with Championship leader Marc Marquez and places him in second in the standings.\nHaving started form eighth on the grid, Valentino Rossi got involved in an early fight with the mid pack, including riders Crutchlow and Stefan Bradl, eventually bettering the German rider to move up and hold on to sixth place to the finish line. Rossi had to contend with a vibration from his front brakes during the race and had battled all weekend to find the best setup for the demanding circuit. The result places him in fourth place in the overall standings with 30 points, 3 behind Dani Pedrosa in third.  \n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo, 3rd\n“Yesterday we were so far from Marc and Dani but this morning in the warm up we found something. The hairpin corners we normally take in first gear we made in second so it improved a lot the feeling and the acceleration, but it was not enough. Just a little bit more, maybe two tenths quicker and I could have fought with Dani and Marc. Today third position was the best we could do. I want to congratulate Cal who didn’t give up until the end and also Marc, he’s the youngest rider in history to win a Grand Prix; he is a phenomenon. It’s an important day for me; I never thought to get this unbelievable number of podiums so today is a magic day. Time flies very quickly, it seems like it was just yesterday that I got my first victory, which was my first podium in Brazil in 2003 ten years ago and now today my 100th.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi, 6th\n“This is a difficult track for us. We expected to do better, but I had a lot of problems in the race because I had a problem with the brakes. I had a vibration in braking because I lost one part of a disc so this didn’t help. We knew that we had to defend here; we know that when we cannot attack we need to try and arrive in the top five but today it was sixth. The balance of the first two races is positive and we arrive in Jerez optimistic for the next few races as the tracks are better for us.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“This was our target, to be on the podium. To be honest to be just three seconds behind the lead is very nice. When you are ten seconds behind and you finish third you are quite happy but if it’s just three seconds you think you might have been able to get a bit more. Apart from that we must be very pleased with the result, to be on the podium was our target and that will continue to be our target for the next couple of races. We struggled a lot here and everyone could see our competitors were strong; we had it the other way round in Qatar. Let’s hope at the end of the season that the balance is in our favour.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“We knew since the beginning that this race was going to be really tough for us but I think the team has worked really well and we could manage it in the best way. To finish third, with only three second gap to the leader is for me really good. Jorge did a really intelligent race without a lot of risk. Now we are going back to Europe where the circuits are more suitable to our M1. Vale’s team worked really hard to try and fit the bike to his riding style; they improved the bike through each practice. Unfortunately we made another step from the warm up to the race that didn’t work as we expected. He also had a vibration on the front from his brakes. I think we are leaving Austin in a really good shape and we are really looking forward to the Jerez race.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantastic fourth for Crutchlow in Texas\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow rode to a fantastic fourth place finish in today’s inaugural Grand Prix of the Americas in Texas to consolidate his place in the top five in the World Championship standings after two races. For the second race in succession, the British rider comfortably finished as leading non-factory rider after he superbly recovered from an early off-track excursion to claim his best finish of the 2013 campaign. Crutchlow was locked in an early fight with Stefan Bradl when he ran off track on lap four, which dropped him back to sixth as Alvaro Bautista swept through. The 27-year-old wasted no time in getting back up to his fast pace and he brilliantly recovered the lost places with two expertly executed overtaking moves on Bautista on lap five and then on Bradl on lap nine. Crutchlow maintained his fast pace and was easily able to streak away from Bradl and Bautista to finish behind factory trio Marc Marquez, Dani Pedrosa and Jorge Lorenzo, which was a fantastic achievement considering they had all tested at COTA last month.\nIt was mission accomplished for Bradley Smith in the 21-lap race as he gained priceless experience by guiding his YZR-M1 machine home to his first point scoring finish in his rookie campaign. Opting to run Bridgestone’s hard compound front tyre for the first time all weekend, Smith gradually built up his confidence and an impressive charge in the second half of the race saw him set a personal best lap of 2.06.415 on the penultimate lap to finish in 12th position. That was 0.3s faster than his best qualifying lap and the confidence and experience gained this weekend means Smith heads to Jerez next month optimistic that he can battle for a maiden top 10 finish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow – 4th\n“I’m very pleased and we did a better job than any of us expected before we arrived in Texas. With no testing here I was worried that it would be more of a struggle and the fire in the garage on Wednesday meant we couldn’t do any of our normal preparation work. So to finish fourth and be behind Marquez, Pedrosa and Lorenzo is a great achievement for all of us and I want to say a massive thanks to my crew. We qualified well and I rode very well in the race and the most pleasing aspect was my consistency. Unfortunately I ran wide while trying to pass Bradl but I managed to fight my way back through and I was running the same speed as Lorenzo for a long time and that gives me a lot of confidence to take into the next few races. I’m giving it my all and I’ll never give up and I think this weekend again we showed how competitive the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 package is. Now we go to Jerez and I was quickest at the winter test a few weeks ago, so it is going to be another big battle that I’m excited about.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith – 12th\n“I am really happy to finish the race because what I learned over a full race distance was priceless. I ran the hard front tyre on the advice of Bridgestone and while it was definitely the right choice, it took me a few laps to understand how it was working. The last thing I needed was to push too hard and make another mistake like in Qatar but the best thing about the race is I got faster and faster. I was quicker as in qualifying on the penultimate lap of the race, and that’s a sign of how much better I was riding the bike. I am learning more and more about the bike on each lap and I can go to Jerez now confident that I can be even more competitive and the goal will be to get closer to the top 10. Finally I can’t praise my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team enough. After the garage fire on Wednesday night it really put everybody on the back foot, but we all rallied round and it is nice to see both Cal and I finish in the points to reward their hard work.”\n\n\n\n\nHerve Poncharal – Tech3 Team Manager:\n“That was a very good first race here in Texas and Cal did an amazing job. He was in a very hard battle in the early laps and after he ran off the track his recovery was fantastic. He was back on his pace immediately and he brilliantly passed both Bradl and Bautista, even though it was clear that they had a very competitive package at this track. What was very impressive was the way Cal pulled away and he was able to run the same pace as Lorenzo in front of him, which is not an easy task and something he should be really proud of. Bradley also had a good race and he did exactly what he had to do after the crash in Qatar. He was calm at the beginning but once his confidence grew he got faster and faster and at the end he was as quick as a lot of those inside the top 10. This will give him a big boost and also the experience he is lacking, so we can look forward to an even stronger challenge from him in the next few races. Cal and Bradley did an awesome job but so did the whole Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team. We didn’t test here and that put us at a disadvantage and after the fire on Wednesday night our preparations were far from ideal. So to get this result in a crucial race for Yamaha and Monster Energy is extremely satisfying.”\nAdvertisements",

That kind of windscreen sure can make the wind moves above your head and cocoons you from the force of the air when riding fast. This Zero Gravity Double Bubble windscreen might be the windscreen of choice for the long distance traveller that wants to minimise the wind hitting their body on high speed. This condition of wind blowing to your body can really tires you out. My friend rides a Duke 690 on high speed but can’t maintain that for long since the push of the wind really make the handling of the bike more exhausting and tiring since we need to constantly adjust the bike handle and at the same time fight the wind. The force of the wind also makes it uses lot more fuel since the bike is not aerodynamic compared when installing the windscreen.   \n\nZero Gravity Double Bubble windscreen also available for Honda CBR250R. It looks huge on the bike, but it gives a real benefit to the aerodynamics of the bike that can protect you from the wind. You might asked whether this windscreen is durable enough for the outdoor wind force since the windscreen looks very long to be supported by the head cover. So, here is the official statement from their website that can assure you about its durability:\nSuperior Optical Quality: Zero Gravity Windscreens feature the finest optics of any windscreen on the market. All Zero Gravity windscreens are fabricated using highly specialized “vacuum forming” techniques similar to those used to form aircraft canopies. The result is a virtually distortion free optical lens.\n Strength plus Flexibility: Made from the finest grade of acrylic plastic, Zero Gravity windscreens are stretched as they are formed, a process which results in superior strength and flexibility. This flexibility allows the windscreen to absorb road vibrations and resist cracking.\n Best Fit to OEM Fairing: Zero Gravity windscreen are factory pre-drilled* and ready to install. The mounting holes and windscreen profile match the O.E.M. fairing for a precision fit.\n Race Proven: Used by the best Superbike, Grand Prix, Supersport and Endurance teams in America, Zero Gravity windscreens dominate roadracing from the club level to the nationals.\n Zero Gravity currently offers four types of sportbike windscreens.\n Each model is unique in design, styling and riding advantages.\nUsing a windscreen helps to overcome this situation and with this ultra big windscreen from Zero Gravity, it really can makes a difference. Just imagine the aerodynamic of the air flow on the top area of the bike that are now higher that your body and head since the windscreen deflects the wind upwards. You’ll have a more comfortable ride and less exhausting trip.\nPrice is at RM600. I’m not selling, just sharing yo.\nAvailable at: http://www.qbee.com.my/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=41\nMore info at: http://www.zerogravity-racing.com/new_products.php\nAdvertisements",

Gaucho Productions was granted exclusive access to the Honda TT Legends team as they took on some of the world’s toughest ’bike races.  From Japan to Germany and from Le Mans to the Isle of Man, the documentary follows these ordinary men doing extraordinary things.  \nJohn McGuinness, nicknamed the ‘The Morecambe Missile’, is an ex-bricklayer and mussel picker from the north of England who has won the legendary Isle of Man TT nineteen times.  He is joined in the TT Legends team by Cameron Donald and Simon Andrews. Donald is Australia’s fastest plumber and a two-time winner of the Isle of man TT. Andrews is a fearless young gun who was the fastest newcomer at the TT in 2011. Together they are the TT Legends.\nThe documentary goes ‘behind the screens’ as the team competes in the World Endurance Championship. The season kicks off with the famous Bol d’Or, a twenty-four hour race at the Magny Cours circuit in France. Then they’re off to Doha, Germany and even Japan for the famous Suzuka 8-Hour before they return to France for the Le Mans 24-hour. Each race brings its own, distinct challenge for the team. In Suzuka, for example, we’ll join McGuinness in an ice bath, a welcome antidote to the searing heat.\n\nThese circuit races are accompanied by legendary road races in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. McGuinness is the man to beat on the roads with Donald and Andrews among his toughest rivals. Gaucho Productions were there to witness the contrast, as these friends and teammates now push each other to the limit and beyond.\nAway from the races, the series will show the team as they relax away from the pressures of racing, learning what makes them tick and why these men are willing to risk everything to race on bumpy public roads at over 200mph. And you’ll meet the families and friends who must cope with the stress of watching them race. Over eight, half-hour episodes, witness all the tears, tantrums and triumphs as this fascinating team enjoys an epic season.\n\nSpeaking about the series, Gaucho Production’s Executive Producer, Alistair Weaver, said: “The TT Legends have a fascinating story to tell and we’re delighted to have brought it to life. Our crews have travelled everywhere with them, from bullet trains in Japan to Cameron’s makeshift motorhome in Northern Ireland. This series is an extraordinary tale of human will and endeavour played out at 200mph. ITV4 is a natural home for it and we’re thrilled to be working with them.”\nJohn Claridge, Head of Programme Strategy, ITV4, said: “ITV4 has achieved great success with its coverage of the Isle of Man TT. The TT Legends series complements it beautifully. We’re delighted to work with Gaucho Productions on a series that offering a fascinating insight into the riders and their lives. ITV4 has a rich heritage of producing exciting sports documentaries and this is no exception.”\nThe eight-part series will debut on ITV4 at 20h30 on Monday 4th February, 2013.\nEditor’s note: ITV4 is in UK only ya.\nAdvertisements",

Championship leader Jorge Lorenzo arrives with a 28-point lead at the top of the standings after a strong second place finish at Motegi on Sunday. The Sepang circuit holds starkly contrasting connotations for Lorenzo, being the scene of his World Championship title in 2010 countered by the tragic passing of Marco Simoncelli in 2011.\nBen Spies moves to Sepang determined to complete the final three races of the season on a high note following a disastrous Grand Prix of Japan which saw him retire on the second lap with braking issues. Due to the cancellation of last year’s race Spies has only competed once at the Sepang circuit, taking an impressive fourth place finish from fourth on the grid in his rookie year.  \nJorge Lorenzo\n“So here we are back in Sepang, a track with difficult memories for all of us from Marco’s tragic accident last year. It is also a track which has very good memories for me from 2010 when I became MotoGP World Champion. With three races left to go we must stay very focused and do our best to put on a good show this weekend. The track is maybe more suited to our bike than Motegi so we will be aiming for the best possible result.”\nBen Spies\n“It’s a strange feeling to come back here after last year. We will honour Sic in the best way we know how, by going out on track and giving 100% as always. Last weekend was yet another disappointment with brake issues, I really hope we can have a trouble free time here in Sepang and show our true podium potential.”\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“Sepang is one of the tracks where we’ve covered more laps than anywhere else with two tests here. In the wintertime we improved a lot from last year which is important. The humidity and the temperature makes it much tougher for the riders but we feel quite strong here and we are prepared for to fight for the podium again.”\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“With just three races to go Jorge is now very close to securing the World Championship title, however we cannot afford to relax and each one will be crucial. We are not here aiming for second places so if a win is possible that is the result we are trying for. With very positive test results in the pre-season we are confident that Ben will also show his true potential here and we expect a trouble-free weekend to allow him to do that.”\nJorge Lorenzo\nAge: 25\nLives: Barcelona, Spain\nBike: Yamaha\nGP victories: 44 (23 x MotoGP, 17 x 250cc, 4 x 125cc)\nFirst GP victory: Brazil, 2003 (125cc)\nFirst GP: Jerez, Spain, 2002 (125cc)\nGP starts: 176 (79 x MotoGP, 48 x 250cc, 46 x 125cc)\nPole positions: 50 (22 x MotoGP, 23 x 250cc, 3 x 125cc)\nWorld Championships: 3 (MotoGP 2010, 250cc, 2006/7)\nBen Spies\nAge: 26\nLives: Longview Texas / Lake Como Italy\nBike: Yamaha\nGP victories: 1\nFirst GP victory: Assen, Netherlands, 2011\nFirst GP: Donington, UK, 2008 (MotoGP)\nGP starts: 52\nPole positions: 1\nWorld Championships: 1 (WSB 2009)\nSepang Record Lap\nC.Stoner (Ducati) 2007, 2’02.108\nSepang Best Lap\nV.Rossi (Yamaha) 2009, 2’00.518\nAdvertisements",

He said that this item is good for pickup and top speed of Y125Z. I’ve done some searching and found great explaination by Moto Tassinari itself.\nQuote taken from www.moto-tassinari.com :\nThe Moto Tassinari VForce3 reed valve system is often times the number one choice of users looking to improve the performance of their machine. It’s a true “bolt-on” performance modification. If you’ve ever checked your reed petals for wear (which you should be doing once a year) than you can install a VForce3 Reed Valve System.\nThe VForce3 Reed Valve System incorporates features you won’t find with other system on the market. With such features as twice the reed tip surface, radius cage surface, snap-together construction, proprietary carbon fiber recipes and more. By doubling the reed tip surface the petals now only need to open half as far to have the same flow as a stock style cage. This is a significant advantage when you factor in that a reed petal opens and closes 133 times per second at 8,000 rpm. The petals are only traveling half the distance of a stock style cage, so now fatigue to the petal has been greatly reduced, increasing petal life. This design also enables the valve to drastically improve the entire powerband with a significant boost in the bottom and mid. Instant throttle response is an understatement! The petals now sit on a radius surface to create a “pre-loading” effect that improves an already snappy acceleration. Our new cage design now allows the reed petal tips to be recessed into the cage itself. This allows for a cushioning of the reed tips and also discourages the possibility of any back-flow.\n41 more pictures after the jump\nBelow is a list of the top features of the VForce3:\n1. TWICE THE REED TIP SURFACE: The unique and proven design of the VForce3 Reed Valve System doubles the available reed tip surface over a conventional reed valve design. By doubling the effective reed tip surface it enables the engine to get more air with less effort. The number one rule in two-stroke motor modification is More Air = More Horsepower. Help your engine get the maximum airflow for maximum horsepower.\n2. SIGNIFICANT HORSEPOWER GAINS:One of the main factors in the incredible popularity of the VForce3 Reed Valve System is the horsepower gains. The VForce design widens peak power and increases the horsepower over the entire range of the powerband. These results are readily seen on the dyno and can also be felt “seat-of-the-pants”.\n3. GREATER ACCELERATION: A direct result of the increased efficiency of the VForce3 design is increased acceleration. Enjoy razor like throttle response when blasting out of a snocross turn or shredding a loamy berm, in the way only VForce technology can deliver.\n4. AIRFOIL TECHNOLOGY: The new reed cage design on the VForce3 Reed Valve system incorporates airfoil shaped (flat on bottom/curved on top) reed tip surfaces which in turn increases the velocity of the fuel/air mixture as it passes through and over, creating the optimum fuel atomization.\n5. PROPRIETARY CARBON LAY-UP: Moto Tassinari continues to test and develop new “recipes” for our carbon fiber used in the VForce3 Reed Valve system. In fact Moto Tassinari specs our own exclusive recipes for all the carbon fiber we use, you can be assured you’ll never get “generic” carbon fiber designed for somebody and something else, when you buy VForce.\n6. SYMMETRICAL REED PETALS: The VForce3 now uses symmetrical reed petals for both the inner and outer red petals. No longer will you need to be concerned with having both “inner” and “outer” reed petals when it comes time to replace reeds. Another advantage of this design is that some heavily modified motors may be harsh on only the bottom reed petal, which may result in accelerated wear on that single petal. Now you can purchase a replacement pack of reed petals and replace only the bottom petal as needed. We also offer the ability to purchase single reed petals when ordered directly Moto Tassinari.\n7. SNAP-TOGETHER CONSTRUCTION: The VForce3 Reed Valve System incorporates the industry’s first and only patented snap together reed valve design. The entire assembly is completely screw free, meaning that when reed petals need changing the job is now literally a “SNAP”. Replacing the reed petals may be a chore on stock or other reed valve designs, however on the VForce3 the job literally takes 2 minutes or less, meaning less downtime and more time for what matters – riding.\n8. CUSTOM AIR-GUIDES: Custom air guides specific to each individual application ensure the maximum airflow and performance benefits of the VForce3 reed valve system in your motor. Don’t settle for a generic design when you can have a custom tailored VForce3 Reed Valve System for your application.\nSimply put, installing this VForce3 Reed Valve System to your Y125Z will make it go FAST!\n\nAdvertisements",

From an engineering perspective, the Ninja H2 and H2R present a new level of greatness.\nThis fastest accelerating motorcycle ever is achieved by its state-of-the-art supercharged engine, where the differences between the street-version H2 (200hp) and the track-only H2R (320hp) engine are only the camshafts, head gasket, clutch and ECU settings. Here are 10 things you should know about these supercharged Ninjas.\n\n1. It carries the Kawasaki “River Mark”\nDating to the 1870s, founder Shozo Kawasaki created a flag from the character ‘river’ for his then shipping business. Consequently, the “River Mark’ was adopted by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) representing the group’s technology, originality and innovation.\nFittingly, the H2s carry this heritage as they were developed with contribution from sister companies within the KHI Group, such as the Gas Turbine & Machinery Company, Aerospace Company, and Corporate Technology Division.  \n\nThe powerplant has been designed to handle 2x greater stresses than a conventional or naturally aspirated (NA) engines. This highly efficient, motorcycle-specific supercharger pumps over 200 litres of air/second, while maintaining a relatively low compression ratio of only 8.5:1.\n\n3. Space-age Aerodynamics\nUnlike the old days where wind-tunnels were heavily used, the H2s were designed by Kawasaki’s Aerospace company using the latest Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis technology to optimize downforce, high-speed streaming as well as heat dissipation.\n\n2. Supercharged 998cm3 in-line four engine\nSupercharging is not something new to Kawasaki. Their recent applications can be seen in their JetSkis where prolonged boosting has to be endured by the superchargers. This forced-induction technology and knowledge is further developed and made available to motorcycles.\n\nThe mirrors on the H2 are replaced with carbon fiber (CFRP) winglets and spoilers on the H2R to effectively reduce turbulence and generate additional downforce and stability at ultra-high speed.\n\n4. Silver mirror paint\nThis is the first time “black chrome” is offered on a mass-produced within the automotive and motorcycle industries. Developed specifically for the H2s, the glass-like surface is created with a chemical process involving silver ions to form a uniform metallic layer of pure silver with four layers of paint and coats being applied manually.\nThese intricate processes produce an effect similar to what we see on McLaren’s F1 cars.\n\n5. MotoGP and F1 dog-ring transmission\nTo ensure a seamless and quick gear-shifting, a dog-ring type transmission as found in MotoGP or Formula 1 was developed for the H2s with feedback from the Kawasaki Racing Team. Unlike a conventional motorcycle gearbox, this motorsport transmission have less moving parts for quicker transitions.\n\nTo match this superior design, a contactless-type quick shifter comes as standard (a first for Kawasaki bike), coupled with an adjustable back-torque limiter (components by Brembo) which acts like a slipper clutch.\n\n6. Racing Suspension, Brakes and Dynamics\nThe fully adjustable and low friction Kayaba suspension (AOS-II) on the H2 and H2R was based on the Air-Oil separate cartridge fork developed for motocross racing. This 43mm fork offers smooth initial action followed by strong damping at the end of the stroke.\n\nThis is coupled with Brembo 4-piston monoblocs and massive 330mm Brembo semi-floating discs (5.5mm thickness) to ensure adequate braking force. Furthermore, the electronic steering damper (jointly developed with Öhlins) adjusts damping according to the bike’s speed and acceleration.\n\n7. Bespoke wheel and sticky rubbers\nWith more than 10 years experience supplying rubbers to MotoGP, Bridgestone has developed the RS10 220mm tyres (also OEM for Yamaha YZF-R1M). This is mounted on the star-pattern 5-spoke Kawasaki wheel to provide optimum rigidity and balance for high speed performance.\nThis wheel technology is derived from World Superbike (WSBK) with knurling on the inside of the rear wheel rim to prevent tyre-rim slippage due to massive torque at wide open throttle (WOT).\n\n8. Kawasaki’s first single-sided swingarm\nThe swingarm pivot mounts directly to the engine, saving weight from otherwise conventional cross members found in double-sided design.\n\nThrough this optimisation, Kawasaki has also managed to mount the exhaust silencer closer to the bike centerline, resulting in a better weight distribution, more ground clearance and higher lean angle.\n\n9. Seat and Ergonomics\nThe Ninja H2s are designed to be ridden at high speeds hence the monoposto configuration. To help support the rider during hard acceleration and mid-turn hang-off, a pair of hip-supporting pads flank the rear of the seat. These hip support are adjustable (15mm) to provide optimum anchoring points for the pilot.\n\n10. Electronic Rider-Aid\nThis upgraded Kawasaki Traction Control (KTRC) used on the Ninja H2s offers the best features of Kawasaki’s earlier systems. This latest KTRC offers multiple settings and different riding modes (plus the Rain Mode) which correspond to different levels of electronic intrusion to manage power output in various riding conditions and to suit rider’s style.\nNot to mention the Kawasaki Engine Brake Control (KEBC) allows more advanced riders to reduce engine braking when riding on the circuit.\n\nSo what’s the point of these highly engineered hyper-bikes?\nPerhaps it’s Kawasaki’s platform to showcase their technology and capability to produce efficient power out of smaller and more compact engines, paving a roadmap for affordable street-production bikes in the future? Imagine Ninja 600cc supercharged, or 250cc sc’d.. Hmm..

The tagline ‘Semakin Di Depan’ is shown at the the side fairing with the recognisable Race-blu colour mixed with the white base colour. In 2013, Yamaha Indonesia also have prepared the MotoGP 2013 variant of the Vixion and it sure looks nice. This can be a collectors item if you start collecting it since 2013.   \nLooking at the both MotoGP 2014 and MotoGP 2013 livery edition, you can see that the MotoGP 2014 uses the white base colour on the tank, where for the MotoGP 2013, it uses Race-blu base colour. MotoGP livery edition always looking nice even with only graphics scheme change.

The combination of the black colour scheme works to makes it low profile but the frame exudes style and simplicity at the same time. The Honda P25 49cc engine there is not just for the show as the bike is actually rideable.  \n\nI actually imagine that this Honda P25 could be the best camera ready bike for some road action without having to install the GoPro. The front headlight that uses security as the main illumination is also a good idea. The LED there can also be IR type so you can see in the dark. This can prove to be useful when you park in the dark and there are someone trying to do harm to your bike. It is better if it is motion detection ready the records the suspisious activity and relay the images to your phone! Hmm, but that is just my assumption.\n\nThis bike is prepared for the ‘Security Show’ in Tokyo Big Site event on 4th March 2014. It is been designed by Nagata-san itself and I thank you for that great design you have presented to the world.\nvia: http://www.pipeburn.com/home/2014/3/14/66-little-honda-p25-chicara-nagata.html#.UyR2hIVX9Fk\nAdvertisements",

        "lagenda 115zr\nreview\nYamaha\nYamaha Lagenda 115Z, Jupiter 115Z, Crypton 115Z, Vega Force 115\nYamaha Lagenda, Jupiter Z, Crypton Z, Vega Force \n\nMy Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR 55-1406km Review \n\n\nPosted on February 2, 2011February 2, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nThis review has been long due. I actually need to update my previous review when my bike reach 1,000km, but it is now at 1,406km. Many readers has asked to update the review after they have read my first review, so, here goes. Let me get this review done first by reviewing some problems that I have encountered with this bike all along.\nCommon problems with the Lagenda 115ZR:\nFuel meter\nThe fuel meter is not reliable and can’t be trusted. The fuel meter tends to show the bike actual fuel are more than what we expect. Have a look at this picture:\n\nDo you think the bike still have 2/3 of the fuel from the total of 4.2liter tank capacity? Or at least half of it? Look at the picture below:\nThe total capacity to top up the fuel tank to the full is at 2.366 liter, which is more than half of the capacity of the fuel tank, and the fuel meter only showing NOT even half of it! I have a friend here in Banting, Selangor who also have 115ZR that at some point need to push need bike to the fuel station because he trusted the fuel meter so much, that he actually ride the bike with very little amount of fuel left in his fuel tank. Terrible! Why is it this thing came as surprise? It is because most of the bike actually will have fuel meter pointing more to the E sign that refers to EMPTY when the actual fuel in the fuel tank is about half, but 115ZR fuel meter pointing more to the F sign that refers to FULL. So, anyone who are thinking to buy this bike need to be careful about this.\nPower\n115ZR is an underpowered bike compared to many bikes from Honda, Modenas and even its own Lagenda 110Z series. Refer the comparison here. The 115ZR is in fact the lowest power-to-weight ratio in the chart at 79.6 compared to previous model of Lagenda 110Z at 91.8. This will of course effect the fuel efficiency and acceleration.\nTop speed that I can get with this bike is only at 105km/h on normal flat road with the rear sprocket already changed to 37T which is smaller than the stock sprocket at 40T. On 40T, the maximum speed that I get is 100km/h. When riding this bike at 80km/h, I feel not confident to overtake big lorries or buses with 115ZR since it is not easy to get 100km/h even if I drop the gear to the third gear.\nA few work around that I’m thinking now to upgrade the capability of my 115ZR is to use a bigger carb, maybe at 26mm and then fit it with 15-35T sprocket for better top speed and better torque.\nOn stock condition, this bike are no-way road runner.\nYou have read the common problems, now let’s read the advantages of the 115ZR.\nAdvantages of Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR:\nRide and handling\nYamaha Lagenda 115ZR have the SUPERB ride and handling that I have ever felt. Taking corners are never this fun with the 115ZR. It feels very confident and the handle bar have direct feel of the road condition. Compared to Modenas CT110 that I owned, CT110 feels like child’s play (sorry CT110 owners out there). 115ZR is an enjoyable bike to ride, with little more modification to obtain greater power and speed, this bike definitely are the best in its class. But, some riders said that the new Suzuki Smash V115  is also a great bike with good top speed, fuel efficiency and also good handling that can challenge the Lagenda 115ZR.\nBrakes\n115ZR is equipped with 2-piston caliper for the front brake and drum brake for the rear. This setup is the same with the Modenas CT110, but the differences, I must say are like, heaven and earth. With Lagenda 115ZR, the front brake feel are very good, maybe I can say, it is perfect. You can control how much braking power you want to apply to the front brake just by using your finger tips. For the rear brake that is using drum setup, it is also feels good and braking power is predictable and not dissapointing. But if Yamaha decide to use rear disc brake, it is much better.\nQuality of parts\nEvery parts of this bike are high quality, even the small screw. FYI, the original brake caliper screw is priced at RM7 per piece, and that are much more expensive that normal screw that is about RM0.30 per piece. Believe me, the price if RM7 is worth it. I have been using RX-Z and Y125Z previously. I can see that the original screw are very resistant to rust. Try to expose the cheap screw to water and wait for few days, it’ll definitely rust.\nOther than that, the welding of the chassis frame are nice and looks high quality enough. This gives confident to the riders to ride the bike for long distance ride.\nConclusion\nThis is a great bike with a few flaw in the technical department and a little bit underpowered, but it is one of the enjoyable bike I have ever own with its great ride and handling feel.\nNote: This is based on my opinion to my Lagenda 115ZR and my Modenas CT110 that I own. You can have different opinion than me. You can comment at the bottom of this page.\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nHonda\nMean Mower \n\nHonda’s 1000cc 109HP Mean Mower – Fastest Lawnmower in the World at 187.61kmph \n\n\nPosted on April 10, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nHonda 1,000cc 109HP Mean Mower\nHonda’s Mean Mower has officially broken the Guinness World’s title for the Fastest lawnmower, averaging 187.61km/h (116.57mph) to break the previous record by over 45km/h.\nThe successful Guinness World Records attempt took place under the watchful eye of a Guinness World Records Adjudicator at the IDIADA Proving Ground, in Tarragona, Spain, on Saturday 8th March 2014. Behind the wheel was Piers Ward of BBC TopGear Magazine, who had previously achieved a fastest speed on Mean Mower of 140km/h (87mph). At around 16:20 CET on the 2000km North Straight at IDIADA, Piers eclipsed the previous record of 141.35km/h (87.83mph), set in May 2010.\nThe speed was measured through a 100 meter speed trap, overseen by official timers, Timing Solutions Limited. To meet Guinness World Records regulations the mower had to record the same run, in both directions, within an hour – with the average speed taken of these two runs. Additionally, to qualify for the record it needed to cut grass and to look like a lawnmower; both of which it did successfully. With all of these criteria met, the Guinness World Records Adjudicator officially declared the success of the record attempt just before 18:00 CET on Saturday 8th March.  \nKate Saxton, Manager – European PR Communications for Honda Motor Europe comments: “The original brief for Mean Mower was to create the world’s fastest lawnmower – and now it officially is, by some distance! We are all delighted to hold a Guinness World Records title and we’d like to thank everyone who was involved in what has been a challenging yet incredibly exciting project.”\nThe idea for Mean Mower was to demonstrate Honda’s sprit of innovation, its motor sport heritage, and that it makes more than just cars. Mean Mower was designed and built in the UK by Honda (UK)’s British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) partner, Team Dynamics.  The team re-engineered a Honda HF2620 Lawn Tractor from the ground-up, adding an all-new fabricated chassis, custom-made from 4130 chromoly (high carbon steel) to provide a strong, safe but very light platform. A 1000cc engine from a Honda VTR Firestorm was used, along with a bespoke suspension and wheels from an ATV.\n\nEvery effort was made to retain as much of the look of the original mower as possible. The cutter deck was custom-made in fibre-glass, to reduce weight, while, in a stroke of pure genius, the grass bag provides a happy home for the fuel tank, a high capacity oil cooler and a secondary water cooling radiator.\nThe ability to still cut grass was also a key element of the brief, and the super-fast mower still can, admirably, thanks to two electric motors on the cutter deck, spinning 3mm steel cutting cable at an incredible 4000rpm. The mower can cut grass at around 24km/h (15mph), more than double the flat-out speed of the original HF2620 from which it is derived.\nBased on feedback from Honda Yuasa Racing drivers, three times BTCC champion Matt Neal and 2013 champion Gordon Shedden, the mower features a custom-made paddle shift six-speed gear system. Additionally it has a custom-made Cobra sports seat, a Scorpion exhaust system and a steering rack taken from a Morris Minor.\n\nThe result of this remarkable feat of engineering is a lawn mower set-up and geared to achieve a top speed in excess of 209km/h (130mph), weighing just 140kg, producing 96Nm of torque, an incredible PTW ratio of 532bhp/tonne; and an estimated 0-100 km/h acceleration time of just four seconds.\nSafety was paramount to the project, so every effort has been made to make the mower stable and secure. To achieve optimum balance, ATV wheels have been used – ideal because ATV racing is held on rough off-road tracks. Super-soft tyres ensure optimum grip and excellent handling on the tarmac. Additionally, every effort was made to use Honda parts, where possible, including brakes and several motorcycle components. Almost everything else has been custom-made by Team Dynamics and its partners.\nAdvertisements",

The combination of the white, red and a little black are nicely done to make this bike looks better in time. The stance of this bike are full of machoism and the special edition livery really spice it up to the next level of excitement (at least in terms of looks). I would buy this if only it makes to our shore here in Malaysia.\nRead the official statement about the Yamaha YZF-R125 WGP 50th Anniversary after the jump  \nA Class Of Its Own\nAt Yamaha we wanted to make a new kind of high-specification 125 right from the start. And while the opposition may have tried to keep pace with this radical sports bike, serious riders know that there is still no substitute for the YZF-R125. Take a closer look and you’ll see the quality in its aerodynamic race-developed bodywork, full-sized Deltabox frame, aluminium swinging arm, lightweight wheels, large diameter discs, liquid-cooled engine, MotoGP-style muffler…and much, much more. When you demand the best, the Yamaha YZF-R125 is the only choice. And in the limited edition WGP 50th Anniversary colours, this bike is in a class of its own.\n\nRace-developed design\nThe YZF-R125 has been developed from Yamaha’s race-winning R-series bikes, and features class-leading engine and chassis technology. With its full-sized Deltabox frame, liquid-cooled, 4-valve engine featuring a MotoGP-type mid-ship muffler, and aerodynamic bodywork finished in the new WGP 50th Anniversary colours, the YZF-R125 is the way to go!\nAluminium swinging arm\nAs well as being equipped with a full-sized Deltabox frame, the YZF-R125 also benefits from a strong cast aluminium swinging arm which operates a link-type suspension system. This advanced lightweight rear suspension system makes for a comfortable ride and delivers responsive handling performance.\n\nAggressive R-series supersport bodywork\nWith its twin fox-eye headlights and sporty aerodynamic lines, the aggressively-styled YZF-R125 has the street presence of a much larger-capacity motorcycle. And just like our YZF-R1 and YZF-R6 supersport bikes, the class-leading YZF-R125 attracts attention wherever you go.\nLarge-diameter disc brakes\nThe YZF-R125 has been built to a high specification and the braking systems are amongst the best in the class. The large-diameter 292mm front disc is equipped with a compact twin-pot caliper for smooth, controlled braking – and the rear system features a 230mm rear disc with a single-pot caliper to give assured stopping power.\n\nFull-sized Deltabox chassis\nUnlike some other bikes in the 125 class, the YZF-R125 is equipped with a full-sized Deltabox chassis which gives a more comfortable riding position and delivers a real big-bike feel. Combined with the radical supersport bodywork, the great-handling race-bred chassis puts this bike in a class of its own.\n\nLiquid-cooled 4-stroke single-cylinder 125cc engine\nThe liquid-cooled 4-stroke 125cc engine delivers a wide range of strong performance. Its short-stroke layout makes for a free-revving character, while the fuel injection system and 4-valve cylinder head give lively acceleration. And with a 6-speed gearbox, the YZF-R125 is a great performer around town and on the open road.\n\nNot just the YZF-R125 gets the WGP 50th Anniversary but the FZ8, YZF-R1, YZF-R6 and Aerox 50cc also gets it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.yamaha-motor.eu/uk/products/motorcycles/125cc/yzf-r125-wgp-50th-anniversary.aspx?view=features\nAdvertisements",
        "125cc\nHonda \n\nHonda Develops Engine with Enhanced Durability, Quietness and Fuel Economy for 125cc Scooters Equipped on Global Scooter Models \n\n\nPosted on September 27, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\n \nTOKYO, Japan, September 26, 2011 – Honda Motor Co., Ltd. has announced its development of an engine with enhanced durability, quietness, and fuel economy. The engine is developed for next-generation 125cc scooters and accommodates an advanced idle stop system for motorcycles. Fuel economy is approximately 25%* better than that of conventional engines for scooters with the same displacement. This liquid-cooled, 125cc, 4-stroke, single-cylinder engine incorporates a wide range of low-friction technologies while packing its lighter weight in a more compact body.  This new engine will be mounted on a variety of 125cc scooters to be sold in many countries around the world and is planned for global rollout starting from 2012.\nThis new engine was developed to offer highly convenient and attractive 125cc scooters, a vehicle used by many customers for commuting in various countries around the world, while reducing CO2 emissions on a global scale, through the further enhancement of engine performance and fuel economy.\nDevelopment was performed to meet these requirements:\n\nPowerful output and greater durability with an emphasis on practicality\nExcellent fuel efficiency suitable for the next-generation global-standard engine\nContributing to CO2 reduction on a worldwide scale by applying to global models\nRealizing an affordable price\n\nTo achieve the engine’s excellent fuel efficiency, Honda incorporated a broad spectrum of new ideas to thoroughly reduce friction. Low-friction technologies such as an offset cylinder and a roller rocker arm are supplemented by such techniques as intelligent control to lessen friction during power generation and the first adoption of a shell-type needle bearing for the rocker arm shaft.\n\n*\nHonda calculations\n\n= Main Features of the New Engine =\nAdoption of a wide range of low-friction technologies\n\n\nOffset cylinder reduces friction caused by the contact between the sliding piston and the cylinder.\nPiston weight has been thoroughly reduced through CAE analysis.\nA spiny sleeve with minute spines on the outer surface of the cylinder sleeve has been adopted to reduce oil consumption and improve cooling performance.\nA shell-type needle bearing is used for the rocker arm shaft to reduce friction.\nSmaller and lighter rollers together with an optimized cam profile and valve spring load.\nRadiator core with high cooling efficiency has been adopted (approximately 1.5 times the efficiency of current models). This enables a smaller and lighter cooling fan on the back of the radiator and reduces friction loss by approximately 30%.\nTransmission oil capacity is reduced 25% compared to current 125cc engines through modifications inside the transmission case in order to lower the oil agitation loss.\nBearings for each of the three axes in the transmission unit are exclusively designed according to the load received, resulting in an optimal set of specifications that lessen the rolling resistance inside the bearings. Friction loss has been cut by approximately 20% compared to the current engine (when running at 50km/h).\n\n\nExcellent combustion efficiency\n\n\nA compact combustion chamber design incorporates burning velocity and cooling performance suitable for an engine that emphasizes torque characteristics in the rpm ranges actually used by a 125cc scooter.\nThe air intake port connection to the combustion chamber has been redesigned into a smoother shape that does not impede the flow of the fuel-air mixture.\nOptimal ignition timing is set due to improved knocking resistance created by a highly efficient radiator and a water jacket that efficiently cools the combustion chamber.\n\n\nIntelligent electronically-controlled ACG starter\n\n\nSmooth and remarkably quiet start has been realized through an electronically-controlled ACG starter, which serves as both a self-starter and a dynamo. An advanced idle stop system has also been realized.\nIntelligent electronic control improves fuel efficiency through the reduction of friction during power generation.\nA swing-back that returns the crank to its position before air intake is electronically controlled for easy restart, while a decompression mechanism mitigates cranking resistance arising from compression during engine start.\n\n\nExcellent transmission efficiency\n\nA wide-ratio continuously variable transmission with V-belt (V-Matic) utilizes a drive belt made of newly developed high-elasticity rubber. Both excellent fuel efficiency and quietness are achieved through the efficient transmission of driving force by optimizing the lateral pressure applied to the belt, along with the durability of the belt.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nLorenzo Fights to the End in Jerez \n\n\nPosted on May 7, 2013May 7, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nJorge Lorenzo took his third consecutive podium finish of the season today, taking third on the podium for the Gran Premio bwin de España at the Jerez de la Frontera Circuit in Southern Spain. The Yamaha Factory Racing rider made a strong start from pole position, initially dropping to second off the line but retaking the lead a couple of corners later from fellow Spaniard Dani Pedrosa. With 22 laps to go tyre life dropped off dramatically and Lorenzo was then re-passed by Pedrosa. The reigning World Champion was able to hold second from an advancing Marc Marquez until the final corner of the final lap when the young Spanish rookie made a heart stopping pass on the inside of Lorenzo, making contact and pushing him wide to steal second. The podium finish delivers Lorenzo 16 Championship points and places him third in the standings, four points behind Marquez.   Valentino Rossi made a good start from fifth position on the grid and enjoyed an early tussle with Marc Marquez reminiscent of their Qatar battle. Having been unable to find an optimum set up for the race Rossi was unable to maintain the pace of the front three. The nine-time World Champion was quick enough to stay ahead of fifth placed rider Cal Crutchlow and rode a relatively lonely race in fourth to take a further 13 Championship points. Rossi sits in fourth in the standings with 43 points, 14 behind his teammate in third.\n\n \n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo, 3rd, +5.089\n“I have always been positive so today also I am going to be positive, to finish the race with sixteen points is always a great result. I was second for the whole race and then lost the place on the last corner so it wasn’t the perfect race. The perfect race is a victory and if not possible second, the next is third. Today we got another podium and we are quite close to the leader. On the other hand we have to improve the bike. I think I made two mistakes in the race, in the start I started really badly and in the last corner, I thought Marquez was further behind than he was so I didn’t take a defensive line, this was my second mistake.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi, 4th +8.914\nIt was a difficult race. Unfortunately we were not able to be better, we suffered a bit with the conditions and we tried to do the maximum. We improved the set up for the race and we did a good start. I was with the top group but unfortunately I was not fast enough to stay with the top three. Lap by lap the gap was bigger so I think we have some work to do. Here in Jerez I expected we could go faster than Honda but they arrived in front of us. We still have some work to do to improve the bike. Tomorrow we have the test and we’ll try to find the right balance. In the Championship we are not very far from the top and we took some important points. I wanted to be on the podium but unfortunately it was not possible, we will try again next week.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“A very tough fight today in very difficult circumstances. We struggled a lot to get the bike under control for the whole race. Finally we finished on the podium, which is very important in races like this. After five laps the tyre had already dropped a lot and Jorge was missing apexes here and there. He brought the bike back home and that is what is important.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“It has been a hard weekend. We really worked as hard as we could to improve tyre life. Unfortunately we couldn’t get what we were looking for. For sure we will focus some more effort tomorrow during the test to fix it for the rest of the season. In terms of the Championship, points and a podium are always good and we are close to the leader. The season is long; we lost a battle but not the war! Both riders put in a lot of effort, pushing 100% from the start of the race until the end. Overall it was a good race.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeroic fifth for Crutchlow, Smith gets first top 10 in Jerez\nThe Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team celebrated its first double top 10 result of the 2013 MotoGP campaign in Jerez today, with Cal Crutchlow riding to a heroic fifth place and rookie Bradley Smith storming to a maiden top 10 finish. Crutchlow displayed phenomenal determination and bravery to bounce back from two heavy crashes yesterday to maintain his 100% record of finishing every race inside the top five this season. The British rider was engaged in an exciting early fight with Valentino Rossi for fourth before he got locked into an intense tussle with Alvaro Bautista shortly before the halfway stage of the 27-lap encounter. In scenes reminiscent of their titanic battle for the podium in Japan last October, Bautista seized fifth from Crutchlow on lap 11. But riding through the pain barrier in gruelling heat that saw temperatures hit 27 degrees under clear blue skies, Crutchlow fought back superbly to take back fifth on lap 17. He then produced a master class in aggressive riding to streak away from Bautista and claim a third successive top five finish by almost three seconds. Bradley Smith produced an equally impressive ride to come tantalizingly close to registering his first top 10 finish in MotoGP. For the majority of the 27-lap race he was locked in the biggest battle on track for eighth position with Andrea Dovizioso, Aleix Espargaro and Michele Pirro. Smith moved into the top 10 on lap 24 with a clinical move to get by Pirro and at that stage he was 1.770s behind Espargaro. He produced a stunning late charge to cut the Spaniard’s advantage to less than a second but just as he was lining up an attack to claim ninth the chequered flag came out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow 5th, +12.663\n“Fifth place today is not a bad result considering everything that has gone on before but it’s not exactly what we expected. I was fast all weekend but after the two crashes yesterday I think it’s a very good result to remain the best of the rest. I did not feel very confident with the front-end in the race, but I think all Yamaha’s struggled in this area. I think in the middle of the race my pace was good and I started to push but with the full fuel tank I could not stop the bike and I had no grip, so I lost quite a bit of time in the early laps. Physically I had no problem on the bike for the race distance although I had a little bit of pain in my lower back. It has been a difficult weekend in many respects so I am very satisfied with fifth because probably last year I would not have finished the race in the same situation and that’s for sure an improvement.”\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith 10th, +44.461\n“I’m obviously happy with my first top 10 result because conditions for the race were different compared to the rest of the weekend. The lap times were relatively slow and the temperature meant the grip was quite low, so it was a big learning experience for me. Riding these bikes with that little grip needs a different style, so I had to adapt at the beginning of the race. From the middle stages I felt comfortable and I’m a little disappointed to be beaten again by Espargaro but it’s nice to be at least closer than last time in Austin. I just ran out of time at the end of the race because I was catching him very quickly. In Austin I was 50 seconds behind the winner and here the deficit is 44 seconds, so that’s definitely a positive and our aim for the future will be to keep reducing the gap. I’m really looking forward to the test tomorrow. It will be another learning experience for me and it will be nice to test on a track where we’ve just had a race and where I feel now really comfortable on the bike. Tomorrow we will be able to test a few different parts and understand actually what’s working better and what does not. So all in all it has been a positive weekend with improvements in every session.”\nAdvertisements",

The image above has been watermarked with the address kcdj.org, and when look for it, it happens to be a forum named “King’s Club Djakarta”. It is a good forum that is dedicated only to Yamaha RX-King 135 bike which has the same feature like the Yamaha RX-Z 135 here in Malaysia. Actually it looks almost like RX-S, but here RX-S is in 115cc where RX-King have  132cc specifically and RX-Z have 133cc of displacement. All are 2-stroker.\nThe front end of the bike looks like Yamaha FZ-150i. Maybe FZ-150i  is inspired by this bike.\nYamaha design team really knows how to create a legend.

What does it means? Check it out below:  \n80 is the tyre width at 80mm. The higher the number, the wider the tyre. Yamaha 135LC ES 5-speed comes with 100/70 tyre type, so it means this tyre is wider.\n90 is the aspect ratio of the tyre height compared with the tyre width. This means that Belang rear tyre height is 90% from the 80mm tyre width. So, the tyre height is actually 72mm.\n17 is the diameter of the tyre inner size, so it can be fitted to 17″ wheel.\nM/C is motorcycle type tyre.\n44 is load index. This means that this tyre can carry 160kg/tyre of rider combined weight(rider, pillion rider and items). Bike have two tyre so if both tyre have load index of 44, it means it can carry total 320 of weight. Refer to image below.\nP is speed index.

And in 2008, YZF-R15 (150cc) and YZF-R125 (125cc) were introduced to India and Europe respectively. The new YZF-R25 is developed not only for the Indonesian market where the popularity of sports models has been increasing, but also as a 250cc supersports model to cater for the global market.  \n\n1) Newly-developed high performance two-cylinder engine\nThe YZF-R25 is equipped with a newly-developed 250cc, liquid-cooled inline two-cylinder fuel-injected engine. In order to promote faster combustion, the new engine was designed using the latest analysis technology to actively generate a tumble (a vertical whirl of air-fuel mixture) in the combustion chamber while obtaining an optimum flow rate of the engine’s air-fuel mixture. As a result, the engine boasts a class-leading power output while also offering a power delivery suited for daily use. In addition, the new engine uses Yamaha Motor’s unique DiASil (Die casting Aluminum-Silicon) cylinders, which offer excellent heat dissipation and lighter weight. This is the first time this technology has been implemented in 2-cylinder engines made by Yamaha Motor.\n2) Mass-centralized lightweight body\nA simple and lightweight steel frame with minimal curves and welding is employed. The new YZF-R25 offers excellent handling through various features, including the front suspension with 41mm inner tubes, one of the largest in the class, Monocross suspension that contributes to mass centralization, and a rear arm that has the same axial distance ratio as the YZF-R1.\n3) Body design inherited from the YZF-R series\nThe new YZF-R25 features a sporty and advanced-looking design worthy of the YZF-R title. The mass-forward silhouette and sharply-sculpted rear end inherit the DNA of the R-series. The reverse-slant twin headlights for a sharper look, an air duct that evokes a sense of high performance, shift timing indicator identical to the YZF-R1, and other features are also derived from previous YZF-R designs.\n\nWe also have written earlier about the YZF-R25 here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYZF R25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYamaha YZF-R25 colours.

The interest for it have dropped since it is already being launched in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam long time ago. In fact, I already assumed that we will never get to see this bike in Malaysia and ready to accept it. Now, we are eager to get the 2011 Yamaha Jupiter MX which is 135LC with 5-speed, but there are no news for it right now whether it is going to be here or not.\nAnyway, what’s great about this Ego LC is the bike under seat compartment at 12.8 liter which can accommodate helmet easily. This volume is much bigger compared to my Lagenda 115ZR under seat compartment at only 7.0 liter.\nIn terms of sticker design, this one look okay. Compared to the Yamaha Mio 125 MotoGP Rossi Edition in Thailand, that one is purely desirable. But, you can have the cover set sprayed and embed the sticker of the Mio 125 to the Ego LC.\n9 more pictures after the jump\nPrice is said to be at RM5450.00 excluding road tax, insurance and registration.\nMore info here: http://www.yamaha-motor.com.my/egolc\nAdvertisements",

True to its commitment to produce bikes designed for ultimate sporting pleasure, KTM is at EICMA with innovative new machines for all surfaces that encapsulate the work and dedication of the company’s R & D department and the collective passion of everyone at KTM’s headquarters in Austria.\n\nHubert Trunkenpolz, CSO, KTM Power Sports AG: “Our message for the future is clear. KTM focuses on any surface more than ever on the strength of our products. The innovations that we are showing here in Milan are a perfect reflection of our innovative, sporting and strong engagement.”\nIntroducing the 690 Duke  \nRenowned for producing winning offroad bikes and fresh from a season of unparalleled success in MX World championship competition, KTM has also long turned its attention to street bikes. Now, just one model year on from the introduction of the highly successful 125 Duke, the entry level bike that has captivated the attention of not only young riders across Europe and beyond, KTM is proud to unveil the 690 Duke at EICMA. Based on more than 20 years of experience in LC4 motor technology and 18 years after the launch of the very first Duke, this single-cylinder bike is a dynamic but comfortable machine with even more power, brand new ABS, very impressive riding characteristics and a cutting edge design that is both new and typically KTM. The 690 Duke represents the very essence of the KTM philosophy and dedication for producing bikes that deliver pure riding pleasure and sporting satisfaction.\n \nKTM Duke 200 Official Picture\n200 Duke follows success of entry level 125 Duke\nFollowing the unprecedented success of the 125 Duke in 2011, which rocketed to the top of the 125 cc bike segment sales in the first six month of its release in the early summer of 2011, KTM now presents the equally attractive 200 cc version. This is a sporty small motorcycle that produces 19 kW (26 hp) that more than matches its little brother in impressive handling and typical KTM design language. The 200 Duke continues the success story of the KTM Duke models and the only small thing about it is the price.\n \nKTM Freeride E - E is for Electric\nFreeride E: the evolution of revolution\nKTM has taken on the challenge of developing an electrically driven offroad sports motorcycle for mass production and has become the first of the major motorcycle companies to do so. This exciting, sports-oriented, environmentally friendly bike is the culmination of three intense years of hard work and a commitment to innovation. The Freeride E embodies all the collective KTM experience garnered during years of development of conventional combustion-driven models and has resulted in a motorcycle that is not only pure KTM but also globally unique. The electric motor, developed in-house, is the throbbing heart of this dynamic machine that is not only emission free but is also almost silent. The Freeride E is proof of KTM’s drive and determination to take on a highly complex project and successfully transform it into a bike that offers intense riding pleasure in the spirit of pure offroad sports. 2012 is only the beginning of what represents a challenging, but electrifyingly exciting new segment in tune with the demands of today’s society.\nKTM 350 Freeride\n350 Freeride\nThe sport of motorcycling is at the very apex of the KTM philosophy. That is why for 2012 the company has also produced a second Freeride model with a conventional drive. Building on the extremely well balanced engine characteristics of the 350 cc engine that has served KTM’s Motocross and Enduro competition bikes so well in the past two years, the 350 Freeride is a lightweight bike capable of translating the thrill of the classic Enduro experience into one that requires the least amount of physical exertion. The 350 Freeride is the perfect introduction to the thrill and exhilaration of Enduro sport. Indeed with this bike, Enduro has never been easier.\nLet the curtain go up on the World of KTM at EICMA 2011\nKTM is proud to present new developments, innovations and updates right across its model range at EICMA 2011. In addition to the four outstanding new models there have been numerous improvements to existing models. The 690 SMC R and the 690 Enduro R have been completely revised to be more powerful and feature a fresh new design. Whether it is updating the 990 SM R to include ABS in 2012 or giving the 990 Super Duke R a pillion, the KTM development team, driven by pure passion, continues its mission to develop the world’s best sports motorcycles.\n\nAdvertisements",

I have taken the opportunity to test ride since I have never ride an electric bike before. The test ride are great since it gives me a feel of how electric bike can deliver its power and how it is different than the normal internal combustion bike.\n\nOn the initial start up, after turning the key, there is a switch on the right hand side that we need to set to ‘D’ that refer to ‘Drive’ position. There 3 position of the switch that is D, N and R. Yes, R refer to ‘Reverse’. I don’t think the R function will be used regularly. After that has been done, the bike is now ready to go. The sound of the engine at this time is completely silent (as expected from an electric bike).   Turning the throttle move the bike forward with a very little whirring sound from the tyre and the chain but not from the motor. I was wearing an open face helmet at that time, but the sound is still almost inaudible. If I were to use full face helmet, I think I can’t hear anything from the bike motor (engine). The power delivery has been regulated so that there is no shock when you rapidly open the throttle due to the installation of torque synchroniser. Electric motor are known to deliver very high torque from very low RPM (maybe even at 1RPM) and all the way to its maximum limit. So, torque synchroniser are one important addition for the bike.\nThe test drive are actually short and I have tried to ‘feel’ every detail of the bike. I want to actually test drive this bike in actual normal riding usage to answer few burning question about it. Does the battery can deliver its power without being dead at the wrong time of the moment? Also, I didn’t get to test the top speed of this CTric but inside the brochure it is said to be at 60km/h. This number can be improved from time to time, so this is a great effort by Modenas.\n\nI can say that this bike is great for anyone who uses the bike below 50km back and fourth in a day since you can’t leave your bike being recharged like it is getting fueled up at petrol station. Charging takes about 3.5hour.\nBased on what I see from the bike and the brochure that is given at the booth, it really seems that this bike is ready for production. I have asked few people from there and they said that they are just waiting for the green light from the Puspakom so that this bike can be insured and road legal. My hunch tells me that by the end of this year, we just might get this bike on the road. The price is estimated to be below RM5,000.\nAs a conclusion, this is bike is great effort from Modenas. Given few more year with continuous R & D can further develop this bike to be better in terms of mileage, top speed and lower charging time.\nUPDATE (17/06/2011): It is launched!

        "BMW\nConcept Ninety \n\nBMW Concept Ninety – modern retro made perfect \n\n\nPosted on May 31, 2013May 30, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nCernobbio. 90 years of BMW Motorrad, 90 years of two-wheeled history – hardly another motorcycle manufacturer can boast such a longstanding and successful heritage as BMW. The BMW R 90 S likewise has cause to celebrate: the BMW Motorrad design icon turns 40 this year. As a tribute to both these anniversaries, the BMW Group is presenting a very special model at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2013: the BMW Concept Ninety. In partnership with the custom bike company Roland Sands Design, the BMW Motorrad design team has come up with an exclusive homage to the BMW R 90 S. Former motorcycle racer Roland Sands and his team are among the most in-demand partners in the custom bike scene. Their design standards and the technical finesse with which they implement their high-class custom and performance parts endow the BMW Concept Ninety with an exclusive and self-assured presence. This cooperative venture elevates both Roland Sands Design and BMW Motorrad Design to a new level.   \n40 years of the BMW R 90 S. \nBack in 1973, BMW unveiled its flagship model in the “Stroke Six” range to the global public. Boasting a top speed of just over 200 km/h (124 mph), it was one of the fastest production bikes of its day and went on to claim numerous prizes in a variety of race series. Even when parked it radiated a powerful appeal: for the first time in the development process of a motorcycle, a designer had forged a successful alliance of form and function while creating the first motorcycle ever to feature a front fairing as standard. Together with its sporty tail end and striking Daytona Orange paintwork, it endowed the BMW R 90 S with an unmistakable identity. The design of this bike pointed the way forward, and it wasn’t long before other manufacturers were gracing their motorcycles with aerodynamically honed front and rear fairings. Today the erstwhile trendsetter is one of BMW’s design icons. “The BMW R 90 S hails from an era in which bikers were regarded as outlaws,” comments Edgar Heinrich, Head of BMW Motorrad Design. “There was something rebellious about it – it was fast, loud and wild. Pure emotion. And it has retained its fascination to this day.”\n \nBMW Concept Ninety. \nThe BMW Concept Ninety resurrects this spirit of the emotionally charged superbike, translating the emotionality and inspiration of the earlier model into a contemporary guise. This is a modern reiteration of the traditional essence of the motorcycle: the harmonious unison of man and machine – pure and emotional. “Today BMW motorcycles stand for perfection and function. That is what we have worked hard to achieve and something we are very proud of,” says Ola Stenegard, Head of Vehicle Design BMW Motorrad. “But we want more than that. With the BMW Concept Ninety we want to show how reduced and pure an emotional BMW motorcycle can be.”\nThe BMW Concept Ninety takes to the stage as a sporty boxer with a battery of sophisticated details. Its basic proportions clearly take their cue from the forebear that inspired this concept: the fairing, tank, seat and tail instantly signal its family bond with the BMW R 90 S. The BMW Concept Ninety also picks up on the demarcation of the bike’s proportions that was a hallmark of the time. The upper ergonomic and aerodynamic bodywork is visually separated from the black engine and chassis. The bodywork is hand crafted from aluminium. Its brushed areas can be seen in the tinted areas of the front fairing and tank, as well as at the tail. The rich orange shade of the BMW Concept Ninety is also a nod to the legendary Daytona Orange paintwork of the BMW R 90 S.\nThe BMW Concept Ninety delivers a very sporty interpretation of the front fairing. But whereas halogen was technically cutting-edge in the BMW R 90 S era, contemporary LED elements light up the face of the BMW Concept Ninety, honouring its ancestor with a round headlamp design. Seamlessly mounted behind it, the dynamically shaped tank ensures an optimal connection between rider and machine. Further along, the tank and seat melt harmoniously into each other. A steadily ascending line from the handlebars to the tail creates a slight wedge shape, lending the BMW Concept Ninety an almost ready to attack stance when viewed from the side – like a sprinter about to explode into action. Below the bodywork sits the air-cooled flat-twin boxer engine. Entirely in black with contrast cut details this section of the bike symbolises concerted power, precision and  performance. The mechanics and technology as a whole are purposely rendered visible and reflect a keen attention to detail.\n \nCustom parts made by Roland Sands Design. \nAs the observer’s gaze gradually penetrates this motorcycle, more and more details are revealed. Many of the high-quality parts of the BMW Concept Ninety hail from custom bike specialists Roland Sands Design in California. In close collaboration with BMW Motorrad Design, the Roland Sands Design team designed and manufactured these parts specially for the BMW Concept Ninety. The mechanical parts and engine area, above all, bear the Roland Sands imprint. Particular attention was devoted to those elements typical of a boxer, and thus also of BMW, which were meticulously designed and elaborately finished. Key highlights include the front cover of the engine and the valve covers, that got painstakingly milled, as well as the exhaust system. The parts were milled using a contrast cut process, which strikes an alluring contrast to the black mechanical components. This technology was also applied to the rims, whose classic design recalls the racing triumphs of the BMW R 90 S in the 1970s. The machining and technical implementation of the parts, are state of the art – like all the details on the BMW Concept Ninety. “It was important for me to translate the special statement made by the BMW R 90 S into the present through the use of unique parts – employing emotional design and cutting-edge technology,” says Roland Sands of his approach to the bike. Likewise designed and made by Roland Sands are the brake and clutch controls, the Paralever arm and the air filter under the seat. All these meticulously manufactured individual parts blend smoothly into the form language of the BMW Concept Ninety.\n“Everything just fits together perfectly: the BMW technology, the BMW heritage and our custom parts complement each other beautifully,” comments Roland Sands on the result of this collaboration. Edgar Heinrich adds: “The BMW Concept Ninety is sheer enjoyment in every respect – from the development of the idea to the sketching stage to the construction process. But above all when you’re riding it. It’s an absolute riding machine – just like the R 90 S was in its time.” Unlike other custom bikes, the BMW Concept Ninety can be – indeed begs to be – ridden. The motorcycle and all its components have been designed with top performance in mind.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 15 Japan: Lorenzo wins the day and Marquez the MotoGP™ championship at Motegi – 1st Lorenzo, 2nd Marquez, 3rd Rossi \n\n\nPosted on October 12, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nYamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo continued his irresistible form in the second half of the 2014 MotoGP season as he won his second consecutive race at Motegi as Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez made it back-to-back MotoGP™ World Championship titles by taking second place in the Japanese Grand Prix.\nAn exciting start to race saw Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi get the holeshot to lead into turn one, a position he held for the first four laps before Lorenzo squeezed past his teammate to take the over at the front. As his rivals battled behind him, Lorenzo set a scorching pace at the front of the field, setting a new Motegi race lap record of 1’45.350 on lap eight and going on to take the chequered flag by 1.638 seconds from Marquez, with Rossi rounding out the podium in third place a further second back.  Race day at Motegi experienced the coolest conditions of the weekend with the peak track temperature recording during the race being 27°C which was 13°C cooler than measured during qualifying yesterday. The fresher temperatures didn’t have a significant effect on race tyre choice, with almost every rider opting for the same tyre combinations they used in race simulations earlier on the weekend. All twenty-four riders selected the medium compound front slick, while fifteen riders selected the soft compound rear slick, and the other nine riders opting for the extra-soft compound rear. After record-breaking pace in yesterday’s qualifying sessions, more records were set at the Motegi circuit during the race with race winner Lorenzo setting a new race lap record of 1’45.350 on lap eight and the overall race time today being over ten seconds quicker than the existing record.\nWith Marc Marquez wrapping up the title at Motegi, the focus now shifts to the battle for second place in the riders’ standings. Valentino Rossi and Dani Pedrosa are currently tied on 230 points, while Jorge Lorenzo is now just three points behind on 227 points and fourth in the standings.\nMasahiro Higashi\n– Vice President and Officer, Global Marketing Strategy and Motorsport, Bridgestone Corporation\n“Congratulations to Jorge on his victory today and Yamaha on their continued good form which has given them three wins in the past four races. I would also like to congratulate Marc and Honda for securing their second consecutive MotoGP World Championship today, especially here in Japan at Honda’s home circuit. This weekend has been a successful one for Bridgestone with many records being set on our tyres and it is a source of pride for our company to share in such special moments as we witnessed at Motegi today. We now are looking forward to supporting the MotoGP championship for the remaining three races and hope to see more exciting battles to come.”\nShinichi Yamashita – General Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“Today was a great end to what was a very successful weekend for Bridgestone. After a new qualifying lap record was set yesterday, today Lorenzo set a new race lap record and the overall race time was also the quickest ever, with the top riders averaging around half a second per lap quicker for the entire twenty-four laps compared to the previous record race time at Motegi. The track temperature today was also significantly cooler than yesterday, but our tyre allocation for this year’s Japanese Grand Prix proved adaptable enough to deal with this change in conditions, so overall I am very happy with our results here at Motegi.”\nJorge Lorenzo, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP – Race Winner\n“I’m really happy to get this second win in a row after my victory at Aragon. Here I knew I had a good pace, I want to thank Yamaha for the great job they’ve done to make our bike so competitive. I didn’t expect to build such a big gap during the race, but in the final laps both Marc and Valentino were really quick so I had to push right until the end and it was enough to win the race.”\nJapanese MotoGP™ Top 10 Race Results\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’21.259\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’22.897\n\n\n1.638\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’23.861\n\n\n2.602\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’24.416\n\n\n3.157\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n42’35.612\n\n\n14.353\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n42’37.912\n\n\n16.653\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nStefan BRADL\n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n\n\n42’40.790\n\n\n19.531\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n42’41.074\n\n\n19.815\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n42’44.834\n\n\n23.575\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n42’56.946\n\n\n35.687\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

The partnership marks their return from their highly successful initial endeavour in organising the 1Minimoto Challenge Malaysia event held last year.  \nOfficially sanctioned by both the Ministry of Youth & Sports Malaysia (KBS) and the Motorsports Association of Malaysia (MAM), at least 60 participants registered to compete across several categories for the one-day race event. Amongst the categories contested included MiniGP sprint and endurance races, Supermoto sprint races, an exclusive Time Attack session for KTM Malaysia CKD bikes, and a unique new category tailored specifically for two-stroke race machines called the “2T 150 Challenge”.\n\nLike the 1Minimoto Challenge that preceded it, 1Full Throttle Challenge has aimed itself specifically at inspiring and nurturing many young and talented Malaysians with a properly sanctioned racing avenue. More importantly, the event’s secondary mission was also to promote motorsports safety amongst youths, combating illegal street racing in the process. The latter mission was expressed fully with an anti-street racing slogan adorned on the front fairings of each PiTRIDES’ Kayo MiniGP race bikes.\n\nThis year, the organisers of 1Full Throttle Challenge event were privileged to have several key partners and sponsors that helped in making the event a success. These included Shell Advance, KTM Malaysia CKD, Shark Helmets Malaysia (Winmaster Sdn Bhd), Alpinestars Malaysia (Iktikad Raya Marketing Sdn Bhd), AHM PRO Racing Exhaust, Strada 7, QBEE Motors, as well as local online motorcycling portals BikesRepublic.com and MotoMalaya.net acting as the event’s official publicity partners.\n\nFor many spectators in attendance, the on-track action and duel between riders in their respective categories was a sight to behold. However, it was the Malaysian riders from the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 that stole the limelight halfway through the day amongst many young fans. Riders Shafiq Rasol, Helmi Azman, and the towering Fakhrusy Rostam were present and took part in a special demonstration free run session, displaying their top-flight skill and fitness levels they have achieved from competing in Asia’s only leading Moto3 championship series.\n\nWhilst the Asia Talent Cup riders’ demonstration was aimed at inspiring the new generation, the special 2T 150 Challenge brought out much nostalgia amongst many older-aged fans. The sight, sounds, and even the smell of these two-stroke machines reliving their glory days was also something to behold, with participants hailing from all corners of the peninsula competing for the title as the undisputed ‘King of 2T’. Amongst the machines that were fielded here included legendary and fan favourite models such as the Kawasaki Ninja 150RR Super Kips, the Yamaha TZM 150, and the Suzuki TXR150.\n\nThough the late afternoon thunderstorm wreaked havoc in the day’s scheduled Supermoto and MiniGP sprint races, it did little in extinguishing the passionate flame in many of the categories participants– both young and old, men and women. More importantly, the one-day event concluded with no serious injuries reported amongst participants, with many of them crowned as champions in their categories including one lady rider in the Supermoto CKD category. Many were awarded with the all-important trophies, as well as various exclusive prizes and gifts contributed by the event’s key sponsors and partners such as Shell Advance and Shark Helmets Malaysia.\n\nAs the 1Full Throttle Challenge 2015 challenge concluded last weekend, organisers HB Motorsports and PiTRIDES have shifted their focus towards organising yet another edition of the challenge before the year ends. More details will be announced at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only racer girl here, Siti Fatimah, leading all the way to her victory in Supermoto CKD category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

        "250cc\nYamaha\nYZF-R25 \n\n2015 Yamaha YZF-R25 Officially Launched in Malaysia – RM19,783 (basic) – available in April 2015 [UPDATED] \n\n\nPosted on February 5, 2015January 12, 2016 by eddy \n\n\n\n2014 Yamaha YZF-R25 has been unveiled officially in Malaysia by Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia. It is a very interesting bike and focuses on the performance which is exactly what Yamaha should do and they do deliver. It comes in two colour choices that is Diablo Red and Racing Blue (this is the normal version, NOT the Movistar Yamaha MotoGP livery).\n\n\nThis is an interesting bike as we all know it. It fights the other 250cc bikes in terms of performance. I love this bike as soon as I know the specs. It delivers 36PS (35.5hp, 26.5kW) at 12,000RPM with torque rated at 22.1Nm at 10,000RPM. This is definitely one of the highest power rating for a 250cc bike compared to currently available in the market. As a comparison, look at these numbers: 2011 Kawasaki Ninja 250 2-cylinder is at 32hp, 2011 Naza Blade 250 V-Twin 2-cylinder at 28.8hp and YZF-R25 only lower than 1998 Kawasaki ZX250R 4-inline at 45hp (this one higher la cause 4-inline, I put here to compare only la bro).\n\nThe engine is the highlight of the bike as it is equipped with 4-stroke DOHC 8-valve (4-valve per cylinder) 2-cylinder inline liquid-cooled configuration. It is definitely fuel injection type with TCI (Transistorized Control Ignition) ignition system. One thing to note is that this engine is tuned to handle a high compression ratio at 11.6:1 that provide better ‘kick’ for each power stroke of the bike engine. The bore and stroke dimension of YZF-R25 are overbore at 60.0 x 44.1mm which shows the high-revving-happy of the engine due to the short-stroke configuration.\n\nTransmission fitted for this YZF-R25 is the sweet 6-speed gearbox with multiplate wet manual clutch system. 6-speed gearbox will enable you to play nicely with the engine high RPM to maxes out the 36PS from it.\n\nBraking system is handled by disc brake system for both front and rear tyre. The front brake system features 298mm floating disc(two-piece type) 2-piston caliper. The rear brake system is handled by 220mm one piece disc with 1-piston caliper.\nSuspension are also given special treatment by Yamaha as the front telescopic fork are now 41mm which can be considered big in its class. For comparison, the other bike that use big front fork diameter like this is the KTM RC 200. Rear suspension is the usual monocross suspension that provides great handling.\nYamaha favourite frame type is the diamond-type and it is again being used in this YZF-R25 as it offers high stiffness and low weight for that easy handling especially when taking corners.\n2015 Yamaha YZF-R25 price in Malaysia is estimated at RM20k but it is not final yet. Some says that the final price is lower than its 2-cylinder competitors. This is CKD in Sungai Buloh. For OTR price, I can safely estimate around RM23-24k. Is it a good price for a good bike?\nUPDATE: 2015 Yamaha YZF-R25 price in Malaysia is RM19,783 (basic without GST)\nYamaha YZF-R25 Technical Specs/Specification\nType : 4-stroke, 8-valve DOHC liquid-cooled motomalaya.net\nCylinder/position : 2/inlinemotomalaya.net\nBore X Stoke : 60,0 X 44,1 mmmotomalaya.net\nCompression ratio : 11,6 : 1motomalaya.net\nFuel System : Fuel Injectionmotomalaya.net\nIgnition system : TCI (Transistorized Control Ignition)motomalaya.net\nSpark type : CR9Emotomalaya.net\nBattery : GTZ8V (MF Battery 7.4 Ah)motomalaya.net\nStarter : Electric Startermotomalaya.net\nLubrication: Wetmotomalaya.net\nEngine oil capacity: Total = 2,40 L ; Servis = 1,80 L ; Oil filter change = 2,10 L\nLength x Width x Height : 2.090 mm X 720 mm X 1.135 mm\nSeat height : 780 mm\nGround clearance : 160 mm motomalaya.net\nWheel base : 1380 mm\nCaster angle : 25 degree\nTrail : 95 mmmotomalaya.net\nMaximum output : 26,5 KW(36 PS) @ 12.000 rpmmotomalaya.net\nMaximum torque : 22,1N.m @ 10.000 rpmmotomalaya.net\nCurb mass: 166 kgmotomalaya.net\nFuel tank capacity : 14,3 L (Res : 3 L)\nChassis type: Diamondmotomalaya.net\nTransmission: Manual, 6-speedmotomalaya.net\nClutch : Wet, Manual clutch , Multiplatemotomalaya.net\nFront & Rear tyre : Tubeless 110/70-17M/C(54S) & 140/70 – 17M/C(66S)\nFront and rear brake : Floating Ø 298mm, 2-Piston & Disc Ø 220mm 1-Pistonmotomalaya.net\nFront suspension : Telescopic Fork (diameter 41 mm)\nRear suspension : Monocross Suspension\nFront lamp : DC Halogen 12V,55W (H7)\nRear lamp: LED\nOfficial press release by HLYM:\nSepang, 5th February 2015 – Hong Leong Yamaha Motor Sdn. Bhd  (HLYM) launched its latest pride, the Yamaha YZF-R25 in conjunction with the Yamaha Motor Co, Ltd Japan’s Motorsports Media Conference at Sepang today. The resilient Yamaha YZF-R25 carries all the accumulated Yamaha DNAs from years of passion, knowledge and experience. This combined DNA presents an unparalleled sports bike feel and sensation which the company is excited to present to the Malaysian motorcycle market.\nThe R-series sports bikes have been exemplary and the YZF-R25 takes it a notch up with its 2-inline Diasil cylinders, DOHC, 8-valves liquid-cooled 250cc, forged piston and downdraft induction fuel injection system combined with a lightweight body design with a perfect centre of gravity. The power and weight ratio is at its stellar best in this model as well. The dual predator headlights speak volumes of the kind of detailed thought put into the YZF-R25. Its unique angular design offers a “predator look” but also functions brighter, sharper and has focussed lighting.\nDuring the launch, Mr. C.H. Ng, Managing Director of Hong Leong Yamaha Motor said, “We are thrilled to present to you the YZF-R25 for so many reasons. There is no doubt we have always been proud of the Yamaha R Series. The YZF-R25 is sporty, lightweight and stylish. Its sleek design is only rivalled by its superb functionality and this is why we are certain it is a model that will be sought after by superbike enthusiasts.”\nHong Leong Yamaha Motor is also proud to unveil this sports bike for its nimble and easy-to- use daily riding experience. The YZF-R25 has a super sport split seat, super sport speedometer, super sport led tail light, aluminium cast wide wheel and wide tyre. Its asymmetric swing arm is strong and solid for a more stable ride with a Monocross Twin-tube rear suspension for sure-handling at sharp corners during high-speed. The YZF-R25 is also agile for its diamond-type frame which is compact and lightweight. Made of steel tubing that offers optimum balance of strength and stability, this superbike is set to take its riders on a speedy yet safe and bump-free ride. Its mid ship sporty muffler also makes for a more exciting ride as it projects a sexy masculine sporty sound.\n“Yamaha earned widespread acclaim in 1998 when Yamaha released the “YZF-R1” into the European and North American markets. It was dubbed as a model that offered “unsurpassed excitement” on winding roads. This model raised the bar in sport bikes and enthusiasts waxed lyrical about it, earning widespread acclaim,” said Mr. C.H. Ng. “We take great pride in the YZF –R25 as it uses the R-Series technology and know-how Yamaha has accumulated since the original YZF-R1. Now, we present the “YZF” lineup to the 250cc displacement class. This high level of riding performance and styling DNA which is inherited is worthy of an R-Series model, yet it gives sports bike buffs easy handling for day to day use. We are certain the YZF-R25 uses its full potential of a 250cc sport model and is apt for a global market.”\nThe YZF-R5 is set to take the market by storm with all its offerings. Hong Leong Yamaha Motor is confident this model, with its agile handling, inimitable super sport design and balance of high performance and fuel efficiency, will supersede all expectations. More importantly, it will also meet all requirements enthusiasts have for any superbike and offer an exhilarating ride.\nImage and price info credit to Sinar Turbo, Adam BR.\nAdvertisements",
        "Moto Malaya \n\nRZR: The Other Version of RX-Z \n\n\nPosted on September 9, 2008 by eddy \n\n\nYamaha RZR, Mexico Version of RX-Z\nDifferent people have different taste. Different country, different market. So, what has been done by Yamaha in order to catch the motorcycle market in Mexico, they have modified Yamaha RX-Z version in Asia to Yamaha RZR.\nThe differences can be looked at the full-fairing set compared to the naked look of RX-Z and the rear brake that has been equipped with disc brake where RX-Z only have drum brake.\nIMHO, I prefer the current look of RX-Z. The full-fairing maybe give a better aerodynamics than naked configuration but at a cost of more weight. The full-fairing also will make the access to the engine much harder. The thing that I want from RZR is the rear brake disc configuration to be installed on RX-Z as standard. Rear brake is important since it can give a better confidence in braking while in high speed. Some biker said that it is useless to use the rear brake, but for me, it is very important. Since RX-Z use a rear drum brake, that is a good way to make the bike much cheaper than other competing bike. The only competitor for RX-Z that I know is Honda Raider 135, but it is not so popular compared to RX-Z.\nLooking back to Malaysia, I’m happy with the current design of RX-Z and my favorite colour for it is BLACK. \nAdvertisements",

The reveal took place at the Beach Club in Kuala Lumpur and unofficially kicks off a sensational week of Ducati product launches, thrilling activities and celebrations that coincide with the Malaysian MotoGP weekend at the Sepang International Circuit.  \nFrom left to right 1.

JUAN CHOW WEE – ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT, NEXT BIKE SDN BHD\n“In-conjunction with the Malaysian MotoGP, we will be welcoming our brothers and sisters from all around the World to celebrate Asia Ducati Week 2014. We are proud to host this international event for three consecutive times and successfully making Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur in particular a two wheel tourist destination,” said Datuk Wira HJ SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, NAZA Group of Companies Joint Group Executive Chairman.\n“This year’s Asia Ducati Week features the newly launched Scrambler that was unveiled to the world in Intermot Germany in October 2014 and we are proud to preview this latest addition to the family that said to be “Self-Expression” and to welcome you to the World of Joy,” added Datuk Wira HJ SM Faisal. “Ducati Malaysia will officially launch the full range of Ducati Scrambler sometime in the first quarter of 2015,” furthered Datuk Wira HJ SM Faisal.\nFor months, Ducati kept the new Scrambler guarded within a (now famous) large yellow container, sharing only snippets of information on the bike’s look and features in a 3-episode web series released on the Internet. Ending the agonizing wait, on 18 July, the Scrambler was previewed in spectacular fashion at the World Ducati Week 2014. The Scrambler is now touring the globe, making special appearances in numerous countries before passionate Ducatisti who have long awaited its introduction.\nA contemporary interpretation of the original 1970’s icon, the Ducati Scrambler 2015 is an easy-to-handle sport bike that is comfortable, accessible and every bit as fashionable as its predecessor. Whilst it certainly exhibits a retro flair, the Scrambler was not designed to indulge in the nostalgic but rather was ‘intended to be just how the legendary Bologna-built motorcycle would be today if Ducati had never stopped building it’.\nAdvertisements",

So, I’ll share about the features, background and my first impression about this Shinko EVO SR877 motorcycle in the size of 70/90-17 and 80/90-17. After installing it to my ride, then I can write about test drive review. So, lets start after the jump with 21 more pictures\nOk, I know, you were thinking that this SR877 have the same side tread like the Maxxis MA-3D. But check out the picture below.\nMaxxis MA-3D\nSo, as you can see, it is different, but maybe the idea is the same; to provide better grip on knee-down cornering. Both tyre are great with beautiful tread. Nowadays, the design not just only needs to be functional, but also needs to serve as an addition to the style of the bike. Remember the saying ‘if it looks good, it should function as good as it looks, but first, it needs to look good’ on the MV Agusta F3 article recently?\n\nI got this Shinko SR877 sent to my office directly from Yoshi Marketing in Johor Bahru. While it is at the front office desk, two of my friend asked me where do I get this tyre. They both said that the tread of the SR877 are beautiful. Both of my friend are also motorhead like me. One of them use Duro 80/90-17 for both wheel for Honda Wave 110RS.\nBeautiful, but Shinko?\nLet me share a little bit about Shinko Motorcycle Tyre company. All of Shinko tyres are made in Korea and they are one of the few manufacturer that makes full range of motorcycle tyres from bias-ply to off-road to radial.\nThe technology of the motorcycle tire acquired by Shinko is from the machines and moulds that they have bought from Yokohama motorcycle division in 1998 after Yokohama factory in Kobe was hit by earthquake. I think that is why we seldom heard about the Shinko. Maybe because they are only 13 years old in motorcycle business. Shinko itself is established on 1946, but at that time they were only selling bicycle tubes and tyres. Now, Shinko has gaining popularity as provider of good motorcycle tyres with very affordable prices. Shinko is also the OEM manufacturer for; Hankook car spare tyres, some of Continental (Germany) Motorcycle Radial Tyres, Yokohama Kart tyres and is also the OEM supplier of tyres to Hyosung Motorcycles (Korean Motorcycles which are brought into Malaysia branded Naza). I have read a lot of forum about Shinko tyres and all of the forum give positive review about the Shinko tyres. Read about it here and here. And many more you can google your way through. But, most of the reviews that I read are about Shinko being fitted to superbikes ranging from 250cc to 1000cc. It is time for me to do the test drive review soon. I’m eager to get this Shinko EVO SR877 installed.\nNow, back to the SR877 tyre initial impression.\n\nI personally really like the tread of this SR877. The big bar of the tread on the center creates a lot of contact to the road. Therefore, grip can be increased. Also, SR877 is made from medium-soft rubber compound that should give balance for grip and durability for long term usage.The softer the compounds, the greater the grip but at expense of durability. One of the soft compound tyre that I know is the Battlax that is used in Malaysian Cub Prix racing series. Battlax BT090 cost about RM380 per piece.\nOn the knee-down cornering angle, Shinko has provided the small ‘teeth’ in the shape of square-based pyramid for better grip the road. This will give more confident for the rider to get lower angle of corner attack.\n\nThe deep groove of the tread keeps the tyre from aquaplaning (floating when it is in contact with water puddle). The tread groove (water channel) also extends all the way to the side of the tyre which provides great water dissipation. This is important to Malaysia bikers since the rain happens in almost every few days. Having this kind of tread makes my choices of tyres can be narrowed down.\n\nI hope my preview here can give you all a little bit of insights of what kind of tyre this Shinko EVO SR877 is. If I’m wrong somewhere, hope you can correct me in the comment section.\nNext, test drive review. Soon!\nOne more, it is also said that Shinko is the no. 1 top selling tyres in USA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RRP price of Shinko SR877 series is:\n70/90-17: RM118\n80/80-17: RM138\n80/90-17: RM138\n90/80-17: RM168\n100/80-17: RM188\nYou can look more for motorcycle tyre price here: http://malaysianbikers.com.my/forum/index.php/topic,65191.0.html\nMore info here: http://www.yoshimarketing.com/\nAdvertisements",

That kind of disc plate might cost you about RM200+.But if you try to buy the original one, it might set you back to RM300+ for the standard size disc plate.For me, I prefer the original ones as it is much tougher and more durable than the aftermarket parts. Not that the aftermarket parts is not good, it is just can’t match the quality of original parts. I have seen one original disc plate fitted to a 10 year old Yamaha bike and still usable up to this point. The disc plate has thinned down but not much, maybe just 1mm. Disc plate is not something you change frequently, it is the brake pad that needs the love and care. But do you care about the brand and originality of your brake pad?\nAdvertisements",

This is definitely an all new machine that is equipped with new fuel injection engine. The engine not only gets an upgrade on the fuel delivery but also on the inside of the engine. It features the technology from Yamaha racing knowhow that is YZ Crankshaft Technology, Low Friction Technology and Forged Piston.  \n\nThe crankshaft are taken from the technology of YZ450F which is a trail bike that contain a lot of torque. Low friction technology are used to minimise the friction so that the power are not wasted and delivered to the power train with minimal power loss.\n\nOne of the proven technology from MotoGP is the use of the forged piston. This kind of piston has high material durability and at the same time is lightweight. In the end, the piston are able to deliver the massive power from the engine and making the bike is much more easier to be accelerated.\n\nWhat surprise me is the 20% power increase claim from the previous version of the Jupiter Z115. 20% is in fact a big increase, but with the available technology fitted to this bike, I think it is achievable. The current version of the Jupiter Z115 produces 6.0kW, so based on my calculation the Jupiter Z1 is at 7.2kW. The current top speed of the Jupiter Z115 is 110km/h, so again I’m calculating that this Jupiter Z1 should be able to get 132km/h. All that are based from my calculation and not tested on the road.\n\nThis is really what I expect from one of the top bike manufacturer in the world. Improvements, green technology and at the same time still capable of producing of fun and high performance bike from a small engine.\nAdvertisements",

It was not long before the others followed him.\nAs at 2pm and some four hours into the first day of testing, it was the nine-time world champion, Rossi who led the way with his best lap time 2 minutes 0.380 seconds. He completed more than 20 laps around the 5,548-meter track.\nRossi’s teammate and former MotoGP world champion, Jorge Lorenzo, stepped up the pace and clocked the second fastest time in the afternoon with his best of 2 minutes 0.521 seconds.\nMarquez clocked 2 minutes 0.930 seconds in the afternoon but as the day progressed, the Spaniard began to improve and eventually clocked the fastest time of the day with his best lap time of 2:00.262, pushing Rossi and Lorenzo down a rung. Marquez went on to complete a grueling 63 laps today.\nNot surprisingly, after two months off their racing bikes, the riders’ lap times were significantly below Sepang’s best of 1 minute 59.533 seconds that was recorded by Marquez at last year’s pre-season testing.\nThat unofficial fastest lap time by Marquez, could be under threat on the second and third day of testing, provided the weather conditions remain good.\nThe official test session today saw the return of Aprilia and Suzuki into the MotoGP World Championship, which will open at Losail International Circuit in Qatar on March 29. Sepang will host the penultimate round from October 23 to 25.\nAprilia have signed up Italian Marco Melandri and Mike di Meglio of France while Team Suzuki MotoGP will be counting on Aleix Espargaro and Maverick Vinales, both from Spain, to lead their challenge.\nSepang will host a second three-day official test session for the MotoGP from February 23 to 25 with a third session scheduled from March 14 to 17 at Losail in Qatar.\nIn conjunction with the test sessions in Sepang, fans are welcomed to see their idols in action from the Main Grandstand and use the opportunity to purchase time-limited, earlybird discount tickets for both the 2015 MotoGP race as well as that for the eni FIM Superbike World Championship Malaysian Round, the latter which is scheduled from July 31 to August 2.\nFor the MotoGP race in October, limited Premier Roving tickets, which allow access to all spectator seating areas, are being offered at only RM250 under the current earlybird promotion whilst earlybird Main Grandstand, K1 and F tickets are only RM150, RM70 and RM50 respectively.\nFor the Superbike race, the Main Grandstand earlybird tickets are priced at RM100 while that for K1 Grandstand is offered at only RM60.\nTODAY’S TOP FIVE FASTEST RIDERS\n\nMarc Marquez (Repsol Honda Team) 2:00.262\nValentino Rossi (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) 2:00.380\nJorge Lorenzo (Movistar Yamaha MotoGP) 2:00.521\nAndrea Dovizioso (Ducati Team) 2:00.617\n\nDani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda Team) 2:00745\nAdvertisements",

Built on Honda values and the success of its Honda Wave 100 which was introduced in 2006 and sold an impressive 274,000 units, the All-New Wave 110 is set to delight discerning bike lovers who prioritise value added performance, fuel efficiency and stylish. The All-New Wave 110 is packed with high value features that makes it a “One for All” bike brings more joy of riding to more customers.  \nSpeaking at the launch, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda, Satoshi Okada said, “With the tagline, ‘Satu Untuk Semua’ or ‘One for All’, the All-New Wave 110 is living up to the demands of today’s riders who want more value. We are confident that the All-New Honda Wave 110 will captivate with its superb riding and new value added features.”\n\n“Since its first introduction, the Wave has remained popular among Malaysians for its practicality, efficient fuel consumption and dynamic performance. The key to our success is our level of customer satisfaction. At Boon Siew Honda, we always provide customers with the joy and satisfaction of global quality. The launch of the All-New Wave 110 attests to our continuous efforts to enhance our products. With the All-New Wave 110, we have raised the bar in innovation and advanced technology in a bike. The All-New Wave 110 is an ideal fit for everyone who expects more from a bike. It comes with improved engine, advanced safety features, and a more rugged and modern look.”\n\nThe All-New Wave 110 is powered by a 4-stroke engine that gives maximum horsepower of 5.64kW (7.67PS) at 7500 rpm and maximum torque of 8.32N.m (0.85kgf.m) at 3500 rpm. Meeting Euro-2 emission standards, the engine of the All-New Wave 110 gives cleaner emission and better performance. This improved engine gives higher fuel efficiency at 52.5km/l, traveling an impressive 3.1km further to a litre as compared to its previous generation of Wave 100 that give a fuel efficiency of 49.4km/l. The result was tested in ECE 40 mode.\n\nSafety features of the All-New Wave 110 have been further emphasised for riders. To improve visibility for the rider and of the rider to other motorists especially at night and in low light conditions, the tail light and headlight have been redesigned. The new tail light gives bright, sharp luminescence with clear rear signaling.

All lighting are tested and comply with UN R53 Lamp installation, R3 Reflector, R50 Lamp performance and R112/R113 Headlamp requirement. Safety when braking is also enhanced; the All-New Wave 110 calls on its Front Disc Brake (applies only for DX variant) to modulate the braking power for a safe ride at all times. Giving a quieter and more comfortable ride where noise emitted is reduced and heat is diminished is the new Exhaust Pipe with thermal protector. This new exhaust also provides added safety from heat. Comfort is extended to the handlebar where the switches are ergonomically placed for natural hand movements and more user-friendly.\n\nRiders will find the U-Box of the All-New Wave 110 spacious enough to store their personal items, providing the added convenience of storing belongings securely.\nWave DX110 Coral Orange Metallic\nThe rugged looking Cast Wheel does not just look robust; it is durable against most city terrains.

        "150cc\n150LC\nY15ZR\nYamaha \n\nGallery: 2015 Yamaha Y15ZR 150cc Fuel Injection Launched at Berjaya Times Square – RM7,999.82 incl GST \n\n\nPosted on August 8, 2015January 31, 2017 by eddy \n\n\n2015 Yamaha Y15ZR in Malaysia\nThis has been an important launch for Hong Leong Yamaha for 2015. The 150cc moped has been available in the neighbouring market that is Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. Exciter 150 FI, Jupiter MX King and now in Malaysia, it is named Y15ZR.\nI have been asking about the name, why it is not named 150LC, to Mr Voon YK of HLYM. I asked whether the name Y15ZR is choosen because it is the same like Y125Z which is a high performance moped so that the user will think that the Y15ZR is also one part of high performance product from Yamaha? Mr Voon YK said yes, how you perceive the bike is correct.  \nAlso asked is whether this Y15ZR is to replace the Y125Z soon? No, the Yamaha Y125Z is still in production, but since it is a long production bike (old bike), it might be stopped someday. But not anytime soon as HLYM tries to comply to the government for any rules and regulation regarding the 2-stroke bike in Malaysia. For your information, any manufacturer can still continue to produce their existing 2-stroke bike if they follow the rules and regulation but cannot produce a new line of 2-stroke model. Hence, we can see Y125Z is still available from Yamaha and Dinamik 120 still available from Modenas. But why not Kawasaki KRR150?\n\nY15ZR comes with 3 colour to choose that is Red, Blue and Black. The one that interest me is the blue colour. It got that really nice blue, grey and white combination that looks very good in real life rather that in the picture. The black and red is nice too, but as it is from Yamaha, we know that blue works best for them since their official colour is Race-Blu.\nThe engine of the Y15ZR is 4-stroke, 4-valve SOHC and liquid-cooled. Bore and stroke is 57.0 x 58.7 mm that is the same number with the one in the engine of Yamaha FZ150i. This might actually indicate that it is using the same engine with few tuning here and there. It can generates maximum output at 15.4PS (11.3kW) at 8,500RPM and 13.8Nm of torque at 7,000RPM. Comparing to the 2014 Yamaha FZ150i, we can see that it is 0.9kW lower with FZ150i output at 12.2kW.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 Yamaha Y15ZR with center box\n\n\nOne more thing to notice about the engine is that now it is using fuel injection system replacing the carburetor system in the 135LC previously.\n\nLooks closely at the kick-starter location and you can see that there is no kick-starter.\n\nThe rear tyre now are super wide, wider than 135LC and FZ150i, at 120/70-17. That is wiiiidddeee.\nUPDATE (11/8/2015): 2015 Yamaha Y15ZR 150 FI price is RM7,999.82 incl. GST (basic price). For comparison, 2014 Yamaha FZ150i is RM8,600 and 135LC 5-speed at RM7,000. All basic price.\nUPDATE (19/9/2015): Many reader were asking about the availability of center box (bakul) for Y15ZR. Yes, it is available and can be fitted nicely.

The high speeds, hard braking zones and high camber angles of some corners results in this circuit being one of the more severe for tyres on the MotoGP™ calendar.\nThe Rio Hondo circuit has an unbalanced layout with nine right-hand corners compared to just five left-handers. However, the left-hand corners tend to be more severein nature than the right-handers and in particular corners such as turn six and eleven generate high tyre temperatures, so the overall loads placed on the left and right shoulders of the tyres are similar. This means the rear tyre allocation for this circuit will be symmetric.\nThe overall severity of the Autódromo Termas de Río Hondo means the rear tyre allocation features rubber compounds from the harder end of the scale. Rear slick tyre options for the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders are the medium and hard compound rear slick, while the Ducati and open-class riders have access to the soft and medium compound rear slicks. As the Rio Termas Hondo circuit is a new addition to the World Championship, Bridgestone’s dataset for this circuit is limited, while a wide range of weather conditions could also be encountered. As a result, a special front slick tyre allocation will be offered for this weekend’s Argentina Grand Prix to ensure riders have enough options to deal with the potentially variable track conditions. The riders will be able to choose from three front slick options – the soft, medium and hard compound front slicks – instead of the usual two front options offered per race weekend.\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“I am happy to see MotoGP return to South America after almost a decade as it such a passionate region for motorcycle racing. This is an important market for Bridgestone and it pleases me that we will be able to showcase our advanced technology to a whole new audience. The large number of fans present at last year’s test at Termas de Río Hondo was a good indication of the reception we can expect this weekend, and I hope to see a huge crowd welcome the sport back to Argentina. From a racing perspective, none of the factory teams tested at this circuit last year so it will be interesting to see which riders are able to adapt themselves to the demands of this very fast circuit. This weekend will be a busy one for our engineers as they will be tasked with helping the teams get the best out of the tyres at this new circuit.”\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Division\n“The Autodromo Termas de Rio Hondo is a new addition to the MotoGP in 2014, and our test at the circuit last year shows it is one of the harshest circuits on the calendar for tyres. This circuit has a high average speed with some sections featuring high-camber angles, while corners like turn six are large radius, high-speed corners that generate very high tyre loads. The circuit is interesting in that although there are nine right-handed corners compared to five left-handed corners, the left shoulder of the tyre experiences higher temperatures than the right shoulder, due to the left-handers generally being faster, more demanding corners. As we have limited data for this track, we have decided to have a special allocation for the front tyres this weekend to ensure maximum safety for the riders. Both our front and rear tyre allocation for this race has to provide high levels of durability, stability and resistance to overheating, so we will provide tyres formulated from our harder rubber compounds for the Argentina Grand Prix.”\n \n \nAdvertisements",

The further the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be realised, which is generally more beneficial. Greater lift has some limitations. Firstly, the lift is limited by the increased proximity of the valve head to the piston crown and secondly greater effort is required to move the valve’s springs to higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head construction, so higher lobes may not necessarily clear the framework of the cylinder head casing. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.\nHigher lift allows accurate timing of airflow; although even by allowing a larger volume of air to pass in the relatively larger opening, the brevity of the typical duration with a higher lift cam results in less airflow than with a cam with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this higher lift could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the intake side. Notably though, higher lift has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in more inefficient running or loss or torque.\nCams that have too high a resultant valve lift, and at high rpm, can result in what is called “valve bounce”, where the valve spring tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This could also be as a result of a very steep rise of the lobe and short duration, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than have the valve follow the cams’ profile. This is typically what happens on a motor over rev. This is an occasion where the engine rpm exceeds the engine maximum design speed. The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily. Sometimes an over rev can cause engine failure where the valve stems become bent as a result of colliding with the piston crowns.\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nBMW\nHP4\nS1000RR \n\n2012 BMW HP4 – Tuned S1000RR \n\n\nPosted on August 7, 2012August 7, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n \n\nBMW Motorrad presents the lightest 4-cylinder supersports bike in the 1000cc class to date, the BMW HP4. Based on the BMW S 1000 RR – or RR for short – the new sports motorcycle has an output of 142 kW (193 hp) and weighs just 199 kilos including Race ABS and with a 90% full fuel tank (169 kg dry weight with Race ABS).\nThe new BMW HP4 sees its world premiere in 2012 and is a continuation of BMW Motorrad’s HP model series founded in 2005. After the boxer models HP2 Enduro, HP2 Megamoto and HP2 Sport, the BMW HP4 is the first 4-cylinder motorcycle in the HP family.  \nThe HP label stands for high performance, and the HP4 once again embodies outstanding agility, power and riding dynamics. But it also reflects the use of extremely high-quality materials and intelligent technology, carefully conceived down to the last detail. In short, the HP4 stands for perfectly controllable power and sporty perfection.\nBMW High Performance motorcycles are truly outstanding: exclusive and authentic, they will always remain relatively rare. This applies equally to the new BMW HP4. Each motorcycle is issued with its own HP4 serial number which is engraved indelibly in the upper fork bridge.\nA genuine highlight: due to its extensive range of fittings and excellent set-up, the new HP4 is immediately ready for use on the race track ex works, requiring no elaborate modifications. But at the same time it offers great potential for dynamic riding on country roads. Still, the HP4 is entirely uncompromising, combining athletic flair and riding dynamics at the very highest level – to an even greater extent than the S 1000 RR.\n \nThe new HP4 – exclusive performance based on the S 1000 RR.\nSince its international press presentation in autumn 2009, the S 1000 RR has sped from one triumph to the next – and not just in motorcycle magazine comparative tests. This is clear evidence of the qualities and the consistency of the supersports concept. Fitted with Race ABS and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), the RR set a new benchmark in this hotly competed and technologically highly sophisticated segment. But even the S 1000 RR left some room for improvement.\n \nTechnical innovations for enhanced sports performance.\nThe HP4 provides the homologation basis for the use of BMW motorcycles in motorcycle racing, especially in the superbike and superstock category. The new model features numerous technological innovations which highlight its orientation towards racing and the race track. The standard passenger seat cover ensures the monoposto look so characteristic of the race track. But for riders who would like to travel with a passenger, BMW Motorrad also offers a passenger package as an ex works option. In addition to the passenger seat this includes the passenger footrest system.\n \nDynamic Damping Control DDC – a world first in serial motorcycles construction.\nThe new HP4 reflects its status as a high-performance motorcycle in terms of its suspension system with a world first for serial production motorcycles: it is fitted as standard with Dynamic Damping Control DDC. This system allows dynamic damping adaptation of the upside-down fork and spring strut to the specific situation on the road. The damping is adapted to the current manoeuvre or road surface by means of sensor-supplied parameters via electrically controlled regulation valves. In this way, the HP4 offers optimum damping in every situation, handling long and short shocks virtually perfectly so as to provide maximum traction and safety.\n \nHigher performance brake system and Race ABS with IDM setting for maximum brake performance.\nWith the introduction of Race ABS in the S 1000 RR, BMW Motorrad underscored its pioneering role in the area of ABS. For the first time ever, an antilock brake system was consistently tailored to sporty needs.\nWith the new race-oriented HP4, BMW Motorrad now takes the next step in this area. In keeping with the HP4 use profile of race track and dynamic country road riding, the new bike not only has Brembo monoblock brake calipers and 9x floating brake discs at the front but also a further developed and refined Race ABS.\nAs before, this ABS has four different modes for wet surfaces (“Rain”), roads (“Sport”), race track with supersports tyres (“Race”) and race track with slicks (“Slick”). Racing experience gained from the IDM (International German Motorcycle Championship) has been fed directly into the Race ABS fitted in the HP4. In “Slick” mode, the so-called IDM setting with refined regulation impulses now gives the skilled rider the option of maximum possible deceleration.\n \nNew 200/55 ZR 17 tyres on the rear wheel and finely adjustable Dynamic Traction Control in “Slick” mode.\nThe HP4 uses a rear tyre in the new format 200/55 ZR 17. The Dynamic Traction Control DTC already used in the RR has been optimized for supersports use in the HP4: now the effect of traction control can be adapted in “Slick” mode to changing conditions and the rider’s individual preference while on the move.\n \nLaunch Control for perfect starts and shift assistant for optimum gearshifts.\nThe HP4 is the first BMW motorcycle to have a so-called Launch Control function which provides active support for the rider in “Slick” mode to achieve maximum acceleration from standing – for example on race starts. Launch Control limits engine torque so as to provide the maximum torque transferable from the rear wheel whenever the front wheel is under no throttle. This means the rider has to focus less on the throttle because he is controlling acceleration solely using the clutch. In addition, when Launch Control is activated engine torque is reduced as soon as the system detects front wheel lift. This prevents unwanted wheelies when accelerating.\nThe HP4 allows the rider to make instant gearshifts with virtually no interruption of tractive force by means of the shift assistant, fitted as standard. This helps gain valuable fractions of a second on the race track, too.\n \nWeight reduction due to forged wheels, lighter sprocket carrier, titanium exhaust system and lighter battery.\nNew finely wrought 7-spoke wheels in forged light alloy and a new, lighter sprocket carrier give the HP4 a weight reduction of 2.4 kg as compared to the RR.\nThe exhaust system is made entirely of titanium and saves as much as 4.5 kilograms as compared to the RR, thereby contributing to the HP4’s enhanced handling qualities. The new exhaust system has an interference pipe between cylinders two and three, a controlled acoustic valve and a closed-loop catalytic converter. It has been possible to optimise the torque curve thanks to the new exhaust system, with the engine application adapted accordingly.\n \nSharpened engine set-up and more torque in the mid-range.\nThe new HP4 is fitted with the water-cooled 4-cylinder in-line engine of the S 1000 RR with a peak output of 142 kW (193 hp) at 13,000 rpm and a maximum engine speed of 14,200 rpm. As in the RR, its maximum torque of 112 Nm goes on stream at 9,750 rpm. The torque has been perceptibly increased in the 6,000 rpm to 9,750 rpm range. In “Rain” mode there is now a smoother output and torque curve available between 2,500 rpm and 8,000 rpm.\nUnlike the RR, the 4-cylinder in-line engine in the HP4 provides the full output of 142 kW (193 bhp) at 13,000 rpm in all modes – “Rain”, “Sport”, “Race” and “Slick” – with an identical throttle curve and thus the same response, making it perfect for use on the race track.\n \nSupersports fittings for sporty riders.\nThe HP4 has numerous special features to meet the needs of sports and racing riders. For example, the instrument cluster not only has a newly designed dial face with HP4 inscription but also provides an extended range\nof information and functions. The information display now shows the\nDDC set-up menus as well as the figures for DTC fine adjustment and\nLaunch Control activation.\nIn visual terms, too, the new HP4 is consistently in line with supersports aspirations for the race track and for dynamic country road riding. In addition to the monoposto look there is a dual-section engine spoiler – elongated as compared to the RR – and a tinted windshield, both of which highlight the increased dynamic performance of the HP4. The small, light LED turn indicators are discreetly integrated and the laser-engraved HP4 logo with serial number on the upper fork bridge underscores the bike’s exclusive character. An elaborate multiple colour paint finish in Racing blue metallic/Light white creates an appropriate racing-oriented appearance.\n \nHP4 with Competition Package – top-level exclusive flair due to use of the very finest materials.\nFor anyone who wants even more than the functional sophistication and extreme riding dynamics of the HP4, the HP4 with Competition Package is an especially exclusive version of the motorcycle. Refined HP carbon parts including a long, closed HP engine spoiler in carbon, an adjustable HP rider footrest system, folding HP brake and clutch levers, wheels finished in\nRacing blue metallic and a sponsor sticker kit provide additional enhancement of the new HP4.\n \nA summary of the HP4 technical highlights:\n\nFork bridge with engraved number and HP4 logo.\nLightest 1000 supersports bike with four cylinders: 199 kg\n(90% DIN unladen weight).\nInnovative suspension with Dynamic Damping Control DDC.\nRace ABS with IDM setting.\nDynamic Traction Control DTC with fine adjustment in “Slick” mode.\nLaunch Control.\nAdapted wheelie detection.\nNew rear wheel tyres, 200/55 ZR 17.\nShift assistant as standard.\nLight titanium exhaust system with controlled acoustic valve and interference pipe.\nForged light alloy wheels, anodised in black.\nRadial monoblock brake calipers by Brembo with special brake pads.\n9x floating brake discs at front.\nExtended, dual-section engine spoiler.\nSeat in monoposto look with passenger seat cover.\nLED turn indicators.\nTinted windshield.\nLighter 7 Ah battery.\nPerformance-oriented engine set-up.\nIncreased torque in the medium engine speed range.\n\n \nHP4 with Competition Package:\n\nLong, closed engine spoiler made of carbon.\nSponsor sticker kit included.\nWheels in Racing blue metallic.\nHP Carbon badge carrier.\nHP Carbon tank cover.\nHP brake lever, hinged.\nHP clutch lever, hinged.\nHP rider footrest system, adjustable.\n\nAdvertisements",

Anyhow, Vyrus certainly gets me interested with that radical and very futuristic looking design that is not just concept but are already available for sale. I like how the front steering detached from the usual fork, but now are attached to the swing arm with central suspension system. This is definitely a hot bike with extreme degree of coolness factor. The one pictured above is the 987 C3 4V, there are two model that is the 984 C3 2V and 986 M2.\n\nAll the bike specs and picture are as below:  \n\n\n\nThanks to Marco from Vyrus who send this in!\nAdvertisements",

        "electric\nMission R \n\nChassis Design by James Parker for Mission R Electric Superbike \n\n\nPosted on December 8, 2011December 8, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nI found the article from Mission Motors about their bike, the Mission R, is very interesting. The chassis design explanation by James Parker, the expert in chassis design, valid for any bike not just for electric bikes as being written in the article below. Check it out after the jump  \nOne of the things that is extraordinary about the Mission R is that we were able to package an incredible 141 HP MissionEVT powertrain, and a 14 kWhr MissionEVT battery pack into a package smaller than a 600-cc sportbike. How can all that be packaged into the superbike chassis?\nFor those of you who follow electric motorcycles, you know that this was no simple feat. To succeed at this challenging task, Mission enlisted the chassis design expertise of James Parker, one of the world’s most talented and creative motorcycle chassis designers.\nFor today’s blog post, we wanted to let James talk about what made designing the Mission R chassis such a unique challenge, and how he succeeded in setting what we believe is the new standard in electric motorcycle design:\nJames Parker on the Mission R chassis design:\n\nAny motorcycle chassis design combines three basic design elements into a cohesive whole.  The three elements are:  components, geometries, and packages.\n“Components” are the basic parts of the bike: Motor, frame, suspension, wheels, brakes, bars, footpegs, and more.\n“Geometries” are the spatial relationships, measurements and paths of motion of the parts: Rake, trail, wheelbase, wheel travel, center of gravity, and a lot more.\n“Packages” are the spaces components and geometries have to fit within: The lean-angle package that lets the motorcycle corner at speed, the ergonomic package that gives the rider a place to operate effectively, the aerodynamic package that keeps the rider and motorcycle parts out of the airstream, and the assembly and servicing package that gives mechanics access to every necessary part and fastener.\nIn designing an electric motorcycle, geometries and packages need to be very much analogous to those in a ‘conventional’ motorcycle, but the components are very different.  Since the electric components need to work with, and fit within relatively conventional geometries and packages, there is a lot of re-thinking to do.\n\nThe Mission R chassis uses unique components to achieve the geometry and packaging demands of a high-performance motorcycle.  The battery is a large box surrounded on four sides by three different structure types.  At the front, a machined aluminum box serves as the steering head/fork mount and spans the full width of the battery. At the rear, the fully stressed “power unit” contains the motor, primary drive, and countershaft as well as the pivot for the swing arm.\nOn each side of the battery, connecting the steering head box and the power unit, are chrome-moly steel trellis sections. The battery is thus surrounded by protective structure to insure maximum safety.  An aluminum plate that is integral to the battery serves as a further chassis element, providing longitudinal and lateral bracing to the 4-sided structure.  In the stripped bike photos we’ve left a battery plate in place to show the structural connections clearly.  In actual use the entire battery, including the battery plate, is installed or removed as a unit, lifting from above.\n\nThe power unit has several structural functions:  As well as a mounting for the swingarm pivot and the trellis sections, the power unit provides mounting points for the rear suspension linkage rocker on its bottom surface, and on the upper radius, provisions for the structural carbon-fiber seat base and the attached upper shock mount.\n\nThe single-sided swingarm, machined from billet aluminum, has a unique linear telescoping, rather than eccentric (as on other single-sided designs) chain adjustment, which allows adjustment without altering ride height.\nThe Mission R’s electrical and structural components work with superbike geometries and packaging requirements to reveal a unique approach to designing a high-performance electric motorcycle.  We’ve achieved a compact, mass-centralized design that uses new approaches to the problems of chassis design in harmony with new energy sources and new drive systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://ridemission.com/blog/page/3/\nAdvertisements",

It is a great oil to be tested since eni is a parent company of Agip oil which is the WSBK, Moto2 and Moto3 exclusive fuel and lubricant sponsor. Definitely we are satisfied with this RM65 oil.  \nThis 135LC is being used daily by our rider for about 100km riding in a day which is a good mileage to test the oil. At the time of testing, our rider had only ride the bike for 4 days before putting his bike to rest since he has holidays for 2 weeks. What is amazing is that, his bike can easily be started after that 2 weeks rest with just one push of the start button. This was a problem for him before since he need to pull the choke and tries few times before his bike can be started.\n\nThe acceleration also feels lighter and easier to reach the top speed. Anyway, the top speed is still maintained at 120km/h, but only easier to reach there. Acceleration is already a great thing about this 135LC and by having eni installed in this bike, it just makes it better.\nWe can conclude that, this eni iRide Moto 4T tec 10W-50 fully synthetic oil is a great oil to be used and we absolutely recommend to all the riders out there looking for the best oil for their bike.\nNext, I’ll be testing the other variant, Agip synthetic, on my own bike soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neni iRide Moto 4T tec 10W-50 fully synthetic oil can be obtained online via: www.qbee.com.my\nAdvertisements",

Coming soon to Malaysia sometime next year with the price said to be lower than RM30,000.One thing that is interesting is that you can adjust the footrest in three step to suit your height. Not just that, you can also adjust the handlebar to make it fit to your reach.\nPreviously we have seen the Vulcan VN500 which has become a popular long time ago as a cruiser of choice. There is also Yamaha Virago XV535 at that time that rides along the road in Malaysia. I remember that it shows someone who rides a cruiser like this is a rich man since only rich man can buy big bikes. Now, at only RM30,000, almost everyone can enjoy what the rich man have too.

JASO MB is required for the scooters as scooters use dry clutch system compared to normal 4-stroke bike that use wet clutch system. Wet clutch system is a system where the transmission, clutch and gears share the same lubricant oil with the piston, cams and crankshaft.Dry clutch is the one that is not shared. That’s why you have transmission oil for scooters.JASO MB oil have friction modifiers compared to JASO MA which does not have the friction modifiers.Even though that is the case, you still can use any motor oil with API SG and above grade, but make sure there is not ‘Energy Conserving’ label on the pack.I have checked my Honda iCon manual book for the transmission oil and it is only required for 0.10L.For more info, try to search Wikipedia entry with the word ‘JASO MB’.\n\nAdvertisements",

Nouvo LC is launched on 18th August 2008. As the name suggest, this mean that new Nouvo LC is being equipped with Liquid Cooling. Liquid cooling is a good addition to the bike since it can give cooler engine in time of traffic jam or in long distance journey. When Nouvo commuter stuck in dense traffic jam, the airflow to the engine is restricted due to slow ride of the bike. Slow ride means slow airflow. Liquid cooling can solve this problem because it contain fan(s) (like the CPU fan in computer) to cool down the liquid from the radiator and then cools the engine. The engine also has been upgraded to 135cc with is the same displacement with Yamaha LC135.\nThe face (headlamp) has been redesigned with sharper edges, much better than bulky ones used in Ego S. The rims are also new style with new color(white) where the old one use black. This rim is also nice to look at. (Be careful guys as this rim might be the new target for theft). The seat is also being replaced with two-tone color. For black bike, you will get a nice black-red tone but for the other colors, just look at the picture.\nPrice for Nouvo LC is around RM6,028.\nFor more information, surf up to: www.yamaha-motor.com.my that is the official Yamaha website for Malaysia.

That is the price including insurance. I’m WOWed! It is not easy to find superbike with this kind of allure and history at this price point. I personally would like to thank to Naza World for being able to bring this Italian model to Malaysia.  \nThe Monster 795 produces 87hp (64kW) @ 8250rpm and 57,9 lb-ft (8,0kgm) of torque @ 6250rpm.\n\nDesmodue\nThe engine of the Monster 795 is the legendary Desmodue, air cooled, Dual Spark L-Twin engine whose 87 hp gives it that unmistakable Ducati sound. Developed for an incredibly flexible power delivery, the Desmodromic engine provides enough torque to exit the most challenging of corners. The impressive torque, typical of the Ducati L-Twin engines, will excite with every twist of the throttle.\n\n\n\nExhaust system\nThe 2-1-2 catalytic exhaust system uses an efficient pre-silencer configuration with twin lambda probes providing finer fuel mapping and Euro 3 conformity. The system’s lightweight and compact design is achieved by using 1mm thick tubing and terminates in Ducati’s trademark twin under-seat, black exhaust mufflers, stylishly contrasted with great looking aluminium end caps.\n\n\nAPTC Clutch\nThe APTC ‘wet’ clutch gives a ‘slipper’ type action that prevents destabilizing of the rear-end under aggressive down-shifting and also gives the extra benefit of a super-light feel at the lever, a great benefit in stop-start city traffic or during longer journeys. The 21-plate oil-bath clutch (11 friction and 10 steel) represents a power-enhancing weight reduction over the ‘dry’ system as well as having a quieter operation and requiring less maintenance.\n\nLightweight crankcase\nThe new crankcases hug the gearbox internals much closer to create a smaller and more compact outer profile and achieve considerable weight savings over previous cases.\n\nvia: Utusan Malaysia and Ducati Monster – http://www.monster.ducati.com\nAdvertisements",

Use low-smoke 2T oil, like this one from Petronas; Petronas Sprinta 5000 2T 2-Stroke Full Synthetic.\n2. Never mix different brand of 2T oil. For example, if you use Petronas Sprinta 5000, stick for it for the rest of the life of the bike. It is also okay if you stick with cheap 2T oil, as long as you don’t mix them up, you will get less smoke.\n3. Adjust the 2T pump on your bike throttle cable. This will reduce the amount of the 2T that gets into the combustion, so you will get less smoke. Here you need to remember that when you reduce the amount of 2T oil that gets into your engine, you also minimise the lubricality of the engine. So, if you want to use your bike for heavy use (eg: racing), adjust the setting so that more 2T oil can be pumped to your engine.\n4. Check, service and adjust your carburetor for maximum fuel and air mixture for combustion, as this one will make your combustion chamber cleaner and therefore produce less smoke.\n5. Use your bike at optimum RPM. Your exhaust will form a resonance inside the exhaust chamber to produce back pressure and back pressure can give more fuel, air and 2T oil to be combusted back into the engine.\nAny more idea?

The locally made model is expected to be yet another Malaysian favourite.\nPresent at the official launch were En. Abdul Hamid Ismail, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs & Special Assignment NAZA World and En. Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, Vice President of Naza Two Wheels NAZA World, joined by 30 NAZA Bikes dealers nationwide.  \nThe NAZA Blade Naked SE is essentially a snazzy, aesthetically upgraded version of the original Blade Naked model and is the product of a technological collaboration with South Korean motorcycle manufacturer, Hysoung. The Blade 250i Naked SE is the most affordable motorcycle in its category and offers a trendier look that compliments its punchy performance.\n“For the past 2 years, we have seen the change in preference from the sports bike to naked bike. Many naked bike models were introduced in that time, especially in the engine category of 200 cc to 250cc. Although our bread and butter is the sports bike version of 250cc and 650cc, our latest offering of this naked bike will essentially make us a formidable player in this category,” said Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, the Vice President of 2W division.\n\nThe NAZA Blade 250i Naked SE is competitively priced at RM13,988 and is certainly the best value-for-money bike with specifications that include Double Overhead Cam (DOHC) and Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) equipped, 75 degree V-twin engine. NAZA Bikes expect the model to contribute 600 units to the targeted sales of 4,000 units of NAZA Blade 250cc – 650cc range.\n\n“With the ASEAN motorcycle market for the 250cc to 650cc range experiencing dramatic growth in recent years, we recognize NAZA Bikes potential to become one of the key players in the region and aim to eventually make the brand a household name. The NAZA Blade has received such a positive response in Malaysia that we are confident it will also capture the attention of motorcyclists in other countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia, 3 markets that we are expanding to with these products,” said Nik Danial Nik Mahmood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 Naza Blade 250i Naked SE price is RM13,988 (basic)\nAdvertisements",

To meet the rigorous demands of time trial athletes, NeilPryde Bikes is introducing the new Bayamo and Bayamo+, the third line of frames created through the ongoing partnership with BMW Group DesignworksUSA’s team in Asia. Bayamo joins the Alize and Diablo high performance road bikes that were launched to high acclaim in 2010, and signified NeilPryde’s first entries to the biking segment. The Bayamo shares its name with a fierce Caribbean coastal wind, referencing both NeilPryde’s roots in sailing and windsurfing and also the fighting spirit of the athletes that will pilot this bike to victory.\n“DesignworksUSA drew upon NeilPryde’s legendary sense of adventure and competition in marine sports to help create their first bikes, the Alize and Diablo”, says Laurenz Schaffer, President BMW Group DesignworksUSA.“Now Bayamo adds a time trial athlete to the growing product family, bringing NeilPryde Bikes’ design DNA together with cutting edge approaches to achieve light weight, high strength and wind-cheating aerodynamics”, Schaffer concludes.\nHigh-modulus, unidirectional C6.7 carbon fiber comprises the Bayamo’s frame, providing an incredibly strong yet extremely lightweight foundation for the bike. This dichotomy is echoed by the frame’s profile, which appears substantial and flat from the side yet thin and light when viewed from the front or rear. Aerodynamic efficiency is critical for the time-trial cyclist, and NeilPryde’s computational fluid dynamic analysis and wind tunnel testing shaped the character lines along the Bayamo’s frame together with its distinct “Kamm” tail at the rear. All drivetrain and shifting cables are routed internally within the frame, further advancing both the aesthetics and aerodynamics of the Bayamo. While the unique and elegant dropout mechanism, exclusive to Bayamo, enables precise positioning of the rear wheel. Bayamo also benefits from a graphics package created by DesignworksUSA.  \n\nFor improved aerodynamics and added comfort, Bayamo+ introduces NeilPryde Bikes’ exclusive and proprietary QFit stem design that is adjustable for height and ride angle. By creating the ideal rider position, together with an exceptionally stiff bottom bracket where the cranks and pedals meet the frame, Bayamo+ ensures that the rider’s energy is transmitted with maximum efficiency and power.\nThe Bayamo will be available now, with the Bayamo+ in premium retailers in 2013. The Bayamo frameset inclusive of frame, forks, seat post, and headset, are priced at 2,750 US Dollar while the Bayamo+ frameset, incorporating the QFit stem and fully integrated brakes, are priced at 5,000 US Dollar. A complete Bayamo or Bayamo+ time trial/triathlon bike with a range of Shimano groupset, Mavic wheels, and premium components, are priced between 3,095 and 10,000 US Dollar.\nThe Bayamo and Bayamo+ will be available exclusively in NeilPryde Authorized Dealers around the globe. Locations can be found in http://www.neilprydebikes.com/dealers-and-demo-centres.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAbout BMW Group DesignworksUSA\nBMW Group DesignworksUSA is a creative consultancy that’s been driving innovation for forty years.  Acquired by BMW Group in 1995, DesignworksUSA enables its parent company as well as internationally-renowned clients outside the automotive industry to grow their businesses through a portfolio of creative consulting services.  With clients including Coca Cola, Dassault Aviation, Embraer, John Deere, HEAD, HP, Microsoft, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Siemens, Intermarine, and Varian Medical Systems, DesignworksUSA is deeply immersed in a broad cross-section of industries.

Two-wheels rider are 15 times much more likely to involved in accident and I think this guide is a good thing by MIROS. It is written in Malay language, but lets just translate it to English for the sake of all readers. So, here goes:\nTyre Maintenance Guide:\n1. Always check the tyre pressure once a week or much more frequent if the tyre is used for long distance riding daily.\n2. Use pressure gauge to check the tyre pressure on cold condition.\n3. Do not use worn tyres.\n4. Do not ride with excessive weight limit as stated by the tyre sidewall. (Refer to Table A).\n5. Follow the speed limit on the road and apply safe riding skill.\nHow to Read Tyre Information on the Sidewall, Table A and Table B (click to enlarge)\nTyre Buying Guide:\n1. Make sure the tyre purchased have the MS or E label.\n2. Change the tyre when the tread touched the warning zone ‘Tread Wear Indicator'(TWI).\nTread Wear Indicator\n3. Tyre need to be replaced if:\ni) cracked\nii) uneven wear\niii) bump on the tread or sidewall\n4. Good tyre choice are important for your safety, comfort, handling and economy.

As the third year of the event, thanks to the cooperation of parties related to this event, the public road was closed during the hill climb performance, and that made the racing machine performances possible, which can generally be seen only at circuits.\nFrom Honda, the RC213V for FIM Road Racing World Championship Moto GP class joined this event, and performed an exhibition ride. The rider on the machine was Takumi Takahashi, who is now on the top of the ranking for the All Japan Road Race Championship this season.\nA test riding with the CBR1000RR was scheduled on Friday, June 13, the day before the event, but, due to the bad weather with hail, Takahashi had no choice but to rehearse with an automobile. He first rode the bike on the course just on the day of the event.\nOn Saturday, June 14, the exhibition ride for the event was held twice. A cheer went up from the large audience for the RC213V riding on the public road, which you can not see anywhere else.  \n\n\nComment from Takumi Takahashi\n“I usually ride at circuits but I have never had an opportunity to ride on a hill. I ride on the RC213V as a test driver but I have never imagined that my first ride on a hill would be on the RC213V. I am happy that the audience enjoyed Honda’s powerful V4 sound surround on the hill.”\n\n\nWords and text from Offcial Honda Release.\nAdvertisements",

(Coloring shown for body and stickers is for photographic purposes only. The body color is all white.)\nCheck out the technical specs and original link after the jump  \nLaunch of the NSF250R Commercial Road Racing Machine\nTOKYO, Japan, June 2, 2011 — Honda Racing Corporation will launch the NSF250R, a newly developed machine for the Moto3 class that will be added to the FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix (WGP) in 2012. Sales of the new vehicle are planned to start in December 2011.\nIn developing the NSF250R, Honda took the “Next Racing Standard” as its development concept and reaped the benefits of racing technology cultivated in the RS125R, thereby achieving a high-level combination of outstanding controllability and racing competitiveness.\nThe liquid-cooled, 4-stroke, single cylinder, DOHC, 249 cc engine was specifically designed for Moto3 to be lightweight and compact while delivering high output. To achieve this high output together with excellent responsiveness, the machine incorporates a front-intake/rear-exhaust configuration with high charging efficiency, while adopting a layout with the cylinder tilted back 15° to concentrate mass.\nTo ensure power delivery all the way through to the high rpm range, the NSF250R adopts titanium valves for both the intake and exhaust to reduce friction. Furthermore, the design reduces friction between piston and cylinder and improves durability by offsetting the cylinder centerline and applying nickel silicon carbide (Ni-SiC) for the cylinder surface treatment. The easily replaceable cassette design selected for the close-ratio 6-speed transmission, allows gear selection to be optimized over a large variety of racing circuits.\nThe frame ensures a degree of freedom in cornering and nimbleness that matches and goes beyond the RS125R by revising the rigidity balance and the shape while inheriting the compactness of the RS125R. Even though the basic structure of the front and rear suspension is the same as the RS125R, the NSF250R-exclusive settings produce a machine with excellent riding stability.\nThe cowling makes the NSF250R the equal of the RS125R in aerodynamic performance, while a cooling duct on the under cowl improves the engine’s cooling performance.\nAs a new-generation road racing machine that complies with Moto3 regulations, the NSF250R will help revitalize road racing while meeting the expectations of road racers.\nNSF250R Specifications\n\n\n\nModel name\nNSF250R\n\n\nModel type\nMR03\n\n\nOverall length × Overall width × Overall height(m)\n1.809×0.560×1.037\n\n\nWheelbase(m)\n1.219\n\n\nGround clearance(m)\n0.107\n\n\nSeat height(m)\n0.729\n\n\nCaster angle(degree)\n22°36″\n\n\nCurb weight(kg)\n84\n\n\nFuel tank capacity(l)\n11\n\n\nEngine type\nliquid-cooled 4-stroke DOHC single cylinder\n\n\nDisplacement（cm3）\n249.3\n\n\nBore × Stroke(mm)\n78.0×52.2\n\n\nMaximum power（kW/rpm）\n35.5/13,000\n\n\nMaximum torque(N･m/rpm)\n28.0/10,500\n\n\nOil Capacity (ENG OIL/T.M OIL) (l)\n1.27/0.55\n\n\nTransmission\nType\nConstant mesh\n\n\nGear ratio\n1st\n1.875\n\n\n2nd\n1.524\n\n\n3rd\n1.304\n\n\n4th\n1.167\n\n\n5th\n1.077\n\n\n6th\n1.000\n\n\nReduction gear ratio\nPrimary\n2.952\n\n\nSecondary\n2.333\n\n\nDevices (Intake)\nIACV\n\n\nFuel supply system\nPGM-FI\n\n\nIgnition type\nFull-transistor\n\n\nClutch type\nWet multiplate\n\n\nLubricating type\nSemi-Dry Sump\n\n\nTire size\nFront\n90/580R17\n\n\nRear\n120/600R17\n\n\nRim size\nFront\n2.50-17\n\n\nRear\n3.50-17\n\n\nBrake\nFront\nType\nHydraulic disk\n\n\nDiameter\nφ296\n\n\nRear\nType\nHydraulic disk\n\n\nDiameter\nφ186\n\n\nSuspension\nFront\nInverted　telescopic\n\n\nRear\nPro-link suspension system\n\n\nFrame type\nAluminum twin tube\n\n\n\nManufacturer’s suggested retail price:\n(MSRP)23,600euro = MYR104,002.623\n(MSRP in Spain, 18% VAT included)\nvia: Asphalt and Rubber and Honda World\nAdvertisements",

Ninja got 2-cylinder engine that can provide good engine feel, while CBR got the single cylinder engine which is good for fuel economy and good torque. Also, single displacement engine have much fewer parts and therefore, easier to maintain all along its lifetime. Single cylinder engine sometime also called ‘Big Bang’ engine. One of the largest single cylinder engine that I know is Aprillia Pegaso 650.\nKawasaki Ninja 250R FI is recently launched at GTMax Motor in Shah Alam. The previous model of this bike is carburetted. Since the new edition equipped with FI system,  fuel-efficiency can further be upgraded and also you don’t have to pull choke everytime you want to start the bike in the morning since the FI system takes control all of that.\nMaybe this news is not much related to underbone bikes, but, please don’t be prejudice and hate all the superbikes. It is there for all of us to enjoy the ride. I’ll continue to write more about underbone bikes as that is my greatest passion.\nPrice is at MYR20,900 as I asked the salesman at GTMax.\n1 more picture after the jump\nAdvertisements",

The two riders will spend two days attending a number of activities. Today they helped to launch the new logo for one of the factory team’s key sponsors, Semakin di Depan (Yamaha Motor Indonesia) at a morning press conference in Jakarta. Lorenzo and Rossi were joined by Yamaha Motor Racing’s Managing Director Lin Jarvis to reveal the logo to the assembled international media. They then went on to spend the afternoon shooting a television commercial for Yamaha Motor Indonesia.  \n“I like the new Semakin di Depan logo,” said Jorge Lorenzo. “I think it’s quite special and even better than the one before. I love coming here to Indonesia, the weather is spectacular and it’s very warm. The people are also very sweet and warm; it relaxes me to be in the country. I’m feeling very positive about the 2013 season, I think the arrival of Valentino is good and we have a very strong team now. I know he is a very talented rider. We will start trying the new bike in Sepang at the next test; I think we have a great chance to be World Champion again. It is going to be very difficult as always, it’s the toughest category.\n\n“I am so proud to wear the new logo and am very happy to be back in the family!” Said Valentino Rossi. “I cannot wait for another opportunity to ride the M1. I think the Yamaha Factory Team will be very strong this year with myself and Jorge. For me at this moment I have to be a little quiet and try to understand what my level is with the bike after the first test. My last Grand Prix victory was in 2010 so my first goal is to come back onto the podium as soon as possible, and to try to win a race.”\n“It’s really nice to be here in Indonesia and seeing so many friends of Yamaha and supporters of the team,” commented Lin Jarvis. “This year of course we have assembled our new team for the challenge of the 2013 MotoGP season with Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi back together again in Yamaha’s ‘super’ team. This is a wonderful occasion for us to be here for with our riders together for the first time this season and also to have the fantastic new Semakin di Depan logo, I love the new styling.”\nAdvertisements",

It is equipped with eSP engine that refers to ‘enchanced Smart Power’. A bigger capacity engine for an automatic bike like this is a welcomed addition as we as the riders likes to have more choices for our bikes. We also like to have more power since they enables us to ride longer distance without stressing the engine.\n\nThe top speed of the 2015 Honda Vario 150 FI as tested using the performance metric measured at 102 km/h which is already good for an automatic bike like this.\n\n2015 Honda Vario 150 can accelerate from 0 to 200 meter in a brisk at 11.94 seconds. Base on this number, you can easily become the new traffic light champion.\n\nWith great power and acceleration, Honda has not emitted the fuel-efficiency that they are known for. It is measured at 52.9km for every liter of fuel that you pour into it.\n\nThe LED tail light are now brighter and can makes it easy for you to be noticed by riders who are behind you which means better safety.\n\nThe word ‘Techno’ on the side really suits this bike as it really looking futuristic much like a robot. There are a lot of sharp lines and edges all around the Vario 150. Also can be noticed is the word PGM-FI that shows that this Vario 150 is equipped with fuel injection system.\n\nThe exhaust cover are nicely designed to fit the overall look of the bike and of course can prevent accidental damage to your skin if you touched it.\n\nThe engine is equipped with friction reducing technology like the roller rocker arm to minimise friction and makes it produces more power.\n\nThe key lock now features shutter to make sure the security is handled one more notch. Seat opening can easily being done with this button.\n\nBrake lever lock on the on the left of the handle is one addition that has come since the day of the Honda iCon. Really important when the bike is parked to a sloped condition.\n\nSide stand switch fitted as a safety measure where you need to pull in the side stand first before you can start the bike. I remember my friend thought the bike is broken since it can’t started, actually he just forgot to pull in the side stand (Honda iCon).\n\nA bigger side glove box so you can put your glove, small items and maybe a water bottle too.\n\nThe front headlight features dual keen eyes that is looking sharp and very ‘Techno’.\n\nUnderseat box are able to fit full face helmet inside it so no more worries to get your helmet stolen or drenched in rain again.\n\nBrake system are now Combi System where it can sense the stopping power you need and also initiate the rear braking even if you only pull the front brake lever.\n\nThe meter cluster of the Honda Vario 150 is superb and again, very ‘Techno’. There is the combination of analog and digital information display but there is no tachmeter. It got the button for idle-stop system that can helps you to saves more fuel and save the environment from excessive CO2.\nGreat job Honda!

        "200cc\n390cc\nKTM\nRC200\nRC390 \n\n2015 KTM RC200 and RC390 street legal supersports machine launched in Malaysia by Eurotech Wheel Distribution Sdn Bhd – RC200 RM16,888 and RC390 RM27,500 (basic) \n\n\nPosted on September 16, 2014September 17, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nEurotech Wheel Distribution Sdn Bhd has unveiled its duo of super sport series named RC200 and RC390 here in Shah Alam, Malaysia. The subject of this bike is to make it more track friendly and appeal to younger rider that are starting to learn to ride track bikes. Personally, I like the double headlight cluster that is enclosed in elongated frame that looks very different that what we always see. This might be the iconic look for KTM super sports bike for years to come as what BMW have done with the squinty headlight of the S1000RR.\n\nOn the first impression, this bike looks like the one bike from the racer in Moto3 series. The one in Moto3 is 250cc whereby the KTM RC200 are 199.5c and the KTM RC390 is 373.2cc. We can say that the RC series is the mix of the supersports style of the Moto3 racer and the base model from the Duke series. RC200 are able to produce maximum output of 25hp while the RC390 at 44hp.   \nNo, this is not the same frame as the Duke. It has been reworked in terms of front angle for shorter wheelbase, sharper steering and less trail.\nYou might already know the nice features of this bike that include steeper steering angle and more forward riding position. The Trellis frame might have looked the same with the Duke 200 or Duke 390, but it has been reworked to make the frame having shorter wheel base, less trail and steeper steering angle. All this modification will make the bike to be more ‘flickable’ or easier to takes corner as it is supposed to do in the track.\nWP Suspension USD fork is used and it is 43mm in diameter\nThis is a road bike ready for the track, so, it should be correct if the suspension is modified too. Yes, KTM did that too. The RC series are using suspension setup which have less travel and the same time more aggressive suspension setup. This will ensure the handling of the bike on the road or track is not compromised. One more interesting about this suspension is that it is using WP Suspension USD fork in the diameter of 43mm, that is as big as the one used on the KTM Superbike 1190 RC8 R!\nSee how big is that 300mm disc on the RC200\nBraking system has been taken care by KTM which the inclusion of the ByBre 300mm disc brake and get this, with 4-piston caliper! The rear get the adequate 230mm disc with single-piston caliper. Looking at the overall weight of the RC series, we can see that it is one of the lightest bike available. The RC200 is at 137.5kg and the RC390 at 147kg. For comparison, the single-cylinder Kawasaki Ninja Z250SL is at 148kg. This means the RC390 is lighter by 1kg than it even with bigger capacity engine! With the lightness of the overall weight, this will make the braking to be more effective and always in control. KTM RC390 will come standard with ABS while the RC200 comes without ABS. This means that all the RC390 will have only one variant which is the ABS model, while the RC200 is only available as non-ABS.\nSportier position of the footrest. Exhaust tip is nice too.\nThe other thing to notice is the footrest position. It is more rear-inclined and this make up for the more sportier riding position. A nice thing to look is the design of the front and rear footrest that is looking very beautiful. The underseat exhaust are also nicely designed and this is the minor details that we’ll usually appreciate time after time.\n\nOne interesting thing that I have found out is that, this RC200 and RC200 feature the Daytime Running Light on the front beak. It is a very nice addition and I have never expected this. A very good job by KTM design team.\n\nThe other interesting thing about the KTM design of the RC200 and RC390 is the implementation of the rear seat to make it looks like a single rider bike, but actually the one that is looking like the rear tail cover is actually a soft plastic with padding to function as a seat.

        "150cc\nvespa \n\nVespa launches youthful limited Apple edition scooter – RM11,388.00 (On the road) \n\n\nPosted on February 6, 2013February 6, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nPETALING JAYA, 5 February 2013 – Traffic jams are all too common in Malaysia but if you’re looking to beat about the long lines of cars, there’s no better way than to get aboard a stylish Vespa and sail through all the road stress. NAZA Premira Sdn Bhd, the sole and official distributor of Vespa scooters in Malaysia today unveiled the vibrant and trendy Vespa LX 150 Apple Edition at the Vespa 3S Centre located in Petaling Jaya.\nPresent at the launch were Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, NAZA Group of Companies Joint Group Executive Chairman and Mr. Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, Vice President of NAZA Two Wheel Division.  \nThe bitten-apple concept comes from the most successful and memorable Vespa advertising campaign that was first made popular in Italy, 1969, and was enjoyed for decades thereafter. The slogan for the advertising campaign – “Chi Vespa mangia le mele”, roughly translated into English meant “If you ride a Vespa, you take a bite out of the apple”. The apple symbolized health, youth, summer fun and a ‘forbidden fruit’ of paradise – one that is attractive, nourishing and wanted by many.  To take a bite of the apple connotes a cheeky and bold act that set’s one apart from the rest and is greatly enriching. With this in mind, the Vespa LX 150 Apple Edition was designed to be a unique version of a well-loved classic that only a great few can have the pleasure of owning, to the envy of many others. It’s bitten-apple graphics are playful, vibrant and an homage to part of Vespa’s history.   \nThe special edition “Vespa LX 150 Apple Edition” shares the trendy styling and elegance common to all Vespa scooters. Significant enhancements in this model are the bitten apple-themed illustrations and new two-tone coloured saddle.\n\nDatuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, NAZA Group of Companies Joint Group Executive Chairman, said “Vespa is one of the most sought-after lifestyle scooters in Malaysia with more than 1000 units sold in 2012.  The company plans to increase sales to 2000 units in 2013. Expansion of the brand in Malaysia is set for 2013 with 5 new showrooms planned for development in Penang, Johor, Kelantan, Terengganu and Sarawak.”\n\n“The Vespa LX 150 Apple Edition combines youthful charm with the timeless quality of classic Vespas and is ideal for everyday urban commutes between home and the workplace or even simply for casual, leisurely rides. The 150cc engine delivers smoother power progression in the relentless stop-start conditions of a congested urban city,” added Datuk Wira SM Faisal.\n\n\nThis Vespa LX 150 Apple Edition is priced at RM11,388.00 (On the road) and there are only 168 units available for purchase in Malaysia. For this Chinese New Year, limited units of Vespa LX150 will be selling at a fantastic promotional basis selling price at RM8,888.00. Festive “Ang Pau” will be provided by NAZA for purchase of the standard Vespa LX 150cc. If ever there were a time to consider purchasing that Vespa customers have been eyeing, this is it! The offer ends 28 February 2013.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "concept bike\nelectric\nHonda \n\nHonda UNI-CUB Personal Mobility Device \n\n\nPosted on May 15, 2012May 15, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\n \nTOKYO, Japan, May 15, 2012 – Honda Motor Co., Ltd. unveiled the new UNI-CUB personal mobility device, designed for harmony with people. Featuring a compact design and comfortable saddle, UNI-CUB offers the same freedom of movement in all directions that a person enjoys while walking.  \n\nRepresenting the evolution of the U3-X personal mobility device that Honda announced in 2009, UNI-CUB features Honda’s proprietary balance control technology and the world’s first omni-directional driving wheel system (Honda Omni Traction Drive System). These technologies allow the rider to control speed, move in any direction, turn and stop, all simply by shifting his or her weight. Since the rider can freely move forward, backward, side-to-side and diagonally, he or she can quickly and easily maneuver among other people.\nMoreover, UNI-CUB’s compact saddle-style packaging makes it easy for the rider’s legs to reach the ground and maintains eye-level height with other pedestrians. This configuration promotes harmony between the rider and others, letting the rider travel freely and comfortably inside facilities and among moving people.\n\nStarting in June 2012, Honda will jointly conduct demonstration testing of UNI-CUB with Japan’s National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. In addition to testing the feasibility of using UNI-CUB indoors, this project will explore the practical applications of the device in a wide range of environments in Japan and other countries.\nThe balance control technology of UNI-CUB is part of the Honda Robotics family of technologies, which originates with Honda’s research into humanoid robots, including the world-famous ASIMO.\nGoing forward, Honda will continue its proactive research and development of next-generation mobility technologies, aiming always to offer more and more people the joy and fun that comes from freedom of movement.\nKey specifications of UNI-CUB\n\n\n\n\nSize (L x W x H)\n520 x 345 x 745 mm\n\n\nSeat height\n745 – 825 mm\n\n\nBattery type\nLithium-ion battery\n\n\nMaximum speed\n6 km/h\n\n\nRange\n6 km\n\n\nApplication environment\nBarrier-free indoor environments\n\n\n\n\nKey features of UNI-CUB\n＜Maneuverability promotes compatibility with people in many environments＞\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\nOmni-directional freedom of movement similar to human walking\nUNI-CUB has a two-wheel configuration with a minimal wheelbase. The front wheel features the Honda Omni Traction Drive System that Honda first announced in 2009. The rear wheel moves laterally to facilitate turning. By leveraging the different rotational speeds of the front and rear wheel treads during lateral movements, UNI-CUB can move forwards and backwards, side-to-side and diagonally and also turn in place, making possible quick, nimble movement.\n\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nMovement in harmony with other people\nHonda’s proprietary balance control technology makes it possible for the rider to freely control the wheels of the UNI-CUB, much as human beings maintain their balance. With a design that takes into consideration the rider’s environment, this system allows the rider to maneuver while moving side by side with or holding hands with another person.\n\n\n\n\n3.\n\n\nCompact size for moving and climbing gradients in barrier-free indoor environments\nThanks to UNI-CUB’s compact saddle-style packaging, the rider and vehicle together are about the same width as a person when walking. Optimized wheel design and high-precision drive/balance control enhance UNI-CUB’s ability to climb gradients in barrier-free indoor environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n< Ease of control promotes freedom of movement >\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nWeight shift control combined with touch panel control\nWhen the rider is using weight shift control, UNI-CUB’s incline sensor detects the direction in which the rider is leaning, allowing UNI-CUB to calculate the direction and speed intended by the rider. And touch panel control via smartphone and other devices is another convenient control option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It has been released in China recently and here is the brochure.  \nOne of the claims that is written in Chinese might just give a meaning of the acceleration data. This bike can propels forward from 0-100km/h in just 8.04s. This number are much better than the Honda at 8.76s (0-60mph) and Ninja 250R at 10.18s (0-60mph). Note: 60mph = 96km/h. It means that GW250 is better in terms of acceleration. It can achieve top speed easily with much lower time needed.\nTop speed for this GW250 are said to be at 140km/h, compared to data from MCN Ninja 250R (97.4 mph = 156,75 km/h) and CBR250R at (94.2 mph =151,6 km/h).

        "indonesia bike\ninfo\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\n2011 Yamaha Jupiter MX Manual Clutch and Auto Clutch Differences \n\n\nPosted on January 30, 2011March 21, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n \n\nBoth of the images above might seem identical, but to a very observant eyes, differences can be seen.\nI was thinking whether this 2011 Yamaha Jupiter MX (135LC) will have an auto-clutch model. It seems that Yamaha Indonesia already have the 2011 Yamaha Jupiter MX auto-clutch version, but on further reading and observing both of the models, it seems that the all new 2011 5-speed Yamaha Jupiter MX is in manual clutch only.\nThe one that you on the very top picture is the auto-clutch version. As you can see, I have circled 3 parts there. One that is pretty obvious is the usage of rear drum brakes whereby the all new Jupiter MX have rear disc brake.\nOn further observation you can see that the engine casing are not the same. The auto-clutch version have the same engine casing like the old Jupiter MX circa 2006-2010. Compare the images in details and you’ll find the differences.\nThe last thing that I can see is that the foot protector near the footrest have different direction of the ‘P’ shape which is projected backwards (makes it looks like inverted ‘P’) while the ‘P’ shape of the all new Jupiter MX is projected forward. I have circled it in red so that you all can find it.\nWhy bother with all this?\nYou see, some of us like to get the all new Jupiter MX with auto-clutch with all new engine and power. If you just go to the shop and buy it, you might just regret what you have bought since the 2011 auto-clutch Jupiter MX is the same old bike with 4-speed gear, same engine and same carburetor like before.\nSo, my conclusion is that the all new 2011 Jupiter MX is available in Manual Clutch only. \nCorrect me if I’m wrong.\n3 more pictures after the jump\n\nUPDATE (21/03/2011): This bike has been launched in MALAYSIA!\nAdvertisements",

Stars are coming in other than the awaited Rok Bagoros which already there since the first day on Wednesday. I have met Zulfahmi today along with Rok Bagoros at KTM booth.\n\nWe also got to see bro Mokhlis with his Honda EX5 Dream drag race machine which has been a winner many times. Tomorrow the bike will be taken to stage for a little bit of interview.\n\nBro EJ aka Pijah Viva is a former mechanic for Asian Race Championship in the era of Yamaha TZM-150 long time ago. As you can see, this 2011 Yamaha 135LC ES 5-speed looks standard with nothing to impress you at all. That is what bro EJ wants you to think. I like to call this modified as standard super modified since everything inside this bike is extremely modified! You might want to ask what is the cylinder block that this bike use. Is it 57mm Shark or the 62mm UMA Racing? You’re wrong. This cylinder block is custom made and with that information, you should be thinking that this bike is serious. Top speed? 180km/h. Video? No need. If you want to believe it, believe it. If you don’t, you got nothing to lose.\n\nYou guys should also check out the X-Bon helmet and test it yourself. If you are looking for full face helmet right now, this might be the one you are looking for. It is lightweight at 1440g and the price is only RM950. What is great is that you’ll get a full carbon fiber shell helmet with that low price (for a full face helmet).\n\nOne more thing, the EX5 drag race machine is being shipped by loading it into a Proton Wira aeroback. I was surprised when I saw it earlier this morning. It fits.\nCheck out more pictures of whats happening after the jump  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

The lineup comprises of 4 new model (including Click 125i model change from the 110cc) and 3 new graphics scheme model change.\nThe new model includes the Honda CRF250L which is a motocross with the engine based on the CBR250R. This CRF250L are global model, so it means that we in Malaysia might get this too. CBR250R was a global and it is being released in Malaysia, so I’m hoping Boon Siew Honda will bring this in.  \nNext is the Honda PCX150 which is also global model. This AT bike features 150cc engine and has been very popular by the bikers.\nNew for the 2012 is the Honda Spacy i. As the name suggest, it features big space for the underseat box and being fed by PGM-FI system. The space are big enough to fit a helmet and the FI system helps for the fuel economy.\nOne of the new bike that I’m interested is the Honda Click 125i. This is the new model change from the previous Honda Click 110cc. This new Click 125i features a new global engine known as the eSP engine. The underseat space are also big and able to fit a helmet in, but I’m not sure whether it is for open-face helmet or full-face helmet. And again, this is global model, so I’m really hoping this will make its way to Malaysia.\nThe other 3 bikes gets a new graphics scheme update that is the Honda CBR150R, Honda Wave 125i and Honda Wave 110i. All the graphics are looking better now. It seems that Honda engineers are getting better nowadays in terms of design and function. Good job Honda!\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2012/01/11/honda-thai-rencanakan-rilis-7-motor-pcx-150-di-maret-2012/\nAdvertisements",

When I thought: man that’s enough I can’t do it anymore, people just continued to cheer and with so many people wanting more, you really can’t say no!  Si I didn’t and all I can say now is that this was my best show ever and for sure I can’t wait to do it again. Kuala Lumpur is fantastic city, with great people, food, relax atmosphere. The only thing I couldn’t cope with was the damn heat and humidity. It was quite a big change coming from Central Europe, where spring is slowly arriving to full summer temperatures of Kuala Lumpur. It also felt fantastic to jump on my KTM Duke 125 and burned some Sava rubbers after short winter break’,  Rok completed his impressions of his first show in 2012. \nHe is now heading to next stage in his stuntriding career, as he will jump on brand new KTM Duke 690 stunt beast that is now in final stages of preparation at KTM headquarters in Mattighofen.

The 2015 VFR800X pushes the concept forward for a stronger all-round sporty ride and sharper modern styling.\nThe heart of the machine remains its VTEC-equipped 90° V4 DOHC 16 valve engine, which now offers increased low and mid-range torque for flexible, effortless drive, plus increased peak power of 78kW(104.6hp), delivered at 10,250rpm.  The aluminium twin-beam frame features a lighter, revised subframe and new aluminium swingarm ­– another VFR signature piece. Suspension has longer travel: 25mm in its two-piece telescopic forks and 23mm in the rear shock. ABS comes as standard and the front 17-inch hollow-cast aluminium wheel is fitted with dual 310mm discs, worked by radial-mount four-piston calipers. Tyres are sporty street-size 120 front and 180 rear for optimal on-road performance.\nThe rider now also benefits from the same kind of Selectable Torque Control System (S-TCS) fitted to the Crosstourer. Two levels of S-TCS are available (plus off), to sense imminent loss of rear wheel traction, and seamlessly reduce torque to allow the tyre to grip.\nThe VFR800X is a true VFR – a motorcycle designed for hard riding fun, but with style, comfort and practicality. Accordingly, the seat is now adjustable, offering two height options, and 5-stage heated grips and Honda’s self-cancelling indicators are both fitted as standard. New, full LED lighting adds a distinct presence and premium finishing touch.\nAdvertisements",

Born from racing, the X-Twelve combines integral feedback from professional racers around the globe with SHOEI’s 50 years of helmet building experience, the very latest in technology, and the most advanced materials known to man. Track certified by the fastest riders on the planet, the X-Twelve’s innovative features unite to form the most progressive racing helmet on the market.  \nFeatures:\nQ.R.S.A. (Quick Release Self-Adjusting) Base Plate System\nNeed to change from clear to tint? SHOEI’s Quick Release Self-Adjusting (QRSA) base plate system includes a locking mechanism that allows you to do just that in a snap—no tools, no hassle, no problems!\nBuilding on the successful QRBP, the QRSA maintains its predecessor’s easy-to-use features–like our simple shield release and attachment, and shield preset lever–but offers a significant advantage. SHOEI’s patented new spring-loaded technology featured in the QRSA eliminates the need to adjust base plates for proper sealing. Every time the shield is lowered, the spring-loaded base plates pull the shield back to contact the window beading evenly, ensuring a wind and waterproof seal.\nCW-1 Shield\nThe all-new CW-1 shield is both wider and taller than the CX-IV that it replaces. In addition, the CW-1 shield protects SHOEI riders from 99% of the sun’s damaging UVA and UVB rays, and our three-dimensional injection-molding process ensures distortion free vision. Another advantage of the CW-1 shield is its ability to work in conjunction with SHOEI’s optional Pinlock system to deliver fog-free vision in even the most challenging conditions. The new CW-1 Pinlock lens is larger, and offers fog-free viewing to the very top of the helmet’s larger eye port.\nAIM+ Shell Construction (Snell M2010-Approved)\nSHOEI’s proprietary AIM+ technology combines fiberglass with organic fibers that are so strong they can only be cut with a laser. The end result is a stronger, lighter shell that will absorb and distribute the force of an impact safely and efficiently.\n5 Shell Sizes\nWhile some of our competitors rely on foam padding for fitting a wide range of customers, SHOEI offers an industry-leading five shell sizes in the new X-Twelve to ensure a custom fit for heads between the sizes of XS-XXL.\nAero Edge 2 Spoiler\nThe X-Twelve’s Aero Edge 2 Spoiler helps minimize lift at high speeds, and thus wind drag from the rider and motorcycle. In addition, increased negative air pressure improves exhaust performance to help ventilate the helmet.\nVentilation System\nIt’s not uncommon for a racing environment to get blazing hot, which is why ventilation was a top priority when designing the new X-Twelve. The X-Twelve features five (5) intake and ten (10) exhaust vents, making it the most aggressively ventilated helmet SHOEI has ever produced. Wind tunnel testing identified the very best locations and shapes of intake and exhaust ports to maximize airflow, including the suction effect that’s created as low pressure air travels toward the rear of the helmet. With this in mind, the X-Twelve features new Side Extractor Vents developed by our MotoGP racing service to help clear warm, humid air from the racer’s face.\nDual-Layer EPS Liner\n\nDual layer liner yields enhanced impact absorption by adjusting thickness and density in key areas\nInner liner features air channels for efficient cooling\nImpact-absorbing EPS liner throughout the entire chin bar\n\n3D Max Dry Interior System\nThe X-Twelve is equipped with a fully removable, washable, and replaceable 3D Max Dry liner. SHOEI’s proprietary Max Dry material has been proven to absorb and dissipate sweat two-times faster than traditional nylon interiors. In addition, the X-Twelve’s interior components are three-dimensionally shaped to match the contours of a rider’s head.\nE.Q.R.S. (Emergency Quick Release System)\nMechanical tabs disengage cheek pads for easy removal by emergency medical personnel. Helmet can be removed with minimum load to rider in emergency situations.\nChin Curtain\nThe chin curtain can be inserted into the lower edge of the chin bar to reduce wind turbulence and noise.\nBreath Guard\nThe breath guard can be inserted into the upper edge of the chin bar to help reduce fogging by diverted exhausted breath down out the bottom of the helmet.\n5-Year Warranty\n5-Year Warranty From Purchase Date. 7-Year Warranty From Helmet Manufacture Date. Whichever comes first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuy the helmet here: http://www.shoei-helmets.com/Helmet.aspx?X-Twelve&h=19&t=1\nAdvertisements",

This bike is an one-off motorcycle made by British engineers Allen Millyard. The engine is taken from Dodge Viper’s 8,000cc V10 which produces more than 500bhp.  \nFor comparison, the BMW S1000R can go all the way to 186mph (electronically limited), whereby this Millyard Viper V10 can go up to 207mph as tested by MCN. The creator are going to have it go at 250mph. All the weight and long riding position might hinders this Millyard to be handled well.\nThe good thing about V10 engine is that it produces smooth power delivery in every RPM which should help the throttle response. Anyway, by having more cylinder, the engine maintainance also getting high and the complexity of the repair also becoming more difficult.\nvia: Wikipedia\nAdvertisements",

The awards were presented during the Ducati World Dealer Conference, held in conjunction with EICMA, where Ducati also unveiled its latest models for 2013.

These two awards show that our commitment to the brand’s success in Malaysia is stronger than ever and we are thankful that our efforts have been recognized on the international stage.”\nDucati Malaysia’s double win at the highly acclaimed exhibition garnered them greater regard from the international motorcycle community. The company was recently in the international spotlight for playing host to the 2nd Asia Ducati Week, the largest gathering of Ducati owners and Ducati lovers in Asia. The event, inspired by the spectacular World Ducati Week and pioneered by NAZA Group of Companies’ dynamic Joint Group Executive Chairman, Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, was a roaring success; earning Ducati Malaysia the ‘Best Event 2012’ title for organizing an entire 7 days of fun-filled, thrilling and memorable activities. \nParticipants from over 10 countries were welcomed with a dinner and party at the Butter Factory disco where they were joined by MotoGP riders, Valentino Rossi and Nicky Hayden. Asia Ducati Week participants were treated to a historical ride and visit to Malacca and celebrated into the night with a Ducati street party in Kuala Lumpur city.\n Also among the event highlights was a special convoy that led riders to the MotoGP race at the Sepang International Circuit and an unforgettable opportunity to indulge in the Ducati Riding Experience (DRE), conducted by qualified trainers from Ducati Motor Holding, at which Loris Capirossi made an appearance, enabling participants to learn from the best and race beside him.\n Ducati Malaysia’s impressive sales this year which exceeded last year’s sales figure of 250 units in the whole of 2011, earned them the award for ‘Best Sales 2012’ at the EICMA 2012. Criteria on which the win was based included Ducati Malaysia’s successful 300% increase in sales since 2011 and the company’s best sales across the board, with the entire Ducati model range.

Anniversary of a successful partnership: when the 2013 MotoGP World Championship gets underway with the Qatar Grand Prix this weekend, BMW M will be starting its 15th season as “Official Car of MotoGP”. BMW has been involved in MotoGP since 1999 and provides the official Safety Cars.\nThe first of many highlights over the course of the anniversary comes at the opening round, which will be held at the “Losail International Circuit” in Qatar: the first public outing of the BMW M6 Gran Coupe. It is only a few weeks since the latest eagerly-awaited high-performance coupé from BMW M GmbH was enjoying its world premiere at the NAIAS in Detroit. This season, the BMW M6 Gran Coupe will spearhead the fleet of Safety Cars in action in the MotoGP World Championship. The high-performance BMW M6 Gran Coupe is a premium product, which combines outstanding performance with captivating aesthetics and luxurious elegance. The latest top model to emerge from BMW M GmbH is powered by a high-rev V8 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and generating 412 kW/560 hp. It is this power that allows the BMW M6 Gran Coupe to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.2 seconds. The engine performance, chassis technology, aerodynamic properties and balance, which is optimised using components such as the carbon-fibre reinforced plastic roof, are aligned with the kind of precision that people have come to expect of M. As such, the BMW M6 Gran Coupe not only offers a new luxury experience in an M vehicle, but also fully exhausts the dynamic driving potential, which is rooted in the BMW 6 Series. The Safety Car version of the BMW M6 Gran Coupe has been specially modified for its use as a pace car out on the racetrack.  \n\nIn total, the fleet of official MotoGP cars for the 2013 season comprises five BMW M and M Performance models. As well as the BMW M6 Gran Coupe, the BMW M6 Coupe and the BMW M5 will also be in action as Safety Cars. The Safety Officer will take to the track in a BMW M3 Coupe, while two BMW M550d xDrive Tourings will be used as medical cars. BMW Motorrad will also provide two new BMW HP4s as Safety Bikes. You can find more information on the 2013 Safety Car fleet online at www.bmw-m-safetycar.com.\n \n“We are delighted that our cooperation with MotoGP is already entering its 15th season,” said Thomas Schemera, Director of Sales and Marketing at BMW M GmbH. “This shows that Dorna Sports sees us as a reliable partner when it comes to guaranteeing that practice sessions, qualifying and races pass safely in the pinnacle of motorcycle racing – even in the most difficult weather conditions. In return, the Motorcycle World Championship provides us with the perfect platform. This allows us to present our high-performance automobiles to a target group consisting of motorsport enthusiasts who share our passion for technologically innovative and dynamic sports cars – and that all over the world. We are particularly proud to be able to run our high-performance luxury coupe, the BMW M6 Gran Coupe, as a Safety Car in the 2013 season.”\n \nBMW M GmbH’s involvement in MotoGP is not solely restricted to the Safety Car fleet, but also comprises numerous sales and marketing campaigns within the Grand Prix environment. The BMW M Hospitality in the paddock will display MINI, BMW and BMW M automobiles. Visitors will also receive detailed information on the Grand Prix, riders and teams. An exclusive VIP sales programme completes the offering in the BMW M Hospitality. On the BMW M MotoGP Experience, guests spend the race weekend in the VIP village, thus gaining insights into what goes on behind the scenes of the Motorcycle World Championship. Among the highlights of this visitor package are the garage tours with former world champion and BMW M MotoGP Expert Loris Capirossi (ITA), meetings with the current crop of riders, and taxi rides in one of the BMW M Safety Cars.\n \nThe BMW M Award is also celebrating an anniversary this year. Since 2003, this award has been presented at the end of the MotoGP season to the rider with the best overall qualifying record. Among the recent winners, who receive an exclusive BMW M car for their efforts, are Valentino Rossi (ITA), Casey Stoner (AUS), Jorge Lorenzo (ESP) and Nicky Hayden (USA). To mark the tenth anniversary of the award, the best qualifier this season can look forward to a special highlight – however, the exact BMW M model will not be revealed until the start of the European leg of the season in Jerez (ESP) in May.\n \nBMW M GmbH rang in the first grand prix week of the season with an exclusive M6 event hosted by Alfardan Automobiles, the BMW importer in Doha. This pre-launch event enabled Qatari national media representatives and invited customers to be the first to view the eagerly anticipated BMW M6 Gran Coupe Safety Car. This pace car, to be deployed on-track for the first time this weekend, was unveiled by BMW M MotoGP Expert Loris Capirossi. Also present were the BMW M6 Coupe Safety Car and the BMW M6 Convertible.\nAdvertisements",

Dato’ Kamarudin also confirmed that American rider Josh Herrin will be one of the team’s two riders in 2014, and that a technical partnership has been signed with Suter Racing Technology to jointly develop a Caterham-Suter chassis over the next two years. This announcement marks the beginning of Caterham Group’s foray into the two wheeled industry. Caterham’s lineage has been to learn in motorsports and translate its philosophy of fun, performance, and accessibility to great vehicles for global customers. Motorcycle products by Caterham Bikes will add to its already established four wheel roadcar partnership with Renault and Caterham Cars.  \nJosh Herrin joins the team as the reigning AMA Superbike Champion, a title he won two weeks ago at the final round of the US series at Laguna Seca. The second Caterham Moto Racing Team rider will be announced in due course. Josh explained how much the announcement means to him: “I could not be more excited about the opportunity to race with the Caterham Moto Racing Team. It has been a goal of mine since I was young boy to race in the World Championship and it seems almost surreal now that the opportunity is finally here. I have been training very hard and I am ready to fight for great results in the super competitive Moto2™ class. I can’t thank my manager Bob Moore enough for working so hard to get me on the best team for next year, and I want to thank everyone at Caterham Moto Racing Team for helping make my dream come true.”\nEskil Suter, Suter Racing Technology, commented: “We are proud that Caterham Moto Racing Team took the decision to collaborate with us in their new engagement in Moto2™. As the team has the full support of their F1 organisation it will open new possibilities for development besides well-known motorcycle technology.\n“Bringing together the two different worlds of F1 and Moto2™ can bring to us (Suter Racing Technology) opportunities to develop certain components such as aerodynamics in different ways and therefore to improve performance. The collaboration will add value to the sport and us as a manufacturing company.”\nSpeaking at the Malaysian Grand Prix round of the 2013 championship, Dato’ Kamarudin explained why Caterham Group is expanding its motorsport interests into the two-wheel arena, in addition to four wheels: “I am delighted to confirm that we have had our entry into Moto2™ accepted, and to be able to make this announcement at our home track of Sepang is a proud moment. Through AirAsia, Tony Fernandes and I have been passionate supporters of motorbike racing for many years and the establishment of our own team in Moto2™ is the natural next step for Caterham Group.\n“I am also very pleased to confirm our first rider, Josh Herrin, who is a very exciting talent and comes to us as the reigning AMA Superbike Champion. He shares our belief that we can achieve the ambitious goals we are setting for 2014 and beyond and we are all excited about seeing him continue to develop on the world stage. We are also going to continue to support Fahmi’s burgeoning career in Moto3™, a young Malaysian rider whose potential develops every season.\n“In addition, we can now confirm that we have signed a technical partnership with Suter Racing Technology for the supply of chassis. This is a pragmatic move, one that gives us access to proven design and manufacturing skills and allows us to build our team with the best possible partners from day one.\n“We will be making more announcements in due course on the second rider who will join Josh, and providing more details on our team structure and goals. For now, we can say that we will be on the grid from 2014 with the experienced hand of Johan Stigefelt as our Team Manager, and this is just the start of our ambitions on two wheels. We announced in November 2012 that Caterham Cars is now in a joint venture with Renault to build a new range of roadcars, and we will soon be making further announcements about our plans for taking Caterham’s two wheeled interests from the track to the road.\n“This is another exciting milestone in the life of Caterham Group, and Tony and I are already looking forward to seeing Caterham Moto Racing Team line up on the grid at the Losail Circuit in Doha, Qatar at its first race in 2014. With the team we are putting in place we have a strong chance of making good progress in our first year, and for many seasons to come.”\nAdvertisements",

What’s better is the price that is lower than RM35k as rumored before. This is a great time for any moped rider that has been waiting for so long to get a hold on superbikes. Wait no more, this is the time! Check out the official press release below:\nKuala Lumpur, 01 August 2013: Boon Siew Honda welcomes the latest addition of CB 500 series with introduction of the highly anticipated CBR500R, CB500F and CB500X models.According to Mr Satoshi Okada, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda, the CB 500 series exemplify Honda’s reputation in superior design and innovation, powerful performance and legendary durability and dependability. These mid-size machines are specially equipped with unique features and excellent value for money based on the platform – ‘Designed for Asian, Developed for Malaysian’. Riders looking for ‘Affordable Mobility’ with a fun combination of power, handling, racy excitement and everyday usability now have more choices to choose from the CB 500 series. The Supersport, Naked Style and Adventure Sport models are ready to drive the market with greater value and motoring excitement.\n2013 Honda CBR500R\nHonda CBR500R –  RM28,588, ABS RM31,888\nA mid-size Supersport designed with lightweight agility and engaging power delivery\nFor riders looking to move up from a 250, or holding a B2 license, the fully faired twin-cylinder CBR500R provides an excellent first big sports bike experience, which will also appeal to experienced riders looking for a great value alternative to larger sports bikes.\nThe CBR500R is powered by a next generation 8-valve liquid-cooled twin-cylinder 500cc DOHC engine. This purpose-built lightweight powerplant uses a square bore & stroke of 67 mm x 66.8 mm that delivers superb peak power of 35kW at 8500rpm and maximum torque reaching 43Nm at 7000rpm. The engine is also fitted with PGM-FI (Programmed Fuel-Injection) system to ensure crisp performance and better fuel efficiency of 27km/liter (WMTC figure). Fuel tank capacity is 15.7 liters (including reserve).\nEfforts to enhance a more feisty Supersport started right from the diamond shaped steel frame measuring 2075mm(L) x 740mm(W) x 1145mm(H) which is light in weight but robust in character. The rear section was designed to facilitate a lower seat height of 790mm that allows most riders to easily plant their feet on the ground when stopped.\nBesides sheer performance, the CBR500R affords riders with a level of comfort on par with its image. This comes in the form of Pro-Link rear suspension with preload-adjuster and 41mm telescopic front fork to ensure a comfortable but sporty ride.\nErgonomics were carefully configured to ensure an unrestricted riding position that allows easy maneuvering in town, an easy reach to the ground, as well as excellent comfort during long-distance highway trips.\nLightweight cast aluminum wheels with Y-shaped spokes not only accentuate a sporty look, they also contribute to the bike’s excellent maneuverability.\nThe potent performance of CBR500R is paired with an equally powerful ABS (Antilock Brake System). Wave brake rotors with superlative heat-dissipating qualities are lighter than conventional discs of the same diameter, which help to further reduce the bike’s unsprung weight. Two POT calipers up front and a single POT caliper at the back provide strong but easily controlled stopping power.\nWhen it comes to environmental performance, the CBR500R fares extremely well. Thanks to an in-built secondary air injection (AI) system, an Oxygen sensor and catalyser inside the exhaust that work to ensure the CBR500R’s emissions are low. CBR500R sports two 55W H7 Halogen bulbs with multi-reflectors for its signature headlight. It also comes with the assurance of HISS (Honda Intelligent Security System) against theft.\nThe CBR500R is available in three colour options of Pearl Himalayas White, Graphite Black and Seal Silver Metallic.\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nEngine\n\n\n\nType\nLiquid-Cooled, parallel twin\n\n\nDisplacement\n471 cc\n\n\nNo of Valves per Cylinder\n4\n\n\nBore × Stroke\n67mm x 66.8mm\n\n\nCompression Ratio\n10.7 : 1\n\n\nMax.

That’s the all-new Honda CB500F, the answer to riders who seek a motorcycle that is fun to ride, easy to handle and available at a reasonable price. It offers the practicality of a commuter together with the thrilling performance and distinctive style of a naked concept.\nAt the heart of CB500F is a next generation DOHC liquid-cooled parallel-twin 500cc engine with PGM-FI. Its light weight, all-round ability deliver a more aspirated ride. Power output reaches a maximum 35kW at 8,500rpm with excellent torque throughout the rev range peaking at 43Nm at 7,000rpm. With fuel tank capacity of 15.7 liters (including reserve), CB500F is able to deliver commendable fuel efficiency of 27km/liter (WMTC figure). Linear and smooth power delivery makes CB500F ideal for the cut-and-thrust of urban riding. Even riders new to mid-capacity engines can fully enjoy the strong level of performance.\nEngine vibration is kept to a minimum by using crankshaft pins phased at 180 degrees and a primary couple-balancer behind the cylinders, which also contributes to the engine’s compact size. Careful flow analysis of the cooling system resulted in a water pump that’s small and lightweight, yet still more than capable of keeping the engine running its best at high output levels. The fuel tank holds 15.7 litres (including reserve) and combined with the engine’s excellent fuel economy gives great range of 420km.\nThe CB500F’s lightweight diamond-shaped steel frame measuring 2075mm(L) x 780mm(W) x 1060mm(H) was designed to allow a certain degree of yield, which enables it to better respond to changes in the road. One of the CB500F’s major plus points is its height of 1060mm, the lowest among its CBR500R and CB500X counterparts. The low seat position not only accentuates the naked style, but also adds to the accessibility of the machine, which puts riders of any physical size at ease since they can put a foot down whenever they need to. Hence, making the CB500F a fun and easy to handle naked model for all levels of riding experience.\nSimilar to the Supersport model, the CB500F is fitted with a Pro-Link rear suspension with 9-stage preload-adjuster and 41mm telescopic front forks to ensure a comfortable but sporty ride.\nSuperb braking performance is achieved through the use of wave brake rotors and two POT calipers up front and a single POT caliper at the back to provide strong but easily controlled stopping power. Plus, ABS gives riders extra peace of mind on reduced-traction road surfaces.\nThe CB500F’s compact handlebar-mounted fairing contributes to its bold “naked” styling, which leaves the beautifully crafted engine out in full view. Its naked-style headlight utilizes a single 60/55W H4 Halogen bulb with multi-reflectors. The model is also equipped with HISS (Honda Intelligent Security System) for the rider’s total peace of mind.\nThe model is available in Pearl Himalayas White, Graphite Black and Candy Ruby Red.\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nEngine\n\n\n\nType\nLiquid-Cooled, parallel twin\n\n\nDisplacement\n471 cc\n\n\nNo of Valves per Cylinder\n4\n\n\nBore × Stroke\n67mm x 66.8mm\n\n\nCompression Ratio\n10.7 : 1\n\n\nMax.

Its lightweight maneuverability and excellent visibility also ensure it works equally well in urban environments and it’s a motorcycle designed to be ridden by a variety of people of all shapes and sizes.\nThe CB500X took its design cue from the 1200cc V4 Crosstourer, with taller chassis, longer travel suspension and a slightly longer wheelbase than CBR500R and CB500F, which add up to a more rugged build suited for sporty adventure. The fuel tank holds 17.3-litres (including reserve) and combined with the engine’s excellent fuel economy of 27km/liter (WMTC figure) translates to great range of 467km between refuels.\nAdventure sport touring riders can expect plenty of performance from the CB500X. Credit to its thoroughly modern, powerful 500cc parallel-twin DOHC engine with PGM-FI system. Using the same piston bore size as the CBR600RR sportbike, the parallel twin engine offers accessible performance across all rpm ranges with maximum power output of 35kW at 8,500rpm and optimum torque of 43Nm at 7,000rpm.\nThe CB500X’s diamond-shaped steel-tube mainframe is tied to the engine with four mounts to offer a rock-solid foundation for superior ride and handling. The chassis which measures 2095mm(L) x 830mm(W) x 1290mm(H) is fitted with Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension featuring a 9-stage preload adjuster and the front utilizes a 41mm telescopic fork ensure a comfortable ride over small bumps, while capably absorbing bigger bumps to increase riding comfort and handling.\nBraking system comprises a single front 320mm wavy disc and two-piston brake caliper matched to a 240mm rear disc and single-piston caliper, while ABS is fitted as standard.\nOther plus-points include HISS (Honda Intelligent Security System) that is built in to the ignition, bright single headlight featuring a 60/55W H4 Halogen bulb and multi-reflectors, digital instrumentation, space under the seat to store a U-lock, and a bash-plate is fitted to protect the engine’s underside and exhaust pipe on rough, loose surfaces.\nThe CB500X is available in three colour options of Pearl Himalayas White, Matt Gunpowder Black Metallic and Candy Ruby Red.\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nEngine\n\n\n\nType\nLiquid-Cooled, parallel twin\n\n\nDisplacement\n471 cc\n\n\nNo of Valves per Cylinder\n4\n\n\nBore × Stroke\n67mm x 66.8mm\n\n\nCompression Ratio\n10.7 : 1\n\n\nMax.

I like to do this comparison between Honda Wave 11oRS and Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR due to it similarity in features and price range. I’ll divide this comparison into 3 important part that is features, performance and fuel efficiency. Read on!\nFeatures\nBoth bike features electric starter which is a good addition just in case you might have injured leg some day in future. Personally, I like to have bike with electric starter since I have been using kick starter for long time since I have my Honda C70 and also because I have injured my knee.\nTubeless tyre can be installed to both of the bike since it features alloy cast sport rim. This is important if you usually ride for long distance since tubeless tyre are easier to repair and also easy to maintain.\nPerformance\nHonda Wave 110RS wins on maximum horsepower at 6.22kW/7500RPM compared to Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR at only 6.0kW on the same RPM range. Anyway, it is easier to hit 100km/h on Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR based on my test drive on my friend’s Honda Wave 110R. Maximum torque also won by Honda Wave 110RS since it produced 8.59Nm/5500RPM compared to Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR at 8.3Nm also on the same RPM range. For me, this is quite odd since Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR have longer stroke, which should reflect to better torque compared to Honda Wave 110RS. Long stroke is equivalent to higher torque. It is even more odd since Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR is displaced at 113.7cc whereby Honda Wave 110RS is just at 109.1cc. It makes me think that Honda engineer has made a very well engineered 110cc engine compared to the Yamaha’s. The power from the engine does not depend just about how large the cc is but also how easy it is to deliver the power to the transmission. Power from the engine are restricted by friction from the piston movement, crankshaft movement and also from the weight of the engine parts inside it such as piston itself, crankshaft and clutch. Honda has noticed about this and hence has made the decision to make a 10% lighter piston and also reducing friction anywhere possible inside the engine. Therefore, it is not really an odd situation to actually think that 110cc engine can be better in terms of performance compared to 115cc engine.\nFuel efficiency\nHonda Wave 110RS is weigh at 96kg(dry weight) and Yamaha Lagenda at 103kg(dry weight). With lower weight and smaller displacement engine with larger power-to-weight ratio, Honda Wave 110RS wins without any contest in terms of fuel efficiency. Boon Siew Honda reported that this bike can go to 52.5km for every one liter of fuel which is way better that the previous 100cc engine that it replace. I don’t know the fuel mileage data for the Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR (Yamaha Lagenda 110Z is up to 42.7 km/L at highway speeds), but on paper, Honda Wave 110RS is really fuel-efficient. This fuel efficiency came from a carburetted bike. Imagine how much the bike can be more fuel efficient if it is equipped with PGM-FI fuel injection system that replace the carburetor which is readily available in Thailand.\nConclusion\nHonda Wave 110RS wins in terms of performance and fuel efficiency. Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR is good in terms of design and on par with Honda Wave 110RS in terms of features. The bottom line is Honda Wave 110RS is cheaper than Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR at about RM50, so, if you were thinking whether to buy either bike, now you know to make your decision.\nBut, please remember, I’m one of the happy owner of Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR. Read my review about it here\nUPDATE (1/10/2010): \nTop speed\nLagenda 115ZR = 100km/h (based on my ride on my bike)\nWave 110RS = 91km/h (based on data from Boon Siew Honda)\nUPDATE (11/10/2010):\nHandling\nYamaha Lagenda 115ZR have excellent cornering stability compared to Honda Wave 110RS based on my test drive.\nAdvertisements",

Usually, I just leave my bike in dirty condition until I have time to wash it. But, it looked very dirty that I decide to send it to a car wash to get it cleaned. This is my first time having my bike get cleaned at the car wash. Well, it was BIG mistake!\n\nThe car wash there used some kind of chemical to clean the bike from oil and grease. My friend said that this chemical is air-cond chemical, but I don’t know specifically what type is it. What happened is that my Lagenda 115ZR engine casing on both side suffered from black spot stain. When I got my bike home, I just thought it might be normal stain that is easily wiped away. I was wrong. The stain are almost permanent and cannot be wash by water, oil and detergent. The stain are unbearable to see if you are someone who care for your bike.\nFortunately, I tried to use rust removal that is Autosol and luckily it works. Autosol works but it takes me about an hour to get it cleaned. After one hour, I can only clean 80% of the stain since some stain are not easy to reach.\nI have learnt my lesson here; NEVER SEND YOUR BIKE TO A CAR WASH to get it cleaned! It just might gets dirtier than before.\nAdvertisements",

It seem that this is a very new bike or it is a spy shot since there are no information about it on Yamaha Vietnam website. This is what I love about Japanese bike manufacturers. Even though they manage to sell a lot of their products, they still have the passion to upgrade it to better version or even just introduce a small facelift to their popular products. This new Yamaha Nouvo LX a.k.a Nouvo LC in Malaysia has shown that you can make good thing to become better. I love how the meter cluster looks in this new Nouvo LX. It looks much more superbike meter cluster that usually have the RPM meter and digital speedometer display (but I’m not sure whether that is RPM meter on the Nouvo LX).  The front end has been upgraded to a better design with sharper look and much more edgier curves. Front headlight are now on the center of the bike, unlike the previous model which is split into two. The signal are taken further back and have better presence. This should be good for safety.\nThe tail light of this bike are said to be from LED lighting which ensure faster response from the traditional tungsten wire lamp bulb. LED also have longer lifetime and uses lower energy from the bike. This ensure lower maintance and it could also helps in term of fuel efficiency.\nThis bike will still carry the proven 135cc engine that provides durability along with good fuel consumption.\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2011/11/24/yamaha-nouvo-lx-fi-yang-futuristik-pas-nggak-buat-nouvo-reborn/\nAdvertisements",

FI system can adds fuel efficiency to the bike and this mean lower CO2 and waste fuel since the FI system metering is accurately measured to the combustion chamber.  \n\nYamaha Nouvo SX125 also makes it appearance there. Previously this bike has been launched earlier in Vietnam. It is a radical looking bike with front projection light.

        "800cc\nducati\nScrambler \n\n2015 Ducati Scrambler unveiled at Intermot – oil and air-cooled L-twin two-valve 803 cc engine \n\n\nPosted on October 1, 2014October 1, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nAt the end of the first day of Intermot 2014 – the International Motorcycle Fair being held in Cologne (Germany) from 30 September to 6 October – Ducati finally unveiled one of the most eagerly awaited new bikes to go on show there; the Ducati Scrambler brand immediately became the focus of media and public attention, and the undisputed star of this key German fair.\nRe-proposing the yellow containers that characterised the original, highly creative launch phase, Ducati set up a Ducati Scrambler brand-dedicated space in the exhibition area of its Intermot 2014 stand. This symbolic opening-up of a “new world” at the end of the press-dedicated day involved both public and media in an original presentation that was fully in keeping with the language and style of this exciting new concept.  \n2015 DUCATI SCRAMBLER FULL THROTTLE\n“This year Intermot is especially meaningful for Ducati”,stated Claudio Domenicali, CEO of Ducati Motor Holding, during the press conference. “Ducati continues to grow steadily as it has done for several years now. The last 12 months confirm this positive trend with a growth over 5% compared to the previous ones, a new sales record. I’m also particularly proud to be celebrating, here at Intermot, Ducati’s historic win in the German Superbike Championship where the performance of the 1199 Panigale R has allowed us to take both the Constructors and Riders title – thanks to the prowess of Xavi Fores and Max Neukirchner.”\n“Presenting the new Ducati Scrambler brand means for us opening the doors to an entirely new, fascinating, and absolutely contemporary world”, said Cristiano Silei, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Ducati Motor Holding, during the unveiling of the new bikes. “We have reinterpreted an iconic motorcycle, part of our history for more than 50 years, in a fully modern way, designing and building the Ducati Scrambler as if we’d never stopped making it. The four bikes of the Ducati Scrambler family represent starting points on a path to personalisation that will make every single Ducati Scrambler a unique, free-spirited bike as individual as the person riding it.”\n2015 DUCATI SCRAMBLER URBAN ENDURO\nThe waiting is finally over. The Ducati Scrambler is finally out of the yellow container that has so jealously guarded it over the last few months and is now – after the previews granted to employees and Ducatisti at World Ducati Week 2014 – officially ready. This is more than just a new bike: it’s a whole new world, one that expresses itself via a range of options and versions that provide a starting point for satisfying the different needs and wants of individual motorcyclists.\nThe Ducati Scrambler is a contemporary bike that expresses the pure essence of motorcycling. Tried and tested materials such as the aluminium of the rear swingarm and engine covers and the steel of the teardrop tank and frame are combined with new-generation components such as front and rear LED lighting and LCD instruments.\n2015 DUCATI SCRAMBLER ICON\nWide handlebars and a long seat provide a comfortable, relaxed riding position and, together with the low weight, low centre of gravity and slightly knobby tyres, ensure pure riding fun whatever the situation.\n“Post-heritage” design gives a contemporary take on the iconic bike built by Ducati back in the 60s and 70s. This Ducati Scrambler, though, is no retro bike: it is, rather, intended to be just how the legendaryBologna-built motorcycle would be today if Ducati had never stopped building it.\nThe Icon version, in yellow and red, is joined by three others – Urban Enduro, Full Throttle and Classic – each offering its own style and performance-related interpretation of the Scrambler spirit. The Urban Enduro, with its “Wild Green” paintjob, is for enduro style enthusiasts and ready to switch from city streets to country backroads in an instant. The Full Throttle is for riders enthralled by the flat-track racing world who have a penchant for pushing things to the limit. And the Classic is for devotees to details and a 1970s look who want the uncompromising riding pleasure and comfort of a modern-day bike.\nThe headlamp, together with the tank, forms a key part of the Ducati Scrambler look. Rounded, classically designed yet extremely modern (i.e. post-heritage) it features a glass parabola and an ultra-modern LED light guide around the rim that acts as a side light.\n2015 DUCATI SCRAMBLER CLASSIC\nSeat and tank have been carefully designed to give the Ducati Scrambler appealing proportions. A compact bike, the Ducati Scrambler instils confidence from the very moment you set eyes on it. It’s been sized to make it accessible to all motorcyclists while the long seat maximises comfort and can also accommodate a passenger comfortably.\nAn oil and air-cooled L-twin two-valve 803 cc engine powers the Ducati Scrambler; it has an 88 mm bore, a 66 mm stroke and has been redesigned to give smooth acceleration throughout the rev range.\nMoreover, thanks to a vast range of apparel and bike accessories, to be presented in November, the Ducati Scrambler offers a virtually unlimited range of exclusive personalisation and lifestyle options.\nThe Ducati Scrambler name has much in common with the verb to scramble – mixing up, blending, letting the imagination run free, sharing with others. The Ducati Scrambler is the two-wheeled alter ego of those who ride it, a cultural movement in and of itself. It’s free-spirited, positive and anti-conformist, open to encounters with other philosophies and styles. Ducati Scrambler isn’t just a bike, it’s a world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 DUCATI SCRAMBLER ICON\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 DUCATI SCRAMBLER CLASSIC\n\n\nThe Ducati Scrambler will be in Ducati Dealerships starting form the end of January 2015 and the first of the four versions to become available will be the Icon.\nSource: Official PR\nAdvertisements",

I hope the AT transmission can provide the same power and durability like the normal manual sequential transmission like Honda Wave 110.\nFuel injection is replacing carburetor for bikes in Thailand, which said to provide better fuel efficiency all round the RPM.\nHere are the excerpt from the Honda Worldwide news:\n“February 18, 2010 – Honda will begin sales in Thailand of a new Cub-type automatic transmission (AT) scooter model, Wave110i AT, in March of this year through A. P. Honda Co., Ltd., a Honda affiliate responsible for distribution of Honda motorcycle products in Thailand. Based on the Wave110i, which is highly acclaimed for its fuel efficiency, the Wave110i AT features a new automatic transmission called CV-Matic. The starting price will be 44,900 baht, with an annual sales plan of 50,000 units. (1 baht = approximately 2.7 yen).\n\nCV-Matic makes the Wave110i AT a product that offers both the typical characteristics of Cub-type bikes such as longer riding range, durability and superior cost-performance as well as added characteristics such as ease of operation and comfortable ride. In addition to Thailand, Honda has plans for the sequential introduction of Wave110i AT in Vietnam and neighboring countries to meet the diversifying needs of customers in ASEAN markets.\nThe CV-Matic features a new cooling system which solved the issue of heat load on drive belt, and was developed based on the small-motorcycle automatic transmission technologies Honda has been fostering over the years. This new system enhances the durability of the drive belt and allows for a more compact design with a shorter distance between the drive pulley and driven pulley. Due to this advance, the engine position does not need to be significantly altered, optimizing design layout freedom.\nIndustry-wide motorcycle sales in Thailand in 2009 totaled approximately 1.54 million units (down 10% compared to 2008). With sales of approximately 1.01 million units, more than 60% of the industry sales total, Honda has been the best-selling motorcycle brand in Thailand for 21 consecutive years. Due to the added comfort and ease-of-operation, the overall sales of AT models has been growing in Thailand, accounting for approximately 710,000 units, or approximately half of the market size in 2009.\nWith the introduction of the Wave110i AT, an AT model of the already popular Wave110i, Honda will further enhance its product lineup to meet the diversifying customer needs. Moreover, Honda is planning to install Honda’s programmed fuel injection system (PGM-FI) to all models sold in Thailand by the end of 2010.”\nSource: http://world.honda.com/news/2010/c100218Wave-110i-AT/\nMan, when will we get to see this in Malaysia?\nAdvertisements",

BMW Motorrad and the blockbuster action movie series Dhoom have one thing in common: a passion for fast and powerful bikes. In Dhoom:3 – the third instalment of the Bollywood blockbuster due for international release on 20 December – BMW Motorrad and Yash Raj Films unveil their debut collaboration in the form of an exclusive motorcycle partnership. The upshot is edge-of-the-seat footage depicting breakneck biking stunts with the high-performance BMW S 1000 RR and BMW K 1300 R models. While these promise serious goosebumps, the action-packed overtaking and evasive manoeuvres along with daring leaps and high-speed rides demonstrate the lightness of touch with which extreme power can be harnessed.\nFor 90 years now, BMW Motorrad has been a byword for style-setting innovations, outstanding engineering skills and a distinctive design that is consistently targeted at the emotional dimension of biking. “For BMW Motorrad, the focus is always on the rider’s experience. That is why we are incredibly proud to be making our debut not just in an Indian film venture but in the biggest Bollywood blockbuster of the year – and with our BMW bikes playing such a high-profile role,” says Alexander Baraka, Head of Events, Exhibitions and Motorsport Marketing. “This is a project predestined for high-speed chases on the big screen.”\nAcceleration even at standstill: the BMW K 1300 R.\nAs one of the most powerful models in its segment, the flamboyant high-performance BMW K 1300 R roadster meets the most exacting demands in terms of riding dynamics. Its muscular front end and slim, sporty rear hold out a promise that is fulfilled the moment you set off on this naked bike: the BMW K 1300 R launches into a rocket start while also boasting safe and stable roadholding through corners.\nSuperbike without compromise: the BMW S 1000 RR.\nEase of handling coupled with extreme ride stability, supreme engine performance allied to perfect everyday utility: thanks to its sporting DNA, the BMW S 1000 RR turns the road into a race track. With its aluminium frame, radical braking system and dynamic tail-up, nose-down design, this bike exemplifies undiluted racing power.\nAbout Dhoom:3.\nDhoom:3, the third instalment of the eponymous Bollywood action movie series, will hit cinemas around the world on 20 December 2013. A string of sensational chases sees cop Jai Dixit (Abhishek Bachchan) and his partner Ali (Uday Chopra) astride the BMW S 1000 RR superbike in hot pursuit of the slippery clown thief, Sahir played by none other than Bollywood megastar Aamir Khan, who sets the screen alight with spectacular stunts on the BMW K 1300 R. Filming took place in Chicago and Mumbai.\nAdvertisements",

The style are now much sharper and looks modern enough for any riders to take notice of it on the road. 250cc bikes is an important market for ASEAN countries since lots of the riders ride moped. Given the category of this 250cc as the beginner superbikes, it makes a lot of sense for riders of moped to upgrade their bike to this category before proceeding for bigger capacity bikes. \n\nThis Ninja 250R has a great head light that compliments its Japanese heritage. It just look perfect. The meter cluster also nicely designed with the sharp cues that flows along the sharp overal design. Having a rev meter on big on the dash also makes it ready for aggressive gear shifting on red line.\n\nNot just that, the tail light also has been properly design for road legal use. Previously, Kawasaki didn’t design the tail light to complement the overall look, but this time it is all perfect. For the braking, it is being fitted with ABS for better contol of the bike in difficult situation.\nKawasaki just wins my two thumbs up.\nThis leak images comes from Taufik at tmcblog and noticed by me at motorcycles.about.com.\nAdvertisements",

We never thought that Yamaha are keeping on its shed this 2014 Yamaha MT-125 with the tagline ‘Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark’. The MT-125 are targeted as the learners bike for those who are looking for a streetfighter style ride but easy to handle for beginners. It got all the aura of its bigger brother, the 2-inline 689cc MT-07 and 3-inline 850cc MT-09 for that street-cred that some might be looking for. If you still remember, the ‘Dark’ trend started with the MT-09 ‘Discover Your Dark Side’ and then followed with MT-07 with ‘Rise Up Your Darkness’. Now it is seemingly correct to tag this MT-125 ‘Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark’ that can be related to the easy handling and more manageable power of the 125cc engine.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase from the YZF-R125 platform, this would make it economical for both Yamaha and its riders since many of the performance parts are readily available on the market.

Yesterday Jorge met with a number of local media before heading off to take part in a soccer game with a team of Lorenzo fans and members of the Yamaha community.\nThis morning Jorge and Vale went together to meet Mr. Joko Widodo, the current Governor of Jakarta. The threesome spent some time cycling and chatting together before the riders moved on to join the thousands of Yamaha dealers gathered to witness the unveiling of the 2014 YZR-M1 that marked the start of the 3S Dealer Meeting.\nJorge and Vale wrapped up the day by recording a local TV show and shooting a Yamaha TV commercial before heading to the airport and saying goodbye to Indonesia once again.  \n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – Yamaha Factory Racing\n“It’s always nice to come into a sunny country with happy people, especially Indonesia, a country that gets crazy about MotoGP. Both Vale and myself have a lot of fans. Everyone recognises us in the street and gives us a lot of love so it’s a good place to promote Yamaha.\nEvery year this Asian market gets more and more important so our visits here increase. This time we decided to do the launch here, in front of thousands of Yamaha people.\nI like the new bike a lot, it’s very smart and elegant with more white. It’s not just the colour though; I’m excited to see what’s inside the bike in Sepang!\nMy expectations for this season are very high. This winter I had an operation to take out the metal plates in my shoulder so I’m a bit lighter but I’m also a bit fatter after Christmas! I am training hard to lose some kilos and I will try to start the season well like last year and be straight onto the podium. This will be important to get points and gain confidence to keep going through the season. Our rivals will be tough but I think if we’ve improved in some areas then we have a good chance to win the title again.\nWhen you are fast and winning races all the big factories want you, this is normal. I have to clarify that there is no truth in the rumours that there is a contract with another manufacturer and I would like to start negotiating as soon as possible for my future with Yamaha. My dream is to retire after my career as a Yamaha rider. If our bike is even better this year then it will be easier!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – Yamaha Factory Racing\n“It’s always great to come to Indonesia. The Indonesians are the best fans in the world, with a lot of passion for MotoGP and the Yamaha Factory Team, even though they have no races in their country. Yamaha Indonesia plays a big role in Yamaha’s global business and I truly hope that Jorge’s and my presence here gives a further boost to their local business. This morning I had the pleasure and the honour to spend some time with Mr. Joko Widodo, Governor of Jakarta, and I could not have expected any better welcome to my arrival in Indonesia.\nThis season is very important for me and the fact that we officially start the season here in Jakarta makes it even more special. I can’t remember any previous unveiling by Yamaha made outside Europe, so today’s event was special for several reasons. Yamaha deliberately decided to offer the Indonesian dealers the chance to host the unveiling of the 2014 M1 during their big annual meeting here in Jakarta and this is another sign of the increasing importance of the SE Asian market for the global business. I truly hope to be able to race here again, very soon, before it’s too late!!\nWe unveiled the new livery for 2014 today; it’s very nice, very elegant and has more white than last year. It’s still very much in the Yamaha Factory style and I like it a lot.\nThe expectations for the coming season are very high. My target is to try and do better than last year, be more competitive and fight for the podium every weekend. I am sure our bike will be very competitive again. It was already very good last year and Yamaha engineers were able to develop it further through the season therefore I expect a lot from my new M1 and I am sure it will get even better during the season.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nLin Jarvis – Yamaha Motor Racing, Managing Director\nI am very happy that I was able to attend the Yamaha Motor Indonesia Dealer Convention here today with our President Mr. Yanagi, Jorge, Vale, and Tsuji-san to give the Indonesian dealers an exclusive preview of our new colours for the 2014 season. The Indonesian market is the biggest in the world and MotoGP is enormously popular here so I really hope we can come here to race in the future.\nI would like to thank our hosts for making us so welcome and for their invaluable support to our MotoGP project. We now look forward with impatience to the first Sepang test in just over two weeks from now to start our 2014 title campaign.”\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 13 Misano: Rossi revels in Italian renaissance after remarkable Misano victory – 1st Rossi, 2nd Lorenzo and 3rd Pedrosa \n\n\nPosted on September 15, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nValentino Rossi had the Italian fans rejoicing at Misano after the Movistar Yamaha MotoGP star won his first race of the season in an intriguing San Marino and Rimini Grand Prix.\nStarting from the front row, Rossi was engaged in a thrilling three-way battle for the lead in the early stages of the race with teammate Jorge Lorenzo and Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez, with Rossi taking the race lead on the fourth lap. After fending off an attack from Marquez – who crashed at turn four while challenging for first place before re-joining the race – Rossi was able to build a gap over Lorenzo and ultimately crossed the finish line 1.578 seconds ahead of his teammate, with the pair ensuring a 1-2 finish for Yamaha. In third place at Misano was Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa, the Spaniard crossing the finish line another couple of seconds behind the leading pair.  \nToday was the warmest day of the race weekend, although the peak track temperature of 37°C recorded during the race was just 3°C higher than yesterday’s peak. As a result, the race tyre choice was similar to what the riders used during race simulations in yesterday’s Free Practice 4 session. Front tyre choice was quite consistent throughout the twenty-three riders on the grid for the race, with all riders except Jorge Lorenzo selecting the medium compound front slick, with the Spaniard instead selecting the hard compound front. Rear tyre choice was split evenly across the grid, with twelve riders selecting the medium compound rear slick, and the other eleven riders selecting the soft compound rear slick.\nAlthough he only claimed a single point at Misano, Marquez still maintains a seventy-four point lead in the championship standings over teammate Pedrosa with five rounds remaining. Courtesy of his first win of the season Rossi closes the gap to Pedrosa to just two points as the battle for second place in the championship intensifies.\nKyota Futami – General Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“Congratulations to Valentino on an amazing victory in front of his home crowd today and also to Yamaha for such a dominant performance resulting in a well-deserved double podium. It was unfortunate to see Marquez crash out during the race, but credit to him for fighting back to claim a valuable championship point and I am sure he will be challenging back at the front at the next round in Aragon. Today was a real special moment for MotoGP and has added yet another fascinating chapter to what has been a thrilling season. ”\nShinichi Yamashita – General Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“As we expected the weather was warmer today, but the track temperatures weren’t high enough to influence a change in tyre strategy for the riders, with almost everyone selecting the same tyre combination that they used during their race simulations yesterday in FP4. I’m very happy with how our tyres performed today, with consistent pace over the twenty-eight laps and seven riders being able to set their quickest lap in the second half of the race.”\nValentino Rossi, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP – Race Winner\n“I’m very happy to win today, especially here at Misano in front of my fans, family and friends. During the practice sessions, our Yamaha and my team were working very well and I felt that we had a small advantage at Misano. Yesterday and today I felt very strong and knew I could fight for the victory, but realised it would be a tough fight with the other riders. I gave my maximum at the beginning of the race and knew that if I could resist the other riders I had a chance as my pace was good, and in the end I couldn’t want for anything more from today.”\nSan Marino & Rimini MotoGP™: Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n44’14.586\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n44’16.164\n\n\n1.578\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n44’18.862\n\n\n4.276\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n44’20.096\n\n\n5.510\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n44’26.357\n\n\n11.771\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n44’33.585\n\n\n18.999\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n44’37.686\n\n\n23.100\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n44’51.044\n\n\n36.458\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n44’53.066\n\n\n38.480\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nYonny HERNANDEZ\n\n\nEnergy T.I.

Marquez ultimately won the race by 1.837 seconds from teammate Dani Pedrosa, who has now finished on the podium at every race this year. In third place for the Argentina Grand Prix was Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo, the Spanish rider leading the first sixteen laps of the race after taking the holeshot into the first corner.\nClear skies and calmer winds than yesterday resulted in the best track conditions of the race weekend, with a peak track temperature of 45°C recorded during the race. The warmer conditions resulted in all riders selecting the hardest rear slick option available; hard compound for Factory Yamaha and Honda riders, and medium compound for the Ducati and open-class entrants. Front tyre choice saw six of the twenty-three starters select the hard compound front slick, with the remaining seventeen riders selecting the medium compound front. Tyre performance throughout the race remained consistent, with Pedrosa setting the fastest lap time of the race on lap twenty-two.\nMarquez’s perfect win record gives him seventy-five championship points, while Pedrosa is in second place on fifty-six points. Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi remains third in the championship classification on forty-one points after finishing in fourth place today.  \nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“The lack of wind and warm temperatures today gave us what were the best track conditions so far this weekend and this allowed for a very fast race pace for the riders. The higher temperatures meant the harder compound rear slicks were used by all riders, while only the medium and hard front slicks were selected for the race. The performance of our tyres over race distance was exemplary, with half the riders setting their fastest lap time after the twentieth lap of the race. The large amount of development we did leading up to the race at Autódromo Termas de Río Hondo enabled us to deliver a tyre allocation that allowed riders to comfortably deal with what were rapidly changing track conditions over the race weekend.”\nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“I enjoyed the race a lot, especially at the beginning among many riders and with all the overtaking. Jorge started to build a gap so I decided to try and follow him for a few laps, then I saw Dani was coming so I pushed a bit more and it was enough to take the victory. Thanks to my team and the Argentina fans. I am very happy with the result.”\nArgentina MotoGP™ Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n41’39.821 \n\n\n\nHard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nDani PEDROSA \n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n41’41.658 \n\n\n1.837\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nJorge LORENZO \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n41’43.022 \n\n\n3.201\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nValentino ROSSI \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n41’44.719 \n\n\n4.898\n\n\nHard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nStefan BRADL \n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP \n\n\n41’54.850 \n\n\n15.029\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE \n\n\nPramac Racing \n\n\n41’59.268 \n\n\n19.447\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBradley SMITH \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n42’04.013 \n\n\n24.192\n\n\nHard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n42’08.939 \n\n\n29.118\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO \n\n\nDucati Team \n\n\n42’13.494 \n\n\n33.673\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nHiroshi AOYAMA \n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar \n\n\n42’23.100 \n\n\n43.279\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

This mean that you have modify your AT bike to be torquey (more pickup) or speedy just by changing the ratio of the front and rear sprocket.The airflow of the CV-Matic is important to keep the heat away from the drive belt for good normal operating temperature.There are many name for this kind of transmission using belt drive namely Ultra V-Matic by Honda, Super CVT by Suzuki or Xtronic by Nissan (for car usage) which actually refer to the same basic concept of Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) using belt driven shaft fitted with cone shaped wheel. There’s a great article for you to read at HowStuffWorks about CVT here: http://www.howstuffworks.com/cvt.htmHonda CV-Matic will only be available on 2010, but Yamaha YCAT already teased in Yamaha Motor Vietnam in Yamaha LEXAM.For more info, get to: http://www.fareastgizmos.com/transport/honda_cvmatic_new_automatic_transmission_for_cubstyle_scooters.php\nRelated Posts:Yamaha LEXAM in Vietnam Yamaha Motor WebsiteYamaha LEXAM First Pictures from AutoPROOfficial Details of Yamaha Y.C.A.T\n\nAdvertisements",

It is still equipped with the same 3-cylinder 4-stroke  liquid-cooled DOHC 4-valves per cylinder engine that provides 115PS @ 10,000RPM. Torque rating also the same at 87.5 Nm @ 8,500 rpm. For longer distance riding, there is one changes to the MT-09 Tracer that is bigger fuel tank. MT-09 carries 14L capacity while this MT-09 Tracer brings it up to 18L, that is 4L extra fuel to makes you rides for longer distances.  \n\nDeveloped with the MT-09 ‘Dark’ series base model, it comes with new styling with the prominent dual headlight and larger 3-point adjustable windshield.\n\nAs we can see, the windshield is adjustable in 3 height position. This will make it easier for you to adjust the windshield to deflect the wind away from you while you are harnessing the 115PS of the engine power or at least half of that power.\n\nThe seat height is actually higher that the MT-09 (815mm) at 845mm, but it is also adjustable so you can maxes it out to 860mm if you need to. Flexible seat height is a welcomed feature since there is always a rider that needs different seat position.\n\nIncluded on the package as standard is the handguard. Handguard is very useful to makes sure there will be no cold air getting to your fist and makes you feel tired of it. Even in Malaysia, the handguard can prevent the coldness of the morning commute. We have tried to use the Acerbis handguard before.\n\nBeing an action tourer, sometimes you need to repair your bike in a place where there is no bike lift available, and with this equipped center stand, it will be easier to make the repair by yourself. Also, it will also be easy to put all the luggage to your side and rear box. FYI, the MT-09 doesn’t have center stand.\nMT-09 Tracer Meter\nThe meter cluster have also been upgraded to a bigger display to enable you to read the information on it in a glance.\nMT-09 Meter\nCompared to the MT-09 meter, it is smaller and totally different than the MT-09 Tracer meter.\n\nThe rear light is maintained from the MT-09 rear light but now there is the rear and side bracket to fit the rear and side box.\n\nMaking it easy to charge your phone and maybe GPS, standard auxillary 12V power outlet is fitted. A nice addition for the long distance riders.\n\nThe headlight is fitted with DRL (Daytime Running Light) so the riders are much more visible in the low light condition.\n2015 Yamaha MT-09 Tracer Technical Specification:\n\nEngine\n\n\n\n\nEngine type\n3-cylinder, 4-stroke, liquid-cooled, DOHC, 4-valves\n\n\nDisplacement\n847 cm³\n\n\nBore x stroke\n78.0 mm x 59.1 mm\n\n\nCompression ratio\n11.5 : 1\n\n\nMaximum power\n84.6 kW (115PS) @ 10,000 rpm\n\n\nMaximum torque\n87.5 Nm (8.9 kg-m) @ 8,500 rpm\n\n\nLubrication system\nWet sump\n\n\nClutch type\nWet, Multiple Disc\n\n\nFuel system\nFuel Injection\n\n\nIgnition system\nTCI\n\n\nStarter system\nElectric\n\n\nTransmission system\nConstant Mesh, 6-speed\n\n\nFinal transmission\nChain\n\n\n\n\nChassis\n\n\n\n\nFrame\nDiamond\n\n\nFront suspension system\nTelescopic forks\n\n\nFront travel\n137 mm\n\n\nCaster angle\n24º\n\n\nTrail\n100 mm\n\n\nRear suspension system\nSwingarm, (Link type suspension)\n\n\nRear travel\n130 mm\n\n\nFront brake\nHydraulic dual disc, Ø 298 mm\n\n\nRear brake\nHydraulic single disc, Ø 245 mm\n\n\nFront tyre\n120/70ZR17M/C (58W) (Tubeless)\n\n\nRear tyre\n180/55ZR17M/C (73W) (Tubeless)\n\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\n\n\nOverall length\n2,160 mm\n\n\nOverall width\n950 mm\n\n\nOverall height\n1,345 mm max 1,375 mm\n\n\nSeat height\n845 mm max 860 mm\n\n\nWheel base\n1,440 mm\n\n\nMinimum ground clearance\n135 mm\n\n\nWet weight (including full oil and fuel tank)\n210 kg\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n18 L\n\n\nOil tank capacity\n3.4 L\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe questions you might ask it; 1.

It is a motorsport racing that takes place on the closed road in an island located in the Irish sea between the islands of Great Britain and Ireland.  \n\nOn the front side, we can see the TT sign with the three-legged triskeleon logo that shows that this is the authentic and official product of the Isle of Man TT race. You can also see the famous mountain course on top of the helmet. Arai has been supporting this fastest, wildest and most dangerous street racing in the world since 2007 and also has become the official partner.\n\nThe RX-7 GP IOMTT ’14 will be available in June 2014 with the price of €1,099 (or RM4,912.10).

Confirming the close ties and synergy between the Bologna-based manufacturer and the Audi Group, the official presentation of the Ducati Team was held at the Audi Forum inside Munich Airport.\n\nIn the presence of a carbon black Ducati Desmosedici GP14, which had just returned to Europe following the recent tests in Malaysia and Australia, Claudio Domenicali (Ducati Motor Holding CEO), personally introduced the team, represented on the stage by Luigi Dall’Igna (Ducati Corse General Manager), by Paolo Ciabatti (Ducati Corse Sporting Director) and by the two riders, Andrea Dovizioso and Cal Crutchlow. The sporting activities for the new season and the technical details of the new Desmosedici GP14 were illustrated, in the light of the recent tests and the decision to take part in the championship in Open configuration (as announced last week in Sepang).  \n\n“As I have said recently” declared Claudio Domenicali at the start of the press conference, “in MotoGP we also want to find again those values that have led us to obtain successful results in the past. We are ready for the new MotoGP season, firmly convinced that the enthusiasm, the passion and the technical competence of our team, together with the support of our sponsors and partners and all of our ‘tifosi’, will enable us to tackle this commitment with determination. Cal and Andrea are very talented riders, and Luigi Dall’Igna will surely be able to manage the resources available in the best possible way. The new technical and sporting decisions that the company has decided to take will allow us to compete once again with the spirit that has always characterized the women and the men who work in Ducati, capable of producing dream bikes that are in the forefront for technology and design.”\n\nClaudio Domenicali then invited onto the stage Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg, Member of the Board of Audi AG for Technical Development. The German manager underlined that Audi and Ducati share the same passion for racing, have many values in common and both represent excellence in the field of technology and innovation. Following this introduction, as a true enthusiast and fan of Ducati, Dr. Hackenberg passed on his best wishes to the Ducati Team on behalf of the entire group.\n\nThen it was the turn of Luigi Dall’Igna, Ducati Corse General Manager, who presented the Desmosedici GP14. “Coming to work in Ducati Corse is probably the most important challenge of my life: working in MotoGP as General Manager for one of the most famous and prestigious manufacturers in the world – Ducati – is an important achievement but also a great responsibility. I am very proud of the choice that I have made and just as motivated by the results of testing at Sepang and Phillip Island. At the moment the most important thing is to continue with the development of the bike, and the choices that we have made will allow us to move forward and improve. We are satisfied with the lap times in the last tests, but also the consistency of the times, which are backed up by the riders’ comments. Ducati has significantly reduced the gap to its rivals and we are confident we can make further steps forward during the season.”\nPaolo Ciabatti, Ducati Corse Sporting Director, as well as MotoGP Project Manager, declared: “After three difficult seasons without any significant results, the changes in organization that we have made in our structure for this season are producing their first results. The entire Ducati Team is very motivated and united, and the encouraging results we obtained in the last tests give us hope for the championship that is about the start. We know that we still need to do a lot of work to further reduce the gap separating us from the frontrunners, but we are convinced we have made the right decisions and so we are very optimistic”.\n\nFor Andrea Dovizioso 2014 will be the second season in MotoGP with the Ducati Team. After an eighth place last season, the 27 year-old Italian will be hoping for better luck this time around and first impressions from the tests are positive. “I am very happy with the way the pre-season tests went because we managed to improve more than expected, and this gives me a lot of confidence. Thanks to the work of Gigi, and by making a few balance changes, the bike is now more manageable, goes better and we succeeded in doing the times we did in the recent tests. Losail is a very difficult track but I think we will be quite competitive, even though we still have a few doubts about our effective race pace. In any case, we have reduced the gap from last year and today we are much more competitive. We still have to improve to arrive at the positions where we want to be, but I think that in the first race we will manage to start close to the front.”\n\nThe 2014 season will be Cal Crutchlow’s fourth year in MotoGP, and the first as factory rider for the Ducati Team. The occasion initiates an exciting new chapter in the career of the British rider. “I’m excited about the season ahead and I think Qatar is going to be good for us. The team have been working well, and especially in Australia I felt we were doing a good job. We still have some things to try with the bike, but I’m excited to start the season in what I feel is not too bad a shape. I think we will be at a disadvantage because we never tested there, but we’ll still be giving 100% in the race.”\n\nThe Ducati Team will be on track at Losail (Qatar) starting from Thursday 20 March, with the first practice sessions, while the race is scheduled for the evening of Sunday 23 March at 10 pm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It can be coming from the front or rear tyre running through the suspension and makes the ‘chatter’ (vibration) to the bike. It can be minor issue or major issue even up to a point that the bike is not controllable under certain condition especially during the cornering and after exiting it.\nI have been reading a lot about it and wonder why it really matters.

That is just about two more weeks ahead.\nIt carries the code Z250SL which tallies with the current naming of the Kawasaki models as of Z250. This naked variant of Z250SL will have the same 1-cylinder liquid-cooled engine that provides 28hp. The single cylinder engine are slim enough to make the bike to be packaged in a chassis that is no more wider than a 150cc bike. Simply said, 250cc in 150cc package. Slimmer bike will give better handling in traffic and the bigger engine of 250cc will give proper speed you have the chance to use on the open road.\nWhat’s even more interesting with this Z250SL is that the price is said to be lower than the full-fairing variant 250SL.\nWill it comes to Malaysia? That is always the question that I wish I could answer. I’m just as clueless as you guys about it. \nVia: http://tmcblog.com\nAdvertisements",

The day it first introduced and up to this days, there are still modification parts for the 135LC made by many third-party company. This time, it is Y-Teq time to introduce the 65mm racing engine block for the popular 135LC.\nOne this that is noticeable from this engine block is the absence of water jacket surrounding the cylinder area and there are two pipes protruding out from the engine block. Since 135LC is liquid-cooled bike, it needs to have water to absorbs all the heat from the combustion of the fuel inside the chamber. So, this engine block still have water surrounding the combustion chamber to takes away the heat but it is now built inside the engine block itself. To make the water flow nicely, the two pipes acts as inlet and outlet pipe for the water to move in and out the engine block.\nBased on my calculation, you have upgraded your displacement from 135cc to whooping 195cc after installing this kit! That is an increase of 60 more centimeter cubic of fuel to burn.\nAnyway, my mechanic told me that there will some consequence that you need to consider. Your connecting rod will wear easily, engine will run hotter, fuel economy will get worse, clutch will slip and many more.\nAvailable at many motorcycle workshops in Malaysia.\n35 more pictures after the jump.\nItem are available for sale here: http://motomalaya.net/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=46\n\nAdvertisements",

Ambient 25-26°C; Track 37-39°C (Bridgestone measurement)\n                 \nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP’s put in one of the performances of his career to win his second race of the year at Argentina’s Autódromo Termas de Río Hondo ahead of Ducati Team’s Andrea Dovizioso and CWM LCR Honda’s Cal Crutchlow.\n\nStarting from the third row of the grid, Rossi worked his way through the field and showed excellent pace during the race – including setting a new Circuit Record Lap time on the twentieth lap – to chase down early race leader Marc Marquez who led the first twenty-three laps of the contest. On the penultimate lap, Rossi managed to pass Marquez for the race lead, with the Repsol Honda Team rider then crashing out while the two were challenging for position. Rossi would go on to win by 5.685 seconds from Dovizioso in second place, while a last-gasp pass by Crutchlow on Andrea Iannone ensured the British rider finished in third for his first podium with his new team.\n\n\nTrack temperatures at the start of today’s Argentina Grand Prix was 37°C, some 10°C lower than seen in qualifying yesterday. On perhaps the most demanding circuit for rear tyres, all but three riders selected the harder rear slick option available; extra-hard for the factory Honda and Yamaha riders, and hard for the rest of the field. The three exceptions were Honda riders Crutchlow, Marquez and Aoyama who selected the hard compound rear slick – the softer of their two options. Front tyre choice was more varied, although it was the hard compound front slick that was the most popular race choice, with fifteen of the twenty-five riders selecting this option, and the remaining ten riders opting for the medium front slick. All tyre options performed incredibly well with a new overall race time record and race lap record being set, while seventeen of the twenty-five riders were able to set their fastest lap in the second half of the race.\n\nAfter three rounds Rossi extends his lead in the championship to six points over Dovizioso in second place, while Andrea Iannone moves into third place in the standings twenty points behind his teammate.\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“This was another amazing race in what has been a thrilling season so far! Congratulations to Valentino and Yamaha on such an impressive victory, his pace in the second half of the race was outstanding. It was unfortunate to see Marc crash out, but we know that he never gives up and will be challenging for victory at the next round. We had another large and passionate crowd at Termas de Rio Hondo this year and undoubtedly the exciting race they witnessed will help boost their love for MotoGP even more. It was a successful weekend for Bridgestone as our new tyre allocation performed very well and we are looking forward to starting the European leg of the MotoGP season at Jerez in a couple of weeks’ time.”\n\nMasao Azuma – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“We were fortunate to have good conditions again today and apart from a few exceptions, the riders selected the same tyre combinations they used during race simulations yesterday. The lower temperatures did make choosing which rear tyre to use for the race difficult, particularly for the factory Honda and Yamaha riders. However, I am pleased with how all of our slick options performed at a circuit that is incredibly demanding on the rear tyre. Having so many riders setting their quickest lap of the race in the final stages is an indication of the consistent performance our new tyre allocation provided. In particular the debut of our new extra-hard specification rear slick was a satisfying result as it was the winning tyre and Rossi was able to set a new race record lap time on the twentieth lap of the race on this specification of tyre.”\n\nValentino Rossi, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP – Race Winner\n\n“I am sorry for the incident with Marc and I hope he is ok, but it was a great race and I am very happy to have won. I had good pace and although Marc was far ahead during the race, I saw he selected the hard rear tyre and so I had to concentrate and keep riding at one hundred percent to catch him.

        "Moto Malaya \n\nSIC looks to excite experienced and new fans alike with launch of the 2015 Formula 1 PETRONAS Malaysia Grand Prix™ that will be an F1 like never before \n\n\nPosted on February 12, 2015March 3, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe Sepang International Circuit (SIC) today unveiled its programme for the upcoming 2015 Formula 1 PETRONAS Malaysia Grand Prix™ taking place from 27 to 29 March 2015. Launched by the Mayor of Kuala Lumpur Datuk Seri Ahmad Phesal Talib, the programme aims to make the second round of the 2015 FIA Formula 1 World Championship a wholesome family affair this year. Also present were SIC Chairman Tan Sri Mokhzani Mahathir, PETRONAS Senior General Manager for Group Strategic Communications Liz Kamaruddin and SIC CEO Dato’ Razlan Razali.\n“In conjunction with the Malaysia Year of Festival 2015, we were inspired to make the F1 Grand Prix programme one that celebrates the position of the race as an event that is firmly embedded in the public consciousness. After 17 years, we firmly believe that many Malaysians look forward to the race, even if they only watch it at home or enjoy photo opportunities during our annual F1 Grand Prix roadshow. Indeed, we are focusing on the family-theme to draw them out of the living room into the high-octane atmosphere of the circuit itself. F1 fans no longer need to choose between quality family time on a weekend and watching the race. They can now enjoy an outing with their family and friends to Sepang on race weekend itself. The earlier start time of the race at 3pm, plus the earlier end for the after-race concert combined with affordable tickets further contribute to making the event attractive for all ages,” said Tan Sri Mokhzani. \nThis year’s programme – themed ‘Experience F1 Like Never Before’ transforms the circuit and the grounds into a huge entertainment space dubbed the ‘F1 Carnival’. It features family and child-friendly activities to encourage families to make the race their weekend outing. The carnival event happening within SIC’s premises during race weekend amplifies the family fiesta atmosphere, with many entertainment and off-track activities – expanding the F1 experience beyond the race. The carnival will have something for all members of the family, including a fun fair with games, amusement rides and other carnival-style attractions, and a food and beverage festival. While the children enjoy the kids and tween zone featuring a role play pit mock up, water obstacles and cool zone, men and women who enjoy adrenaline activities or shopping can spend time karting and drifting at the X-track or shop at the F1 Village.\n“As title sponsor, PETRONAS has played a significant role in putting Malaysia on the world Formula 1 map and attracting fans from across the globe, while contributing to the socio-economic development of the nation,” said PETRONAS Senior General Manager, Group Strategic Communications, Liz Kamaruddin.\nPETRONAS had over the years worked together with SIC, the local authorities and other partners to promote the Formula 1 PETRONAS Malaysia Grand Prix™ through a range of activities. The activities aim to bring Formula 1 closer to the people and to make the Malaysian leg of the Formula 1™ race a success.\nLiz added that last year’s Formula 1 PETRONAS Malaysia Grand Prix™ saw the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One™ Team top the podium, a position it maintained through 16 of 19 races over the 2014 World Formula One Championship season.\n“The achievement could not have come at a more significant time as we enter our 20th year of involvement in Formula 1 – a journey that has taken us beyond branding and into new business frontiers as well as extensive product research and development, taking our products from track to road,” continued Liz.\nThe launch event featured the unveiling of a new winner’s trophy* for the 2015 Formula 1 Petronas Malaysia Grand Prix™, crafted by Royal Selangor. It is the eighth trophy designed for the event by Royal Selangor since the race was first organised in 1999, and maintains the bold contemporary look of its predecessors.\nPromotional activities for the 2015 Formula 1 Petronas Malaysia Grand Prix™ are in full swing – from international promotions to domestic F1 Grand Prix roadshows featuring the MERCEDES AMG PETRONAS Formula One Team car – the F1 W06 Hybrid. In addition, the popular SIC Zoomers Roadshow is scheduled to visit at least 20 key venues around the country bringing great ticket promotions and exciting prizes. Locations will include popular malls and hypermarkets in line with the family theme.\nThis year, SIC’s exclusive Malaysia Grand Prix Gala 2015 will showcase The Jacksons as its main act, and this time, fans will be able to purchase tickets to watch the performance at the Plenary Hall, Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre on 26 March 2015. Race week will feature local support races including the Malaysia Championship Series (formerly known as Malaysian Super Series), autograph sessions with drivers, a public pit walk experience, the stunning opening ceremony performance and much more.\nFans of local motorsports will be thrilled with two support races – Round 1 of the Malaysia Championship Series (MCS) will be taking place from 27 to 29 March 2015 and the Malaysia leg of the TCR International Series on 29 March 2015. The MCS race was formerly part of the highly popular Malaysia Super Series Championship for Cars and Bikes, and will be held across 5 rounds this year – from March to November. Meanwhile, the TCR International Series, formerly the TC3 touring car series, is flagging off the first of its 2015 calendar’s 12 legs in Sepang. The exciting new series aims to restore the ‘Touring Car Pyramid’ concept of cars that can compete at national, regional and international levels.\nCommenting on the F1 engines, Tan Sri Mokhzani added: “It is also interesting to note that the quieter F1 turbo hybrid engine introduced last year is contributing to a more kid-friendly F1 race. The lower noise levels appear to be more conducive in attractive families, particularly those with younger children, to watch the race at the circuit. I have noticed that the younger children are more comfortable watching the race. Many of them used to find the noise level upsetting and did not enjoy their F1 experience. I think in the longer term, this can help in growing a new generation of F1 fans, and this is what SIC wants – being the race organisers.”\nThe race weekend will close on a high in Sepang with the after-race concert on 29 March 2015 headlined by iconic rock musician Lenny Kravitz. For the first time ever, all F1 Grand Prix ticket holders will be able to enjoy the concert at no extra charge. Additionally, ticketholders will get to enjoy selected activities and the F1 Carnival at no cost, plus be rewarded with One Ticket Unlimited benefits featuring discounts and promotions from various retail outlets and brands in Kuala Lumpur.\nTicket prices begin from RM80 – with tickets ranging from RM340 to RM1,770 for seats in the Main Grandstand, RM440 for the Tower, RM280 to RM660 for Grandstands F and K1, and RM80 to RM160 for Hillstand tickets.\nThe F1 tickets can be purchased:\n• online at SIC’s website\n• at the Sepang International Circuit ticket booth on the Ground Floor of the NU Sentral mall in the KL Sentral area\n• from a ticket agent – just check the location from SIC’s website – http://www.sepangcircuit.com/[email protected]\n• by calling the SIC TICKET HOTLINE at 03-8778 2222\nAdvertisements",

I asked the mechanic about it to know how good this tire is.\nThis MA-3D from Maxxis is better, IMHO compared to Duro HF-918 and Michelin during taking corners. This is due to the fact that it has the diamond shaped groove at the side of the tire. The grip of MA-3D is handled by this diamond shaped groove when the bike is slanted more than 45 degree. This gives riders more confident and lower attack angle. 60% of the center groove are designed for high speed riding with the usage of simple groove and a water channel groove in the middle for maximum speed in dry straight line. The groove also makes this tire a balanced characteristic during dry condition and works well through wet tracks.\nI was thinking how long the diamond-shaped would last since the groove is not deep enough to be abused all day, but in the end, for normal ride, we don’t usually ride more than 45 degree to the left or right unless we are doing 100km/h on the round-about. So, based on my opinion, it can last as long as the tire center groove before you need to replace it.\nIt is not that Duro HF-918 or Michelin is not good, but in terms of cornering, MA-3D is much better doing laps. Michelin is a high quality tire that is very good on dry and straight line, but riders needs to be careful when using it for taking corners during wet condition. The thread and groove of Michelin and Duro are simple and looks more like slick tires for high speed dry straight sprint.\n8 more pictures after jump\nAdvertisements",

Previously, I was notified by rumors that Y125ZR is going to be discontinued after the launched Ego LC, but luckily all that was pure rumors. There is no plan yet from HLYM to stop the production of the one of their big seller item. \nThe colour blue of this Y125ZR are rumored to the limited edition WGP 50th Anniversary edition, but as BLH Motor has stated, it is only a new colour for Y125ZR that is added to the choice if colours already available which is not limited edition like what we expected earlier.\nY125ZR in my humble opinion are the best 125cc 2-stroke moped ever made. It got the style and power in a perfect balance that comes with very low affordable price when compared to its competitor. It is fast and agile added with superlight construction makes it a bike true riders and racers choose.\nI’ll be writing more about this super moped after I got more pictures and more info about it.\nFor now, I feel like I want one.

        "390cc\n400cc\nKTM\nRC390\nreview \n\n2014 KTM RC390 Review – lightweight and track-ready -RM27,500 \n\n\nPosted on April 15, 2015April 15, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nSupersports is one of the popular bike category for so long. The category exudes speed and performance. This has been to the factor that supersports styling is the style used in professional racing namely in MotoGP and WSBK.\nThe particular supersports from KTM, the RC390, embodies the statement of speed and performance really well. It got all the packages to be a great supersports bike. Great chassis, great engine, high performance and of course great design.\n\nLooks\nKTM RC390 is an interesting bike in terms of design. When I see the concept first by KTM, it looks very sharp and carry the silhoutte of the KTM RC250GP which is being used in Moto3 racing series. What’s even better is that, the concept has been taken into the production with minimal changes in the overall design. It is still sharp, and most important, it is different than the rest of the supersports in its category. The iconic double front headlamp with double J LED fairing light is distinguishable from far to be a KTM. The rear lights also very interesting with a strong presence of the red light bar. This has to be one of my favourite rear light design so far. It looks different, creative and feels like it is designed by someone who knows bikes and love it very much.  \nEverywhere you look at this RC390, it always looking good. Looking at the side, shows you the nice orange Trellis frame. Looking of the front, shows you the sharp and radical headlight and windshield assembly. Looking at the back, of course, shows you the nice LED brake light cluster.\n\nThere is also the rear seat that hides as the rear cover. Well played KTM.\n\n6,000RPM is where the action start\nThe power of this RC390 comes from the usual single cylinder with 373.2cc liquid-cooled engine. Starting the engine gives you the harsh ramble, iconic of KTM engine. It vibrates and asks you to quickly ride it and rev it. Bore and stroke measures at 89mm x 60mm showing that this engine is a oversquare engine with larger bore than the stroke. A particular characteristic of this kind of oversquare engine is the ability to be rev high. As per testing, the RC390 comes to life after hitting the 6,000RPM and beyond. After starting the engine and learning the character of the engine, you’ll always want to keep the RPM counter above 6,000.\n\nGear shifts is accurate on the RC390 and very easy to initiate and this makes the bike easy to work by our command. One character of the transmission setup that I can felt here is that the bike have a high engine braking ability. Much harder than the Duke 390. This can good or bad depending on your preference. The hard engine braking gives you more control of the speed for corner entry, but you need to learn on how to predict the corner entry speed as the engine braking works.\nThe exhaust note is a little on the soft side with the creative mid-mounted muffler and sometimes, you hear more of the engine than the exhaust. This can be fixed with KTM Power Parts Akrapovic Slip-on muffler.\n\nBig brakes, big shocks\nSize does matter in braking and suspension. Knowing this, KTM has bring out the best from their stable; 43mm WP Upside Down front suspension and 300mm 4-piston front brake caliper. The 43mm WP USD suspension is the same size as the 1195cc RC8R suspension. Having the bigger size front suspension minimise the fatigue (fade) of the suspension when used for an extended duration of riding. Of course, it absorb well the bump and pot hole on the road, but what is more important that this setup enables it to eat the corners like hot knife through a butter. Easy, relaxed and predictable.\nThe combination of the big brakes and big shocks makes it one of the best handling bike for this category. Taking corners is effortless and very predictable. You can feel confident on it and really feel the sharp handling of this bike. The 300mm brakes works very well and being fitted with 4-piston radially mounted caliper, you can stop the bike with maximum confidence and minimal effort. It just great.\n\nRiding position\nComparing this RC390 to its sibling, Duke 390, the RC390 sits lower and your hand will reach further for the handle. This is expected from a supersports bike. On my experience, the first 30 minutes makes my back and arm a little bit in pain since the riding position is almost to racing style. After trying to adjust the riding position with few changes, the ride is fun. In fact, I was asked whether I want to use the Duke 390 for a 400km ride but no, I still want the enjoyment of premium supersports offered by the RC390. For me, the fun and enjoyment rewards is far bigger than the not-so-comfortable riding. You buy this because you want to enjoy the performance, not to be comfortable, right? Anyway, it is up to you whether you prefer the comfortable naked Duke 390 or the sportier RC390.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis is by far, the lightest, premium-packed and funnest >400cc 4-stroke supersports bike I’ve ever tried. Looks good, feels good and performs well. Top speed? 175km/h.\n2014 KTM RC390 price is RM27,500 (basic)\nAdvertisements",
        "250cc\nMT-25\nYamaha \n\n2015 Yamaha MT-25 Officially unveiled in Indonesia – Pure Street Naked Bike – Rp 46 million (RM12,917.39 direct conversion) \n\n\nPosted on June 7, 2015June 7, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Motor Indonesia has unveiled the world premiere of the muscular naked 250cc bike that is the Yamaha MT-25 with the tag line ‘Ini Penguasa Jalanan’. Said to be the pure street naked bike and we kind of agree with it since this bike is based on the same engine with the YZF-R25 which is one of the most powerful 2-cylinder 250cc available in the market right now.\n \nYamaha MT-25 is the 4th model from the MT or the ‘Dark’ series. We can see earlier there is the MT-09 3-cylinder beast, MT-07 2-cylinder bike and the beginner’s bike, the MT-125. The introduction of the MT-25 fits the lineup nicely and this means that the MT series can almost fit all the riders category in the naked segment.\nThe differences of the bike can be seen with the higher handlebar position that makes it is easier to reach without crouching forward. Naked bike is a bike where riders can take it to urban riding in the city where the handling for the traffic is more important that just outright speed. What surprises me is that the bike is having the same seat height as the YZF-R25, but this is then understood since the YZF-R25 is made as the ‘everyday superbike’. This means that the YZF-R25 is already low in the seat height position at 780mm (for comparison, KTM RC390 seat height is 820mm).\nThe one in silver blue is nice with the exposed blue-colored frame that adds the aggressiveness style to the bike. There are 3 colours that is available that is the Silver Blue, Red Rage and Black Strike.\nThe 2015 Yamaha MT-25 is priced at Rp 46 million OTR (or RM12917.39 direct conversion). It is NOT available in Malaysia… yet…\nSpesifikasi MT-25 : (via: http://www.yamaha-motor.co.id/newsdetail/archive/2015/june/article/yamaha-mt-25-ini-jalan-penguasa-pure-street-naked-bike-top-of-maneuverability.html)\nDimensi\nP x L x T : 2.090 mm x 745 mm x 1.035 mm\nJarak sumbu roda : 1.380 mm\nJarak terendah ke tanah : 160 mm\nTinggi tempat duduk : 780 mm\nBerat Isi : 165 Kg\nKapasitas tangki besin : 14 L\n \nMesin\nTipe mesin : 4 langkah berpendingin cairan, DOHC\nJumlah/posisi silinder : 2 silinder/tegak\nDiameter x Langkah : 60,0 x 44,1 mm\nPerbandingan kompresi : 11,6 : 1\nDaya maksimum : 26,5 kW (35.5hp)/12.000 rpm\nTorsi maksimum : 22,6 Nm/10.000 rpm\nSistem starter : elektrik starter\nSistem pelumasan : basah\nKapasitas oli mesin : total = 2,40L : berkala = 1,80L ; ganti filter oli = 2,10L\nSistem bahan bakar : Fuel Injection\nTipe kopling : basah, kopling manual, multiplat\nPola pengoperasian transmisi : 1-N-2-3-4-5-6\n \nRangka\nTipe rangka : diamond\nSuspensi depan : teleskopik\nSuspensi belakang : swing arm\nBan depan : 110/70-17M/C (54S)\nBan belakang : 140/70-17 M/C (66S)\nRem depan : single disc brake\nRem belakang : single disc brake\n \nKelistrikan   \nSistem pengapian : TCl\nBattery : GTZ8V\nTipe busi : NGK/CR9E\nvia: Yamaha Motor Indonesia\nAdvertisements",

How I wish Proton never sell this marquee. There are many handovers after Proton has sold it to GEVI SpA and now, it is own by Harley-Davidson of USA.\nMV Agusta , with their tagline ‘Motorcycle Art’ really integrates what is being defined as the intersection of technology and art blended together. I like how the three-muffler exhaust comes out on the right side of the bike finished in the same colour as the wheel. This is different that what I always see in most superbikes; underseat or just plain cylindrical(or trioval) muffler.\nThe elegant three-muffler in gold\nThe wheel itself is the stylish and have proper look for a superbike that speaks lightweight and power. The attention to details that the engineers have put in the design of this bike are pure passion and pure Italian.\nThe diamond-like headlamp makes it noticeable with just a glance, but you might mistaken it for F4. F3 as opposed to F4, is the 3-cylinder engine which is more compact than the 4-cylinder engine of F4. For 3-cylinder engine, the F3 got 675cc of displacement compare to F4 at 1000cc. The real advantage of 3-cylinder is the compactness that makes is narrower and lighter, therefore handling, acceleration and stopping should be better. The overall look of the F3 compliment each other and adds each other parts strength in looks. I have heard an engineer said that ‘if it looks good, it should performs as good as it looks, but first, it needs to looks good’.

        "agv\nhelmet\nK-3 SV\nparts \n\n2014 AGV K-3 SV full-face helmet – built in sun visor – estimated RM1,000 \n\n\nPosted on February 12, 2014February 12, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n \nAGV has updated their K-3 base model to this 2014 model, the K-3 SV. SV stands for Sun Visor (thanks user rihuhs for telling me this) and as you can see there is the sun visor inside the helmet. Before this, the popular helmet from AGV that have sun visor is the AGV Stealth SV, but that one is not easy to find in Malaysia.\nHaving the sun visor is a good thing in Malaysia since it can prevent the scorching hot sun blinding you from the road. Based on the JPJ regulation, it is illegal to use a dark or reflective tint visor, so, you can avoid it by using the clear visor on the outside and the darker sun visor on the inside.\nI think this K-3 SV is still not available in Malaysia as I checked in mudah. Maybe it will come in few more months and the price of RM1,000 is just the estimation on the current AGV K-3 without the SV is at RM750.\nAlso check out the official info from AGV after the jump:  \n\nThe K-3 SV was developed from the experience AGV gained during the design process of the Pista GP and Corsa helmets. Thanks to the use of Finite Element Analysis (FEM), the technical department developed a benchmark product in terms of comfort, aerodynamics and safety. This helmet has a wide appeal and is suitable for young riders with a passion for racing as well as for more mature riders looking for comfort and high performance characteristics.\nThanks to CFD Analysis (Computational fluid dynamics), the special ventilation system provides maximum airflow to the head through two front and side vents, one central vent and two extractors at the back of the helmet.\nThe sanitized Dry-Comfort internal components can be removed for washing. The mechanism for opening and closing the visor has three customisable settings according to helmet use (Touring, Race and City) and features the XQRS system for quick removal.\nThe K-3 SV has been designed to accept the new integrated communication platform SHARE.\n\n– 2 sizes of HIR-TH shell (High Resistance Thermoplastic Resin)\n– Inner shell in EPS in 4 sizes; shell and EPS dimensions optimised using the FEM (Finite Elements Analysis) system\n– Homologation: ECE 2205, DOT, JIS, NBR, AS/NZS\n– Ventilation system designed and optimised in a wind tunnel, comprising 4 front vents (3 at the front and one on the chin guard) and 2 rear extractors\n– XQRS (X-tra Quick Release System) visor mechanism for tool-free removal and replacement of the visor in seconds\n– Visor mechanism with PVS system (Perimetrical Visor Seal) for improved seal and protection against draughts and noise thanks to the seat for the visor edge\n– GT 2 scratch-resistant, anti-fog polycarbonate visor with 100% protection from UV rays\n– Integrated removable Sun Visor (ISV) with scratch-resistant visor with tool-free replacement system\n– Removable breath deflector\n– Removable windproof chin strap protection\n– Fully removable and washable 3D inner liners\n– Sanitised Dry-Comfort fabrics\n– Micrometrically adjustable strap retention system\n– Anti-theft ring on strap\n– Sizes XS- S- MS- ML – L- XL – XXL\n\nAdvertisements",
        "250cc\nHonda\nnsr\nnsr250 \n\nNSR-World.com: The Ultimate Honda NSR Guide \n\n\nPosted on May 24, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nAfter digging on the net for more information about Honda NSR, I’ve found this NSR World website that tells a lot of story about it. The information there are indeed priceless and the history there are well written.\nLet me show you one of its story about 1994 Honda NSR250R MC28. Below is the excerpt taken from NSR World.\n\n1994~ NSR250R MC28\nIn November 1993 the first MC28 went on sale. The styling was only subtly changed, with the seat unit and nose fairing mimicing the factory NSR500 and NSR250 respectively. There was one major styling difference though… the Pro-Arm rear swingarm. This swingarm, originally designed and used on the RC30 for endurance racing, was the last word in styling!\n\nNSR250SE MC28  \nThe MC28 was also the first and only Honda to utilise the PGMIV, activated by the much hyped “Smart Card”, a device initially marketed as the ultimate tool in engine management! The idea was to be able to use several different cards, each with their own ignition characteristics, for any given track or weather condition. It was also the first production bike to sport a digital display. In reality however, the PGM-IV only served as a clever restriction aid introduced by Honda to comply with Japans ever increasing clampdown on power output and licensing laws. In fact, the PGM-IV makes the MC28 the costliest and hardest of the NSR’s to derestrict.\nAlthough up on weight and down on power, the MC28 still remained the ultimate 2 stroke race-rep’, with only Suzuki’s 1996 RGV250R VJ23 trying to keep pace with the NSR’s ultra high specification.\nThroughout its years (1994-1999) the MC28 remained virtually unchanged mechanically, and all three standard models were still available; the R, the SE, and the SP. The 1994 SP was again released in Rothmans colours, with a limited run of 1500 bikes, and in 1995 another 1500 limited edition SP’s were released in HRC Racing Colours.\nIn 1996 the R model was discontinued, and only the SE and SP were sold. Only 1000 SP’s were built, and were painted in Repsol colours to commemorate Mick Doohan again winning the World GP championship title.\n\nNSR250SP Repsol Special Edition\nIn 2000 Jha were the only company consistently supporting the NSR250. They bought the majority of remaining bikes and would sell them in any guise from stock to full race, including ram-air, light weight race bodywork, and titanium expansion chambers.\n\nSadly, in 2001 after correspondence with Jha, we were informed that there was no longer a stock of “new” bikes at their workshops, and although still supplying a wide range of spares and performance products, complete machines were no longer available, and in 2007 Jha eventually ceased trading.\n   \nSpecial thanks to Jha for the updated pictures of their race bike and their continued support over the years. Jha have now sadly ceased trading, which is a crying shame not only for the NSR owner, but for anyone competitively running a competition 2-stroke road/road-race bike, as their products were simply unrivalled in the marketplace and on the circuit.\nCheck out the original link here: http://nsr-world.com\n\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nmotogp \n\nRound 7 Catalunya MotoGP: Marquez conquers the Catalan Grand Prix to maintain perfect win record – Rossi 2nd, Pedrosa 3rd \n\n\nPosted on June 16, 2014June 16, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nAs dark clouds loomed over Montmeló, Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez weathered a storm of challenges from his MotoGP™ rivals to win his seventh race from seven starts in 2014.\nThe rain that threatened to fall over the Spanish circuit failed to eventuate, allowing the riders to compete at a ferocious pace on slick tyres resulting in today’s Catalan Grand Prix being completed in record time, beating the old mark by over five seconds. The electric pace also created one of the most exciting race finales in recent history as Marquez, his teammate Dani Pedrosa, and Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi all battled for victory.\nIt was Marquez who ultimately prevailed from the three-way fight for the lead. He survived a late attack from Pedrosa on turn ten of the final lap which saw the riders touch, and went on to win the race from Rossi by 0.512 seconds. Pedrosa’s last gasp move on Marquez saw him run wide, but he recovered to claim third place, finishing just over a second behind Rossi. On his way to victory, Marquez set a time of 1’42.182 on the second lap of the race to break the six-year-old race lap record at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.  \nWidespread cloud cover and fresh winds brought a cool change, with the peak track temperature recorded today being 40°C; 14°C less than recorded during yesterday’s Free Practice 4 session. Despite the significant change in temperatures, the cooler weather didn’t have a major effect on race tyre choice, as riders still used the slick options they preferred in yesterday’s hotter conditions. All riders except for Stefan Bradl selected the medium compound front slick, with the German rider opting for the hard compound front. For the rear tyre, thirteen of the twenty-four starters selected the medium compound rear slick, with the remaining eleven riders selecting the soft compound rear slick. No riders chose to use the hard compound rear slick for the Catalan Grand Prix. Tyre performance at what is the one of the most gruelling events on the calendar for tyres was exceptional, with the top four finishers completing the race under the existing overall race time record.\nMarquez moves to 175 championship points and extends his lead over second-placed Rossi to fifty-eight points. Pedrosa remains in third place on the championship table, and just five points behind Rossi in the standings.\nShinichi Yamashita – General Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“What an excellent race! Congratulations to Marc and Repsol Honda on their seventh victory this year, not to mention Honda’s one-hundredth win in the modern MotoGP era. Well done also to Valentino and Dani for making the podium and pushing Marc all the way to the chequered flag. We had much cooler conditions today but this didn’t change the riders’ minds on which tyre combination to use for the race. This circuit has quite a low grip level so I am very pleased with how our tyres performed in the race, with a new Circuit Record Lap being set by Marquez and the top four riders able to complete the race quicker than the existing overall race time record. I am proud that Bridgestone was involved in such a fantastic race here in Catalunya, but now our attention turns to this week’s MotoGP tests at Montmeló and Aragon, as we continue to test new tyre developments in our quest to give riders even higher levels of safety and performance.”\nMarc Marquez – Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“Today was more difficult than the last race at Mugello as the Yamaha riders had strong pace at the beginning of the race. I made a mistake chasing Valentino when braking into turn one, which cost me around a second, but after that I was able to catch him again and we had a nice battle. In front of the crowd here at my home circuit it was really special to fight the last few laps with Valentino and Dani, but the most important thing was we were able to get the victory and the twenty-five points for the championship.”\nCatalan MotoGP™ Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\nRepsol Honda Team\n42’56.914\n\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\nValentino ROSSI\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n42’57.426\n0.512\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\nDani PEDROSA\nRepsol Honda Team\n42’58.748\n1.834\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nJorge LORENZO\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n43’01.454\n4.540\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\nStefan BRADL\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n43’08.062\n11.148\nHard\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\nNGM Forward Racing\n43’11.127\n14.213\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\nPol ESPARGARO\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n43’13.041\n16.127\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\nDucati Team\n43’13.089\n16.175\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\nAndrea IANNONE\nPramac Racing\n43’14.954\n18.040\nMedium\nSoft\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nBradley SMITH\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n43’21.695\n24.781\nMedium\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n \n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

With a compact new chassis and high-torque 3-cylinder engine, this new generation performance machine is designed for riders who appreciate character and soul.\nThe beating heart of this new kind of animal is a lightweight 850cc 3-cylinder engine that kicks out a wide band of raw, linear torque giving outstanding acceleration that gets your adrenaline flowing.\nAnd for agile handling this dynamic new naked motard-style bike is equipped with a compact aluminium chassis and upright riding position that make light work of everything – from weekday urban riding through to Sunday morning blasts.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompact and lightweight 850cc 3-cylinder engine\nTo keep the MT-09 as light, slim and compact as possible, our designers have developed an all-new CF aluminium die-cast frame. Its low weight and excellent rigidity balance contribute towards the bike’s agile handling performance, and help to keep the overall wet weight down to just 188kg.\nMonocross suspension with asymmetric CF die-cast swingarm\nThe rear end features a lightweight asymmetric CF die-cast swingarm that gives a low unsprung weight for responsive suspension action and a comfortable ride. An almost horizontal rear shock is situated beneath the seat, and the externally mounted swingarm pivots keep the chassis slim for a compact riding position.\nStress-free ergonomics and a ‘slim-fit’ riding position\nThe new MT-09 is designed to handle a variety of roles, from sport riding through to weekend trips and the daily ride to work.

With the firm’s standard stolen vehicle process enabled, tracking of the Ducati commenced with a team dispatched from Bike Trac’s headquarters to assess the initial tracked location in London.\nBike Trac’s Bill Taylor picked up the story,“SOC quickly tracked the bike to a known location not far away in London, but due to this area being densely populated, local police could not offer us a search warrant even with our Radio Frequency technology showing a strong signal. From this point on we had to wait, but several hours later the Bike Trac unit showed the Ducati was on the move again and unfortunately crossed the English Channel before UK police could reach it.  \n\n“From then on, we used a mixture of GPS signal and triangulation of sim masts across Europe to keep track of its movements. The difficulty was that we had no knowledge of what vehicle the stolen Ducati was travelling in, but nevertheless we still managed to track the signal across six countries. By Poland we had a team waiting at a major border crossing, but the thieves chose an alternative route and so the chase continued.” \nWith the bike now in Lithuania, the Bike Trac team in the UK stayed up through Tuesday night, keeping track of the bike as it continued its journey east, before the bike came to a prolonged stop in the town of Vilnius.\n“By Wednesday morning we were able to establish a solid fixed signal” continued Taylor, “so we were confident that the Ducati had reached the thief’s chosen final destination. With the help of Interpol, local Lithuanian authorities swooped in and within an hour we had confirmation of the bike’s safe recovery.”\nWith the bike safely in the hands of Lithuanian police, as well as some suspects arrested too, Bike Trac’s longest ever live track came to a successful end.\nSue Hitchmough, General Manager for Bike Trac parent company Road Angel Group, commented, “To recover a stolen motorcycle over 1,000 miles away is no better example of the effectiveness of tracking technology. This is naturally a huge success for us, but it’s also a great example to everyone that tracking really does work. I’d like to personally thank everyone involved in this recovery from our team at HQ to Interpol and to the Lithuanian authorities. It’s very pleasing to know so many people want to stamp out bike theft.”\nWith the recovery so fresh, Bike Trac expect to make a further, more detailed announcement on this recovery in the coming weeks.\nMore about Bike Trac:\nFor just £299.99 inc VAT* a Bike Trac unit really can offer an owner complete peace of mind. But unlike other units available, Bike Trac also offers handy additional functions too, so it’s not just a security device that works if the unthinkable happens. Bike Trac offers a handy 24/7 web portal where owners can log-in to see the exact whereabouts of their bike, check its battery voltage, review recent journeys and even set their very own Geo Fence too. On top of this Bike Trac also offers ‘Bike Down’ – a great safety feature for lone riders that will notify a next of kin via text should the bike go over an 68-degree lean angle with the ignition switched on. (* additional annual subscription required, but unlike some other units includes all text costs`).\n\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nWSBK \n\nPATA Honda’s 2015 WSBK Riders Presented In Italy – Guintoli and van der Mark \n\n\nPosted on January 28, 2015January 28, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe Pata Honda line-up for the 2015 World Superbike championship was officially unveiled at Verona in Italy today when Sylvain Guintoli and Michael van der Mark were presented to a large and enthusiastic crowd of Italian fans and media.\nThe two riders – both world champions in 2014 – have already tested their 2015-specification Pata Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP race machines this year at Portimao, Portugal and, earlier this week, at Aragon in Spain.\nIn spite of less-than-favourable weather conditions, both riders declared themselves happy with the development of the CBR, on which their Netherlands-based team has worked hard to meet revised technical regulations for the 2015 WSBK season.  \nReigning World Superbike champion, Guintoli, 32, and his 22-year-old Pata Honda team-mate, van der Mark, who won last season’s World Supersport crown, will return to Spain tomorrow for a two-day test at Jerez on Monday and Tuesday next week.\nThe forthcoming season marks the third in which Pata, one of Europe’s largest and most successful manufacturers of potato chips and snacks, has supported Honda’s official entry in the World Superbike championship. Pata president, Remo Gobbi, a passionate follower of motorsport on two and four wheels, was alongside both Pata Honda World Superbike riders when the covers came of their CBR machines on Saturday afternoon.\nSylvain Guintoli\nBringing the number one plate to a new manufacturer is a big deal, really, because it doesn’t happen very often. It’s symbolic for me, too, because I’ll be going for the title again on a different bike, the Honda CBR. I’ll definitely be wearing the number one with pride this year. But I’m motivated by the challenge and I’ve found a team that also wants it really badly. The bike has changed quite a bit over the winter and we have new regulations. The team has worked hard and we know it’s going to be a big challenge, but that’s what makes it interesting! The 2015 engine is quite close to last year’s specification and, if anything, is a bit smoother, which is good news for us because, built as standard, it suits the new rules. We’re still working on a few things li ke weight distribution and geometry but the bike is already quite different to last year. I’m very pleased with the work that has been done over the winter. There is still more work to be done, but the team is a big asset; you can feel the power of Honda, and it feels good.\nMichael van der Mark\nI’m in the same team as last year but, after winning the World Supersport title, I had to make another step and, for me, that was World Superbike. It’s maybe a little easier for me because I have the same team, but I still have to get used to the bigger CBR and its more sophisticated electronics and find a good set-up. I think the biggest challenge for me and everyone is the new regulations. At the moment the bike feels really good but we’ll have to see where it is after the first few races. I have to learn a lot, of course, but I don’t put any pressure on myself – I just want to do my best, make forward steps and see where we can get to. The weather hasn’t been great at the two tests we’ve had this year but my feeling with the CBR is much better than my first outing at Jerez. To gether with Sylvain, I think we have a great team. He brings a lot of experience as last year’s world champion, but I think we can learn from each other and that’s what we’ve been doing in the tests.\nRonald ten Kate\nOur rider line-up is very good on paper with two world champions on the Honda CBR Fireblade. I think that would be unique for any team but certainly for us. There’s a lot of knowledge and experience that Syvlain is bringing to the team – he’s been on a lot of different bikes in different paddocks. On the other side, Michael has stepped up to Superbike and he’s the young gun. Apart from a few outings at Suzuka, he has no experience on the big bikes, so when you put those guys in the blender I think we’ve got the perfect team. You can already smell, feel, sense that something great is coming up.\nCarlo Fiorani\nThe 2015 season has already started very well as we are the only team with two world champions in our garage – one from Superbike and the other from Supersport. Of course, our plan was to have a very experienced rider and a young rider with very good prospects. Our expectation is to have good results with Sylvain and, after a few races, to see Michael fighting in the top six. We want him to grow with the team and be ready to challenge for the title in 2016. The team has worked really hard with the new regulations but the CBR was already quite production-oriented. After the first tests we are quite satisfied and we expect Honda to be fighting for the podium once again.\nAdvertisements",

Namun begitu, model sedia ada seperti Yamaha RX-Z dan Yamaha 125Z masih lagi dibenarkan untuk dijual dan pengenalan pada model 2 lejang terbaru berakhir disitu.\nPada pendapat saya, motosikal 2 lejang ini tidaklah begitu mencemarkan alam sekitar, tetapi cukup mencemar bunyi sekiranya diubahsuai tidak tentu hala untuk peningkatan prestasi dipacu atas jalan raya awam.\nKuasa yang dibawa oleh motosikal 2 lejang adalah melebihi 40% berbanding isipadu silinder yang sama pada motosikal 4 lejang. Motosikal dua lejang juga mempunyai susun atur enjin yang agak mudah kerana tidak memerlukan OHC dan injap.\nPenggunaan minyak pelincir 2T merupakan faktor tidak ekonomi pada motosikal jenis ini, tetapi ini tidak menjadi masalah sekiranya dibandingkan dengan kepuasan memandu dengan kuasa yang mudah dilepaskan sekiranya perlu.\nAsap tidak menjadi masalah sekiranya langkah untuk mengatasinya diambil.

        "motogp \n\nMarquez Makes History, Pedrosa Second at COTA \n\n\nPosted on April 23, 2013April 24, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nMarc Marquez #93 and Dani Pedrosa #26\nMarc Marquez (Repsol Honda RC213V) made history in today’s Grand Prix of the Americas outside Austin, Texas, by becoming the youngest-ever winner of a premier-class Grand Prix. The 20-year-old rode a magnificent race to beat team-mate Dani Pedrosa (Repsol Honda RC213V) by less than two seconds.\n\nThe Repsol Honda pair have dominated proceedings since the MotoGP circus arrived at the superb new Circuit of the Americas venue, doing a one-two in practice and qualifying, when Marquez became the youngest rider to score a premier-class pole position.\nMarquez has taken both records from another sublimely talented Honda rider, American Freddie Spencer, who achieved his first pole at Jarama, Spain, in May 1982 and his first win at Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium, in July the same year. On that day Spencer was 20 years and 196 days old. Today Marquez – who achieves such dizzying angles of lean that he scrapes his elbows on the tarmac as a matter of course – is 20 years and 64 days old.\nThe duo played a tense game of cat and mouse on their RC213Vs throughout the 21 laps, Pedrosa grabbing the lead after Marquez ran wide at the first corner. The positions stayed that way for the first 12 laps, Marquez happy to wait behind his more experienced team-mate. Finally, on lap 13 he dived ahead at Turn Seven. Pedrosa did not give up and was on the new leader’s rear wheel for the next few laps, until he made a mistake on lap 19. That lost him a second, putting him 1.6 seconds down, but still he did not give up, closing the gap to 1.2 seconds as they began the final lap. That was too much of a disadvantage, however, and Pedrosa realised he had to be content with second today. The pair crossed the line 1.534 seconds apart.\nMarquez’s historic victory didn’t just rewrite the record books, it also moved the former 125 World Champion and reigning Moto2 World Champion into the joint lead of the 2013 MotoGP World Championship, with reigning champ Jorge Lorenzo (Yamaha). Spencer still holds the record for being the youngest premier-class World Champion, but for how much longer?\nStefan Bradl (LCR Honda RC213V) had a strong ride to fifth on his RCV, making amends for his tumble in the season-opening Qatar Grand Prix. The German had a busy first few laps, running second for the first few corners, then battling back and forth with Cal Crutchlow (Yamaha) who finished behind final podium finisher Lorenzo. Eventually Bradl settled into a lonely fifth position, setting a good pace aboard his RC213V.\nAlvaro Bautista (Team GO&FUN Honda Gresini RC213V) had to fight hard for his eighth-place result, first with Valentino Rossi (Yamaha) and then with another factory rider, Andrea Dovizioso (Ducati). He might have beaten the Italian but for an error at the final corner.\nBryan Staring (GO&FUN Honda Gresini FTR Honda) came home 20th aboard his CBR1000RR-powered CRT bike, happy to have scored his first MotoGP finish after sliding off in Qatar. During the race he was able to learn plenty from other more experienced riders that will help him improve in the future.\nNicolas Terol (Mapfre Aspar Team Moto2 Suter) scored a runaway maiden Moto2 victory today, the former 125 World Champion taking the lead in the early stages and never relinquishing it.\nSome way behind him a thrilling three-way contest developed for second place. Esteve Rabat (Tuenti HP 40 Pons Kalex) won the battle, coming from ninth on the first lap to grab the runner-up spot at the final corner where Mika Kallio (Marc VDS Racing Team Kalex) made a mistake. Dominique Aegerter (Technomag carXpert Suter) crossed the line just behind Kallio after making contact with the Finn a few corners from the finish and almost falling.\nScott Redding (Marc VDS Racing Team Kalex) started from pole for the first time in his career and led the race until Terol assumed control. The lanky Briton lacked top speed against his rivals and lost several positions on COTA’s back straight, the longest in MotoGP. He eventually crossed the line all alone in fifth position. The result, following his second-place finish in Qatar, puts him in the World Championship lead for the first time.\nJohann Zarco (Came Ioda Racing Project Suter) came through strongly to finish sixth, beating Anthony West (QMMF Racing Team Speed Up) on the final lap. Mattia Pasini (NGM Mobile Racing Speed Up), Alex De Angelis ((NGM Mobile Forward Racing Speed Up) and Toni Elias (Blusens Avintia Kalex) completed the top ten.\nQatar winner Pol Espargaro (Tuenti HP40 Pons Kalex) crashed out as he charged through the pack after starting from the third row.\nThe Moto3 race was stopped and restarted after Jasper Iwema (KTM) crashed heavily and was knocked unconscious. The Dutch rider was concussed and bruised in the accident, but is otherwise okay.\nThe five-lap restart was won by Alex Rins who had dominated the original race. He came out on top of a final-corner duel with Luis Salom, who was passed on the run to the line by Maverick Vinales. All three rode KTMs.\nJack Miller (Caretta Technology – RTG FTR Honda) rode a brilliant race to finish sixth and top Honda, just a few tenths off fifth place. The young Australian made up in the corners what he lost on the straights to finish 8.6 seconds behind the winner.\nAfter a terrible start in the first race, Alexis Masbou (Ongetta-Rivacold FTR Honda) was grateful for the restart, in which he got away much faster and worked his way through the pack to finish eighth.\nBrad Binder (Ambrogio Racing Suter Honda) crossed the line ninth, just two tenths behind Masbou. The South African now heads to next month’s Spanish Grand Prix as the top-placed Honda in the World Championship.\nDanny Webb (Ambrogio Racing Suter Honda) finished 11th, with Isaac Vinales (Bimbo Ongetta-Centro Seta FTR Honda) ending up 13th.\nThe MotoGP World Championship now returns to its European heartland for the first of a series of six races on the Continent, commencing with the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez on May 5.\nAdvertisements",
        "125cc\ncagiva\ncagiva mito \n\nCagiva Mito 125 Review at NST \n\n\nPosted on February 17, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\n2006 Cagiva Mito 125 from topspeed.net\nAnother great legend in 125cc category that is the Cagiva Mito 125. It has special model in Malaysia that is the Fauzy’s Edition. Mito 125 is the direct arch rival to the Aprilia RS125. Mito 125 is actually the first bike rode by Rossi.\nRead the review of this Cagiva Mito 125 from Arman Ahmad, News Strait Times after the jump\nSPEAKING of myths, this is like David vs Goliath. ARMAN AHMAD slingshots\nabout in the Cagiva Mito.\n\nMY ears are ringing. I’ve been riding for about half an hour in the sun\n– but I’m not even sweating. It’s midday, and I’m zipping through traffic\nat insane speeds on a Saturday wearing just my full face helmet, a thin\nT-shirt and a pair of jeans.\nSome people sitting in the cars I overtake are probably thinking I’m\ncrazy. Other motorists will probably think I’m just a regular hooligan.\nExcept the fast, loud little two-stroke machine that I’m riding is no\nregular rempit machine – it’s the legendary Cagiva Mito 125.\nMy ears are ringing because the din from its two-stroke racederived\nengine is barely muffled by the exhaust. My back hurts because the\nrace-inspired seating is cramping my style. As I flick through the gears\nand work the clutch, the hot sun is biting into my exposed arms but I\ncouldn’t care less.\nI rev the bike’s engine past 7,000 rpm and go screaming into a\nroundabout. An elderly Chinese aunt frowns at me as she watches me corner\nat an insane angle. But she and her Honda City are soon mere dots in the\nbike’s rear view mirror.\nYou may wonder why I’m displaying such foolish bravado. No, I haven’t\nbeen experimenting with hallucinogens.\nI just picked up the bike from Mofaz the day before, and I have been\nriding since morning. I’m hooked.\nThe buzzsaw engine doesn’t produce much power but the bike weighs a\nmere 129kg. Acceleration is nothing to shout about. It’s probably as fast\nas a Proton Saga.\n\nHowever, the bike has razor sharp handling. It changes direction at the\nflick of your wrist. Who cares about power anyway when you don’t have to\nbrake?\nOnce you climb on the seat – you get a race-like view of the road\nahead. The meter is simple and uncluttered, with a steering damper\nsituated under it.\nDespite the sluggish acceleration, the bike’s top speed is acceptable –\nsomewhere in the region of 180km/h. But it would be hard to travel long\ndistances on the bike. It’s better suited to short distances in the city.\nIn short, the Mito won’t be challenging any Ducatis but it’s a lot of\nfun to ride. It would be well suited to beginner riders – even women\nriders. Just think of it as “My first Ducati”.\nIt is incredibly beautiful. When I was testing it, I was surprised to\nfind the red Mito attracting so much attention. I’ve ridden bikes five\ntimes the price and 10 times the capacity but they didn’t attract as much\nattention as the little Mito.\nThe mere mention of the name Mito may conjure up some memories for old\nschool bikers. In Italian, mito means myth or legend.\nThe bike was first introduced in 1990 as the Cagiva Mito Lawson to\ncommemorate Cagiva’s GP 500 victories by motorcycle racing legend Eddie\nLawson.\nWhen it first came to Malaysia, it caused a sensation with its\nupside-down forks, Brembo brakes and beautiful Italian styling.\nIf my memory serves me correctly, it sold here for about RM15,000,\npretty affordable for any exotic Italian brand that was affiliated with\nDucati.\n\nOver the years, the Mito gained a somewhat cult status in Malaysia,\nwith die-hard fans braving spare part shortages to maintain their bikes\nin working condition.\nIn 1994, the Mito was restyled in Italy by Massimo Tamburini, the same\nguy who drew up the design for the Ducati 916.\nIn fact, if you parked both bikes side by side, only a few details\nwould differentiate the 900cc superbike and its 125cc sibling.\nAlthough the fairing had been changed, most of the innards were still\nthe same crazy two-stroker that caused a sensation in the early 90s.\nNeedless to say, when the bike was introduced here as the Mito EV\n(evolution), it was an immediate hit.\nThat was 13 years ago.\nIt has been a while since the Mito was imported to Malaysia. However,\nMofaz is bringing in a final batch of some 300 bikes.\nAccording to them, the bike will be the last batch to be produced with\nthe two-stroke 125cc engine.\n\nThere are rumours that Cagiva will produce a 500cc singlecyclinder Mito\nwith a Husqvarna engine but nothing has yet been confirmed.\nThe Momos version of the Mito sells for RM19,244.50 on the road. If you\nwant to own this unique piece of motorcycle history, give Muzisham from\nMofaz a call at 019-6318-173.\nAdvertisements",

The design can be a full turnaround of the usual Suzuki single headlight design. One bikes that comes to my mind is the Honda RCV-213S that have almost the same headlight. Yet, it is fresh to see a design like this from Suzuki.  \nSuzuki GSX-R250 could be a great 250cc supersports competitor in the market. Before this, Suzuki has been quite with the release of the Suzuki Inazuma in select market like Indonesia and China. Maybe the GSX-R250 can share the same engine but with different tuning. Some says the rumored output of this Gixxer is 37.2hp which is really hopeful. The highest 4-stroke 250cc bike for this era as far as I remember is Yamaha YZF-R25 35.5hp.\nSo far, Young Machine has been correct in predicting the upcoming like the scoop of the YZF-R25 some time ago.\nI’m hoping Suzuki will jump to the bandwagon and fight Honda, Kawasaki and Yamaha in the competitive segment of 250cc 4-stroke supersports category.\nSource: Pics send by Izzamir, also noted from tmcblog.com\nAdvertisements",

In early 50s, after the World War II, many machines with high precision that has been used for making aircraft like propellers for the Imperial Navy fleet such as the A6M-Zero war plane which is the one used in kamikaze attack at Pearl Harbour.\nA6M3 Zero War Plane\nThe YA-1 is equipped with 2-stroke engine and 125cc of displacement. YA-1 is strongly inspired by the design of German’s bike that is DKW RT125. Many bikes actually inspired by the DKW RT125 bikes like the BSA Bantam (Britain), M1A Moskwa (Russia) and WHM SHL125 or Sokol 125 (Poland). It is said that DKW RT125 is the most copied bike.  \nYokosuko K5Y a.k.a aka-tombo\nYA-1 is nicknamed aka-tombo or “Red Dragonfly”, like the colour of the Yokosuko airplane that it resembles when it enter the race Mount Fuji Ascent Race and Asama Highlands in 1955. It place 3rd in Mt. Fuji and 1st in Asama. Yamaha has established it name with reliable and well-built machine. I personally think, it still carries this quality up to this day.\nDKW RT125\nThe second machine with 175cc named YC-1 has been produced later in 1956 after the racing success.\n1956 Yamaha YC-1\nYA-1 is made for elite customer since the price is high compare to the one made by Honda which is much more simple and cheaper, but Honda came to the industry 3 years later in 1958 with the introduction of Honda Super Cub. Earlier than that in 1952, Honda only make a clip-on engine to be fitted to bicycle named Honda Cub F.\nWith this kind of history of 2-stroke engine, it is no wonder why Yamaha able to produce some of the greatest 2-stroke engine bike like the popular Y125Z, RX-Z 135, TZM150 and TZR 250.\nMore information here:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_YA-1\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Super_Cub\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Cub_F\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A6M_Zero\nhttp://www.motorcycle.in.th/article.php/Teruo-Okada\nAdvertisements",

The compressed air bike works the same way, the differences is that the highly compressed (pressurized) inside the chamber that expands to a lower pressure air and move the parts inside the engine.  \n\nThe diagram above shows it works, but after looking at it for few minutes, I still can’t get it. For simpler explanation, I just think that it works like normal petrol engine without the petrol but compressed air.\nI also think that to get the compressed air inside the canister for the bike, you need some kind of power to do it. So, there is some power loss somewhere to get this bike powered. Then, I think, what if the we use solar panel? That might work, but for a bike, there is very small space to install the panel. Maybe we can use regenerative braking system just like hybrid cars. You brake, then the dynamo is powered on and charges the battery. All this happens unobtrusively. For the real solution of it, I just leave it to Dean Benstead to find it.\nWhat great about this bike in terms of appearance is that it appears to look like a normal motocross. In fact, it is one beautiful motocross bike in yellow color!\nMalaysian inventors, why don’t you make our own version of this compressed air bike? Are you not good enough?\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2011/12/03/wew-02-pursuit-sepeda-motor-tenaga-udara/\nwith: http://www.gizmag.com/compressed-air-motorcycle/20354/\nAdvertisements",

The next six riders were separated by just half a second.

We have seen many product launches and we as a motorcycle blog has been awarded 2nd Best Automotive Blog by Blogrrr. Looking back to 2013, here are five most interesting bike in Malaysia, in my humble opinion, that we should recap. The list are after jump:  \n5. 2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke R RM133k on the road (pictured above)\nThe Beast, as it is nicknamed, features a great design with interesting engine to go with it. A radical upgrade from the previous Super Duke 990.\n\n\n4. 2013 Kawasaki Z250RM21,589 basic price\nA segment that always been fighting for but never equalled by Kawasaki. For more than 20 years, Kawasaki keep bringing us interesting 250cc bike since the original 4-cylinder 250cc ZX-250R. Then, the 2011 Ninja 250R and 2013 Ninja 250. All that is in the supersports category, but now they tell us to enjoy the 250cc in naked form. Enter the Z250.\n\n\n3. 2014 Yamaha Lagenda 115Z/ZR Fuel Injection RM5,168 basic price\nReleased in September, it has become the second bike under 150cc category in Yamaha lineup to be fitted the Fuel Injection system. Upgraded with 20% more horsepower and better fuel efficiency, this is the bike to get for 115cc category.\n\n\n2. Honda EX5 Dream 100 discontinued, no longer for sale\nThis bike has always been interesting and popular among the rider in Malaysia. Sadly, the year 2013 signals the end of the production of this bike after 26 years of its appearance on the Malaysian market.\n\n\n1. 2013 Honda CB500 Trio – CBR500R RM28,588, CB500F RM28,288 and CB500X RM28,688\nIntroduced in August 2013, the riders in Malaysia shocked to see the price of the bike is below the expected price of RM32k, but at just RM28,288. It was then become the benchmark of a price to beat in 500cc and even the lower 250cc segment. At only 47hp, this cannot be said to be the ‘baby rabbit’, but more fitting to be called a hamster. A good hamster that is. A good hamster that many will love especially the beginners, like me.\n\nAdvertisements",

I’m not sure whether this one is referred to RPM limit cut-off or speed limit cut-off.Based on Shah’s interview with the mechanic at the supplier shop, it is said that this CDI from Thailand is much better compared to BRT and Rextor from Indonesia. Also, I’m not sure about this. By better, it means that the ignition spark and timing are good all around the RPM.I have spoken to the mechanic who work at Malaysian Cub Prix about racing CDI and he replied to me that he only use original stock Yamaha CDI unit, but, tuned at Hong Leong Yamaha for each and every track for the suitable ignition timings and ignition sparks. Therefore, I do really think that this Yamaha CDI unit from Thailand is as good as told by the mechanic which my friend has interviewed.Final opinion is up to you to try it yourself.

Malaysia have the Racing Boy, Indonesia have CMS (Championship MotorSport) and Thailand have LHK.\nI’m looking forward to have my Lagenda 115ZR to be modded.

Then, what if there is 1-stroke engine available? Does it means mono-stroke engine is 40% more powerful than the 2-stroke engine?\nThis article about mono-stroke engine or Bourke engine has been available for a long time in my bookmark but had been forgotten for a while until today. The engine is actually already available since 1920s, but I don’t know why there isn’t any company taking this design for further study.\nThe benefit of this Bourke engine are great. It got two power stroke per revolution. It happens to be an improved 2-stroke engine, with the advantage of no premixing the 2T oil into the combustion chamber. It is also high in efficiency as it produces only 80ppm of HC (hydrocarbon) and zero CO (carbon monoxide)!\nFor the experiment that has been done to a 400 cu. in (6.8liter) Bourke engine, it produces 200hp at 2000RPM with 500lb/ft (677.14Nm) of torque!\nFor comparison, Ferrari Enzo with 6.0 liter engine produces 660 PS (485 kW; 651 hp) at 7800 rpm and 657 N·m (485 lb·ft) at 5500 RPM.\nAs I read the article, it is said that Bourke engine are believed to be the “Most Efficient Form of Internal Combustion Engine”.\nOne more pictures, animation of the Bourke engine and original links after the jump  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/bourke.htm\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourke_engine\nAdvertisements",

This follows Sunday’s eagerly awaited announcement that Czech rider, Jakub Kornfeil, will partner Malaysian ace Zulfahmi Khairuddin in the SIC Racing Team next year.\nThe 21-year-old Kornfeil, who began his career at the age of six in motocross, supermoto and mini bikes, first took part in the Czech 125cc class in 2006. He went on to win the Red Bull Rookies Cup in 2009 and made his Grand Prix debut in 2010.\nSIC CEO, Datuk Razlan Razali, who announced the participation Malaysian team in the world championship two days ago, commented that Kornfeil was an experienced rider. “Despite his age, he comes with an enormous amount of experience and will be a huge asset to the team.”  \n“I am sure he (Kornfeil) will combine well with Zulfahmi and together will form a formidable two-rider line-up. And with Johan Stigefelt as the team manager, we have a very strong package going into next year’s championship.”\nFor the record, Kornfeil was third fastest in yesterday’s Moto3 qualifying session and finished eighth in today’s race.\nKornfeil said he was delighted to join the SIC Racing Team. “After five years in the World Championship, I am happy to be part of the SIC Racing Team for 2015. I have known Johan for a long time and for the last two years it has been our goal to work together, so this is a dream come true. I also have a strong teammate in Zulfahmi. I hope we can work together next year and do well as a team.”\n“This is a fantastic opportunity for me and I want to thank Dato’ Razlan and Johan for offering me this chance. I’m really looking forward to it and I’m very happy to be able to stay with KTM. I’m feeling positive and I think we can make a great season in 2015.”\nStigefelt said he was thrilled to have the opportunity to work SIC. “I’m very pleased to be able to work with Sepang International Circuit and to embark on this new project together with them.\nHe explained that being based in Malaysia was advantageous to the team as they would be able to test in Sepang regularly. “This is great for our riders and I believe this will benefit them a lot.”\n“I’m very happy to have signed both Zulfahmi and Jakub for our Moto3 Team in 2015. It was crucial to sign a Malaysian rider and Zulfahmi was the obvious choice for us. He is without doubt the best suited for this project, he knows the KTM and he knows the Championship well and we know he has great potential.\n“It was also important to have another established and fast rider who can push together with Zulfahmi to get the results, for both himself and for the team and that I know is what Jakub is capable of. I have known him since 2012 and he has much talent. He is a dedicated rider who will work hard and I believe he can fight at the top next year.\nStigefelt added that the team had a heavy schedule in the pipeline. The team will be testing in Jerez in November and also at the beginning of next year. The testing will give the riders the time to get accustomed to the KTM Moto3 bikes which they will use next year.\n“I wish to thank everyone involved, from the team members and our riders to Dato’ Razlan, CEO of Sepang Circuit and our partners in this project.”\n \nAdvertisements",

Having shown race winning pace all weekend in all conditions ‘The Doctor’ was faultless in today’s TT race. The nine-time World Champion held his fourth position from the grid into the first turn then started looking for a way past Stefan Bradl for third. By the second lap he was past and with just 22 laps to go he moved past Marc Marquez into the first corner for second, beginning the hunt for Dani Pedrosa and victory. It took just one lap more and Rossi was able to dive past Pedrosa into the final chicane for a race lead he would hold to the flag, crossing the line to a sea of yellow flags and a well deserved return to form. The win puts Rossi on 85 points, now just two behind Cal Crutchlow in fourth place.\nWhile his teammate rightly deserved the honours for an amazing victory, Jorge Lorenzo also shone today. The World Champion gave everything he had and more, defying the pain from collarbone surgery just 36 hours ago in a heroic effort to race. Lorenzo had started from 12th on the grid but had risen to eighth by turn three. By the second lap he had climbed to fifth and was chasing down satellite Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow in fourth. With 23 laps to go he had passed Crutchlow and began to close the gap to Marquez in third. As the laps wound down exhaustion set in and with 11 to go Lorenzo was re-passed by Crutchlow. With grim determination he managed to maintain pace for fifth position and rolled into the Yamaha pits to an applauding team. The remarkable feat means Lorenzo holds second in the Championship and is just nine points behind Pedrosa as they head to Sachsenring in two weeks time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi 1st / 41’25.202 / 26 Laps\n“Today was something special, this is one of the best victories in my career because it is one of the most wanted and expected for such a lot of time. I’m so happy because I won a real race where all my opponents were very strong and very fast, apart from Jorge with his injury. It was great from the beginning, I had a good feeling, I could overtake on braking and I felt good on the bike. It was difficult but the finish line was calling me so I had to arrive as fast as possible. We have made a step with the bike, I can ride in a better way so we have to try and stay with the top guys every weekend. Jorge rode an incredible race, we have to say a special great congratulations because he had great courage to do this and also he made an important step for his Championship.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo 5th / +15.510 / 26 Laps\n“It would have been impossible to believe some minutes after my crash that this could happen. We were brave to make the operation the same day, if I had waited to Friday the doctors would not have let me race. We made the race today and I was very brave in the first laps because passing the riders with a collarbone like this under braking was really hard. I felt quite good physically at the beginning of the race but after lap seven every lap was worse; it was more difficult to change direction, to brake and to accelerate so I couldn’t do more than fifth position. We only lost two points to Dani who is leading the Championship. This fifth position is better than any victory I have had in my career. I hope to have a good recovery for Germany, I will not be 100% but I hope to be better than here. The victory for Valentino and the third for Crutchlow are good for the Championship, I would have preferred Cal to finish in front of Marc but you can’t always have perfection! I am happy for Valentino, more than two years without winning has been hard for him so I’m happy for my box partner. After Aragon I think he made some improvements and here he took profit from the opportunity. Lets see what happens in Sachsenring as last year we had some issues and the Hondas were strong but I think if I can improve my physical condition I can be more competitive than this race.”  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“If you would have asked me a quote before the race I would have said we need to finish and get some points. To fight for the first fifteen laps at least and to be there with the front boys was unbelievable for Jorge. Finishing fifth, having Vale winning the race and having Cal also on the podium is great for Yamaha. The result is great for us as we lose just two points to Dani. I think that is what this race was all about, damage control, we had to try to finish and for sure not to crash.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“It has been a double victory today, so great for both results. Vale is back with a victory after two years and eighth months and the last one was also with Yamaha so it has been a great result for all of us. We were also able to gain some points against our competitors so for me it was a very special victory. Jorge did something really incredible. He showed he has the determination that is not normal. That he could race having had surgery just two days ago, has been very impressive, I know what a rider can physically feel when you are on the bike and injured. At the end we also only lost two points to Pedrosa. For me this is going to be an unforgettable weekend. We will leave this place in a really good mood and for sure we are going to start the next weekend totally full gas.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrutchlow returns to podium in Assen thriller\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow made a stunning return to the podium in a classic Dutch TT encounter this afternoon. The 26-lap battle was a nail-biting affair from start to finish and a fantastic charge in the second half of the race secured British rider Crutchlow a third rostrum in the last four races and ensured once again that he was unmatched as the outstanding non-factory rider.\nStarting from pole position for the first time in his premier class career after a sensational qualifying performance yesterday, Crutchlow found himself down in fifth place in a frenetic opening to the 65th running of the historic Dutch TT. With 90,000 fans gripped by the exciting action, Crutchlow’s podium challenge commenced when he seized fourth from heroic reigning World Champion Jorge Lorenzo, who just 48 hours after breaking his left collarbone in practice was producing a superhuman effort to keep the podium in his sights early on. Crutchlow disposed of Lorenzo’s threat at the final chicane on lap 15 and he then moved into the rostrum places with an identical move to get by World Championship leader Dani Pedrosa on lap 21. The former World Supersport’s blistering speed then saw him brilliantly hunt down Marc Marquez for second as the race reached an enthralling climax. Eager to equal the career best second place he scored in Le Mans last month, Crutchlow came close to pulling off a thrilling overtake at the first corner on the final lap. Marquez though was not to be outdone and after coming close to contact, Crutchlow momentarily ran off track before recovering to claim a richly deserved fifth MotoGP podium that keeps him in fourth position in the World Championship standings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith produced yet another hugely encouraging display, the British rookie finishing inside the top 10 for the fifth race in a row. Starting alongside eventual winner Valentino Rossi and Pedrosa on the second row after a career best qualifying performance, Smith did his best to keep himself in the hunt for the top six in the early stages to try and gain vital experience from the fastest riders in the world. Struggling in the hard braking zones with discomfort from a recovery left wrist injury, Smith slipped outside of the top 10 but refused to settle for an 11th position he held from the fifth to the last lap. Locked in a battle with Nicky Hayden and Andrea Dovizioso, Smith produced a stunning last lap attack to finish ahead of both to claim ninth for the third time in the last four races.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow 3rd – 87 points:\n“I am really happy to be back on the podium after the disappointment of Barcelona. It was a great battle right to the end and once again I showed my speed and I was close to finishing second and that would have matched my best result in MotoGP. But obviously after starting from pole position I wanted to win the race and had it not been for me struggling with the full fuel tank in the first five laps, I think I had a chance to fight with Valentino. I can’t turn the bike on a full fuel load and then Jorge passed me and he was riding amazing considering his physical condition. It took me a while to get back by him but then I chased down Dani and Marc but it was a case of too little, too late. It was close with Marc on the last lap and I think we touched, so we were lucky he got back on the throttle when he did otherwise both of us could have been in the grandstand! Being back on the podium is great for Monster, Tech 3 and Yamaha and it is another positive result for the Championship. Before the start of the season, if somebody had said I would have been on the podium three times in seven races and been so consistently fast with the best riders in the world, then I would have been happy. Now we go to Germany in a positive frame of mind and hoping to get back on the rostrum again.”\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith 9th – 41 points:\n“With my wrist injury continuing to cause me a problem, today was probably my hardest race of the year. After the operation immediately after Catalunya I expected it to be better than the last two races but to be honest I have a few more problems now. So it was a good race and to be able to get ninth on the last lap is a good situation. The distance to Bradl was quite similar to Barcelona and truthfully this ninth feels better than the sixth I got in Barcelona because today I really had to battle and nobody crashed. The gap to the front is quite similar to Barcelona and obviously the big positive of the weekend was starting on the second row. I knew finishing seventh was going to be a best case scenario because I knew Jorge was going to be coming through. I stayed consistent and my pace in the second half of the race was strong. I still need to work on the set-up for the early laps but I can go to Germany with a lot of confidence. I’ve scored another top 10 and beaten two very experienced riders on the final lap. And hopefully the wrist will be less of a problem at Germany and I can be in a bit less discomfort than here.”\nAdvertisements",
        "125cc\nYamaha\nYamaha Ego LC, Mio 125, Luvias 125, Xeon 125 \n\n2013 Yamaha Xeon RC YMJET_FI in Indonesia – Semakin Tak Tertandingi \n\n\nPosted on January 12, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nYamaha Indonesia just launched the upgraded version of the popular 125cc Xeon automatic bike to RC version which features a lot of improvements. This includes the major upgrade that is the use of YMJET_FI system that should give better fuel efficiency of the already fuel saving bike before. It comes in 5 exciting colours and this time the livery is not disappointing. It is looking fresh and nicely done. Truly ‘Semakin Tak Tertandingi’ (More Unbeatable):  \nThe bike already comes with a large luggage underseat box that can fit few items for daily riders. It is a common trend now to have a bigger capacity underseat box since this helps rider a lot in bringing the essential items such as rain coat or even power bank hand phone charger.\n\nThe brake lever also got some nice feature named Smart Lock System. This system actually locks the brake so that you can have a safer starting since the bike won’t jumped off away from you when you accidently twist the throttle while starting it up. Smart Lock System also helps when you park a bike a descent spot.\n\nSmart Stand Switch. I really love this feature. I remember using it when I use to have Honda iCon 110. The system will cut off power when you push out the side stand and kill the engine. This also means that you can’t start the engine until the side stand is tucked in. You can always be sure that your side stand won’t jolt the asphalt with this feature.\n\nOne more thing that I like to see is the tail light if this new Xeon RC. In this few years, Yamaha are terrible in designing a proper beauty for a tail light design. This one looks better that the one for Yamaha Lagenda and Ego LC. I’m hoping more Yamaha products will have a better tail light soon. I have seen Honda and Kawasaki are now getting better in designing a tail light. Just look how nice the 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R tail light looks like.\nvia: www.yamaha-motor.co.id\nAdvertisements",

It features a design that resembles it larger capacity brother with power of almost 30hp.  That’s a huge amount of power for a 125cc engine.\nThis time it is the moment for it the Aprilia RS4 125, which is a 4-stroke 125cc bike. The tech specs for the engine are as good as it can gets. It features DOHC, FI, Magneti Marelli ECU, 6-speed gearbox, 4-piston front caliper with 300mm and many more.\nAnyway, it is much less powerful than the 2-stroke RS125. Some says it is only at 15hp.\nTechnical specification, official overview and 8 more pictures after the jump  Check out the similarity of the Aprilia RSV4 1000cc.\nAprilia RSV4 APRC Factory\nAprilia RS4 125\nRS4 125 Technical Specification\n\n\n\nEngine: Four stroke liquid cooled single cylinder with electronic injection and 4 valves.\n\n\n\n\nBore x Stroke: 58 x 47 mm\n\n\n\n\nTotal displacement: 124,8 cc\n\n\n\n\nCompression ratio: 12,5 ± 0,5:1\n\n\n\n\nIgnition: Electronic with CDI capacity discharge\n\n\n\n\nStarting: Electric\n\n\n\n\nLubrification: Miscelatore automatico\n\n\n\n\nGear box: 6 Ratios, 1st 11/33 2nd 15/30 3rd 18/27 4th 20/24 5th 25/27 6th 23/22\n\n\n\n\nClutch: Multiple discs, in oil bath\n\n\n\n\nPrimary drive: Gears, 69/29\n\n\n\n\nFinal drive: Chain, 60/13\n\n\n\n\nFrame: Aluminium perimeter frame\n\n\n\n\nFront suspension: 41 mm upside down fork, wheel excursion 110 mm\n\n\n\n\nRear suspension: Asymmetric swingarm with monoshock, wheel travel 130 mm\n\n\n\n\nBrakes: Front: 300 mm stainless steel disc with radial 4 piston calliper Rear: 218 mm stainless steel disc and calliper with single 30 mm piston\n\n\n\n\nWheels: In light alloy with 6 split spokes, with sealing profile for tubeless tyres; front: 2.75 x 17″; rear: 3.50 x 17″\n\n\n\n\nTyres: Front: 100/80 – 17″, rear: 130/70 – 17″\n\n\n\n\nDimensions: Max.

They belong – not only from a styling point of view – to the same range of extremely high performance Italian motorcycles in which the Aprilia RSV4 stands out, the extraordinary bike which conquered two world titles in the 2010 Superbike season.\nAPRILIA SPORT BIKES: WINNING DNA\nIn its short history, Aprilia has earned 45 world titles (36 in Moto GP, 2 in Superbike, 7 in off-road competition) and hundreds of championship races, to become the most victorious Italian and European brand in just a short period of history in Moto GP with 282 victories.\nIt is precisely in the youngest classes of Moto GP that Aprilia established itself as a true “school of champions”. On Aprilia 250 and 125 bikes in the RS series (RS, RSV, RSW and RSA) riders such as Biaggi, Rossi, Melandri, Stoner, Lorenzo and Simoncelli rode to their first great triumphs.\nEvery weekend, all over the world, Aprilia bikes take to the track, from international venues to local races, holding high the honour of Italian and European motorcycling, supporting the biker’s desire to race and cultivating young riders destined to enter the world championship scene.\nAprilia has always drawn from this wealth of success and technical skills for mass production – both in the philosophy which inspires the product and the aesthetics which are often taken from the racing bike – establishing itself from the start as an absolute leader in the 50 and 125 super sport segment, categories in which the Noale brand has introduced timeless innovative concepts and solutions and dictating trends which would be followed by all of its competitors.\nFrom 1993 until today, more than 100,000 Aprilia RS 125 two stroke bikes have been manufactured and sold in more than 30 countries around the world.\nNow Aprilia RS4 50 and 125 take the concept of the sports bike for novice riders who want to enter the motorcycling world with a proper bike to new levels of technological sophistication.\nThe Aprilia RS4 125 is the natural successor and most advanced evolution to date of the Aprilia RS 125, the bike that has dominated the 125 cc sports class for years, which set the benchmark for the one-eighth litre sports segment and which is still today the most highly sought after vehicle among riders competing in the Sport Production category.\nAprilia RS4 125 introduces the highly advanced, all-new four stroke powerplant to the sports segment, while adopting styling and technical solutions inherited from the RSV4, the superbike that led Aprilia to victory in the WSBK 2010 championship.\nBelow is a summary of the peculiar characteristics of the Aprilia RS4 50 and 125:\n– RS4 50 – 50cc 2 stroke single-cylinder engine, liquid cooled with six speed transmission\n– RS4 125 – 125cc 4 stroke, single-cylinder electronic injection engine, liquid cooled, 4 valves, dual overhead cam (DOHC) with six speed transmission\n– RS4 125 – Aprilia Quick Shift system available, the sophisticated technical solution derived directly from its big sister, the RSV4 APRC\n– stiff aluminium perimeter frame derived from racing experience\n– 41 mm upside down fork\n– front brake with 300 mm disc and radial four piston calliper\n– Superbike inspired analogue/digital instrument panel\n– fairings derived directly from the RSV4 for total aesthetic coherence with the SBK world champion\n– LED taillight\nDESIGN\nThe livery and eye-catching forms of the Aprilia RS4 50 and RS4 125 echo the looks of the Factory version of the Aprilia RSV4 supersports bike. And the RS4 shares more than just a family resemblance with the most hardcore street version the bike dominating the world SBK championship.\nThe design of the fairings and tank, the unique looks of the front end, with the headlights suspended over the gaping air intakes, and the spectacular tapered tail fairing are identical to their counterparts on V4 1000 cc supersports model that set new standards in terms of style and technical content for the superbike segment.\nExtensive aerodynamic studies have minimised surface areas without compromising wind protection, and the fairings showcase the superlative mechanicals of the Aprilia RS4 50 and Aprilia RS4 125 rather than conceal them. As a result, the frame and engine are not hidden away but proudly flaunted as fundamental elements of the design of Aprilia’s new small supersports models. With the triple headlight, the Aprilia RS4 bikes have a decidedly aggressive look that lends a unique character to the entire front end. The LED taillight merges stunningly into the ultra-compact tail fairing and offers excellent luminosity.\nThe fairing, product of extensive wind tunnel testing and race experience, offers excellent wind protection together with superb aerodynamic efficiency. And as well as contributing to the extremely aggressive looks of the bike, the top fairing and tail fairing also maximise performance in terms of speed. On Aprilia RS4 125, one additional detail underscores the level of sophistication of the bike: the exhaust, which is unmistakably inspired by competition machines, is completely integrated within the lower part of the fairing. A solution that is not just visually effective, but which also contributes significantly to the dynamics of the bike by helping to centralise masses.\nENGINES\nWith the new RS4 50 and RS4 125, Aprilia confirms its global leadership in the small capacity sports and young-targeted bike segment, creating models that exceed the expectations of even the most discerning rider.\nThe sophisticated chassis architecture of the Aprilia RS4 50 and RS4 125 is complemented by state of the art engines.\nThe single cylinder 50 cc unit developed by Aprilia for the RS4 50 is a water cooled two-stroke with reed valve induction. The lubrication uses a separate mixing system with a variable capacity volumetric pump. The six speed gearbox lets the rider make full use of the performance of this class beating engine.\nThe Aprilia RS4 is powered by an all new 125 cc water cooled 4 stroke single cylinder engine with four valves and electronic engine boasting a sophisticated double overhead camshaft (DOHC) valve timing system. This engine produces the maximum power output permitted for the class with a smooth, linear delivery and ecologically – as it meets even the strictest emissions regulations in effect.\nWith a six speed gearbox allowing the rider to make full use of the power available in all conditions, the Aprilia RS4 125 offers unbeatable performance in its class not just in terms of absolute power at high engine speeds, but also in terms of usable power band, minimised vibration and outstanding mechanical reliability.\nAPRILIA QUICK SHIFT\nFor the first time on a 125 bike, Aprilia offers the innovative Aprilia Quick Shift system, a sophisticated technical solution derived directly from the extraordinary big sister, RSV4 APRC, which in turn is derived directly from Aprilia’s experience in the World Superbike championship. The operational principle is similar, although partly simplified, to that of the RSV4: on the RS4 the system also guarantees torque interruption for gear change based on the speed which is engaged, the level of gas opening and the engine rpm, but for the 125cc, the shift time is a fixed parameter. The advantage of this system – available as a separate accessory – is that the rider can easily upshift keeping the gas open without using the clutch, thereby making the gear change simple and quick.\nCHASSIS\nThe chassis is without a doubt the feather in the RS4 project’s cap: built based on the exceptional experience which Aprilia has gained in WSBK and the 125 and 250 classes in Moto GP, it uses die cast aluminium spars with crossed reinforcement ribs. With its state of the art design, this extremely lightweight structure offers high torsional stiffness.\nThe front suspension also boasts a class beating layout, with a sturdy 41 mm upside fork, black anodised stanchion clamps and a wheel travel of 110 mm, while at the rear is a monoshock linked directly to the asymmetric swingarm.\nBoth the Aprilia RS4 50 and RS4 125 boast class beating brake systems: each bike uses a 300 mm steel disc at the front, gripped by a four piston radial calliper, and a 220 mm disc at the rear with a single piston calliper.\nThe 17” wheels are shod with 100/80 rubber up front and a 130/70 tyre at the rear.\nSTANDARD EQUIPMENT AND FEATURES\nThe multifunctional analogue/digital instrument panel with LCD display draws directly from its big sister, the RSV4, while the design of the split 6-spoke design of the wheels further emphasises the purposeful character of Aprilia’s latest small capacity sports bikes. The passenger saddle is yet another example of the extreme level of sophistication of these new bikes from Aprilia. Instead of fiddly screws, a practical quick release button allows the passenger seat to be exchanged with the tail fairing cover in an instant to transform the bike from two seat to single seat configuration (available as a separate accessory). Under the saddle there is also space for a practical glove-box, the most spacious in its category.\nCOLOURS\nThe new Aprilia RS4 50 and 125 are available in two colour schemes – “Racing Black” and “Racing White” – and in the bold “Replica SBK” livery which takes its colours from big sister, Aprilia RSV4 SBK, the bike with which Max Biaggi and the Aprilia Alitalia Racing Team conquered the rider and manufacturer titles in the 2010 World Superbike season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "Michelin\nparts\nPilot Street\nPilot Street Radial\ntyre \n\nMichelin Pilot Street and Pilot Street Radial launched in Thailand for Asean Market – better wet grip and 30% more tyre life \n\n\nPosted on May 10, 2013May 11, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nMichelin has flown us to Thailand for the launch of two of their new offerings that is the Michelin Pilot Street tyres for below 150cc bikes and Michelin Pilot Street Radial tyres for 150cc to 300cc bikes. There are media that are invited from the respective launch target country that is Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines and Malaysia. It was an interesting launch event to meet bike media and enthusiasts from other neighbouring country. All of them has passion and lots of knowledge about bikes.\nI’ll be dividing this article into three posts:\nPart I about Michelin Pilot Street\n Part II about Michelin Pilot Street Radial\nPart III about the test ride.\nPart I: Michelin Pilot Street\nPilot Street are targeted 100% street use positioning. This means that it is made to be able to handle the daily commute road stress and wear.Michelin have studied about their target consumers and their expectations for the tyres. Previous model of the Michelin tyre that is the Michelin Pilot Sporty (MPS) has been a great tyre but lack of grip in wet condition. Michelin Pilot Street are set to make this tyre having great grip whether on dry or wet road.  \n\nMichelin Pilot Street are targeted for high-end urban bikes under 250cc starting from the lowest one as seen as the Yamaha Mio and Honda Click-i with have 14-inch wheel. This is a good move since there are many modders in Asean countries that are looking high performance tyre for better power transfer from the engine to the transmission and finally to the tyre to the road.\n\nOne of the improved part of the tyre is the variable groove width on the tread pattern that facilitates the evacuation of water when the tyre on wet condition. This sometimes referred as aqua-channel. We can see from the picture that the width increases from 3mm on the center groove to 5mm on the shoulder groove and 6mm at the very end of the aqua-channel. This provides better wet condition grip and test results shows that the wet braking performance almost matched the dry braking performance. Some of us are very used to the Michelin Pilot Sporty which provides great grip on dry but suffers on wet condition, but this Pilot Street has managed to overcome the problem and now the wet grip and braking are now much better than its predecessor.\n\nThe durability of the Michelin Pilot Street are also increased to 30% more of tyre life. We have interviewed Mr Laurent about this and he said that the durability differs between bikers and riding style, but whatever style or riding condition you have, you will have 30% more tyre life. For example, if your riding style gives you 10,000km of tyre life, you should get 13,000km on the Michelin Pilot Street.\n\nThe tread pattern design is unmistakenly Michelin that usually features simple lines but a very interesting ones. It is derived from Michelin Sport Touring Radial and should give a great look to the bike. A little detail that you must see is that the front tread pattern and rear tread pattern have opposing direction of the aqua-channel. This is due to front tread pattern are optimised for handling, and the rear are optimised for braking.\n\nI haven’t got the information about the price yet, but I estimates at RM200. I’ll update as soon as I get the info from the dealer.\n\nThis is the official shot of the tyre and more on the gallery below. Already available in the on May 1st 2013 on the shop near you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is one more model that is the Michelin Pilot Street Radial, but I’ll save that for tomorrow post for part II. Keep in touch!\n\nAdvertisements",

Changes to both engine and chassis for more direct response allow riders to feel even more connected to their ride. Like before, the Ninja 1000 blends control and comfort, and the sportier handling does not come at the cost of ride comfort. The well-balanced package further benefits from new, perfectly integrated panniers (accessory) and flagship-level technology like 3-mode KTRC (Kawasaki TRaction Control) and selectable Power Modes, which add to the Ninja 1000’s already highly versatile performance.\nFor 2014, the more refined Ninja 1000 offers riders even more of a good thing.  \n\n\n\nAggressive full-fairing Ninja design\nThe Ninja 1000’s well-integrated full-fairing styling offers a good indication of its sporty character. The sensuous styling is both audacious and subtle at the same time. The aggressive design gives the Ninja 1000 an appearance that is instantly recognisable as a Kawasaki, yet ensures it retains its own distinct identity when lined up next to other Ninja models.\n\n \n\n\n\nMaximum riding excitement: chassis\nLike its predecessor, the Ninja 1000’s highly rigid aluminium frame offers a high degree of mass centralisation, ensuring a balance of sharp turning and firm handling. The more direct handling of the new Ninja 1000 can be largely attributed to its revised suspension settings. The bike responds more quickly to rider input as a result, and the Ninja 1000’s ability to soak up bumps and ruts is still excellent.\n\n\n\nMaximum riding excitement: engine\nPowerful liquid-cooled, DOHC, 16-valve 1,043 cm3 In-line Four engine pulls strongly from all rpm and does not let up before the redline. Revised engine tuning focused on the feeling the rider gets when opening the throttle. The strong torque feeling and mid-range hit of the previous model remains, but changes made to the engine and ECU settings result in a more direct throttle response, adding to the Ninja 1000’s sporty street riding potential.\n\n\n\nEnhanced intake note\nDesigned specifically so that acceleration could be enjoyed aurally as well as physically, the carefully crafted auditory note of the intake is a key component of the street riding exhilaration offered by the Ninja 1000.\n\n\n\nRigid 41 mm inverted fork\n41 mm inverted fork is adjustable for compression and rebound damping and spring preload. Sportier settings deliver quicker handling while maintaining excellent ride comfort, ensuring the response and handling for enjoyable street riding both in town and in the hills.\n\n\n\nRadial-mount monobloc calipers\nThe supersport-style brake package includes triple petal discs, radial-mount monobloc calipers and radial-pump front brake master cylinder. The new monobloc calipers and new brake pad material contribute to a firmer initial touch, superb braking control and even more formidable stopping power. Models with ABS available in some markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiquid-cooled\n4-stroke In-Line Four\nDOHC 16-valve\nDigital Fuel Injection\n1,043 cm3\n6-speed\nKTRC\n230 kg / 231 kg (ABS model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: www.kawasaki-cp.khi.co.jp/mcy/street/14_zx1000lm_e.html\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nWSBK \n\nAprilia Dominates at Sepang Two Wins by Marco Melandri, Two One-Two Finishes for the RSV4 \n\n\nPosted on June 11, 2014June 11, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n \nThe first ever World Superbike Championship round at Sepang bore the Aprilia signature, dominator in both races. Marco Melandri’s double win and Sylvain Guintoli’s double second place confirmed the supremacy demonstrated from the first practice laps of the weekend where the RSV4, including the “satellite” bike ridden by Toni Elias, showed just how much they liked the Malaysian track.\nRace 1 had the two RSV4s ridden by Marco Melandri and Sylvain Guintoli pulling away at the front from the very first lap to battle for the win. It was the rider from Ravenna who brought it home in the end, skilfully bridging the gap that had been created after a crashing pileup in the first few turns. Once he had caught up with his team mate, Marco overtook him in one of the braking sections on the tenth lap, holding onto the lead until the chequered flag.  \nRace 2 changed in form but not in substance. A red flag in the third lap decreed a restart for a race now shortened to 10 laps and the starting grid based on the riders’ positions at the time the race had been stopped, which put the three RSV4s on the front row. Sylvain Guintoli took the lead straight away while Marco Melandri battled to chase down his team mate.\nIn the final lap the two Aprilia riders made a series of passes that were as spectacular as they were clean, with Marco Melandri prevailing after Sylvain’s last ditch attempt in the turn right before the finish line. It was a flying finish, the second one-two of the day and overall standings that were radically changed. This brings Melandri up to fifth place in the rider standings, whereas only 13 points separate Guintoli from current leader, Tom Sykes. Aprilia shortens the gap in the Manufacturer standings as well, where they lie in second place just 4 points from the top.\nMarco Melandri: “A double win that was just what we needed! Despite the difficulties we never gave up. We kept working and fighting. I had a good feeling straight away with my RSV4 here. The conditions in Race 1 were difficult but I managed to catch up to Sylvain. After overtaking him I set my own pace. I knew I could defend well in the braking sections and I was able to manage the race to the end. Race 2 was even harder because I also had to battle with the Kawasakis before catching Sylvain. In the last tap I thought I would give it a try. I had to give 100 percent down to the chequered flag. Anyway, all the riders deserve admiration today because riding in these conditions is not easy at all. I want to dedicate this win to Manu, her belly and all the guys on the Team. See you at Misano!”\nSylvain Guintoli: “In Race 1 I thought I had implemented my strategy well, but unfortunately toward the end Marco just had a really good pace and forced me into a few mistakes. I think I did better in Race 2, trying to pull the pin straight away, but toward the end Marco quite simply had just a little more. I tried to fight back and I think we gave anybody watching the race plenty of entertainment in that last lap! We earned some important points in the championship and showed that Aprilia is back out front with a great day. Now we’ll get some rest after this really tiring weekend.”\nAdvertisements",

These included our friends from the Ducati Club of Malaysia (DCM), as well as other prominent groups such as the Harley-Davidson Owners Group (HOG) Malaysia Chapter, and the Air Force Bikers Community. Also present were celebrity bikers Awie and Fauziah Latiff.  \n\nThrough the club’s formation, the organisation aims to consolidate all motorcycle owners who purchased their bikes from PEKEMA member entities, regardless of bike brand, model, and type. Appointed as the club’s president is Datuk SM Zulkifli SM Amin. Datuk SM Zulkifli is also the managing director of SMS Auto World Sdn Bhd, Malaysian distributor and importer of Moto Guzzi motorcycles.\nSeveral top-tier EXCO members of PEKEMA were present during the auspicious launch ceremony. Also present alongside Datuk SM Zulkifli during the ceremony was PEKEMA president Datuk Haji Zainuddin Abd. Rahman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This club was formed not to overshadow all other existing motorcycle clubs in Malaysia. Instead, the club would serve as a universal platform that allows all consumers to directly interact with their bike sellers who are members of PEKEMA,” explained Datuk SM Zulkifli during his opening speech. He further stated that part of the club’s activities besides group rides will involve acts of charity to benefit communities in need through PEKEMA’s very own charity arm.\nA symbolic plaque signing ceremony was held on stage witnessed by many club and club members present, alongside PEKEMA’s own EXCO members, and a select group of journalists. Shortly after, Datul Zulkifli, alongside PEKEMA president Datuk Haji Zainuddin proceeded presenting donations and contributions to a few deserving non-governmental organisations and several folks in need.\nMembership is open to all bikers in Malaysia, with a one-time membership payment fee of RM60.

        "110cc\n125cc\nAirblade\nex5\nHonda \n\n2013 Honda Dream EX5 110 and Airblade 125 FI launched in Malaysia – EX5 110 RM3,908, EX5 (e-starter) RM4,145, Airblade RM7,708 \n\n\nPosted on July 23, 2013August 5, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYes, our insider has given us 100% correct information about the launch of the 2013  Honda EX5 110 and the automatic bike Airblade 125. Let me break the surprise first, the Airblade 125 comes equipped with PGM-FI system. This is what we are waiting for, the era of FI system finally getting to our soil.\nThe popular EX5 has been upgraded with better engine and cosmetics all around it. The engine are now 109.17cc which is larger that the bike it replaces at only 92cc. It retains the carburetor-type fuel system that should keeps the price low and also low maintainance. Another improvement is the bigger tank capacity at 4.0L which is larger than it predecessor at only 3.7L. This can contribute to fewer fuel station stops and longer travel distance. It comes in 4 colour choices that is, Euphoria Red Metallic, Vital Blue Metallic, Mariana Purple Metallic and Pearl Graceful Green.   The meter cluster also has been change with modern looks along with the added muffler protector that should helps to keep the heat away if you accidently touch the exhaust.\n\nHonda Airblade is a welcome addition to Honda family in Malaysia which features PGM-FI system that has become the standard in our neighbouring country. The Airblade is powered by 124.88cc engine that provides 8.2kW (11.1PS) at 8500rpm and 11.2N.m(1.14kgf.m)/5000rpm. That should give a good ‘go’ feeling. There are few features that makes this Airblade interesting. One of it is the Idling-Stop system that for now only available in Honda PCX150. Idling-Stop is a good way to increase the fuel-efficiency further by making the engine of the bike automatically stops at traffic light (or anytime when the bike is halted) and starts again automatically when the rider release the brake. This feature usually reserved for hybrid vehicle. Also included is the Remote Response Key, which makes the key have a remote button just like keys for car. When the button is pushed, the bike will beep, so you can find your bike easily in crowded area. The light system will also flash along with key shutter light and U-box light. Interesting idea. Anyway, I think this feature is added as a global feature since there are two countries that I think is crowded with motorcycle that is Indonesia and Vietnam, so this Remote Response Key will really help them to find their bike in parking space full of motorcycle.\nHonda Air Blade 2013 – Features\nYeah, we know you want to know the price, but we didn’t have it yet but will update soonest when we get the info.

        "1000cc\nducati\nPanigale 1199 \n\nDucati 1199 Panigale “Superquadro” Power House Revealed \n\n\nPosted on October 11, 2011October 10, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nSuperQuadro Power House\nWith just a matter of weeks to go until the final unveiling of Ducati’s brand new 1199 Panigale at the EICMA International Motorcycle Show in Milan (10-13 November), the Italian manufacturer now reveals the secrets behind the awesome power of its 2012 Superbike.\n4 more pictures after the jump  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most extreme benchmark ever\nDucati’s latest engine, the Superquadro, goes beyond the barriers of engineering to enable the introduction of a futuristic Superbike today. Its no-compromise approach to design, combined with Ducati’s Italian innovation has now set the most extreme benchmark ever and stands as the latest milestone in Ducati’s long and iconic history of Superbike engines.\nDucati engineers were given a near impossible design brief to create the new generation Superbike engine for the Ducati 1199 Panigale. Increase power, torque and user-friendliness and reduce overall vehicle weight and scheduled maintenance costs seemed impossible tasks, but given a “blank canvas” to create the new power-plant and encouraged to think outside-of-the-box to achieve the unachievable, engineers have finally ticked all the boxes.\nThe innovative Superquadro engine, so called because of its massively over-square bore and stroke ratio, has increased power to an absolute production twin-cylinder milestone of 195hp and torque to 98.1 lb-ft (13.5kgm) with user-friendly Riding Modes that deliver that power appropriate to the rider’s style and environment. Its construction has enabled a radical reduction in overall vehicle weight and, further identifying Ducati’s constant pursuit of performance perfection, major services have been extended to 24,000km (15,000 miles). Only Fabio Taglioni’s masterpiece 90° L-twin configuration and Desmodromic valve control have been retained from previous engines. Everything else is new.\nEngine architecture\nWith the engine designed to be a fully stressed member of the chassis, its architecture has been completely re-calculated to provide the best possible vehicle construction for layout, weight distribution and strength.\nThe cylinders, which remain at 90° to each other, have been rotated backwards around the crankcases by a further 6°, until the front cylinder is 21° from horizontal. This has enabled the engine to be positioned 32mm further forwards for improved front / rear weight distribution in addition to perfectly positioning the cylinder head attachment points for the 1199 Panigale’s monocoque frame.\nThe crankcases, which are vacuum die-cast using Vacural® technology to ensure optimal weight saving, consistent wall thickness and increased strength, also incorporate in their form the outer water-jacket of the “cylinder”, eliminating the jointing face that used to exist at the base of the cylinders. Instead, the Superquadro has separate nikasil-coated aluminium “wet-liners” inserted into the tops of the crankcase apertures. This design enables secure fixing of the cylinder head directly to the crankcase, improved sealing and enhanced heat dissipation from the thin cylinder-liners directly into the surrounding coolant.\nThe primary-drive casing, clutch casing and outer cover, sump and cam covers are all cast in magnesium alloy, ensuring a lightweight engine despite its increased strength as an integral part of the chassis.\nIn addition to cylinder position, the crankcases now use shell main bearings for the crankshaft, previously only used by Ducati on the Desmosedici RR engine. Removing the roller bearings has enabled an increase in diameter of the crank journals for enhanced rigidity and an increase the crankcase section around the main bearing area for improved strength in line with the Superquadro’s extreme power output. The shell bearings are force-fed oil from internal drillings within the main bearing pillars to keep the new crankshaft well lubricated and is quickly scavenged back into the sump with the introduction of a new Ducati feature, a highly efficient MotoGP-style vacuum pump.\nThe pump is driven by the main oil pump shaft and effectively maintains constant vacuum in the crankcase area below the pistons, reducing atmospheric resistance during the down-stroke of the piston and controlling the internal “breathing” of the engine.\nExtreme dimensions\nIn calculating the optimum configuration to achieve the next big step forward in power output for the L-twin engine, Ducati and Ducati Corse engineers increased engine speed and enhanced breathability with the incredible bore and stroke of 112mm x 60.8mm. The intense study of power and ridability resulted in an output of 195hp @ 10,750rpm and 98.1 lb-ft (13.5kgm) @ 9,000rpm. The new bore and stroke ratio of 1.84:1 effectively increases rpm with the ultra-short stroke of the crankshaft and increases the cylinder area to enable increased valves diameters. Inlet valves have increased from 43.5 to 46.8mm and exhaust valves from 34.5 to 38.2mm. With such large inlet valves operating at higher rpm, the intense inertial forces have been controlled by using titanium instead of steel, a solution only previously used on full “R” models. The new valves are actuated by racing-derived rocker arms, ‘super-finished’ for reduced friction and fatigue and then coated in polymeric-like carbon (PLC), a process originally developed for the aerospace industry.\nThe race-derived Superquadro pistons have a distinctive double-ribbed undercrown to achieve high strength and reduced friction by using minimal piston wall surface area. Using technology developed by Ducati Corse, the design enables reliable operation of the 112mm diameter pistons when performing at high rpm. The improved volumetric efficiency of the increased inlet valve diameters is further capitalised on by increasing the oval throttle body dimensions from an equivalent diameter of 63.9 to a massive and highflowing 67.5mm. The Ride-by-Wire throttle bodies feed air across twin injectors per cylinder, one positioned below the butterfly for enhanced flexibility and one above for outright power.\nClean power\nWith such enhanced “breathing”, the challenge for the Superquadro’s Design Engineers was to program performance-optimised fuel mapping for a smoother cycle-to-cycle engine operation, without compromising emissions. To achieve this, Ducati introduced a secondary air system that completes the oxidisation of unburned hydrocarbons and effectively reduces HC and CO levels. The system is activated when the engine ECU recognises specific conditions in the engine’s operation via the lambda and throttle opening sensors. It then opens a valve enabling a flow of clean air from the main airbox to a reed valve situated in each cylinder head, which enables one-way flow into an air gallery exiting into the exhaust port close to the exhaust valve. Entering the hottest point of the exhaust gasses, the fresh charge of air enhances the burn environment, eliminating any unburned fuel that escapes during the exhaust cycle under certain conditions.\nDesmo dependent\nWith such an extreme engine, never before has Ducati’s unique Desmodromic system been so vitally important. With the high engine speeds at which the Superquadro operates combined with such large valves, it would be impossible for the valve’s rocker-arm to follow the steep closure profile of the cam lobe using normal valve closure springs. The Desmo system actuates valve closure mechanically with the same method and accuracy as it opens, enabling steep cam profiles, radical cam timings, large valves and high operating speeds. This system is used on every single Ducati motorcycle and is constantly proven on Ducati Corse’s World Superbikes and Desmosedici MotoGP bikes.\nThe power of precision\nControlling such large valves with the precise Desmodromic system also led engineers to replace the original belt-drive concept, used since the introduction of the Ducati Pantah in 1979, with a combined chain and gear-drive arrangement. The conventional bush-type chain runs from the crankshaft to the cylinder head where a single sprocket positioned between inlet and exhaust camshafts, is attached back-to-back to a gear wheel mounted on its own short, dedicated shaft. The attached gear meshes directly with gears on the ends of both the inlet and exhaust camshafts, which are also designed with +/- position adjustment for ultraprecise cam-calibration. The cam chain, therefore, provides highly efficient point-to-point drive route and, tensioned automatically, provides continuous reliability and further reducing the cost of routine maintenance.\nOn the end of each exhaust cam drive gear is a centrifugal flyweight which retracts at speeds below tickover to rotate a “protrusion” from the concentric section of the cam, thus creating sufficient inlet valve lift to act as a de-compressor. This ingenious device enables the Superquadro engine to be started easily without using a larger battery and starter motor, which has reduced overall vehicle weight by approximately 3.3kg (7.3lb). When the engine starts and the camshafts begin to rotate at tick-over speed, the centrifugal flyweight flicks out, retracting the “protrusion” back into the cam and allowing complete valve closure for full compression. This innovative feature further underlines the lengths to which designers and engineers have worked together in the single-minded pursuit of weight-saving.\nNew transmission\nDucati’s engineers also capitalised on the opportunity of the “blank canvas” project to increase dimension between the centres of the six-speed gearbox shafts, enabling larger diameter, stronger gears to transmit the enhanced power output. New for a top-of-the-range Ducati Superbike is a “wet”, oil-bath clutch. Based very closely on the design of the Multistrada and Diavel components, the clutch assembly features a “slipper” function and a progressive self-servo mechanism that compresses the friction plates when under drive from the engine. While enhancing frictional efficiency, this also results in a rider-friendly light clutch lever “feel” at the handlebar. Conversely, when the drive force is reversed (over-run), the mechanism reduces pressure on the friction plates, enabling a true racing “slipper” action, reducing the destabilizing effect of the rear-end under aggressive down-shifting and provide a much smoother feeling when closing the throttle or down-shifting under normal riding conditions.\nPerformance perfection\nCompetition is the platform on which Ducati has always challenged and measured itself. It is a discipline for designers and engineers and the bedrock of motivation for a company in which the constant desire for victory has become a way of life. The Superquadro is the most powerful twin-cylinder production engine on the planet and is destined to power the new Ducati 1199 Panigale with absolute performance perfection.\nAdvertisements",

For 2014 however, Bridgestone will bring asymmetric rear slick with slightly softer rubber on the left shoulder to offer even more grip to riders. The rubber on the right shoulder will be one step harder than the left shoulder, and is the same hardness as was offered in the symmetric rear slicks in 2013. Rear slick options for the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders are the soft and medium asymmetric rear slicks, while for the Ducati and Open-class riders, the extra-soft asymmetric rear slick makes its debut for 2014, alongside the soft compound rear.\nStarting from this weekend, Bridgestone will increase the front tyre allocation for riders, giving each rider an extra front tyre (ten in total) and the ability to choose from three compound options, whereas previously only two choices were available. The front tyre allocation for Jerez is the soft, medium & hard compound front slicks.\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“After three intriguing races to start the season, I am excited to see MotoGP heading to Europe for the first time and especially to be going to Jerez, which is a circuit that always delivers fantastic racing. The tyre allocation for this year’s Spanish Grand Prix has seen a change from symmetric rear slicks, to asymmetric rears which will give riders even more safety and performance at this flowing circuit. \n“This weekend is also the debut of our revised front tyre allocation system which gives riders greater flexibility with their front tyre choice than ever before. The weather forecast for this weekend is sunny and warm weather, so I hope to see a huge Spanish crowd present at Jerez to welcome their MotoGP heroes.”\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Division\n“Jerez has a mix of fast and slow corners with a layout that is quite balanced in regards to the demands placed on the left and right shoulders of the tyre. The diversity of the corner layout and this means that we need to provide a tyre with a balanced character to provide good handling from low speed to high speed corners, and from flat corners to changes in elevation. \n“The balanced layout has meant in the past we always supplied symmetric rear slicks at Jerez, however, for this year we’ve decided to bring asymmetric rear slicks with softer rubber on the left side to provide better grip and warm-up performance in the left-hand corners. The surface is smooth which is easier for the tyre’s centre section but it is abrasive so harder compound tyres are required to ensure good durability. The track temperature during the race weekend is historically high too, adding to the challenge of minimising tyre wear.”\nBridgestone slick compounds available: Front: Soft, Medium & Hard; Rear: Extra-soft, Soft & Medium (Asymmetric)\nBridgestone wet tyre compounds available: Hard (Main), Soft (Alternative – front), Extra-hard (Alternative – rear)\nAdvertisements",

All came gradually together in last couple of months when heat raised and started the ‘Rok on’ tour in South America and completed the stunt-full season on EICMA motor show in Milan – Italy. The intensity was brutal as he performed in Mexico, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala, Peru, Slovenia, Malaysia, Germany and finally in Italy. Ten weeks, nine countries and three continents!\n\nWhile on tour, he had a chance to meet his fans all over the world and that was as he stated just surreal! Here it is how he put few impressions together: ‘To see all this people yelling my name and cheering, asking for autographs, for a photo with me, that just gave me incredible boost and motivation to train even harder and longer. Sometimes I train and hone my stunt-riding skills late in to the night, in hot or freezing cold weather, and even when there is around me all covered in snow. I don’t mind the elements! I just want to follow that ultimate goal to become the best stun rider in the world. Sometimes I think I’m in a dream, but than I realize that this is all real – cool!’\n\nIf Rok was not more than a year ago, just a kid on a Duke 125, he is now well recognizable also on big KTM Duke 690 where he is rapidly honing his aggressive but fluid riding style. ‘I want to bring people around me the feeling they are at the rock concert and not just a stunt show, full of adrenaline and emotions’ added young rebel stunt rider.\n\nHere you can check out his latest video, a summary from the tour in South America where he performed on a KTM Duke 200 and catch a glimpse of amazing vibes:  \n\n\n \n\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\n150i\nFSR Technology\nfuel injection bikes\nmalaysia bike\nparts\nYamaha \n\nInterview: FSR Technology – The Maker of Malaysian Very Own FCU for Yamaha FZ150i \n\n\nPosted on April 12, 2012April 12, 2012 by eddy \n\n\nFSR Technology FCU-150Z PnP\n10% improved power and 10% improved fuel economy at full throttle for a 100% standard FZ-150i is what makes me excited about this FCU from FSR Technology. If you are still wondering, FCU is Fuel Control Unit that is used for fuel-injected bike like the Yamaha FZ150i, in fact that is the only fuel-injected bike under 150cc in Malaysia. We have interviewed Mr Farhan via email and below is the Q&A:  \n1. What is FSR Technology? \nF = Farhan\nS = Suffian\nR = Research or Racing, depending on who we’re talking to 🙂\n\nWe are a year old startup focused on developing automotive & consumer electronics. FSR Technology was officially founded on Feb 16, 2011. The founders are myself and Suffian. We were both primarily from a microchip design background before we started this. I (Farhan Mohamed Ali) am 27, have bachelors and masters degrees in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University (USA). Worked for a couple years in a chip design firm where Suffian was my colleague. Mohd Suffian Zamali is 31, has bachelors and masters degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota (USA). After a lot of thought and discussion, we decided we were ready to do own thing. So we somehow put together about RM250,000 and started this company to build great products. We realized early that automotive electronics would be an interesting market and saw a gap in the market which our FCU product addresses, namely tuning for entry level fuel injection bikes.\n\n\n2. As far as I know, FSR Technology only makes FCU for FZ-150i, is there any plan for other bikes?\n\nYes, currently the FCU is our only product. We have experimented on other bikes, but the FZ still remains the most popular fuel injection model in Malaysia, so it is still our primary focus.\n\n\n3. Can you tell us about your FCU products, in terms of the variant and tech specs?\n\nWe keep our product line simple. There is only one current model of this product, which we call the FCU-150z PnP (Plug and Play). This is an improvement over the first model of our product which required some fairly complicated wiring. Now all the user has to do is plug in our product, which can be done in 1 minute. It comes preloaded with tuned settings for a standard FZ-150i so most of our customers can immediately benefit without having to do any tuning. 80% of our customers are using standard bikes.\nYou can check out the product description/images here https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.361729343848415.83718.240257402662277&type=1\nand here http://fsrtech.com/fcu\n\n\n4. What benefits riders can get in using this FCU by FSR Technology?\n\nWe claim 10% improved power and 10% improved fuel economy at full throttle for a 100% standard FZ-150i. We know it doesn’t sound as “grand” as a lot of so called performance products like to claim, but we pride ourselves in being engineers, not salesmen. Our claims are based on measurable data via our extensive dyno testing (400+ bikes!) and corroborated by user feedback. A very detailed user testimonial can be seen here: https://www.facebook.com/fsrtech/posts/366001383421211\n\n\n\n\nFor bikes which are modified (e.g. aftermarket exhaust, bore up kits, etc), our FCU is pretty much a necessity to get the best performance. Any such mods mess up the fueling on the bike and the performance potential is not realized. In cases such as bore up kits, performance increases up to 30% are not impossible with our FCU. It also helps to prevent engine damage due to overly lean fueling from installing bore up kits. Basically, our FCU is the enabler for all sorts of engine mods which were previously impossible to do reliably on the FZ.\nYou can see some dyno results here: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.248477661840251.63746.240257402662277&type=3\n\n\n\nA bike we sponsored/tuned also won the ARC race at the Elite track recently https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.374260715928611.86256.240257402662277&type=1\n\n5. What are your plans for the future for FSR Technology?\nThe immediate plan is to improve our distribution channels so that we can focus on engineering great new products. As for the future, we’re always experimenting with new ideas (which are not always automotive related), so we’ll let you know when we come up with the next interesting product.\n\n6. What do you think about the biking scene in Malaysia especially the underbone bikes?\nSome of the interesting things we discovered:\na) These guys spend a lot of money on performance accessories for their bikes! More than we anticipated. Unfortunately a lot of so called “performance accessories” make incredible claims which simply cannot be substantiated. It is really sad to see people getting sucked into buying such products.\nb) From a technological standpoint, underbone bikes in Malaysia are behind the curve because of our primitive emissions regulations. We are still using carburetors because we are only required to be Euro 2 compliant, while even entry level bikes in Thailand have been using Fuel Injection for some time now because they must be Euro 4 compliant. I believe we will be stepping up to Euro 3 only in 2014.\nUPDATE (additional information from Farhan):\nFollow FSR Technology via our website http://www.fsrtech.com or on facebook at http://www.facebook.com/fsrtech\n\nNote: We are very thankful for the nice and prompt reply from FSR Technology. We are hoping all the best for them and keep tuning more bikes!!!\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\nJupiter MX King\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\n2015 Yamaha Jupiter MX King 150 (Rp. 18,95 mil) and Jupiter MX 150 (Rp. 18.45 mil) officially released in Indonesia – RM5,164.24 to RM5,304.10 (direct conversion) \n\n\nPosted on March 13, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe Yamaha Jupiter MX King 150 has officially landed to Indonesia. After seeing the first introduction in Vietnam with the name of Exciter 150 FI, this moped is making waves on other region in Asean. Yamaha Jupiter MX King is a very interesting bike for the market here in Asean as we are always in love with practical but powerful bikes. This MX King 150 could a bike that suits the statement of ‘one size fits all’. The seating ergonomics is not too high or too low. Almost everyone can ride this and be happy with it (but then, everyone have different tastes in bikes).\nThe Jupiter MX King 150 is the successor of the very popular Yamaha Jupiter MX 135 (Exciter in Vietnam, Spark 135 in Thailand, 135LC in Malaysia or T135 as the internal code name). Almost everything is being upgraded from the its predecessor. The Jupiter MX King 150 gets a new chassis, new engine with bigger capacity at 150cc and new wheels, and this is fitting to say that this is the ‘All New Bike’ from Yamaha stable. Even with a lot changes in and out of the Jupiter MX King 150, it is still recognisable as the high performance super sports moped just like the T135.  \n\nThe icing on the cake is the Jupiter MX King 150 as it features a more premium accessories than the Jupiter MX 150. Both of the bike carries the same engine and all the important technical aspect like the brakes and engine where both is manual clutch equipped. The differences of the Jupiter MX King lies in the accesories only like the usage of halogen HS1 headlight, LED fairing light and gold colour caliper. You can check the table below:\nYamaha Jupiter MX King 150 vs Yamaha Jupiter MX 150 (from http://www.yamaha-motor.co.id/newsdetail/archive/2015/march/article/yamaha-mx-king-150-king-of-street-si-raja-jalanan-sports-moped.html)\nThe engine of the 2015 Yamaha Jupiter MX King 150 is liquid-cooled 4-stroke 4-valve SOHC engine which have used a lot of technology from the previous model. What is great about the engine from Yamaha is that it is easy to be tuned as there are a lot of aftermarket parts available for it. For now, there is still not much aftermarket parts for this model, but I’m thinking it will be available in just few months.\n\nOne feature of the Jupiter MX King 150 is the use of ‘Humanic Meter’ which can display ‘Hi buddy’ or any character no more than six letter which you can input it yourself. The 2014 Yamaha FZ150i already have this feature but it can only display ‘Hi bro’.\n\nThe rear tail light is nice with that LED and you should also notice the rear signal indicator shows that it is in sharp triangle shape. The one fitted to the Jupiter MX 150 is in the oval shape.\nAfter reading this, you might be asking whether this will make it to Malaysia or not.

It’s Aprilia RS125 \n\n\nPosted on February 17, 2011February 17, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nAprilia RS125\nAprilia RS125 is one of the most popular entry-level superbike Aprilia bike that features 2-stroke Rotax engine with 15 bhp power output.\nThe price of Aprilia is at RM22,690.00 which is not cheap compared to the formidable machine by Yamaha that is Y125Z that is only at RM6,800.00 (basic price).\nRead the details on the manufacturer writings here:\n\n\nRS 125 Overview\n\nAprilia has always been the undisputed leader in 125 cc supersports, a market segment in which Aprilia has pioneered new concepts and advanced solutions, and developed technology that others have struggled to follow. Like all Aprilia motorcycles, the RS 125 has benefited from the sophisticated technology that has been developed over years of success in GP racing, and quickly transferred into production. Over the years, the RS 125 has forged a reputation as the standard setter for sports 125’s. Sales success has come naturally too, with the RS 125 topping the sales tables on major European markets. The RS 125 is the inevitable choice of riders entering Sport Production racing. And rightly so, because when the competition gets tough, there is simply no other bike like the Aprilia RS 125. The Aprilia RS 125 offers young riders the best in components and equipment, and a concentration of technical refinements worthy of a flagship supersport.\nThe following are just some of the main features of the Aprilia RS 125:\n• tried and tested yet extremely sophisticated Rotax two stroke engine;\n• super-rigid aluminium frame and swingarm derived from Aprilia’s vast GP experience;\n• upside down fork;\n• front brake with radial caliper and four opposed pistons;\n• RSV 1000 R style fairing, windshield and tail;\n• RSV Factory style, crossed spoke wheels;\n• analog/digital instrument panel with multi-functional computer;\n• RSV Factory style, forged steering yoke;\n• oval section racing silencer with riveted end plates;\nSTYLE\nThe mean, cutting edge look of the new RS 125 tells you that this is a professional racing machine. The styling of the RS, like that of all Aprilia sports bikes, is the result of painstaking aerodynamic research.\nThe fairing, for example, was perfected by extensive wind tunnel testing, to guarantee great wind protection and minimum drag for maximum racetrack efficiency. The fairing, windshield and tail not only look mean and aggressive, but allow the RS 125 to reach a blistering top speed, eliminating all turbulence around the rider and allowing man and machine to become one.\nThe latest generation twin halogen headlight also adds to the mean look of the new RS 125, and delivers a high power light beam for enhanced visibility and safety at night. The sleek tail looks exactly like the tail of a GP racer. Thanks to the effort put into the design of  the RS 125’s tail, not even the passenger seat disturbs the bike’s impeccable lines.\nThe crossed spoke wheels are not only lighter and more stylish, but safer and more reliable too.\nENGINE\nThe powerful but reliable, single cylinder, two stroke, Rotax-Aprilia engine needs no introduction. Over the years it has won a reputation for being unbeatable on the track and dependable on the road.\nStill today, this engine boasts technical solutions that are state-of-the-art for two strokes, including a crankcase reed valve intake, liquid cooling, an anti-vibration balancer shaft, and an automatic mixing system. The RS 125’s engine has been constantly updated over the years to keep in line with the latest emission control legislation without penalising performance. A catalytic converter and precision carburation has won Aprilia’s single cylinder two stroke homologation to Euro 3 standards. And the amazing thing is that this has been achieved without losing out on performance: the Aprilia RS 125 engine remains the reference point for all 125 cc powerplants.\nCHASSIS\nWithout a doubt, the most advanced single component on the RS 125 is its frame. Developed from Aprilia’s vast experience in GP 125 racing, the RS 125 frame is made from cast aluminium alloy with cross-ribbing reinforcement. Despite its extremely light weight, this advanced structure achieves amazing torsional rigidity, setting the standards for Aprilia’s competitors.\nThe box section, aluminium alloy swingarm has the highest torsional rigidity of all production 125 cc swingarms. Differential side members enable the exhaust to follow a path that maximises engine performance and enables more acute angles of lean to be achieved on bends without risking dangerous contact with the asphalt.\nThe suspension too plays a fundamental role in ensuring not only the RS 125’s performance, but its safety and comfort too. The RS 125 can rely on an upside-down fork that has been optimised for maximum performance on the racetrack while also delivering a more satisfying ride on public roads.\nThe rear suspension features rising rate linkages based on Aprilia’s 125 GP racing technology, for excellent traction and superb comfort even over uneven road surfaces. The hydraulic monoshock that provides the damping for the swingarm is also adjustable in spring preload.\nBRAKES\nLike any self-respecting supersport motorcycle, the RS 125 has to have the best when it comes to components. The braking system is the best available, and designed for maximum efficiency under competitive riding conditions. The front brake is a genuine state-of-the-art, high performance system with a radial caliper and four opposed pistons. In addition to the 320 mm front disc, the system also incorporates a radial master cylinder and aeronautical hoses for maximum precision and unrivalled braking power. The rear disc is 220 mm in diameter and is also equipped with metal braided hoses for perfectly balanced, high performance braking.\nEQUIPMENT \nThe Aprilia RS 125 is packed with prestige components. Compact and impressively light in weight, the instruments include an analog rev counter and a multifunctional digital display with an on-board computer that can be operated from the handlebars. The speedometer, rev counter, coolant temperature gauge and exclusive racing chronometer put you in total control. The on-board computer even has provision for interfacing with the optical finishing systems used on racetracks.\n\nDescriptions, codes, pricing and illustrations provided in this configuration may be subject to change over time.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "Lotus Motorcycle \n\nLotus Motorcycles to build C-01 – its own and first ever motorcycle \n\n\nPosted on June 25, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nLotus Motorcycles was established to design and build the first motorcycle of the iconic car manufacturer. The bike will be named Lotus C-01 and will be the most impressive appearance on public roads on two wheels. It will reflect a combination of lifestyle, design and high end technology.\nLotus Motorcycles is a joint project of Kodewa, car designer Daniel Simon and the Holzer Group. The Lotus C-01 will be a hyper bike with integrated racing technology. It will be manufactured of materials like carbon, titanium and aerospace quality steel, which are also used in Formula 1. Safety, ergonomics and design are the most important factors the design team has put emphasis on. It will be a state of the art motorbike powered by an approximately 200 horsepower engine.  \nKodewa has recently built the new sports car Lotus T128 LMP (Le Mans Prototype) and is running the Lotus LMP2 program in the FIA World Endurance Championship. The team of Kodewa comprises of experts with a lot of knowledge and experience not only in endurance racing but also Formula 1, DTM and lower formulas.\nThe unique shapes of Lotus Motorcycles will be penned by renowned designer Daniel Simon. Simon, a former designer for Bugatti Automobiles, has lately been responsible for some of the most sophisticated concept vehicles in Hollywood film history. Amongst his most recognizable contributions are the ‘Lightcycle’ in the 2010 Disney motion picture ‘Tron: Legacy’ and the ‘Bubbleship’ used by Tom Cruise in the recent Universal Sci-Fi hit ‘Oblivion’. The German was also designing the famous black and gold livery of the Lotus LMP2 sports cars.\nDaniel Simon is known for his clean and holistic concepts. The designer says: “With the Lotus C-01, we have only one ambition: to create a unique state-of-the-art machine that carries its brutal forces with elegance and style, a high-tech monster in a tailored suit. The C-01, with all its top notch components and materials, is first and foremost emotional, heartbreaking, at times playfully retro, and always clearly a Lotus. Lotus is a glamorous name with a rich history, and the C-01 celebrates it proudly: the shapes of the marvelous Lotus 49 were a main inspiration, and all color schemes pay homage to iconic Lotus racing liveries, such as the dashing black and gold. The intersection of past and future never fails to fascinate, and so does the unique idea of the C-01.”\nWithin the Holzer Group, the Performance GmbH is involved in the development process. The components made of titanium, carbon fibre and aerospace steel will be produced by RPC GmbH, which is also part of Holzer Group and Kodewa. Latest CNC machines linked with CAM workstations ensure highest precision and optimal workflow of the complex procedures. Because of quality inspections before, during and after the production process, a safety-related and faultless production is ensured.\nIn the next few weeks, images of Lotus Motorcycles will be released and will give a first insight into what to expect from the new Lotus C-01.\nAdvertisements",

The two-time World Champion left the sport at the end of last year and has been linked with rumors of a wild card appearance this season but this is now out of the question. The Australian rider will do four tests in Twin Ring Motegi (Tochigi, Japan) in the next few months with Honda Racing’s R&D team, working on the evolution of the RC213V and also on the new production racer bike that Honda Racing will sell to selected teams next year to race in MotoGP.  \nComment by Casey Stoner\n“It’s been almost seven months now since Valencia and I’m still happy and comfortable with the decision I made to stop motorcycle racing, even if sometimes I miss riding my RCV. That’s why I am happy with HRC’s offer to do some tests in Motegi this year! This will allow me to enjoy what I miss: riding a MotoGP bike! I can’t wait to get on the RCV to see how it has changed from last year and I’d like to thank Honda for this opportunity.”\nComment by Shuhei Nakamoto, Executive Vice President of Honda Racing Corporation\n“We are very pleased to have Casey back in the team! He knows this machine very well and I’m sure he can help our engineers and technicians with the development of the RC213V. We will also ask him to test the new production racer and give us his initial feedback to assist us in producing the best machine possible.”\nAdvertisements",

This new Lagenda really attracts my attention as it features unconventional head and taillight design. Also the displacement has been updated from 110cc to 115cc, which means more torque and more power. Fuel tank also increased to 4.2L. It also gets an under seat compartment at 7.0 liter of volume.\nIn terms of design, Yamaha said that this bike is one the most stylish bike they ever designed(I’ve forgot where I have read this, so I can’t provide a link). I agree with them. In pictures, it look beautiful and nice, but when you see it at the motorcycle shop, Yamaha Lagenda 115Z really sets it par high enough that makes other bikes seems so outdated. I have went to a workshop and see many models of bikes from many brands lined up for display, and my eyes really attracted to Yamaha Lagenda 115Z design. The fairing is very projected forward and the lamp cluster looks like an updated version of Yamaha 135LC lamp cluster.\nThe quality of the parts and workmanship from Yamaha for this Lagenda 115Z is as always more than what we can expect. Every original parts seems well fitted together and the original colour painted to the coversets are really glossy and high in quality. This maybe to due to Yamaha experience in making precision equipment for music component in their early days before they started making motorcycles. There are all together 7 lamps for the front lamp  which can increase the safety for the rider since the bike is easily visible by oncoming vehicles. Also, the front lamp cluster make this Lagenda 115z looks like superbike when we see the light from far, which is also an addition to safety.\nYamaha really have made a very good decision to introduce this bike to Malaysia market along with The Boss (Yamaha RX-Z), King of Moped (Yamaha 135LC), Yamaha 125Z, Yamaha Lagenda 110z, Yamaha Nouvo LC and many more that are the leader in their own category. For example, Yamaha RX-Z and Yamaha 135LC are still having no contender whatsoever from any other manufacturer, so they are the leader. Another example is Yamaha Ego S, it is the number one best seller scooter or automatic bikes in Malaysia due to its cheap price, low maintainance, cute design, easy to handle, good pickup, easy to modified, easy to find spare parts and have a great impression among the riders as it is from Yamaha for its high quality.\nYamaha Lagenda 115ZR features a new addition to bike accessory like underseat compartment light. The sport rim is now in colour blue and I expect many owners of previous Lagenda 110ZR will start colouring their wheels too.\nOne question remains, is this Yamaha Lagenda 115Z a good buy? For me, the answer is definitely YES. With the money that you have, just spend it on this bike if you are on the market for new bike. Owning a Yamaha is like owning a legend and owning a Lagenda 115Z makes that meaning comes true.\nMe myself have used (some already sold) 2 Yamaha RX-Z, 1 Yamaha 125Z, 1 Honda C70, 1 Honda iCon and 1 Modenas CT110, but my best experience is with the Yamaha. The second best is with Honda. This is my opinion, so your opinions might differ.\nWhy is Yamaha the best to own? I don’t how to explain this, but I just feel that Yamaha makes a bike that care for its owner. Sounds weird? I think so too.\n\n\nPrice is about RM4,599 (Lagenda 115Z) and RM5,260 (Lagenda ZR) not including tax, insurance etc.\nPrice on the road is RM4,876.15 for Lagenda 115Z (Kick) and RM5,189.60 for Lagenda 115Z (Electric Starter). While Lagenda 115ZR on the road price is RM5,504.25.\nUPDATE (20/09/2010): I just bought Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR! Read my review here\n\nAdvertisements",

I was at K1 grandstand to watch the history in the making.

It was a good battle and all the of crowd were cheering and happy with the result. It was a very close fight, if not we just could see Zulfahmi as the winner of this Moto3 in Sepang.\nHafiz Syahrin who rides with number 86 was also a great rider to watch. He started at position number 27, and at that time, I thought he can only makes at best, only at position 15. But there I was wrong. He battle slowly by overtaking one by one rider starting in the first lap and all the way to the position number 1 in just few laps. The crowd again is cheering and doing the Mexican wave nicely. Everyone there is happy and I can see that in their face. To finish at position number 4 is a great thing and leading the race some time in the lap is a some thing to watch out to.\nWe wish all the best to Zulfahmi and Hafiz for the next race.

        "Yamaha \n\nTwo-strokes still going strong among four-stroke pioneers \n\n\nPosted on July 22, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe sound changed, the mood changed and for a while it seemed that the sport would make a wholesale change. When four-stroke engines punched their way back into motocross at the turn of the century Yamaha were at the forefront with their innovative YZ400F; an iconic motorcycle that Doug Henry achieved distinction with victory in AMA Supercross but also Andrea Bartolini thanks to 500cc World Championship success in 1999. The writing was apparently on the wall for the two-strokes as manufacturers embraced a new cycle and range of possibilities for engine and performance development. The YZ250F and YZ450F were the fine-tuned results of investment and the growing trend for consumer preference.\nThis wondrous search and thirst for torque quickly fed into a new format of the sport as 125, 250 and 500cc categories – classes that had come to define the shape of motocross across the decades from the 1960s to the end of the century – morphed into MX1 and MX2.  \nThe four-stroke era blossomed from the early ‘00s. The bikes became lighter, more powerful and quieter and also influenced a generation of young and fast talent who learned a different style of motorcycle racing.But were the marginalised two-strokes really on their last legs?\nThere might be discrepancies with the manufacturers with regards to the production of the engines – Yamaha is the only Japanese firm to still offer a comprehensive line-up from 85 to 250cc for example – but the controllers of the sport at FIM level and also in the burgeoning European Championships are putting the onus back on to the screamers.\nAt the root of motocross (and perhaps all motorcycling as off-road is normally the easiest first step for any youngster to twist a throttle) the two-stroke motorcycle didn’t quite die-off as expected. 65 and 85cc machinery provided a natural progression for those who had taken their initial steps with special and heartfelt bikes like the Yamaha PW50. Two-strokes were still the ideal entry level to the two-wheeled world as the bikes held aloft principals that stand strong to this day: manageable technology, low cost maintenance, lighter riding experience and skill-set building.\n“Two-stroke motocross bikes are important to Yamaha, in particular for the kids and young customers in general,” affirms Laurens Klein Koerkamp, Yamaha Motor Europe’s Racing Manager. “They offer a relatively affordable start in the motocross world, are easy to maintain – for example by the father – and are a good base for youngsters to learn how to control the throttle. Sometimes I have the feeling that people think that only some European manufacturers still make two-strokes but Yamaha is offering a full range of very competitive YZ85, 125 and 250cc models.”Motocross in Europe is angled directly towards the FIM Motocross World Championship and sees the two-stroke playing an essential role in the path of any ambitious junior athlete or kid with eyes on professional status. Regional European series on 65s and 85s lead into the eight round EMX125cc championship that is run at Grand Prix events and on the best stage possible. The FIM and Youthstream – promoters of Grand Prix – even announced a new European Championship to sit alongside the MX1 and MX2 division from 2014 that will see two-strokes up to 300cc take to the line. Youth development has become a more important and visual side of any brand’s work in the sport over the past five years. With the MX2 class carrying an age limit of 23 years and the elevated status of the European competitions, teams like the Kemea Reytec Van de Laar Yamaha squad – that functions in EMX85, EMX125, EMX250 and MX2 – provide a well-supported and professional ‘ladder’ for aspiring racers. At the core of the Belgian team’s work is their attitude to the development of Frederik Van Der Vlist (Dutch) and Cyril Genot (Belgian). With two other important ingredients also in place: the YZ two-strokes and the presence of former GP winner Marnicq Bervoets.“I think what we are doing here it is really good,” says the experienced and knowledgeable Belgian. “Two years ago I was working with a young kid who had to move straight onto a 250 four-stroke to continue his progress and you could see the difference in what he had to handle. They are heavier and more powerful, too much actually. Kids need a lighter bike to make a better step. They are still growing in their mid-teens and they might not be strong enough at that age for a four-stroke. There had to be a decent stage between moving from 85cc to the four-strokes and the 125 is pretty essential for that and their career. It is also important to try and avoid big injuries. I think it is a very good system now in terms of progression.”So far the team have enjoyed fruits of their labour with Peter Van de Laar looking after the tuning of the engines from his Dutch workshop. The highly-rated Genot is currently second in the 85cc Dutch Open Championship, scoring a double win in the last round and already catching the eye with his speed in the European regional series. Van Der Vlist is proving to be formidable force on Dutch soil and is leading the 125cc points table by a hefty margin. He is also third in the EMX125 standings with three of the eight rounds already in the bag. In France the YZ125 is the choice of more than half the field in the national series. The French Federation’s ‘L’equipe de Franc de motocross Espoir’ fields Nicolas Dercourt on a YZ125 and the teenager has finished on the podium in the last two rounds of the EMX125 contest after also lifting silverware in 2012 and currently lies fourth in the championship. All the youngster are making good progress on the YZs.“The bikes are fast and hugely reliable and through our YRRD Rinaldi racing parts programme we offer 125cc kits which are very popular, particularly in France,” said Klein Koerkamp.\n“The Yamaha YZ125 hasn’t changed that much out of Japan but we have a set-up with Yamaha Netherlands and Van der Laar with a different sub-frame and of course overall tuning and we are very competitive,” says Bervoets. “The development has been small but we have worked hard. Van der Laar is very interested in helping young riders on two-strokes. They are always tuning and working on the bikes but usually the modifications are small because it is not easy to make big steps with the engine. The power is good though and strong enough to be competitive and serve its purpose as being the next educational step. At the last EMX125 round in Latvia in early July we saw four YZ125s in the top ten, all with different tuning.”\n“You know, kids can change so much and so quickly between the ages of 13 and 17,” continued Bervoets. “It is a crucial stage of a career and the two-stroke allows the riders to play more with the bike and develop their technique. Yamaha have the right approach with their two-stroke and four-stroke motorcycles. I hope one day manufacturers will bring modern two-strokes right up to the level alongside the advanced technology on the four-strokes so it means absolutely all riders have a good choice.”\nPhotos courtesy of Kemea Reytec Van de Laar Yamaha/Christophe Desmet and Max Zanzani\nAdvertisements",

        "250cc\n250R\nKawasaki\nninja\nninja 250r \n\nGallery: Kawasaki Ninja 250R 2013 features and specs – RM22,589 basic price – topspeed 167km/h \n\n\nPosted on October 13, 2012April 28, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nAfter knowing that the Ninja 250R launched in Malaysia, we, riders are definitely happy and can’t wait to see in our own eyes (I know I am). Before doing that, let us see the features and specs and that leaves us all drooling.\n\n \n2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R came in a design that is edgy with lots of dynamic lines that exudes the sense of speed and style. On the side, the fairing with the black ‘spacer’ in the middle makes it looks less heavy that the previous version of it. It now look lighter now. One of the most interesting visual here is the new wheel. It is a 5  ‘Y’ spoke design is thinner bar and gives a fresh modern look for it.  \n\nThe headlight is looking serious with the sharp angle on the side that increased to the top of the head. It also have lots of curves compared to normal headlight. It is not a simple design, but a complicated design that works. It fits for a bike built for this decade.\n\nThere is also ABS version other than the normal ones without the ABS. As we can see from this pictures, there is a series of square holes on the inner ring of the disc brake plate to give a clue that this one is the ABS brake system equipped. ABS can help for better brake control during cornering and when swerving to avoid danger. Anyway, this does not permit you from driving recklessly.\n\nThe meter dashboard features a big half circle RPM meter to help you shifts gear at the optimum RPM range for torque delivery to the drive train. Speedometer are shown in the box on the right in big digital display to help you drive in on the proper speed when riding on the speed-limited public road.\n\nAs tested by Rafi Superbike (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faW_Qu-1AKs), the top speed of this Ninja 250 is 167km/h on the bike meter reading. That is a good number for a full-fairing entry level sportsbike. If you need more speed, maybe you can change the block to the Ninja 300 block (if it is available la bro).\n \n\nThe view from the back is good too. I think, many owners after this will remove the rear fender to make fenderless like a true racing bike. This is common in Malaysia where riders put the plate number under the rear mud protector. The previous look after thought where this one is more refined and looking very good.\n\nNow, let see on the inside. The 249cc engine block are sleeveless aluminium die-cast plating for better heat dissipation since there are no more ‘sleeve gap’ (or the area with minimum contact to the engine block). The piston are now anodized along with the larger oil pan from the new crank for better cooling of the engine. Sweet spot for the engine are from low-to-mid RPM. The improvements and increased torque on the low-to-mid RPM makes it worthy of the name Ninja.\n\nRadiator also has been improved. Not on the inside but now it features a plastic deflector that deflect the hot air downwards away from the feet of the riders. This has been an issue for the previous version of the Ninja 250R. It is good to know that Kawasaki listen to the riders need.\n\nFuel injection sytem of this Ninja uses dual throttle valve. The benefit of this dual throttle valve is that it can precisely control the air intake to achieve natural linear response from all speed range that increase the combustion efficiency. Also, this increase fuel efficiency.\n\nChassis are from high-tensile steel in the form of diamond shape to provide higher chassis stiffness. This will provide improved rigidity. Quality of the ride are also improved in term of smoothness with the application engine rubber mount to reduce the shock and vibration from the engine.\nTechnical Specification:\n\nType of engine: 4 stroke, water cooled, twin parallel\nDisplacement: 249 cc\nBore x measures: 62.0 x 41.2 mm\nCompression ratio: 11.3:1\nValve system: DOHC, 8 valve\nFuel Supply: Fuel injection system with dual throttle valves\nIgnition: Digital\nStarter system: electric\nTransmission: 6-speed, return shift\nMaximum power: 23.5 kW (32 PS) / 11 000 rpm\nMaximum torque: 21.0 Nm / 10,000 rpm\n\nRemember, it is now available in Malaysia at RM22,589 basic price or estimated RM26k OTR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.kawasaki-cp.khi.co.jp/mcy/street/13_ex250lm_essence_e.html\n2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R Official Pictures, Specifications And Details\n\nAdvertisements",

Translated, it means “Cool, Agile, Economical”. It came in 7 colours to choose and by my definition, that is a lot to choose for. All of the colours along with the livery are all good looking and should be perfect if you happen to choose any one of it. For me, the one I like is the Sirius Black (this is one of the character in Harry Potter, right?) and Lunar White. The rest of the colours are named Fighting Red, Masculine Blue, Lightning Green, Deep Purple and Armor Bronze.  \n\nGT acronym refers to three meaning. The first is “Gentle” which refers to its target market that is men . The second one is “Great Technology/Green Technology” which refers to the bike advanced and eco-friendly technology YM-JET fuel injection system. This FI system provides fuel-efficiency and at the same time produces low emission for the environment.\n\nThe last GT acronym stands for “Gran Tourismo/Grand Touring” which refers to its design styling. This bike is based on the cues of Modern Muscle Car like the Chevrolet Camaro and this can be seen with the style of the headlamp. It look bold, muscular and very manly.\n\nThe features of the bike are great for an automatic bike. It got nice speedometer panel which is surrounded by straight line and edges. The underseat compartment are now much larger but still you can’t put a helmet in. On the side, you can see a 3D emblem of the Soul GT in chrome placed elegantly there. The tailight are also nice to see along with the front muscular and aggresive light. The engine are also new with the aforementioned YM-JET FI system. The key is the 3-in-1 setup where you can open the underseat compartment, shut the key hole and start the bike. DiAsil cylinder and forged piston are also included in the specs of the bike which is a proven technology from Yamaha since the day of Yamaha 135LC.\n\nThe engine is equipped with 113.7cc cylinder and it push out 7.75PS (5.7kW) at 8,500RPM with 8.5Nm at 5,000RPM. It is a long stroke engine with the bore and stroke dimension at 50.0mm x 57.9mm which delivers the maximum torque in low-mid RPM range. The front brake is 1-piston caliper disc brake with rear drum brake setup.\n\nThe design, specs and feature of this Yamaha Soul GT 115 is  really a good combination for an automatic bike which can prove to be the next popular product from Yamaha. It just looks beautiful and it seems like Yamaha really knows what their customers want. Maybe I sound like a fanboy, but that’s what I think. What about you? ‘Silalah komen di ruangan di bawah’.\n\nYMKI (Yamaha Motor Kencana Indonesia) also introduced a special edition Mio Soul GT helmet for the launch of the bike and it is available for sale there! The helmet feature CSC which stands for Clean, Safe and Comfort. This original special edition helmet should be a valuable collection for any Yamaha fans. When Yamaha makes a limited edition product, we know it won’t last long in the market. So, quick and buy it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info at: http://www.yamaha-motor.co.id/soul-gt\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nPreview by Bridgestone – Round 17: Sepang MotoGP \n\n\nPosted on October 23, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n\n\nRound seventeen of the 2014 MotoGP™ season takes place at Sepang International Circuit, a circuit defined by its high ambient temperatures and humidity, and a fast, technical layout.\n\nMeasuring approximately 5.5 kilometres in length, Sepang is characterised by two long straights that end in extreme braking zones which demand high levels of stability from the front tyre. The rest of the circuit is a mix of high and low speed corners that combine to generate significant stress on tyres, with this circuit being one of the more demanding in terms of tyre development.\n\nWith the severe braking zones being such an integral part of the Sepang Circuit, Bridgestone has developed a new hard compound front slick tyre that riders will get to use in a race setting for the first time this weekend. This new development offers the same excellent braking stability and durability of the previous hard compound front slick, but with better cornering and warm-up performance.\n\nAlthough Sepang is tough on tyres and asymmetric rear slicks are supplied at this circuit, the stresses placed on the left and right shoulders of the tyre are not as marked as at other circuits, so the right shoulder features rubber only one step harder than the left. The rear tyre options for the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders are the medium and hard compounds, while the Ducati and Open-class riders have the soft and medium compound rear slicks available to them. Owing to its severe braking zones and high ambient temperatures, the front tyre allocation for Sepang comprises rubber compounds that are towards the harder end of Bridgestone’s range with the medium compound front being available alongside the new hard compound front slick that makes its competitive debut this weekend.\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“The final leg of the triple-header takes place this weekend at Malaysia’s Sepang Circuit, and this event is growing in popularity each year as South-east Asia’s love affair with MotoGP continues to grow. There is still a lot to play for in this championship, with two rounds left to decide who will finish second in the championship. Valentino and Jorge are in great form for Yamaha, but Dani has a tremendous record at Sepang having won there the past two years, so it seems we may have an exciting battle on our hands. This weekend also marks the final round of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup which Bridgestone has been proud to support in its inaugural year. This series has helped unearth some great young riding talent in Asia, and I hope to see a successful conclusion to this year’s championship in front of a big crowd at Sepang.”\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“The Sepang circuit have a varied layout that is characterised by its two long straights, the long lap length and the high track temperature which is often above 50 degrees Celsius. It is one of the fastest circuits of the season and features a mix of high speed corners and tight hairpins with heavy braking. Front tyre stability is crucial under braking, especially at the end of the two fast straights, and the high speed corners demand good shoulder grip and durability. This weekend marks the debut of our new hard compound front slick and given how important good front-end feel and stability is at this circuit, this new development should be a boost to riders this weekend.\n\n“Tyre durability and a good bike setup are crucial here as the high ambient and track temperatures mean that there is little cooling effect on the tyres. The track surface at Sepang has degraded significantly over the years, so it’s important that the teams find a setup that makes best use of the tyres and in this regard, having the winter tests here is important.”\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Should an evergreen design with the racy lines that evokes speed and emotion. On further observation, is the 3 line of red-white-red on the side refers to the letter R?  Official words from Arai Europe:\nPURE RACING TECHNOLOGY\nArai is extremely proud to announce that the RX-7 GP helmet is one of the very first helmets to meet both ECE Regulation 22-05 and the new SNELL M2010 standard. The RX-7 GP is in all respects the new benchmark in Arai’s helmet technology. The RX-7 GP was developed with the SNELL M2010 in sight, one of the most stringent helmet standards for impact-absorption tests, in addition to the mandated ECE Regulation 22-05 standard. There are, however, considerable differences between the ECE 22-05 and SNELL M2010 requirements. SNELL M2010 requires for instance that any location above the test line is tested by two consecutive impacts, while ECE 22-05 requires a single impact only at specific points on the test head form. This makes the total impact energy absorbed by each test location of the SNELL M2010 standard almost twice as high than the ECE 22-05 tests in some consumer size ranges. In addition, SNELL M2010 impact absorption tests are carried out with hemispherical and bar anvils. Both anvils are known as harsh to the outer shell performance.\nFurthermore, to insure the helmet shell is strong enough, shell penetration testing is also required by SNELL M2010, but is missing in the ECE 22-05 standards. The impact-absorption capacity of the Arai RX-7 GP exceeds even that of the famous RX-7 Corsair. Together with its conformity to both the ECE Regulation 22-05 and SNELL M2010 it makes the RX-7 GP a true benchmark in helmet technology.\n\nvia: http://www.araihelmet-europe.com/site/collection/rx-7-gp/\nAdvertisements",

The engine is still the same that has been upgraded from the 2009 599cc engine to bigger 636cc engine in 2012 for higher output. The engine configuration is 4-stroke 4-valve per cylinder inline-four liquid-cooled.\n\nThe advantage offered by the new Ninja ZX-6R’s 37cc displacement increase is significant for real world riding exhilaration. Increased performance across the rpm range is welcome when sport riding, both in the hills and on the racetrack. But increased low and mid-range torque also offers increased usability in everyday street-riding situations, like riding in stop-and- go city traffic, or accelerating to pass another vehicle on the highway. A new race-inspired clutch offers both a back-torque limiting function as well as a much lighter feel at the lever. The suspension also being revised with the use of SFF-BP.  \n\nThe fork setting are idealised for winding road whether it is on track or on the road.

It is very special because this one is the 1st model of Yamaha 125Z and it is still unmodified!The engine is still in standard condition except for the 0.25 piston size after one time rebore, but the rebore has been done not to modified the engine but to restore the compression that has been lost due to the old engine (about 8 years now).Compared to my RX-Z, this bike is very light (in fact, it is the lightest I have ever rode) and very fast. The first time I ride it, I can easily get to 120km/h and that is normal speed riding! I thought something is wrong with the speedometer, but no, everything is working well after further testing.Next, I’m going to restore this bike to a new standard look in the colour of blue as in the picture below. All the ‘X’ mark there is the item that I’m going to replace with original parts. For the rim, I think I’m going to use fish bone sports rim.\nYamaha 125Z Blue\n\nLook at my previous restoration project of 1997 Yamaha RX-Z here.\nAdvertisements",
        "BMW\nR1200\nS1000R\nS1000RR \n\nBMW S1000XR and R1200RS arrives in Malaysia \n\n\nPosted on July 23, 2015 by kesh \n\n\n\nBMW Group Malaysia expands Motorrad line up by introducing the BMW S1000XR and R1200RS –from RM112,900 and RM101,900 respectively.\n\n\nThe BMW Motorrad range in Malaysia just larger today followng the introduction of two new models by BM Group Malaysia. New in our market are the R1200RS sport-tourer and the highly anticipated S1000XR adventure-sport.\n\nWe start things off with the R1200RS sport-tourer first. Essentially, the RS’ arrival more or less completes the boxer-powered R1200-series range in Malaysia. It now joins in the ranks alongside the R1200GS adventure bike and R1200R naked roadster that was launched earlier this year during the inaugural BMW World Malaysia 2015 showcase.\n\nLike its adventure and naked brethren, the R1200RS harnesses power from a signature BMW Motorrad air/liquid-cooled 1,170cc boxer twin-cylinder engine that develops 125hp and 125Nm of peak torque. Power is sent to the rear via a six-speed constant-mesh transmission that is paired with a shaft-drive similarly found in its GS and R brethren.\n\nBeing a sports-tourer, the R1200RS was developed to cater towards enthusiasts that yearned for a bike that offered both sportiness and comfortable long-distance touring abilities. Notable features primed in the sport-tourer include a pair of 45mm inverted telescopic front forks paired with an EVO Paralever single sided swingarm, Automatic Stability Control (ASC), as well as an ABS braking suite and two selectable riding modes – ‘Rain’ and ‘Road’.\n\nRiders can garner greater versatility by opting for options such as Riding mode Pro that further adds ‘Dynamic’ and ‘User’ riding modes, and it also includes a Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) suite being primed. There is also the option to equip the sport-tourer with BMW’s Dynamic ESA (Electronic Suspension Adjustment) as well that offers selectable suspension and damper mappings.\n\nIf the R1200RS is not versatile enough, then perhaps the all-new S1000XR would be more up your alley instead. Built based upon the brand’s manic S1000RR supersport and S1000R naked-sport, the S1000XR is set to rival strongly against adventure sport favourites such as the Ducati Multistrada and the KTM Adventure series.\n\nUnderneath, the S1000XR shares the same 999cc twin-cam in-line four-cylinder heart as found in its sport and streetfighter siblings. As a result, the S1000XR packs a substantial offer of power as the mill generates 160hp and peak torque of 112Nm, all of which is sent to the rear via a six-speed constant-mesh straight-tooth transmission and chain-drive system.\n\nLike the R1200RS launched alongside it, the S1000XR also packs a equally large technological punch. Its on board electronic arsenal includes ASC, BMW’s all-new ABS Pro suite, two selectable ride modes – ‘Rain’ and ‘Road’, and BMW’s latest incarnation of its E-Gas ride-by-wire engine management system.\n\nThe S1000XR’s package can be further sweetened with several notable options. Highlights here include the Gear Shift Assists Pro (GSAP) clutchless quick-shifter system, Riding mode Pro feature and its two additional ride modes plus DTC, as well as the Dynamic ESA suite.\n\nAvailable for viewing and bookings bow via authorised BMW Motorrad dealers nationwide, the new BMW R1200RS is priced on-the-road without insurance at RM101,900 (6% GST included). The new BMW S1000XR, on the other hand, is priced from RM112,900 OTR without insurance (6% GST inclusive).\nCheck out the gallery below to see more of the new BMW R1200RS and S1000XR.\nBMW S1000XR and R1200RS Launch @ Kuala Lumpur\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW S1000XR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW R1200RS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "car\nLevorg\nSubaru \n\n2014 Subaru Levorg – 1.6-litre 168bhp boxer sports tourer concept \n\n\nPosted on November 24, 2013November 24, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nThe all-new Subaru Levorg sports tourer concept made its world premiere this week at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, hinting at a new vehicle currently under development for market launch in Japan in 2014. The name ‘Levorg’ comes from a combination of the words ‘Legacy’, ‘Revolution’ and ‘Touring’, and the concept blends the practicality of a tourer with the stylish design and feel of a sports car. The front of the Levorg features Subaru’s unified design motif, the hexagonal grille, while the shape of the new ‘hawkeye’ headlights helps emphasise the car’s low, wide stance. Its sleek profile is optimised for high aerodynamic efficiency and conveys the Levorg’s performance potential, yet also leaves no doubt about its practicality and touring credentials. The Levorg concept sees the introduction of an all-new 1.6-litre horizontally-opposed direct injection turbo (DIT) Boxer engine, which produces 168bhp and 184 lb ft torque, designed to offer smooth performance and greater environmental efficiency. The Levorg has also been engineered with a new high-performance 2.0-litre DIT Boxer engine in mind, producing 296bhp and 295 lb ft torque.  \nBoth new engines are mated to Subaru’s Lineartronic CVT. The Sport Lineartronic transmission fitted as standard to the 2.0-litre engine features an eight-speed shifting mode, which allows for either a more relaxed or a sportier drive and decisive acceleration.\nThe Subaru Levorg makes extensive use of ultra-high tensile steel throughout its body for weight saving and rigidity. The concept’s independent suspension system and electric power steering allow immediate responses to driver inputs and high cornering limits in all conditions, without compromising the level of comfort expected of a practical tourer.\nWith a stiff, light-weight body and Subaru’s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system at its core, the Levorg benefits from world-class safety performance. Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) and Active Torque Vectoring ensure predictable handling and among best-in-class hazard avoidance. New safety structures for the bonnet and bulkhead, and greater use of collision-absorbing materials in the engine bay, further improve crash safety performance and pedestrian protection.\nThe Levorg previews new safety technology destined for future Subaru models, including Hazard Avoidance Assist, which provides steering assistance if the system anticipates a collision, and Pre-Collision Reverse Throttle Management, which restricts engine output if the car detects sharp and unexpected acceleration while in reverse.\nSubaru’s innovative EyeSight driver assist system has been updated for the Levorg, and now features greater visibility and wider viewing angles for the Active Cruise Control and Pre-Collision Braking Control systems. The next-generation EyeSight introduces a new Active Lane Keep System.\nThe interior of the Levorg features high quality materials and a rich design, with piano black and metal trim accents throughout the cabin. Instruments feature ice blue lighting to emphasise the high-tech look, while a new 3.5-inch LCD colour display shows the status of the vehicle to the driver at all times. A small-diameter flat-bottomed D-shaped steering wheel affirms the car’s sportiness.\nAdvertisements",

        "100cc\nAgip\nDemak\nengine oil \n\nReview: Agip TOUR 4T 10W-40 Synthetic on Demak DX90 – RM35 \n\n\nPosted on February 23, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nWe at MotoMalaya are very happy with all the results of the Agip and eni engine oil (EO) test. We have installed the EO on 5 bikes now with different variation of the EO on different bike. The bike included for the tests are 2 Yamaha 135LC, 1 Yamaha Lagenda 115Z, 1 Honda EX5 and 1 Demak DX90. For today, we’d like to share with you the review of the Agip TOUR 4T 10W-40 Synthetic which we have put in the Demak DX90.  The Agip TOUR 4T 10W-40 Synthetic is a kind of synthetic EO that have thinner viscosity compared to the normal 20W-50 EO that is widely available in the market. The thinner the EO, the easier the engine parts to move, but too thin, it can make the EO not able to protect the engine parts surface by covering it in a form of film layer. The thin effect of this EO can give smoother ride and better acceleration, but thin EO needs to be ready for the extreme performance when the riders needs it. So, the EO needs to have great shear relialibity so that it won’t ‘tear’ at high temperature and at high speed. Due to this reason, EO manufacturer needs to have a really good engineers to make the thin EO as reliable as normal 20W-50 EO.\nInstalling the Agip TOUR 4T 10W-40 Synthetic into the Demak DX90 has given us much surprise considering how much the EO can really affects your bike’s engine performance. The immediate results that we can feel is that the bike is superbly have lot less vibration. Nothing has been done other that pouring that Agip into engine. The riding on Demak DX90 suddenly become enjoyable and the short drive back home from the workshop make us want to ride more of the bike. It just feels like it just got a new breath of life.\nThen, we thought, this much must be a very expensive oil to be had, but after checking with brochure, it is only RM35, which makes it on par with Motul 5100, which was our favourite brand before. Given the performance and immediate results of an oil change, we are surprised to know that there is really differences in EO.\nWe now are considering Agip and eni as our new favourite. It is not easy to spot Agip or eni at workshop as I observed here in Banting, Selangor but give a try if you found them somewhere.\nAgip TOUR 4T 10W-40 Synthetic are available at: Qbee Motor\nAdvertisements",

In Indonesia, the riders are lucky enough to get this smaller version of the Satria F150 that is the Satria F115 Young Star.\nThe noticeable difference that we can see is the use of plain two-piece suspension at rear as opposed to monoshock suspension on the Satria F150. One more difference that we can see is the absence of the rear brake disc which are now replaced by the drum brake.  \nThe engine is absolutely different since this one is only at 115cc which is smaller than the Satria F150 at 150cc. Even though it is the more affordable version, it is still equipped with Fuel Injection system which has become the norm all over Asia for small bikes. Suzuki said that this engine is given an upgrade in terms of the bigger valve diameter, closer valve angle and a spark plug position which is closer to the combustion chamber. All this for better performance and at the same time helps the fuel efficiency.\nThe engine also gets the lightweight piston and valve spring. Further reducing the friction is the use of roller rocker arm. Combining the Fuel Injection system, lightweight engine parts and low friction technology, the Satria F115 are able to go all the way to 63km for every liter of fuel. That is impressive in our mind.\n\nGood job Suzuki Indonesia. Can we also get this in Malaysia, Suzuki?\nvia: https://www.facebook.com/suzukimotorindonesia/photos/a.200127456665778.52751.191574987521025/989161834428999/?type=1&theater\nAdvertisements",

The other riders to have done this are Giacomo Agostini, Valentino Rossi, Geoff Duke and Eddie Lawson.\n– Casey Stoner has 32 career victories in MotoGP, placing him fifth in the all-time premier-class Grand Prix winners list, after Valentino Rossi, Giacomo Agostini, Mick Doohan and Mike Hailwood.\nOne more info: Lorenzo will miss the Shell Advance Malaysian MotoGP.\nAdvertisements",

Despite the difficult track and weather conditions the teammates were able to finish today’s session in first and fifth respectively.\nRossi was up for the challenge of repeating his strong ride of two weeks ago. He needed little time to get back into the swing of things and was quick to take over the top spot from his teammate at the start of the eight-hour long session. As the temperature started rising the pace of the field picked up, but the Doctor was quick to respond and cruised back to the top the leader board with an impressive 2’00.414s lap, which kept him sitting on top for the rest of the session.\nTeammate Lorenzo had a more challenging start to the second Sepang test. Though he briefly topped the leaderboard with a 2’02.099s lap, he struggled to find the good setup for the slippery asphalt. The Spaniard was pleased with his YZR-M1’s gearbox update and made the most of the available testing time by putting in a total of 51 laps. During his multiple stints he worked on improving the setting and set a best time of 2’01.162s, putting him in fifth place just +0.748s behind Rossi.\nBoth riders took a break in the afternoon until the worst of the heat passed before returning to the track, but the dry track conditions weren’t to last. Rain flags signaling an approaching thunderstorm were raised and soon the fickle Malaysian weather struck the Sepang circuit.\nNot wanting to let the last precious hour of testing time go to waste, Rossi and Lorenzo decided to brave the pouring rain to test their wet setup until, with 30 minutes remaining, the red lights came on, ending the session.\nThe change in weather meant Rossi and Lorenzo were unable to improve their times and they finished in first and fifth place respectively.  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – 1st / 2’00.414 / 54 Laps\n“Everybody in our team was curious about the updated gearbox and the first impression is quite positive, so I’m happy. It doesn’t make a huge difference, but it’s a small help in a difficult point where we need to improve. The bike is a bit better in braking and corner entry and I think we need to work to understand the maximal potential, but the first test was good. I am happy to finish in the first position because I was in P1 from this morning, so it’s a good first day. It’s important for us to make some kilometers on the wet. I don’t really like the feeling with the bike on the wet and last year I struggled a bit. We already improved a bit today, but we need to do some more testing and make some more kilometers.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – 5th / 2’01.162 / 51 Laps\n“Today was a pretty tough day for me. I feel the jet lag and last night I was only able to sleep for just four hours. At the beginning of the session we tried the set-up we used at the first Sepang test but nothing worked. We changed so many things on the bike but the result was the same. I’m a bit disappointed because of the results today but at least the new gearbox works well. We need to adjust it a bit but overall it is quite good, especially on braking where we can get more stability. The track conditions were pretty bad compared to the first test. The asphalt had less grip so we struggled a lot with the conditions. Hopefully we can improve our pace tomorrow and check the new things we need to test again before going to Qatar.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team Director\n“For me it has been a positive first day. As with the first Sepang test we don’t have a lot of material, but it is really important that we continue to work to find the right direction. The updated transmission gave both Jorge and Vale a good feeling, and it will continue to develop further. Today’s rain allowed us to obtain a full set of wet data to go with our dry findings so it has had its use. We made the decision to stop early after the rain, and will continue tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEspargaro shines on first day of Sepang 2\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech3 Team rider Pol Espargaro began the Sepang 2 test with immediate speed to storm to third place on the opening day of action in Malaysia. The young Spaniard continued working on the 2015 specification Yamaha YZR-M1 as he gears up for the fast approaching 18 round season and made further progress in establishing a strong setup. The 23-year-old Catalan clocked a best time of 2’00.876 which he set on his 17th lap out of 45 to successfully see him finish inside the top three on the first day. Although rain fell in the afternoon, costing the riders the chance to improve their times, it did allow them to test rain setups and Espargaro ran six laps on wet tyres as he now looks to tomorrow to continue his bright start in Malaysia.\nOn the other hand, Bradley Smith opened his Sepang 2 account with a firm and confidence boosting ride to eighth position in the standings. The young British rider suffered a leg injury during the winter break and after easing back into riding at the first test, this week he returns to Sepang recovered and ready for action. The 23 year old set to work immediately as the session began as he sought to further refine and adjust the 2015 Yamaha YZR-M1 with the season opener in Qatar only a month away. The end result was a best time of 2’01.241, less than a tenth of a second back from fifth which he set on his 22nd lap before going on to complete 51 in total including several laps in the wet.

We are continuing to work in the right direction and as soon as we started this morning, I knew that we could be quick. At midday it was already 54 degrees on the ground which was clearly warmer than the first test where it reached a max of 50 and so we weren’t able to ride as many laps. However, the general feeling for today was that it was productive and we focused on trying different electronic settings. The information that we collected will be very useful and furthermore, it was very good to run some laps in the rain as well. This meant that we could work on the wet setup and I am really pleased with this especially, as there is a definite improvement. The 2015 Yamaha feels great and I know that if I can ride a bit smoother and adjust my riding style slightly, we can be strong. There are a few more things which we have to study in order to improve, but we cannot rush everything and we must take it all step by step.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith – 8th / 2’01.241 / 51 laps\n“It’s great to be back here at Sepang again after not such a long wait so that we can carry on getting prepared for Qatar. The track conditions were different today compared to the last time when we were riding here and the circuit was a bit unpredictable with the grip levels. In some corners there was a lot less than in others but I’m happy because I didn’t really lose a lot of time compared to the other riders in these conditions. I’m closer to the front than the last test and I am also pleased because my ankle is much better than it was, although it is still not perfect. We were able to ride in the rain as well which is positive. I didn’t risk too much but I already feel much more comfortable when compared to last year in the wet and the lap time was much quicker. I think we still need to work but we are starting to see what we need to do to carry a good lap time and also to get grip in the wet with the Yamaha.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBradl and Baz still on track at Sepang\n\nThe first day at Sepang is over for the Forward Racing team and its riders involved in the second official test of the season.\nStefan Bradl and Loris Baz completed respectively 42 and 37 laps each, before torrential downpour interrupted the session in the early afternoon.\nThe German recorded a best lap of 2.02.410 and ended in 18th position in the time sheet, with Baz claiming 24th position with a personal best of 2.03.316.\nThe development work in view of the upcoming Qatar GP will continue tomorrow at the Malaysian circuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefan Bradl\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStefan Bradl – 18th / 2.02.410 / 42 laps\n“I can’t say that I am really satisfied with the work done today. The track conditions were very different from last test and I struggled particularly at the start of the day. In the afternoon the feeling was better, I was able to push even on worn tires, but then it started to rain and I could not improve my lap time. I am optimistic for tomorrow, I would like to make the most of the day and improve my performance.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoris Baz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoris Baz – 24th / 2.03.316 / 37 laps\n“It was a complicated day. I went on track hoping I would find the same conditions as the first test, but the reality was different and I was not able to push as I wanted. I tried some new solutions and I’m fine with them. In the afternoon, the rain started to fall heavily and I was able to complete few laps on the wet track in order to get to know better this bike in these conditions. It was another day of work, we continue to move forward step by step in view of the Qatar GP. I am confident that I will improve tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTest Results – Day One\n1.

        "motogp \n\nRound 6: Italian MotoGP™ – Qualifying Practice: Masterful Marquez marches to pole position at Mugello \n\n\nPosted on May 31, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nMarc Marquez’s mission to dominate every MotoGP™ qualifying session continued unabated at Mugello today, as the Repsol Honda rider lapped the Italian circuit in a time of 1’47.270 to claim the top spot on the grid for tomorrow’s Italian Grand Prix.\n\nMarquez set the day’s quickest time during his first time attack in Qualifying Practice Two, using the combination of the medium compound slicks front and rear. To the delight of the Italian fans, Pramac Racing’s Andrea Iannone was second in QP2 with a best lap time of 1’47.450, while Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo qualified in third place with a time of 1’47.521. Today’s QP2 session at Mugello was perhaps the most fiercely contested so far this season, with only half a second separating the top ten riders as the chequered flag was waved.\n\n\n\nAfter a rainy start to the race weekend on Friday, conditions today were warm and dry with the highest track temperature recorded being 45°C during QP1. The fine weather enabled riders to perform long runs on various tyre combinations in FP4, and it was the medium compound front slick that proved to be the most popular for riders. Rear tyre choice was more varied during practice with the preference among the Factory Honda, Yamaha and Ducati riders being the medium compound rear, while the majority of the open-class entrants preferred the soft compound rear slick. Some factory-class riders did evaluate the hard compound rear slick in FP4, but it is not expected that this option will be selected by any riders for tomorrow’s race. For the time attack in the Qualifying Practice sessions, the softer rear slick options and the medium compound front slick was the most widely used tyre combination, as it provided the best balance of cornering and braking performance.\n\nSimilar weather conditions are forecast for tomorrow, with the twenty-three lap Italian Grand Prix getting underway at 1400 local time (GMT+1 ). Before then, the MotoGP™ riders will be out on track for the twenty-minute Warm Up session at 1000.\n \nMasao Azuma – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“We were able to make up for lost time yesterday thanks to the fine conditions today, and the riders were able to try some different tyre combinations during practice. Today’s sessions revealed that the riders feel that the soft and medium slick options for both the front and rear are performing best, so we don’t expect the hard compound front and rear slicks to be utilised for the race. The pace among the riders is quite close both in terms of race pace on long runs and over a single lap as we saw in qualifying, and it is pleasing to see the Ducati, Honda and Yamaha riders so evenly matched in performance. The signs are good for an exciting race tomorrow.”\n\nItalian MotoGP™ QP 2 times – Riders that qualified from QP1 shaded in gray\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nQP2 Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ \n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n1’47.270 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE \n\n\nPramac Racing \n\n\n1’47.450 \n\n\n0.180\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nJorge LORENZO \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n1’47.521 \n\n\n0.251\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDani PEDROSA \n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n1’47.584 \n\n\n0.314\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n1’47.612 \n\n\n0.342\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW \n\n\nDucati Team \n\n\n1’47.659 \n\n\n0.389\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBradley SMITH \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n1’47.681 \n\n\n0.411\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO \n\n\nDucati Team \n\n\n1’47.754 \n\n\n0.484\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nStefan BRADL \n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP \n\n\n1’47.765 \n\n\n0.495\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nValentino ROSSI \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n1’47.791 \n\n\n0.521\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n1’48.132\n\n\n0.862\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n1’48.218\n\n\n0.948\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It can be seen as in the picture above with the red tab that shows the position of the EQRS mechanism to pull out the side padding easily. Nobody wants to be in this emergency situation but if it do happens, EQRS can prove its benefit. The system helps to minimise the critical injury reaction time as compared to the helmet without the mechanism.

We already have heard about the KTM RC390 that has been leaked from KTM Canada, but now there are two more versions coming out, the KTM RC200 and KTM RC125. KTM RC200 is based from the KTM 200 Duke while the KTM RC125 is naturally based from the 125 Duke. If you notice, all these three bikes are actually siblings, since the 125 Duke is the inspiration for 200 Duke and 390 Duke is the more powerful version of the 200 Duke. The acronym RC has been used long time ago since the introduction of the KTM RC8 to refer to its track ability.  \nA full-fairing version of the KTM RC200 and RC125 should appeal younger riders and will be a great learning bike for the track. Since this is coming from KTM, we can expect to have a smooth and powerful single-cylinder engine.\n\nThe main difference that we can see on the bike is the use of the double headlight enclosed in distorted hexagon shape and windshield visor.\n\nThe chassis remains the lovable Trellis frame in iconic KTM orange. Handlebar are now much more projected for lower riding to cut the wind. The riding style of 200 Duke like motard will be different that this one that is more to sports track bike handling.\n\nThe exhaust port is on the bottom and exits on the right side and looking good in that triangle enclosure. A good question to ask is, is this the bike we are waiting for after the 200 Duke?\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2013/10/28/ktm-rc-200-berbasis-duke-200-siap-dirilis/\n \n \nAdvertisements",

        "650cc\nBurgman 650 Executive\nsuzuki \n\n2014 Suzuki Burgman 650 Executive – four wheel comfort, two wheel practicality – est. RM68k \n\n\nPosted on December 12, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nCommuting by motorcycle boasts a number of perks. Reduced journey times, typically better fuel economy, and ease of parking in city centres, which is often free, are just a few of them.\nBut in the winter months those perks are often overshadowed by the numbing of extremities in the cold weather, rain and spray covering the visor, making visibility difficult, and if you do commute by motorcycle in the winter, chances are you’ll want to wear more layers when you arrive but lack the storage space.\nEnter the Suzuki Burgman 650 Executive, which offers the same two-wheel practicality as other motorcycles, but with comfort levels more akin to four-wheeled vehicles. Heated grips and a heated rider and pillion seat as standard keep everyone warm, while an electronically adjustable windscreen, coupled with an ample fairing, keeps off the worst of the elements. Filtering through rush hour traffic to keep those journey times down is even easier too, with mirrors that fold in electrically at the push of a button.  \nAchieving more than 60mpg is easy too, with a handy eco-light illuminating on the dash to encourage economical riding, ABS as standard adds confidence when braking on tricky winter surfaces, and parking on an incline is aided by a handbrake located near the left leg for an easy reach, while a magnetic ignition cover adds a greater level of security. 50 litres of under-seat storage is enough for two full face helmets, with three handy compartments up front adding additional storage space, and a DC outlet is conveniently included to charge phones, satnavs, and other electronic devices on the move.\nAfter a recent trip to the Scottish Highlands aboard a Burgman 650 Executive, freelance journalist Chris Moss commented, “With its high level of convenience, comfort, and practicality it’s fair to say it’s one of the most versatile two-wheelers on the market. Cruising at around 80-90mph is no strain at all thanks to the total protection offered by the fairing and electrically-controlled screen. And returning 66mpg is an indication the trip didn’t take much out of the motor either. Selecting the auto option of the three gearbox settings available, and keeping the ‘eco’ light illuminated on the dash guarantees that sort of economy. The fold-in mirrors are another thoughtful feature of the scooter which helps to make life run all that bit more smoothly and time-saving when filtering through cars.\n“The Burgman really is something that makes a difference to your life, completely simplifying your transportation, regardless of the nature of the journey. I cannot recommend it highly enough, and I’m confident anyone who tried one would feel exactly the same way.”\n2014 Suzuki Burgman 650 Executive Technical Specs\n\n\n\nEngine capacity:\n638cc\n\n\nEngine:\n4-stroke, 2-cylinder, liquid-cooled, DOHC\n\n\nBore:\n75.5mm x 71.3mm\n\n\nCompression ratio:\n11.2:1\n\n\nLubrication:\nWet sump\n\n\nIgnition:\nElectronic ignition (Transisorised)\n\n\nTransmission:\nSECVT\n\n\nDrive:\nGear train\n\n\nMPG:\n60.50*\n\n\nFront suspension:\nTelescopic, coil spring, oil damped\n\n\nRear suspension:\nSwingarm type, coil spring, oil damped\n\n\nFront brakes:\nDisc, twin\n\n\nRear brakes:\nDisc\n\n\nFront tyres:\n120/70R15M/C 56H, tubeless\n\n\nRear tyres:\n160/60R14M/C 65H, tubeless\n\n\nOverall length:\n2270mm (89.4in)\n\n\nOverall width:\n810mm (31.9in)\n\n\nOverall height:\n1430mm (56.3in)\n\n\nWheelbase:\n1590mm (62.6in)\n\n\nSeat height:\n750mm (29.5in)\n\n\nFuel capacity:\n15.0litres (3.3 UK gallons)\n\n\n\nFor more information on Suzuki’s Burgman 650 Executive, visit www.suzuki-gb.co.uk.\n\nAdvertisements",

This time it is Voltcom Crescent Suzuki Team unveiling their new livery of the GSX-R1000 piloted by Eugene Laverty bearing the racing number 58 and Alex Lowes with the number 22. WSBK could be the one race that we can see Suzuki in racing that we have missed so much after their withdrawal in 2011 in MotoGP. What is great about WSBK is that, the bikes they used in the race series is the production bike that is heavily modified to fit the FIM regulation. This can raise the brand awareness and the bikes’ aura since the bike is readily available on the market.\nRemember the date. 8th June 2014.\nvia: http://www.motofan.it/notizie/sbk-2014-il-team-voltcom-crescent-suzuki-presentato-nel-dorset/16027?preview=1\nAdvertisements",

        "Moto Malaya \n\nShell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 – Malaysia holds high promise \n\n\nPosted on July 31, 2015 by kesh \n\n\n\nAdam Norrodin leads the charge for Team Malaysia as the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 season resumes for Round 3 in Sepang this weekend.\n\n\nAfter a two-month long hiatus, the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 season resumes for its third round this weekend. The series is held in conjunction with the weekend’s Malaysian leg of the eni FIM World Superbikes Championship (WSBK) race in the Sepang International Circuit.\n\nAs Friday concludes, Team Malaysia is holding high promise for good results thanks to the efforts of 17-year-old Adam Norrodin. The Batu Pahat native showed good pace in the first practice session held in the morning where he stayed close on the heels of lead Japanese rider Ayumu Sasaki and ranked second fastest with his time of 2:20.496.\n\nAdam would eventually improve that in the second practice session held in the late afternoon. The session ended with Adam topping the time sheet after clocking in a blistering time of 2:19.282. Second fastest Sasaki was just 0.151 seconds off Adam’s pace here, and perhaps signalled his serious intent to give Adam a good fight ahead of tomorrow morning’s qualifying session.\n\nAlso showing promising signs was Pasir Gudang youngster Fakhrusy Rostam. What began as a struggle ended with improvements for Fakhrusy as he ends the day’s second practice session ranked in sixth.\n\nHowever, things are not going too well for the other three – Helmi Azman, Shafiq Rasol and rookie Azroy Anuar. Helmi’s day came to a premature end after discovering a hand injury in the first practice session. He was forced to sit out of the second session after race doctors deemed him unfit to continue. Helmi’s will know his fate for the weekend tomorrow morning when race official will deliberate on whether he can take part in qualifying or not.\n\nAs for Shafiq and Azroy, both appear to be struggling with Shafiq dropping for sixth in the first session down to eleventh in the second. Azroy has shown improved laptimes, but advances no further 14th in the first outing and 15th in the second. Despite this, both riders remain hopeful on turning the tables during qualifying tomorrow.\n\nBesides these five, two other fellow locals on the grid join Team Malaysia this weekend. The first comes in the form of Ahmad Idham Khairuddin, younger brother of national Moto3 rider Zulfahmi Khairuddin. With guidance from Fahmi, Idham is showing good pace in both sessions today and ends the day ranked in 18th in both sessions.\n\nThe second wildcard entry comes in the form of 13-year-old Luth Harith Erwan. Hacing competed in the Malaysian Cub Prix previously and Malaysian MGP3 national Moto3 cup last year, Luth marks his series debut as a wildcard this weekend. Things appear rather challenging for him as he is ranked dead last in both sessions today.\n\nWith the exception of Adam, Team Malaysia’s pace and performance is not optimal yet. Despite this, all five riders and the two wildcards appear upbeat and raring to go for tomorrow’s Qualifying session. Qualifying will take place early tomorrow morning, with Adam holding the highest promise here.\nStay tuned to out site for more updates as the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup race weekend proceeds over the next few days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Spied at Indonesia and reported by tmcblog, the CBR150R are available in at least 2 variant which is black and Repsol edition. Based on just the sole image of the spyshot, how can you know it is not CBR250R?  \n\nI was looking for the differences and also the sign of ‘150’ sticker anywhere but there is none to be found. Luckily, there is one difference that can confirm that this is the upcoming 2015 Honda CBR150R which is slated to be launched at Indonesia tomorrow.\n2014 Honda CBR250R\nLook at the exhaust muffler of the 2014 Honda CBR250R. Compared it with the spyshot above. You can see that the exhaust muffler of the CBR250R is enclosed in metal casing, whereby the CBR150R spyshot shows that the exhaust muffler is in black colour and covered by muffler protecter in metal colour.\nWe are hoping that Honda will use an all new engine to fit this bike that can provides more power and better fuel economy.\nWill this make its way to Malaysia? I don’t know. The price? Estimated around IDR 43million or RM11,628.00.\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2014/09/02/penampakan-jelas-all-new-2015-honda-cbr-150r-repsol-edition-made-by-honda-indonesia/\nAdvertisements",

I actually remembered to write this article after many sites has posted about the the Diesel Ducati which is a collaboration between the fashion brand, Diesel and Ducati. I thought at first it is the diesel-powered Ducati. But then, there is actual bike using diesel engine like this one that is made for military on which is based on the production Kawasaki KLR 650.  \n\nWhat is even better is that this bike is equipped with bullet-proof tyres. And I think this is the ultimate puncture proof tyre for now that I know (if you know better, tell me in the comment).Using diesel is good since it is cheaper than the petrol and gives more torque for the bike. This mean that it can pull easily from stationary up to its optimum RPM.\nThere are some disadvantage of using diesel engine to a bike. One of the deterring factor is the weight. The engine needs to accommodate the high compression of the piston inside the combustion chamber. The other factor is about the narrow powerband of the diesel engine that makes it need to use a lot more gear than normal bike to make the bike comfortable to ride. If you look at bus engine RPM, you can see that the maximum RPM is only at 6,000RPM. Normal petrol bike have maximum power output at 8,000RPM.\nSource: dieselbike.net\nAdvertisements",

With 294 Grand Prix races won in Road Racing World Championship, Aprilia holds the record for the most wins of any European manufacturer in the history of maximum motorcycle competition.\nThese are joined by an impressive 54 world titles: 38 in Road Racing World Championship (20 in 125 and 18 in 250), 7 in Superbike (Rider and Manufacturer double win in 2010, 2012 and 2014, manufacturers in 2013) and 9 in Off Road disciplines (7 in Supermoto and 2 in Trial).\nFor 2015, Aprilia has fine-tuned its Superbike flagship and upped its game with a lighter motorcycle (2.5kg less than the weight of its predecessor), made more powerful – thanks to a new engine breaking the 200hp mark. \nCombined with a revised chassis, better handling and an enhanced electronics package, the RSV4 is primed for victory, being more effective on the track and providing improved riding pleasure for the road. The exclusive numbered RF limited edition, which sees greater sophistication with refined suspension and wheels, is the reference point for sportiness and performance. Skills honed on the track have been transferred to the road-going product to provide everyone with the same excitement that the motorbikes prepared by Aprilia Racing do.\nUnmistakeable in its design lucidity and applied technology, the RSV4 is conceived around a 65° V4 engine never before seen on a production sport bike. The Aprilia RSV4 comes already equipped with all the electronic and technical refinements that a rider could want.\nTo celebrate the arrival of the new king of superbikes, NAZA Premira is offering Malaysians the Aprilia RSV4 RF Limited Edition (only 500 units available worldwide) characterised by a dedicated “Superpole” livery and elements of the Race Pack which includes exclusive aluminium forged rims and professional Öhlins suspension.\nThe style of the new RSV4 is the result of the perfect combination of form and function. The careful design led to the creation of the most compact full size sport bike on the market, where technical elements such as the impeccable aluminium double rail frame contribute to emphasising its racing vocation. The front end has been completely redesigned: now there is a new, more protective top fairing, created after a careful wind tunnel aerodynamics study, which provides better protection from the wind for riders of any height.\nThe Aprilia RSV4 is the world’s first full scale production motorcycle with a high performance narrow V4 engine, the most revolutionary and powerful engine ever built by Aprilia. It delivers more than 16 additional HP and crosses the 200HP threshold of maximum power output, making it one of the most thrilling sportbikes to ride,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA proven leader in the electronics realm, Aprilia continues to captivate with its APRC (Aprilia Performance Ride Control) software suite, including Aprilia Traction Control (eight-way-adjustable) and Aprilia Wheelie control. It also provides Aprilia Quick Shift and three Aprilia Launch Control settings (for use on track but also approved for street use) and highly advanced Race ABS. \nAprilia Tuono V4 1100 Factory Edition\nAprilia has brought the latest and most spectacular evolution of the sport naked bike dynasty, the Tuono V4 1100 Factory, to the road. A direct descendant of the RSV4, this motorcycle is best described as ‘adrenaline in its purest state’. The know-how acquired in years of victorious competition at top levels and the experience of the Tuono history now allow Aprilia to exceed limits which had previously seemed insurmountable.\nWith a revamped V4 engine (now taking it to 1100 cc and 175hp and maximum torque of 121Nm), and a redefined chassis, the Tuono V4 1100 Factory is a true performer and offers greater agility. The already exceptional APRC Package has been further developed to ensure a more effective ride of greater convenience. \nAprilia also introduces the possibility of connecting your smartphone to the vehicle through the V4-MP platform and two distinctly outfitted versions (Factory and RR) that have the same, strictly Aprilia character in common. This model features the Ohlins suspension, forks and steering damper, which takes the bike’s cornering brilliance to another level. Simply put, the Tuono V4 1100 Factory is the ultimate in performance, technology and real-world practicality.\nThe latest model sports a new look thanks to the more protective top fairing and the better aerodynamic penetration coefficient. The relative headlight unit changes as well, a whole 1.5 kg lighter, fitted with a LED technology position light and a more modern shape which better integrates with the overall design of the bike.\nTuono V4 1100 Factory stands out for its new rail fairing, derived from the RSV4’s, a true benchmark in sport motorbike design. The saddle is now more comfortable, even compared to its fairing-clad sister, thanks to the new foam creation procedure. Riders can still naturally ride two-up by mounting the dedicated saddle portion. Thanks to the 15 mm lower seating position and the new style handlebar, the on board ergonomics of both Tuono V4 1100 versions change, becoming more comfortable and increasing the feeling of complete control for the rider.\nThe third generation of APRC, standard equipment on the new Tuono V4 1100 units, fully integrates with the fine full Ride-by-Wire multimap electronic management of the revamped V4 engine. As always, the Tuono V4 benefits from specifically developed calibration, but it has been evolved even further in order to provide maximum thrills on the road and maximum performance on the track.\nThe Tuono V4 1100 range is fitted with a highly advanced Race ABS system, developed in collaboration with Bosch to guarantee maximum safety on the road, without sacrificing any performance on the track. The 9MP system, weighing a mere 2 kg, adopts an intervention strategy called RLM (Rear wheel Lift-up Mitigation) that limits rear wheel lift (stoppies) when braking sharply; In addition it can be disengaged and easily adjusted on 3 settings by accessing the instrument cluster control menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Aprilia RSV4 RF Limited Edition is available at the Basic Selling Price of RM138, 800 (inclusive of GST) whilst the Aprilia Tuono V4 1100 Factory is offered at the Basic Selling Price of RM118,800 (inclusive of GST). Both come with 2 years or 20,000km manufacturer’s warranty.\nMore exciting information about Aprilia Malaysia may be obtained at http://www.aprilia.my/ and https://www.facebook.com/apriliaofficialmalaysia.

I’m honoured to have the recognition by QBEE Motor Group which has noticed the importance of Internet media such MotoMalaya.net blog. It is also good to know that Manfred from QBEE Motor Group has invited me to go to Sepang MotoGP and sponsored me a K1 Grandstand ticket. That is actually my first MotoGP experience. Usually I just sit at home at watched it on TV. I remember that sometime I need to skip class just to watched the MotoGP which happens Sunday, which is not a weekend in Kelantan! At that time, the most popular rider is Mick Doohan with his Repsol Honda livery and single-sided swing-arm. It was a beautiful bike at that time. Now, the Honda glory has been liven up by Casey Stoner who just wins the 2011 MotoGP championship.  \nManfred from QBEE Motor Group with a little gift to Taufik - TMCblog\nI also got a chance to meet Taufik from the popular blog in Indonesia that is the TMCblog.com. QBEE Motor Group are good enough to present Taufik with a Shinko T-shirt.\nI’m very thankful and honoured to have a support from QBEE Motor Group.

        "135cc\n135lc\n135LC 5-speed\n150cc\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\n2015 Yamaha Exciter RC 150 – is this the 150LC? [UPDATED] \n\n\nPosted on December 11, 2014March 10, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nA clearer photo of the alleged 150LC (135LC in 150cc form) in yellow here is looking just a little different that the 135LC. We can easily recognise the wide fairing light and the wide body it have. \n\nThe rear is looking a little bit busy and the tyre looks like it is wider. Still retaining the monoshock rear swing arm. This Yamaha Exciter RC 150 is slated to release sometime next year mid December in Vietnam.\n\nUPDATE (12/12/2014): Also available is the Exciter RC GP Edition that comes in exciting grey base colour with the iconic Yamaha Race-Blu splashed over it in the speed-block shape. The wheels looks like it is inspired (or is it the same?) from the 2014 Yamaha FZ150i. The wheelbase are looking longer than usual but I can’t confirm it. This is indeed 150cc bike as you can see on the wording ‘150’ on the side panel of the GP Edition bike just about the Yamaha word.\n\nTransmission is 5-speed and this is confirmed by the word ‘5-speed’ shown on the picture above. Engine casing are now different and this makes it easy to differentiate between 135cc and 150cc LC. I like the colour of the GP edition as it comes in more blue colour coverage than the one we have seen earlier that have lots of white colour. The design of the livery is also very interesting. If you observe carefully, you can see the rear tyre hugger is also in a new design that is sharper and more pointed. It makes the bike looks fast even when not moving.\n\nSome readers are saying that the front fairing light looks like the one from the YZF-R25, and I agree with them. It is wider but now it is slimmer to make it look like it is looking sharply to the front. Sadly, the front and rear brake only consists of single-piston brake caliper which I think should be replaced with 2-piston caliper since this is 150cc bike that need more power in braking. Oh, the power. The power is rumored to be close to 16hp which is promising, but compared to FZ150i, it is only 14.75hp with the same 150cc engine. Maybe this is a different engine altogether?\nUPDATE (19/12/2014): Yamaha Exciter 150 RC / GP has been launched in Vietnam. Check out the news here.\n \nVia: Jeff Nouvo, Zing.vn and http://www.2banh.vn/threads/exciter-150-cua-yamaha-viet-nam-lo-dien-anh-thuc-te.21802/\nAdvertisements",

        "110cc\n150cc\nHonda\nhonda malaysia\nPCX150\nSpacy helmet in \n\n2013 Honda Spacy Helmet In and PCX 150 unveiled in Malaysia – Spacy RM4,999 – PCX RM10,688 \n\n\nPosted on October 31, 2012September 20, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nBoon Siew Honda Sdn Bhd is setting the trend in fun   and easy riding with the introduction of the All-New Spacy and the All-New PCX today. Both of these new global Automatic Transmission models – which have made its mark in Europe, America and around Asia – will be available in Malaysia, featuring advanced safety, improved dimensions and comfort styling.\nWith easy-to-ride, practicality, safety and fuel efficiency as the top features, the Spacy and PCX are packed with advanced technology and innovation. Both Automatic Transmission models are designed to be stylish and easy to handle, making riding even more enjoyable.  \nSpeaking at the launch, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda, Satoshi Okada said, “At Boon Siew Honda, we believe that there is always a bike for everyone, for every occasion, for every lifestyle. In a business dealing with of all kinds of motorbikes, there is always a place for Automatic Transmission models, which are simple to ride and maintain. Today, we are taking this line to a whole new level with the Spacy and PCX, two Automatic Transmission models with exciting new features.”\nHonda Spacy 110\nThe All-New Honda Spacy\nFunky Fun that comes with Functionality\nThe Spacy is designed for fun with high utility and big capacity. It is spacious at every level, from an 18-litre XL-sized utility box (U-Box) that can fit a full-face helmet to a 5.2L fuel tank that reduces the need for refuelling. With space being the key theme, the floor panel is also made larger, the seat wider, and the front inner box can fit a 500ml water bottle and other small things. The Spacy has utility and style all around. The excellent features also make for a more enjoyable ride for both rider and passenger!\nSafety and stability are highlighted in the new Spacy with its brake lock lever function and tubeless tyres. The brake lock lever function is easily activated with a quiet click, providing added relief for riders to avoid accidentally turning the throttle when idling. Braking is via a front disc brake that provides superior control even on slippery roads.\nTubeless tyres are a superior alternative to conventional tyres. The Spacy’s durable tubeless tyres ensure that air doesn’t dissipate all at once during a puncture. Adding to its safety feature, the Spacy has a special Side Stand Switch feature which activates an automatic engine shutdown when the side stand comes down, a design which also saves fuel consumption.\nVisibility both for the rider and of the rider to other motorists is critical. The Spacy with its headlight that is quick in illuminating corners and the big eye winker and fog light design that provides better visibility at night, enhances safety when riding in dark, rainy or foggy conditions. The rear lamp is elegant in design with the winkers separated from the tail light to increase visibility to trailing motorists.\nThe Honda Spacy runs on a fan-cooled, 4-stroke, 110cc single-cylinder OHC engine powered by Honda V-Matic Technology. It is economically fuel-efficient with 41.5km per litre while complying with the Euro II emission standards based on the ECE40 Mode test. The key shutter glows in the dark and has a magnetic locking system, providing ease of use while reducing theft risk.\nAvailable in Magellanic Black, Euphoria Red Metallic and Pearl Metalloid White, the Spacy has a On-The-Road road price of RM4,999.00 with 1 year comprehensive single rider insurance and a warranty period of 2 years or 20,000km, whichever comes first. The Spacy will also be available in another colour, Luminous Orange in March 2013.\n2013 Honda PCX 150\nThe All-New Honda PCX\nThe Luxurious and Feature-Laden Performance Automatic Transmission Model\nThe All-New PCX is a stylish Automatic Transmission model built as a luxurious Personal Comfort Sedan with the key elements of comfort and convenience, combined with high power performance and sporty design. This elegant Automatic Transmission model is also environmentally friendly.\nFor the first time, Honda’s Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system is made available in an automatic transmission line with the PCX, providing optimum burning velocity and cooling performance. Its 153cc single-cylinder, four stroke, liquid-cooled SOHC engine enhanced Smart Power (eSP) which is designed for durability, fuel economy, power and torque and coupled with quiet operation provides excellent fuel consumption of 50.2km per litre based on the ECE40 Mode test.\nAdding to this outstanding fuel efficiency is a new Idling Stop System, which automatically stops the engine when it is idle after 3 seconds. Within the system is also an ACG starter, which permits smooth starting, eliminating typical noise from the starter gear engagement or meshing. The engine restarts automatically when the throttle grip is twisted. The result is fuel savings of approximately 7% compared to when the system is not in function based on ECE R40 Mode test.\nTo achieve smoother and more effective braking, the Combined Brake System (CBS) operates between the front disc or three-piston caliper and real drum to equalise braking pressure.\nThe PCX uses 14-inch Aluminium Wheels with Tubeless Tyres, adding to its stability and safety. Another safety feature of the PCX is that the engine automatically shuts off when the side stand is down, courtesy of its Side-stand Switch.\nAdding to the exterior styling, the PCX comes with a Tail Light with Separate Winkers, giving it a sporty look while making the rider more visible to trailing motorists. The All-in-one Dual Grand Headlight with Position Lamp not only looks elegant, but also provides large headlights and a fog lamp for better visibility at night. Providing clear viewing of ride information is an electronic speedometer and an LCD screen displaying the fuel gauge and Idling Stop System.\nFor longer distance travelling, comfortable seating and spacious storage are very important. The PCX addresses this with a Wide Seat with Sit-in Riding Position, a console box to fit personal items such as sun glasses and riding gloves and a 25-litre Extra Large U-Box that can store a full-face helmet and more.\nThe 5.9-litre fuel tank is made extra convenient when refueling with a Pop-up Opening. The features laden and luxurious PCX will certainly give riders the utmost comfort and peace of mind when riding, making it the perfect everyday accomplice.\nThe PCX comes in two variants. The Deluxe variant which come in Pearl Metalloid White with the road price of RM10,888.00 and the Standard variant which comes in Pearl Magellanic Black and Radiate Grey Metallic at the road price of RM10,688.00. Both variants come with 1 year comprehensive single rider insurance and a warranty period of 2 years or 20,000km, whichever comes first.\nFor more information, please visit www.boonsiewhonda.com.my or call the Boon Siew Honda Toll-Free number at 1800-88-3993 (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm, except for public holidays).\nAdvertisements",

The name is PRO Shade. This would be a great thing to see in country in South East Asia which have a hot sun shining almost everyday. There is a usual style that is use by another manufacturer that placed the visor between the outer shell and inner padding. This new Arai PRO Shade is different since it is installed outside on the outer shell, so, the safety of the shell is not compromised. Even though it is on the outer shell, the visor can still be flip down easily. It is also all-weather system that ensures the durability. Can be removed for easy cleaning. Check out the official words from Arai Helmet Europe:  With the new PRO Shade System, Arai now introduces a (patented) revolutionary solution to a well-known problem: sun glare!\nIt is nowadays quite common to use a retractable sun-visor that is situated between the helmet’s outer- and inner shell to protect against sun glare. However, it’s Arai’s opinion that this construction could affect the performance of a helmet during impact.\nAs the PRO Shade System is completely mounted on the outside of the helmet, it will not in any way negatively affect the performance of the helmet. It confirms to Arai’s R75 Shape concept.\nThe PRO Shade System is a small peak that is locked in position. Unlocking is easy; just pull the PRO Shade System forward. Than it can be flipped down with a flick of the hand, to perform as an effective sun-visor.\nThe PRO Shade System is the complete all-weather system for serious touring riders, offering protection against: sun glare, fogging and misting. Especially for riders that prefer an upright seating position and/or the comfort of a fairing, the PRO Shade System will enhance the rider’s comfort significantly.\nUnique features:\n• Complete system, mounted on clear MAX Vision visor\n• Enhanced aerodynamics\n• Increased helmet stability\n• Removable for easy cleaning\n• No contact with visor: no scratching\n• Fits all Arai “SAI” full-face helmets\nAdvertisements",

        "Galaxy Slide\nKYT Helmet \n\nReview: KYT Galaxy Slide open-face helmet with sun visor – RM211 \n\n\nPosted on January 29, 2015January 29, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nKYT Galaxy Slide is an open face helmet with a sun visor included to make it available to protect you from the sun in the day but clear enough to be worn in the night. I always liked a clear visor helmet that comes with sun visor and it seems that many are now adopting the feature. A good helmet must provide all around comfort and the sun visor features really adds the comfort level up. Read more about it after the jump with lots of pictures:  \n\nOn the above picture, you can see the sun visor is slided out.\nSlide mechanism on the left side. O = Open. C= Close.\nThere are few mechanisms available to slide out the sun visor but this one from KYT features an easy sliding mechanism fitted on the left side of the helmet. It is easy enough to use and the mechanism feels very solid to withstand the everyday abuse.\n\nThe padding of the one I’m using here is for the size of M, which fits my head perfectly. This is one of the most comfortable helmet padding I’ve tried for an open face helmet priced below RM300. The fitments is perfect for me, but it can be not suitable for you, so, when you are thinking to buy it, try it first. The padding and the insulation prevents the noise from the surrounding gets into the helmet and this make it one of the most silent open face helmet I’ve ever tried again! It can be good or bad. Some people like to wear Apollo helmet with that thin padding since they want to hear the surrounding and also hear their awesome exhaust note, but for long distance riding, a well noise insulated helmet is a good thing.\n\nOne interesting thing that I’ve found about this helmet is the clip on the fastener belt (tali pengikat dagu) that prevents the belt from flapping around. Without this clip, you will always get slapped by the belt to your neck when you are riding fast.\n\nThis is a great simple idea that works nicely when I tested it.\n\nNo worries for the safety regulation as it is JPJ approved with the E3 stamp.\n\nOverall, I’m satisfied with this KYT Galaxy Slide open face helmet and can be my next daily helmet. It got good design, great fastener belt with clip, nice airflow all around it, safety approved and fits my head profile perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice for KYT Galaxy Slide is RM211 and available via QBEE Motor (https://www.facebook.com/QBEEmotor?fref=ts).\nAdvertisements",

        "car\nHonda \n\nHonda to Begin Sales of All-new “N BOX +” Mini-vehicle – DOHC Turbo! \n\n\nPosted on July 5, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nTOKYO, Japan, July 5, 2012 – Honda Motor Co., Ltd. announced it will begin sales of the N BOX + (“N BOX plus”), the second model of the new mini-vehicle N Series, at dealerships across Japan on July 6, 2012. Following the introduction of the N BOX, which realized one of the largest*1 interior spaces among all mini-vehicles in the market through adoption of newly-designed platform and powerplant, Honda is now introducing the N BOX + which was developed under the concept of “adding (“plus”) new possibilities.”\nTwo innovative ideas were added to the large cargo area made possible by the combination of Honda’s innovative packaging technology, the center-tank layout, and the newly-developed powerplant. The “Universal Bridge*2” combines a sloped floor and an attachable aluminum slope*3, which makes the loading and unloading of luggage and other items easier. The “Multi-space System*2” realizes versatile space arrangements with three different sized boards.\nThe addition of these innovative ideas enables the N BOX + to accommodate diverse customer needs in a wide range of vehicle uses including daily routines, recreational activities and special needs care-giving.  \n\nThe 2-tone color style , which has different color combinations for the body and roof, was established to enable each owner to more strongly express their personality in a fun way, expanding the potential for the joy of customers.\nThe N BOX, the first model of the new mini-vehicle N Series, was Honda’s proposal for a “mini mini-van” which leverages its overwhelming spaciousness beyond the concept of mini-vehicle to enhance occupant comfort. The vehicle has been well received by a large number of customers, especially families with children, and cumulative sales since the sales launch in December of last year has already reached approximately 100,000 units.\n\n*1\nHonda’s internal research (as of July 2012), comparison based on the interior size (length, width, height)\n*2\nThe Universal Bridge and the Multi-space System are registered trade marks of Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\n*3\nAluminum slope is available as a dealer option\n\n[ Key features of N BOX + ]\nThe “Multi-space System” realizes versatile space arrangements with three boards:\n\nA wide variety of arrangements including several cargo modes or a bed mode which folds flat can quickly be made using large and small multi-boards and an end board.\nThe “Universal Bridge” combines a sloped floor and an attachable aluminum slope, to improve the ease of loading and unloading:\n\n\nIn addition to sloping the low floor which was realized by the center-tank layout, Honda’s innovative packaging technology, an aluminum slope was made available to bridge the vehicle floor and the ground, making it easier to load and unload heavy items on wheels such as a small motorbike.\n\n\nVisibility and sense of security beyond the mini-vehicle category:\n\n\nIn addition to realizing an eye point as high as that of a mini-van, installation of mirrors which help eliminate blind spots around the left-front wheel, left-rear wheel, and lower rear make it easier to pull up closer to an object on the side or to park.\n\n\nA high-performance powertrain realizes both excellent driving performance and fuel economy at a high level:\n\n\nSmooth and powerful driving was realized through the combination of a high-output/high-torque DOHC engine which generates output and torque at the top level of the class and a CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) with high power efficiency. Excellent fuel economy of 21.2km/L*4 was realized through adoption of various features including the idle stop system and ECON mode system.\nA DOHC Turbo engine with high-performance turbo charger is available in all grades.\n\n\n*4\nN BOX + and N BOX + Custom FWD vehicles (excluding turbo model) measured in JC08 mode (Testing by Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism)\n\n\nHigh safety performance and enhanced safety features:\n\n\nClass-leading omni-directional collision safety performance was realized with the newly-designed engine and new load distribution structure.\nVSA (Vehicle Stability Assist) system is standard equipment on all types.\nHSA (Hill Start Assist) that temporarily prevents the vehicle from rolling backward when starting on an upward incline is installed as standard equipment on all types.\nDriver-side i-SRS airbag system (with continuously staged inflation) and SRS airbag system for front passenger are standard equipment on all types.\nThe impact-mitigating headrests in the front seat which are designed to help mitigate the likelihood of a neck injury in the event of collision, and the interior which protects occupants’ heads from impact are adopted.\n\n\nEnvironmental performance:\n\n\nAll types are certified by Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism as complying with the 2005 – 75% emissions standard.\nG and G・L Package (FWD/4WD) for both N BOX + and N BOX + Custom comply with the 2015 fuel economy standard.\nMore than 90 percent of the entire vehicle is recyclable*5.\n\n\n*5\nCalculated based on the “Definition of and Guideline for Calculating the Percentage of Recyclable Materials in New Automobiles” (Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc., 1998)\n\n\nAdvertisements",
        "250cc\n250RR Mono\n250SL\nKawasaki \n\n2014 Kawasaki Ninja 250SL unveiled in Malaysia – RM17,689.00 (basic) \n\n\nPosted on May 22, 2014May 27, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nFinally the awaited Kawasaki Ninja 250SL has breaks cover in Sepang for its launch. Ninja 250SL comes with 250cc single-cylinder DOHC 4-valve engine. SL refers to the acronym of Super Light that is seemingly correct since the curb mass is 151kg. This is 17kg lighter than the Ninja 250 2-cylinder.\nPower extracted by Ninja 250SL is 28hp at 9,700RPM and torque at 22.6Nm at 8,200RPM.\nOnly yellow and lime green colour are available for now.\n\nThe body comes with slim compact trellis-like chassis frame (but the official specs says this is Diamond type) for strength and sportier handling of the bike but able to keep it low cost for the masses. Also seen there is the same wheel design which is used for the Ninja 250 2-cylinder that shows 10-spoke Y-shape wheel.  \n\nHere is another view of the 10-spoke Y-shape wheel that is looking very nice.\n\nOverall design are made to be as sporty as its predecessor, Ninja 150R, which is based on super sports category. This mean it will have lower steering position for the rider to hug the tank and slips into the air bubble of the bike to avoid the wind.\n\nAs predicted, the engine comes from the KLX250 which is an engine from an expensive bike. This 1-cylinder 250cc engine are able to push out 28hp which is only less than 4hp compared to 250cc 2-cylinder engine of Ninja 250 at 32hp!\n\nThis could be a great engine that provide almost instant torque from low RPM and light enough to take it to the max RPM limit. Powerful, lightweight and torquey. But, what about its sound?\n\nKawasaki still adopts the hot air radiator deflector to deflect the heat away from the riders feet just like the way it is implemented on the Ninja 250 and the Z250.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this bike is the used of Uni-Trak suspension that is identical to what racing bike uses. Honda have implemented the similar suspension setup with the name Prolink which is put on Honda CB150R Streetfire and CBR250R. Whether Unitrak or Prolink, this setup provide a better feel of the bike and improves the handling as the suspension can work nicely whether in low or high speed.\n\nKawasaki hasn’t left out the design of the meter to be modernised along with the modern looks of the bike. The meter cluster is luxurious and tasteful enough for modern rider. There is the big speed speedometer display. Above it is the rev counter. Clock, trip meter and fuel capacity indicator are also there too. On the sides there is battery fault, high beam, EFI fault, ABS and oil pressure indicator. It is a very informative meter cluster indeed. It can be further improved if they decide to put the gear indicator into it. The implementation of the gear indicator on the Suzuki GSX-R1000 is the best I have ever seen.\n\nModern bike needs modern technologies and this Ninja 250SL comes with ABS brake system to aid the handling of the bike in difficult conditions (but currently not available here in Malaysia). The brake comes with 2-piston caliper single disc brake system for the front and also 2-piston caliper disc brake system for the rear.\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja 250SL/RR Mono Non-ABS Pearl Shining Yellow with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja 250SL/RR Mono Non-ABS Lime Green with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja 250SL Tech Specs\n\n\nEngine type: Liquid-cooled, 4-stroke 1 Cyl DOHC\n\n\nDisplacement : 249 cm³\n\n\nBore x stroke : 72.0 x 61.2 mm\n\n\nCompression ratio: 11.3:1\n\n\nValve/Induction system: DOHC, 4 valves\n\n\nFuel system Fuel injection: ø38 mm x 1\n\n\nIgnition : Keihin, Transistorized Ignition\n\n\nElectric: Starting\n\n\nLubrication : Forced lubrication, wet sump\n\n\nMaximum power 20.6 kW / 9,700 rpm\n\n\nMaximum torque 22,6 N·m { kgf·m} / 8,200 rpm\nSS 400m : 15,5 s\n\n\nSS 200m : 9,7 s\n\n\nMax Speed : 153 km/h\n\n\nTransmission 6-speed, return\n\n\nFinal Drive Sealed chain\n\n\nPrimary reduction ratio 2.800 (84/30)\n\n\nGear ratios: 1st 3.000 (393/11)\n\n\nGear ratios: 2nd 1.933 (29/159)\n\n\nGear ratios: 3rd 1.444 (31/22)\n\n\nGear ratios: 4th 1.217 (28/23)\n\n\nGear ratios: 5th 1.045 (23/22)\n\n\nGear ratios: 6th 0.923 (24/26)\n\n\nFinal reduction ratio 3.000 (42/14)\n\n\nClutch : Wet multi-disc, manual\n\n\nFrame type Tube diamond\n\n\nRake/Trail 24° / 90 mm\n\n\nWheel travel, front 110 mm\n\n\nWheel travel, rear 116 mm\n\n\nTyre, front 100/80-17 M/C (52S)\n\n\nTyre, rear 130/70-17 M/C (62S)\n\n\nSteering angle, left / right 36° / 36°\n\n\nSuspension, front telescopic fork\n\n\nSuspension, rear Bottom-Link Uni-Trak swing arm\n\n\nBrakes, front Single 263 mm petal disc.

Honda is accelerating the effort to reduce its environmental footprint by providing FI-equipped models at affordable prices to facilitate popularization of FI-equipped models.\nHonda began motorcycle production in Indonesia in 1971, and the cumulative production volume reached the 30 million-unit milestone in March of this year. Industry-wide demandin the rapidly growing Indonesian market is forecasted to exceed 8 million units this year, setting a new all-time record. AHJ sales for 2011 is expected to be approximately 4.27 million units, which is approximately a 25% increase compared to 2010 sales of 3.42 million units. Honda will continue fulfilling the diversifying needs of customers by providing products beyond customer expectations with speed, affordability and low CO2 emissions.

The bike bears a significant resemblance of the Yamaha 125Z.\nThe bike itself is equipped with great specs to begin with. We can see the use of the front and rear disc brake, monoshock rear suspension, 120cc lean-angle 2-stroke engine. The engine are able to push 15.5PS at 8,000RPM and 1.50kgmf at 7,000RPM. Transmission is checked with the 6-speed gearbox. The tyre is wide at 2.50-17 at the front and 2.75-17 at the rear. All that packaged in 101kg of total weight.  \nInteresting. Anyone have seen this in Malaysia anywhere?\nvia:  http://dwinugros.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/serial-bebek-bebek-jago-asli-import-4/\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nmotogp \n\nMarquez takes victory in spectacular season opener in Qatar and Rossi on second position \n\n\nPosted on March 24, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nMarc Marquez got his MotoGP™ World Championship title defence off to the perfect start after the Repsol Honda rider emerged victorious from a closely-fought contest with Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi. \n\nStarting from pole position, Marquez traded places with Rossi at the front of the field numerous times throughout the twenty-two lap race, before Marquez made the race-winning pass in the final stages to take the chequered flag by 0.259 seconds. In third place at the Qatar Grand Prix was Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa who crossed the finish line 3.370 seconds after his teammate.\n\nThe track temperature for the race was the coolest recorded over the whole race weekend, with a peak recording of just 20°C which brought with it a spike in humidity levels. This resulted in many riders commenting after the race that grip levels were lower than the Warm Up session four hours earlier. Although conditions were quite cool, only two riders selected the soft compound front slick, with the rest of the grid opting for the hard compound front slick. For the rear tyre, only race-winner Marc Marquez selected the hard compound rear slick for the race, and the medium compound rear was by far the popular choice, with fifteen riders selecting this option. Seven of the eleven Open-class entrants selected the soft compound rear slick for the Qatar Grand Prix.  \n\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“That was a fantastic way to start the season; it was great to see riders from so many different teams fighting for position in the opening half of the race. Congratulations to Marc Marquez and Honda on winning the first race of the season, and well done to Valentino for pushing him all the way to the finish line. Every session this weekend was closely-contested, culminating in a thoroughly exciting race which I am sure was appreciated by MotoGP fans all around the world. I hope this trend of close racing continues for the rest of the season, starting with the Grand Prix of the Americas in three weeks’ time”\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“The 10pm start for the race in Qatar means we had cool and humid conditions for the Qatar Grand Prix, and listening to the comments from riders after the race, it seems this reduced the grip levels compared to the Warm Up session. As expected we had big variation in tyre strategies for the race, with all our front and rear slick options being utilised. I am happy to see that Marc was able to be so competitive on the hard compound rear slick, we made a big development with this option late last year for improved edge grip and the race result today showed it’s a viable race option for this year.”\n\nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“I’m very happy with the victory as I didn’t expect this result. I felt better physically yesterday but I still had a question mark over how I would go in the race. I chose the hard rear tyre so I was a bit cautious at the start of the race, but then it was ok so then I decided to push. The battle with Valentino was very exciting and we swapped positions many times, last year he came out on top but this year it was my turn. I hope to have many more nice battles like that this year.”\n \nQatar MotoGP™ Top Ten Race Classification \n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’40.561\n\n\n\n\n\nHard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n 42’40.820\n\n\n0.259\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’43.931\n\n\n3.370\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n42’52.184\n\n\n11.623\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n42’52.720\n\n\n12.159\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n43’09.087\n\n\n28.526\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nScott REDDING\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n 43’13.154\n\n\n32.593\n\n\nHard\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nNicky HAYDEN\n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar\n\n\n43’13.189\n\n\n32.628\n\n\nHard\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nColin EDWARDS\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n43’20.108\n\n\n39.547\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n43’23.921\n\n\n43.360\n\n\nHard\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",
        "motogp \n\nRound 10: Indianapolis MotoGP™ victory makes it ten out of ten for Marquez in 2014 \n\n\nPosted on August 11, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Marc Marquez made it ten wins from ten starts in the 2014 MotoGP™ season as the reigning world champion stormed to victory at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\nStarting from pole position, Marquez had a poor start off the line and as the field completed the first lap he found himself in fourth place before he began his fight-back. Following an exciting battle for the lead, Marquez made the race-winning pass on the eleventh lap and was able to increase his pace to ultimately take the chequered flag by 1.803 seconds ahead of Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo who finished in second place. Third place went to Lorenzo’s teammate Valentino Rossi who led the first ten laps of the race after a brilliant start.\nConditions were dry today, with ambient and track temperatures reaching their highest level of the race weekend, with a peak track temperature of 48°C recorded at the start of the race. The higher track temperatures didn’t have an effect on race tyre choice, with riders selecting the same tyre combinations they used in yesterday’s practice sessions. All except two riders selected the medium compound front slick, with Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa andOcto IodaRacing Team’s Danilo Petrucci opting instead for the hard compound front slick. Rear tyre choice saw almost every rider select their harder rear slick option; hard compound for the Factory Honda and Yamaha, and medium compound for the Ducati and open-class riders, with only GO&FUN Honda Gresini’s Alvaro Bautista breaking the trend by selecting his softer, medium compound rear slick for the race. Tyre performance at this year’s Indianapolis Grand Prix which featured a revised track layout and new tarmac was exemplary, with ten of the fifteen riders that finished the race setting their fastest lap in the second half of the race.\nMarquez’s perfect win record means he has amassed 250 championship points to lead teammate Dani Pedrosa by 89 points, while Rossi remains four points behind Pedrosa and in third place in the standings.  \n \nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“The new layout at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was a welcome change and resulted in some great racing today, but once again Marc was too strong so congratulations to him and Repsol Honda on another emphatic victory. The early stages of the race were particularly exciting with many riders on different makes of machine challenging for the race lead, and this bodes well for the rest of the season. I am pleased with how our tyres performed at the revised Indianapolis circuit with excellent levels of safety, performance and durability, and I am now looking forward to next week’s Czech Grand Prix as in the past few years we have had some very close races there.”\n \nMasao Azuma – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“Although track temperatures were warmer today there were no surprises with the riders’ race tyre choice, with every rider selecting the tyre combination that they preferred during the practice sessions. The medium compound front slick was the popular choice all weekend and this was chosen by almost every rider today, while the harder rear slick options were used by all except one rider for the race. The majority of the riders managed to set their best lap times in the closing stages and tyre performance was very consistent throughout the twenty-seven laps, so I am happy that our tyre allocation proved to be ideally suited to the new Indianapolis MotoGP circuit.”\n \nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“The race was so hard especially as the track temperature was higher than yesterday so I struggled a bit in the beginning and so I stayed behind Valentino until I felt comfortable with the tyres. When I felt the front tyre was working well I could improve my pace and take the lead and although it was difficult to build a gap, in the end I could take the twenty-five points.”\n \nIndianapolis MotoGP™: Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’07.041\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’08.844\n\n\n1.803\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’13.599\n\n\n6.558\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’17.057\n\n\n10.016\n\n\nHard\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n42’24.848\n\n\n17.807\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n42’26.645\n\n\n19.604\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n45’27.800\n\n\n20.759\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n42’46.837\n\n\n39.796\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nScott REDDING\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n42’47.548\n\n\n40.507\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nHiroshi AOYAMA\n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar\n\n\n43’02.801\n\n\n55.760\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",
        "BMW \n\nBMW Group Designworks USA Thermaltake Computer Mouse \n\n\nPosted on August 31, 2012 by eddy \n\n\nMunich/Taipei. Totally focused and oblivious to his surroundings, the young man speaks urgently but quietly into his headset. One hand hovers above the keyboard, the other on the computer mouse. On the monitor screen in front of him a virtual figure is chasing through a labyrinth of alleys and dead-ends, veering off, flattening itself against walls, reacting to opponents – all this happening at split-second commands. The speed with which these cyber scenes unfold is breathtaking. It’s like being taking along for a spin with a Formula One pilot. This is Kai “Kaii” Schäfer, one of the best German professional gamers, at work. Together with Thermaltake, renowned provider for electronic gaming accessories and based in Taiwan, BMW Group´s think tank of creative specialists, DesignworksUSA, has developed a high-end computer mouse specifically for tech pros like Schäfer and all those dedicated amateurs hoping to match their wits against the lightning-fast best. You need a speedy mouse for this.\nSupport from the Gaming Pro.\nThis piece of technology, resembling a tiny racecar, has about as much to with those grey plastic shells scooting over mouse pads like a family van does with a high performance supercar. Niko von Saurma, the director of the Munich studioof DesignworksUSA, takes up one of the three prototypes and handles it with the care afforded a rare artifact. And that is what this sleek concoction, outfitted for the rigors of professional computer sports, is set to become. Officially, this latest innovative example of industrial design is called Pro-Gaming Computer Mouse Level 10 M. Anyone who’s ever tried their hand at a computer game knows that Level 10 is reserved for the very, very good. Someone like the pro-gamer “White Ra”, who shared his first-hand experience during the developing process. Level 10 M has the potential to become a “game changer”, says Tony Liu. For the director of T t esports, the gaming division of Thermaltake, “the mouse is an extension of the player´s soul”. It is no less than the conduit into the game. Just like a basketball shoe, a golf club or a cockpit, a professional´s mouse needs to be customized to meet the competition needs of tech’s best athletes.  \n \nDesign a new ingredient for digital athletic top performance.\nDesignworksUSA´s mighty mouse does indeed fulfill the mantra of every designer: form follows function. It is a two-part construction, with the upper half seeming to float above the base. Made of an alloy also used in aeronautics and architecture, Level 10 M is both lightweight and immune to corrosive effects. The top part, where the gamer´s hand would be resting for hours during competitions, can be individually adjusted for height and lateral inclination. The mouse is also outfitted with a number of keys, which a gamer can set to meet specific demands. The software packed into the stunning hardware is also able to read out DPi-rates for gaming visuals. The drilling in the upper shell serves to ventilate a player´s palms during the game – even top-seeded gamers break into a cold sweat at heart-stopping moments. As a special highlight this mouse can even be illuminated in different colors.\n \nThis has now been the second project where Thermaltake and DesignworksUSA pooled their respective resources. The first was the Level 10 computer chassis, which made a huge splash in gaming circles. With a computer up and running and a mouse set to go, both companies are contemplating enlarging the Level 10 gaming portfolio of must-haves. The blogosphere was buzzing with anticipation when the designers and Thermaltake together presented their high-tech mouse at the international computer fair CEBit in Germany in the spring of this year. Equally at COMPUTEX Taipei in the early summer the mouse received a lot of praise and positive feedback in the web as well as the “COMPUTEX Design and Innovation”-Award.\n \nKey Role for Ergonomic solutions.\nThe Level 10 M Mouse is an ingeniously designed piece of High Tech. The greatest challenge for the designers was to translate the geometric language of the lead product, the Level 10 Computer chassis onto a piece of equipment which naturally asks for ergonomic solutions. DesignworksUSA profited from its vast work for a great variety of industries far from the automotive world in which the designers discover trends, new phenomena and design developments in order to create world class creative solutions for its mother company BMW Group as well as for other clients outside the automobile field.\n \nGame or Sports? The New Formula 1 of Tomorrow?\nTwo of the most popular electronic games at the international meets drawing pros are car racing and football. To compete at a high level in computer and video games demands the same set of skills as spending off-time with a Nintendo or Playstation set-up at home: hand-eyes coordination, reaction time, spatial awareness, control and tactical acumen. Except that these talents have been honed to the expertise that separates a weekend golfer from a Masters champion. In this business success is a matter of split seconds. Professional gamers, especially those qualifying for the annual World Cyber Games, train as seriously and assiduously as their more physically oriented counterparts in the real world. Putting in six to ten hours per day, immersed in the augmented reality of their virtual game scenario, navigating mouse and keyboard at the blink of an eye, is necessary in order to compete against the best in this brotherhood. But these computer athletes also need to train physically to have the stamina for twelve-hour bouts and often spend time in a kind of boot camp to prepare for the big events. Contrary to the geek image of gaming, players aren´t generally loners, however, but form teams that are financed and outfitted by sponsors such as the Apollos, that sport the T t esports colors. In gaming circles these groups are called clans, based on a legendary computer game called “Quake”.\n \nPhenomenon with high prize money.\nWhat draws the young gamers to this form of sport is not just the thrill of performing at Level 10. By now there is big money involved. Winners can easily cash into a million dollars, much like the top poker stakes, not least because big-name sponsors like Nike and Pepsi-Cola have discovered the hip allure of e-sports for themselves. A good professional can earn up to 250 000 dollars a year. Within Asia there are special stations televising the competitions, with the US and Europe following lead. For these TV shows, the pro teams get trained, styled and coached for the public show down.  There are gaming stars in this locked-in world of halls full of busy computer screens just as there is the usual media hype.\n \nIt is only really since the eighties that the fledgling virtual world began offering a state of play. Ever since the advent of home computers, the rise of the Internet and faster and more powerful broadband technology has electronic gaming evolved into that – still somewhat hidden – mass phenomenon. Tony Liu pointed out, that at times up to 15 million people are online to play a game. Which is also why it was a real-time, real-world disaster when Sony´s online gaming platform was hacked, disclosing account holders’ data.\nDesignworksUSA revolutionizes the World of Gaming. Thermaltakes Team Apollo at work. (08/2012)\n \n The features of the Level 10 M Mouse:\n\n3D Steering Axis Movement: The Mouse is divided into lower and top part which seems to float over the base. This part which is also the essential steering element of the mouse can be adjusted in regards to height and angle. The 3D dimensional character of the mouse provides for new and highly sufficient axis movements in various directions and makes the mouse fit as many gamers’ preferences as possible.\n\n \n\nSolid Aluminum base: Commonly used in the aerospace industry and in architecture, this material is characterized by its high resistance to corrosion. It ensures that the user’s Level 10 experience is durable and resilient to mouse-gliding movement.\n\n \n\nAir-Through Ventilation System: Additionally the Mouse is fitted with exquisite texture – a perforated surface which provides for a better air and temperature exchange as a means of passive ventilation, solving issues due to heavy use and direct touch of gaming equipment and the rise of temperatures of the hand.\n\n \n\nIntelligent Software Application: The Level 10 M Mouse is a programmable gaming mouse capable of using the most comprehensive software application to customize settings based on user’s needs. The Mouse has 2 regular keys on top and 5 additional keys at the side. Each key is programmable by software application by a single press with the finger. The so called “Z” key is especially designed for 5 different commands. There is a total of 11 programmable command keys on Level 10 M Mouse while the “Z” key offers another function: During the gaming mode this key can switch between up to 5 gaming profiles. In addition, the polling rate and the 7 lighting-effect colors of the Mouse are also customizable. The Level 10 M Mouse is equipped with 8200 DPI, adjustable from 800, 1600, 3200 to 5000 (default setting), and customizable by software application up to 8200 DPI. The Function-Lock Mechanism also serves to avoid accidental error command by locking side keys during gaming mode.\n\n \nLevel 10 Mouse in the market.\nAs of August 27th, 2012, the mouse will be available at most major retailer stores and online stores in the US, in Europe and Asia. The Level 10 M Mouse will also be displayed at Tt eSports’ website at www.ttesports.com\nAvailable in four colors: Diamond Black, Iron White, Military Green and Blazing Red. Sales price will be around 99 US Dollar.\n \nAbout BMW Group DesignworksUSA.\nBMW Group DesignworksUSA is a creative consultancy that’s been driving innovation for forty years.

This NSC110 comes with PGM-FI for the European model for better fuel efficiency and lower emission to meet the standard that has become stricter everyday.\nFuel efficiency is rated at 50.2km/l which is a good number considering this is a scooter. Scooter are known to consume much more fuel compare to moped which have normal chain and sprocket transmission as opposed to belt-drive system.\nThe capacity of the tank also has been increased to 5.5 liter which can be considered gargantuan for this kind of bike. For comparison, Honda Wave Dash 110 only have 3.7 liter of fuel capacity and Honda Icon 110 only have 3.5 liter of fuel capacity. Large fuel tank are welcomed for this kind of scooter since it can provide longer distance riding with fewer fuel stops.\nHonda NSC110 retain the sharp styling with aerodynamic package for the overall look and make it look fast, even when standing still. Also can be seen in the sketch drawing is the headlamp visor which is a good addition to provide the sharp and fast look.\nI’m hoping this NSC110 will be a global model so that we in Malaysia will get the taste of PGM-FI equipped scooter!\nOriginal link after the jump  http://world.honda.com/NSC110/index.html\n \nAdvertisements",

        "cub prix racing \n\nRound 9 Jempol Petronas AAM Malaysian Cub Prix: Affendi Rosli wins CP130, Zaqhwan takes his maiden championship \n\n\nPosted on November 2, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nHonda’s Mohd Zaqhwan Zaidi clinched his maiden CP130 title with a comfortable third place finish in Round 9 of the PETRONAS AAM Malaysian Cub Prix Championship in Jempol, Negeri Sembilan on Sunday while Mohd Affendi Rosli won the race with a brilliant performance.\nIt was a dream weekend for Zaqhwan after the only man who could stop him, Norizman Ismail (Harian Metro Y-TEQ SCK Honda Racing) came in eighth.\nThe Givi Honda Yuzy Racing rider was in solid form to qualify for front row and made a good start when the lights went off but deteriorating track conditions forced him to be cautious.  \nEven so, that did not stop the 19-year old from punching through Mohd Iskandar Raduan, Mohd Zamri Baba and Ahmad Fazli Sham to finish the race in third place with 14’46.782s, ultimately sealing the title with 161 points.\nAffendi (PETRONAS Yamaha CKJ) meanwhile put in a spectacular performance to dominate the entire 18-lap race in 14’44.125s while teammate, Ahmad Afif Amran came second, 14’45.911s.\n“I am lost for words and over the moon,” said an emotional Zaqhwan.\n“We came to Jempol aware we could secure the title given the point advantage, but to actually win it, nothing can prepare you for that. I am really overwhelmed right now. A million thanks to my manager, Shahrol Yuzy for guiding me to this very day and congratulations to the team who has been working endlessly to make sure I win this championship. You guys deserve this,” he added.\nReflecting on the race, Zaqhwan commented, “This must have been one of my toughest races since stepping up to the CP130. It felt like everyone wanted to stop me and the battles were close.”\n“Naturally I wanted to win but Affendi had a better start and managed to get the holeshot. I was riding sixth and struggled to get ahead and I really had to push to get ahead of Iskandar, Zamri and Fazli. Once I passed them it was between Afif and I but at that point my bike was already at its limit. If I pushed it any further, we would have ended up crashing so I chose to play it safe to the finish line.”\nThe penultimate round of the Malaysian Cub Prix Championship also marked a memorable occasion for Mohd Izzat Zaidi Salehan as he secured the CP115 overall title when closest title rival and teammate, Zaidy Mohd Zaifaizal finished seventh.\nThe Motul Yamaha YY Pang ended the chase in style by winning the 15-lap race in 12’30.085s, ahead of seasoned contender, Elly Idzlianizar Ilias (M Seki Liberty Honda) with 12’31.023s.\nAbdul Muhaimin Roslan (PETRONAS Yamaha Maju) came in third 12’33.743s.\n“To be frank, I did not expect to win the crown with one more race to spare. I expected Zaidy Zaifaizal to finish quite close to me,” said an elated Izzat.\n“Nevertheless, it was far from an easy race. Elly used all his experience to deny me the lead in the first three laps. But then he made a mistake and lost control of his bike. I took that opportunity to slip through, build a gap and maintain a consistent pace to the finish line.”\nIzzat who won the title with 178 points went on to add, “I am extremely happy to win the championship but this victory does not just belong to me. It also belongs to the entire Motul Yamaha YY Pang crew, sponsors, family, friends and of course our die-hard fans. This win goes out to all of you.”\nReigning WIRA Champion, Khairul Idham Pawi maintained his flawless run as the Kozi Yam Honda Racing rider claimed his eighth successive victory in the age-capped category.\nKhairul bounced back from a botched start to steal the lead from Fairuz Nasir (Felda Pbafb Tech Racing) before pulling away from the pack, concluding the 12-lap race in 10.01.312s.\nFairuz was forced to settle for second place with 10’12.012s while Mohd Afiki Supaat (Jetron Apido Team PJM) finished third in 10’12.176s.\nThe win gives Khairul a perfect total of 216 points with Afiki taking second 108 points back followed by Fairuz third in the rankings, 122 points adrift.\n \nResults\nCP130\nRace\n1.Mohd Affendi Rosli (Yamaha) 14’44.125s\n2.Ahmad Afif Amran (Yamaha) 14’45.911s\n3.Mohd Zaqhwan Zaidi (Honda) 14’46.782s\n4.Ahmad Fazli Sham (Yamaha) 14’47.849s\n5.Mohd Iskandar Raduan (Yamaha) 14’49.763s\n \nOverall Standings\n1.Mohd Zaqhwan Zaidi (Honda) 161 points\n2.Ahmad Afif Amran (Yamaha) 131 points\n3.Norizman Ismail (Honda) 121 points\n4.Affendi Rosli (Yamaha) 121 points\n5.Ahmad Fazli Sham (Yamaha) 96 points\n \nTeam Awards\n1.PETRONAS Yamaha CKJ 252 points\n2.Givi Honda Yuzy Racing 219 points\n3.Harian Metro Y-TEQ SCK Honda Racing B 183 points\n4.PETRONAS Yamaha Maju Motor 158 points\n5.Motul Yamaha YY Pang 138 points\n \nCP115\nRace\n1.Izzat Zaidi Salehan (Yamaha) 12’30.085s\n2.Elly Idzlianizar Ilias (Honda) 12’31.023s\n3.Abdul Muhaimin Roslan (Yamaha) 12’33.743s\n4.Amirul Ariff Musa (Honda) 12’34.447s\n5.Kasma Daniel Kasmayudin (Yamaha) 12’34.602s\n \nOverall Standings\n1.Izzat Zaidi Salehan (Yamaha) 178 points\n2.Zaidy Zaifaizal (Yamaha) 148 points\n3.Tengku Amirul Haffiruddin (Yamaha) 121 points\n4.Amirul Ariff Musa (Honda) 109 points\n5.Elly Idzlianizar Ilias (Honda) 95 points\n \nTeam Awards\n1.Motul Yamaha YY Pang A 299 points\n2.Motul Yamaha YY Pang B 191 points\n3.Givi Honda Yuzy Racing 165 points\n4.M Seki Liberty Honda 146 points\n5.PETRONAS Yamaha Maju Motor 128 points\n \nWIRA\nRace\n1.Khairul Idham Pawi (Honda) 10’01.312s 2.Fairuz Nasir (Yamaha) 10’12.012s 3.Afiki Supaat (Yamaha) 10’12.175s 4.Amirul Hakim Mohd Rizal (Yamaha) 10’19.088s 5.Saiful Azhary (Honda) 10’19.250s\n \nOverall Standings\n1.Khairul Idham Pawi (Honda) 216 points 2.Afiki Supaat (Yamaha) 108 points 3.Fairuz Nasir (Yamaha) 94 points 4.Saiful Izman Ahmad Zamani (Yamaha) 86 points 5.Amirul Hakim Mohd Rizal (Yamaha) 86 points\nAdvertisements",

Boon Siew Honda Sdn Bhd will launch the Honda 2012 Gold Wing on 31 May 2012, raising the benchmark for luxury touring bikes. “We are proud to present the Honda 2012 Gold Wing, which provides incredible smoothness, efficiency and comfort to cruise great distances. The Honda 2012 Gold Wing will provide the ultimate cruising experience for bike enthusiasts in Malaysia,” said Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda, Mr. Satoshi Okada.  \n\n“The Honda 2012 Gold Wing made headlines when it was first unveiled during the MotoXpo 2012 in February earlier this year. It created a buzz within the biking community with its stylish exterior and advanced performance – capturing the essence of reliability and durability found in Honda machines. We are pleased to welcome the Honda 2012 Gold Wing model in Malaysia,” he added.\nHonda 2012 Gold Wing runs on a unique 1832cc liquid-cooled horizontally opposed six-cylinder engine, where PGM-FI technology ensures a crisp throttle response and low gas exhaust emissions. HECS3 oxygen-sensing catalytic exhaust gas converter system minimises emissions of harmful exhaust gases to ensure full compliance with EURO-3 emissions regulations. The side-to-side torque effect is cancelled out with the five-speed gearbox with overdrive that spins the opposite way to the engine’s crankshaft. The fifth gear is an overdrive that offers low cruising revs.\nThe Honda 2012 Gold Wing combines high performance and beautiful design with an upgrade in exterior styling. Elegant-looking, the bike sports sharp dynamic forms with an impressive front face as well as integrated lines linking the front and rear. The aerodynamics of the machine is enhanced by tweaking the shape of the bottom bridge.\nDesigned with the long distance traveler in mind, the Honda 2012 Gold Wing features larger pannier cases, fairing pockets and top box, increasing the overall luggage capacity over 150 litres. A 2.8 litre central storage compartment is provided to store small personal items and accessories while on the road.\nThe touring bike experience is not complete without a good audio system for music-playing. The Honda 2012 Gold Wing comes with an audio system with surround sound, which provides the freedom of creating an adventure soundtrack for the journey in a variety of formats such as MP3, WMA and AAC by connecting to an iPod(r), iPhone(r) or USB stick.\nCapping off the Honda 2012 Gold Wing as the ultimate luxury touring bike is its newly-improved seat material. Its new weatherproof seat cover and urethane seat are shaped to cushion its passenger at the highest comfort level. In addition, its heated seat and foot warming system goes the extra mile to regulate the temperature throughout the journey. Its Pro-Arm Rear Swingarm allows for neutral and responsive handling, whilst its low centre of gravity provides good low-speed balance and stability.\nThe Honda 2012 Gold Wing’s also comes with advanced riding features that every bike fan will love for its convenience and responsiveness. A push button on the right handlebar engages the slow-speed reverse gear easily; whilst cruising is made simple with a lightweight electronic cruise-control system that utilizes a 16-bit ECU-based, motor-actuated throttle mechanism.\nWith six windscreen-adjustment system settings over 100mm of travel, cruising is not only more comfortable but also safer when rough winds sweep through which is also further enhanced by the improved wind and weather protection built into the front and body of the machine. Safety features are further boosted with the Antilock Braking System (ABS) to reduce the braking effort should the system detect that wheel is about to lock up and the Combined Braking System (CBS) tackles the task of delivering the perfect balance of front and rear braking.\nThe Honda 2012 Gold Wing comes in two colours – Pearl Fadeless White and Graphite Black. The new models are available in authorised Impian Honda shops with the on-the-road price of RM174,900.00 from 31 May 2012.\nFor more information, please visit www.boonsiewhonda.com.my or call the Boon Siew Honda Toll-Free number at 1800-88-3993 (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm, except for public holidays).\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\n150i\nYamaha\nYamaha FZ-150i, Yamaha Vixion\nyamaha malaysia \n\n2014 Yamaha FZ150i unveiled in Malaysia – RM8,538 (basic) \n\n\nPosted on April 17, 2014August 7, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe wait is over. Hong Leong Yamaha Malaysia (HLYM) has finally bring us the awaited 2014 Yamaha FZ150i with the new refreshed facelift that is already released earlier in Indonesia. Many riders in Malaysia who looking for a great fuel-efficient 150cc bikes are holding up their money to wait for this bike. In Indonesia, this bike is named as the Yamaha V-ixion Lightning to distinguish itself from its predecessor.  \n\nOne feature highlight of this model is the inclusion of the rear disc brake that has been requested for so long by riders who have been following the bike industry in Malaysia. The use of the brake will give a better braking power and at the same time makes it looks sportier. You can also see the exhaust heat cover are now given a new design and the muffler end tip are also different.\n\nThe wheels are also different with the use of 10-spoke star-like design that is wider. The wheels are now measures 90/80-17 for the front and 120/70-17 for the rear.\n\nThe engine are now a little bit different with few upgrades on a number of components. The fuel injection system are now IPA 1 as compared to the previous 3CI system. The ignition are now TCI as compared to the previous CDI system (UPDATED: It is already TCI since the first FZ150i model. Info from FSR Technology). This actually makes the engine behave differently and now the horsepower has increased to 12.2kW (11.1kW previously) and torque at 14.5Nm (13.1Nm previously). So, this 2014 Yamaha FZ150i actually carries a different engine on its frame. Oh, the frame is still the same diamond-type as of the previous 2008 model.\n\nThe dashboard will also be a new sight to be hold for the upcoming owner of this bike. It is now features a digital speedometer and a big rev meter that makes it looks very race like and actually very nice. I think this meter looks like the one fitted to the Yamaha YZF-R1. The 2008 FZ150i carries the two circle display that shows the speed and the rev counter which feels outdated. This kind of the digital+analog combo is a welcome addition to this bike for the next kind of features that should be fitted to all Yamaha models.\n\nThe key lock are now also upgraded with the key-shutter system for a better security of the bike from theft. At least, it can makes the thief to take more time to do something to your bike. All Yamaha bikes should features this kind of key-shutter system and by saying that, I think, all of the Yamaha bikes in their lineup already have this kind of system except the 125Z.\n\nThe overall look of this bike is sportier and this can be contributed by the use of the redesigned fuel tank that is higher and sharper. It complement the overall looks of the bike that shows its racy sportiness.\nEverything is looking good for this bike and could be the one that is going off the selves quickly with the nice design and more power.\n2014 FZ150i Technical Specification\n\n\n\nType\n4-Stroke, Liquid-cooled, SOHC, 4-Valve\nCylinders\nSingle\nDisplacement\n149.8 cm3\nBore x Stroke\n57.0 x 58.7 mm\nCompression Ratio\n10.4 : 1\nMaximum Horsepower\n12.2kW (8,500rpm)\nMaximum Torque\n14.5N.m (7,500rpm)\nStarting System\nElectric\nLubrication System\nWet Sump\nEngine Oil Capacity\n1.15 litres\nFuel Tank Capacity\n12.0 litres\nIgnition System\nTCI\nCooling System\nLiquid-cooled\nBattery Capacity Type\n12V 3.5 Ah\n\n\nType\nManual\nPrimary Reduction Ratio\n3.042\nSecondary Reduction Ratio\n2.867\nGear Ratios\n1st: 2.833; 2nd:1.875; 3rd:1.429; 4th:1.143; 5th: 0.956\nClutch Type\nWet, Multiple Discs with Coil Spring\nSpeed Type\n5 Speed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrame Type\nDiamond\nOverall Length\n2009 mm\nOverall Width\n705 mm\nOverall Height\n1035 mm\nSeat Height\n790 mm\nWheelbase\n1296 mm\nMin.

Taufik from TMCblog, Indonesia, reported this bike earlier to be named ER250C (a named written on the sketch paper), which a probable name for it. Now, I have a very strong source that said that this bike might be named Kawasaki Z250 that will be launched as soon as this January 2013. This Z250 will be sold along side the beautiful Ninja 250R FI which is logical since the Z250 is the naked bike and Ninja 250R is the full-fairing bike.  \nLooking at the price, we know that the 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R is at RM22,589. So, by adjusting the price for the naked bike which usually have less parts (eg; no fairing), I’m thinking this bike might be priced at RM19k-21k. The price difference might not be much, but that is good enough to make you think a lot before choosing the two bikes to take to your garage.\nTake this a rumors guys. I’m hoping this all can be true soon enough. I’m eagerly waiting for this!\nPhoto credit to TMCblog.com\nAdvertisements",

        "125cc\nTricity\nYamaha \n\n2014 Yamaha Tricity unveiled – new mobility to the world \n\n\nPosted on March 25, 2014March 25, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nUrban traffic congestion is a major problem in many European cities, and is set against a background of increased environmental awareness and the squeeze on many consumers’ disposable incomes. The landscape of personal mobility is set to change drastically, and Yamaha is working to develop New Mobility solutions designed to facilitate and encourage the adoption of a new mindset amongst urban commuters.\nDespite the availability of a wide choice of scooters, a huge number of commuters continue to make their daily journey into the city using public transport or a car. In addition to these non-riding members of the public, there are also those riders who currently commute on 2-wheels – or may have done so in the past – and are attracted by the increased feeling of stability and riding confidence that are associated with a new 3-wheel concept.\nThe all-new Tricity is the first model in Yamaha’s New Mobility segment, and it represents a new solution to the issue of personal transportation. Unlike some other larger and heavier multi wheel scooter-style vehicles, the Tricity has been developed using a completely different approach in which lightness, sportiness, agility and ease of use are the key elements.  \nNew Yamaha Tricity\nAn alternative approach\nFeaturing twin front wheels that automatically lean when cornering, the new Tricity delivers scooter-like agility combined with enhanced confidence and an increased feeling of stability. With a strong focus on riding enjoyment, ease of use and affordability, Yamaha’s Tricity is equipped to transform the daily lives of urban commuters throughout Europe.\nThe Tricity development team in Yamaha Motor Corporation focused on creating a future-proof concept that offers an attractive and realistic alternative for today’s urban commuters. The key targets for the Tricity were set as follows:\n*           Simple, easy and enjoyable to ride\n*           Light and agile handling\n*           Increased stability feeling\n*           Comfortable in different road conditions\n*           Functional and practical urban commuter\n*           Unique design with innovative and advanced technology\n*           Weight and overall dimensions in line with 125 class scooter\n \nNew Leaning Multi Wheel Chassis\nAdded riding confidence with a new kind of enjoyment\nThe Tricity’s exclusive new Leaning Multi Wheel (LMW) mechanism has been developed specifically by Yamaha for our New Mobility vehicles, and it features a patented system that is designed to create a good feeling of stability, combined with a sporty and agile handling character.\nHidden behind the lightweight front cowl, a lightweight parallelogram link gives the rider the ability to lean the Tricity in much the same way as a conventional 2-wheel scooter. The parallelogram link’s component parts are connected to the forks and the frame’s steering head, and when the Tricity rider enters a turn this system allows the twin front wheels to lean over in parallel. While leaning over, the track (distance between the twin front wheels) remains almost consistent, and this ensures a natural and intuitive feel during cornering.\nAnother key element of Yamaha’s new LMW mechanism is the use of special tandem-type cantilevered telescopic front forks that feature two separate tubes for each wheel. The rear fork tubes function as guides, while the front fork tubes handle the shock absorbing functions to deliver smooth cushioning throughout the 90mm stroke. The suspension system on each front wheel operates completely independently, and this gives a smooth and stable feel over bumpy road surfaces and in changing road conditions.\n\nLightweight cast alloy wheels\nFor sure-footed roadholding and easy handling over a variety of road surfaces, the Tricity is equipped with twin 14-inch aluminium front wheels that are fitted with 90/80-14 tyres. Featuring 3 pairs of V-shaped cast spokes, these beautifully styled lightweight wheels complement the dynamic and elegant bodywork to give the Tricity a unique and enchanting image.\nAt the rear the Tricity is equipped with a 12-inch diameter cast alloy wheel with a 110/90-12 tyre, and this 3-wheel layout delivers a smooth and comfortable ride together with good levels of cornering grip for confident roadholding.\n \nUnified Brake System (UBS)\nThe Tricity is equipped with a Unified Brake System (UBS) that is designed to enhance stopping efficiency and deliver smoother chassis characteristics during braking. The system incorporates twin 220m diameter front discs and a 230mm rear disc, and when only the left hand brake lever is applied, the braking force is applied to the rear wheel and also to the front wheels, giving balanced and effective stopping power.\nWhen the rider applies only the right hand lever, the front brakes are applied, and when the rider applies both the left and right levers at the same time the Unified Brake System distributes the braking force to the front and back brakes using input from both levers.\nThe intelligent UBS technology not only makes the Tricity easy to use, it also ensures smoother stopping with minimal fluctuation in the handlebar motion.\n\nNewly developed 125cc 4-stroke liquid-cooled engine\nSmooth, lively and economical\nPowering the Tricity is a newly developed 125cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke engine that has been designed to produce good acceleration from low speeds, together with smooth higher speed operation. The engine benefits from specially designed intake and exhaust systems that enhance performance in typical urban stop/start situations, making the Tricity a strong performer in congested city streets.\nThis new engine is equipped with a special cylinder that has been developed using Yamaha’s leading casting technology. Manufactured from aluminium alloy with specific silicon content, this lightweight cylinder has no steel sleeve, and the piston runs directly onto an aluminium bore. This unique design gives excellent heat distribution, which in turn contributes towards stable engine performance and improved lubricant life.\nFor high levels of economy the new engine is equipped with Yamaha’s exclusive YMJET-FI fuel injection system that ensures high combustion efficiency with smooth low speed acceleration, together with a responsive power feeling through the mid and high rpm ranges.\nThe lively 125cc engine transmits its power to the rear wheel via an efficient CVT transmission for smooth and easy acceleration, making the Tricity an ideal means of transport for customers who have little or no scootering experience.\n \nLight and compact\nThe key element in New Mobility\nWeighing just 152 kg with fuel and oil, the defining characteristic of the new Tricity is its light, compact and agile handling feeling that sets Yamaha’s New Mobility engineering philosophy apart from the larger and heavier multi-wheel models available in the market.\nWith its confidence inspiring 3-wheel design – combined with a fun-to-ride character and a smart, modern image – this revolutionary new model is ready to win the hearts and minds of those non-riding commuters who are ready to make a change to their daily lives. Of course, the Tricity is also sure to find favour with many past and present scooter riders who value the additional benefits that this compact 3-wheel scooter has to offer.\nThe lightweight bodywork is both strong and easy to clean, making it ideal for the rigours of city life – while the aluminium wheels keep unsprung weight low for agile steering feel together with smooth and responsive suspension characteristics. The strong new tubular frame design also offers a large flat footboard with plenty of space for the rider, while also contributing towards weight reduction.\n\n50:50 weight distribution and centralized centre of gravity\nWeight distribution plays a major role in shaping the handling and character of every vehicle, and this lightweight urban commuter benefits from a 50:50 weight distribution. This philosophy of distributing the weight evenly between the front and rear wheels is the same as the approach used on Yamaha’s MotoGP bikes, and it contributes greatly towards achieving the Tricity’s easy manoeuvrability and natural and enjoyable handling character.\nFurthermore, the Tricity’s centre of gravity has been set at a point just below the front of the seat, and together with the low overall weight and 50:50 weight distribution, this idealized centre of gravity is another key factor in achieving a light and responsive handling character.\n \nContemporary design\nSmart and practical bodywork\nYamaha’s designers have created a smart body design that accentuates the modern and aesthetic appeal of this New Mobility vehicle. Viewed from the side, the beautiful lines of the front cowl flow smoothly into the flat footboard area and through to the rear cowl. The contrasting colors of the body panels enhance the futuristic profile – while the combination of the aerodynamic front cowl together with an upswept tail and angular twin front fenders gives an overall impression of dynamic movement.\nThe beautifully styled bodywork is functional as well as fashionable, and Tricity riders can look forward to experiencing a relaxed and comfortable ride on their journey to work. The stepped dual seat features a slip resistant material, and its generous length and substantial cushioning material ensures a comfortable journey for the rider and passenger.\nThe upswept legshields and flat footboard area give a roomy riding position with easy accessibility, and the lightweight bodywork and sports screen also help to protect the rider from the wind and weather. There’s plenty of storage space under the seat, which can accommodate full-face helmet designs, and a convenience hook in front of the rider gives useful carrying capacity.\n \nEasy to read instruments and LED lights\nJust like the rest of this new urban commuter, the instruments are stylish, functional and easy to use. An animated sequence greets the rider when the Tricity is turned on, and the attractive full LCD instrument panel features a central digital speedometer flanked by a clock, air temperature gauge and odometer. The display also includes an array of indicator lights, and the easy to read design displays the relevant information in a clear manner.\nTo enhance the futuristic styling the Tricity is equipped with dual front LED position lights, and there is also an LED taillight and LED license plate lamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordable price and low running costs\nBy ensuring that the company’s entire design, development and production processes are operating at a high level of efficiency, Yamaha have been able to ensure that its new generation of models can be produced with reduced lead times and also at a highly competitive price.\nAvailable from Yamaha European dealers in summer 2014, the new Tricity will be priced at less than €4,000, confirming its aim to really create a new segment in the urban commuter market.\nWith high fuel economy and low maintenance costs, this innovative New Mobility vehicle is poised to change the urban commuter market and introduce many new and existing riders to an affordable, easy and more enjoyable way to live every day.\n \nYamaha Tricity Highlights\n*           The first Yamaha ‘New Mobility’ urban commuter model\n*           A realistic, economical and fashionable urban transport solution\n*           Exclusive Leaning Multi Wheel (LMW) engineering\n*           By far the lightest, most compact and most agile 3-wheeler\n*           3-wheel layout provides riding comfort and a good feeling of stability\n*           Closely spaced front wheels give scooter-like manoeuvrability\n*           Lightweight aluminium wheels, 14-inch front/12-inch rear\n*           Front and rear disc brakes for easy controllability\n*           Unified Brake System (UBS)\n*           Economical liquid-cooled 125cc 4-stroke engine\n*           Fully automatic transmission for smooth and easy operation\n*           Low weight of 152kg (with fuel and oil)\n*           Large flat footboard and natural upright seating position\n*           Full-face helmet space under the seat\n*           Double LED position lights and full LED taillight\n*           Low purchase price and ownership costs\n \nColour Options\nMDRM3 (Anodized Red)\nDBNM8 (Mistral Grey)\nBWC1 (Competition White)\nSMX (Midnight Black)\nAdvertisements",

There are two variant of this 649cc bike that is the naked version CB650F and the full fairing sports version the CBR650F.\nThe tagline for these series is ‘entry-level to Honda inline-four’ which translate to low price inline-four bike from Honda. Honda has been successful with the introduction of CB400 inline-four engine bike in the past that have the style and formidable presence. Being 400cc, the power is limited and this make the rider crave for more.   \n2014 Honda CBR650F spotted in Malaysia\nIncreased power is what all rider want, but they also want it to be affordable. Performance on the cheap is the mantra. The power for this CB650F or CBR650F is at 87bhp at 11,000RPM which should be a nice power rating for this 650cc bike. What’s more important is that the power is delivered by smooth inline-four engine that will be linear power delivery at all RPM range. The torque is rated at 62Nm at 8,000RPM. That torque might be low, but you can see that you can harness it in lower RPM range.\nComparing this to the CB500 series, the CB650 series is much higher in terms of specifications. There is the higher output as compared to only 47hp for the CB500. The front brake disc is equipped with the double brake disc system which should provide better and more powerful braking which is logical since the engine power output is higher. There is the ABS version but I’m not sure about this one whether it is ABS or not.\nThe price for the 2014 Honda CB650F is estimated at RM38-40k and the 2014 Honda CBR650F is estimated at RM42k.\nSinar Turbo has been a very reliable source so we believe this.\nvia: https://www.facebook.com/sinarturbo?fref=ts\nAdvertisements",

It is just about time that we are going to get this. The engine are still the same from the 2011 Honda CBR250R MC41 engine but few optimization has been made on the intake airflow and new exhaust muffler design. The 1-cylinder 249cc DOHC engine with the bore and stroke dimension of 76.0 mm x 55.0 mm are now able to maxes out 29ps at 9,000RPM with the torque rated at 23Nm at 7,300RPM. The one thing that can be noted here is that the fuel efficiency has also increased to 50.1km/l. Tank capacity is 13l, so, this means that you can go 651.3km with every fuel tank, theoritically.  \n\nAlso coming is the entry-level inline-four 650cc engine from Honda that should be priced low since it is entry-level. It got that nice naked look and the inline-four engine must sounded buzzy enough to get your adrenalin pumping. The 16-valve inline-four DOHC engine claimed to push 85.8hp and 46.4 lb-ft of torque. \n\nIf you prefer to slide away with the wind, you can choose the full-fairing version that looks good too. The handlebar is lower and closer to the tank for that race-like look and better to slips from the wind riding style.\nPrice for the bikes are unknown yet, but here are our estimates:\n2014 Honda CBR250R RM16,500\n2014 Honda CB650F RM48,999\n2014 Honda CBR650F RM49,999\nPlease be reminded that the price is ESTIMATION only!!!\nAdvertisements",

The code for this bike is ND110K and ND110M, which I think the variant of this bike that refers to kick starter and the other one that is electric starter. It is better just to get one variant that is the electric starter. The design of this New Dream 110i tells us that Honda engineers still able to revive their popular cub, the Dream a.k.a EX5 in Malaysia, to the new futuristic design along with new technology such the advanced programmed fuel injection system, the PGM-FI which is proprietary for Honda.  \n\nIt features multi hole nozzle injector for better fuel atomisation to provides precise and cleaner combustion. Other than that, it can provide great mileage for a very little of fuel. In this case, New Dream 110i are able to get 57km/liter (if I translate that from the picture above correctly). The power should also gets higher since the ratio of fuel and air that are mixed up inside the combustion chamber are now metered precisely.\n\nThe design really takes the cue from the previous version of Honda EX5 Dream. I can feel the aura strongly about it even it came with so many improvements. The key system are now equipped with shutter to prevent theft which is the usual concern of owners. It gets new meter panel with new colours and new design. Much more hexagonal look than the previous one that look more squarish. Headlamp are also upgraded with new design along with the tail light that are now much modern and cleaner. One special thing about bikes in Thailand is that it came with front basket that is placed just above the front mudguard.\nHonda New Dream 110i RED\nHonda New Dream 110i GREEN\nHonda New Dream 110i BLACK\nThe Honda New Dream 110i comes in 4 colour to choose from that is red, green, blue and black. All colour are good with this bike, which one you choose will be a great choice (if it came to Malaysia).\nConclusion?\nThis is the great improvement over the classic interpretation of modern ‘People Mover’.\nvia: http://www.aphonda.co.th/product/dream110i\nAdvertisements",

The one that is very interesting is the BMW F 800 R that comes with liquid-cooled parallel twin with a capacity of 798 cc, 4-valve technology, DOHC engine that can maxes out 87bhp at low range of 8,000 RPM. The torque is rated at 86Nm @ 6,000 RPM. One particular distintive feature for a BMW naked/tourer bike is the use of dual size headlamp that looks different that other bike that we can see in the market but also a recognisable feature of the BMW bikes. The F 800 R is particularly interesting not because of the specs and quality of the bike only, but because this F 800 R is priced at RM46,888 (OTR excluding insurance). This level of price has never being thought of for a bike from BMW that is in 800cc category. Almost anyone in the market for a 700cc-800cc naked/tourer bike can fit this in their shopping list.  One model that is available in Malaysia is the F 800 GS. It comes with the same engine but in different styling. GS stands for Gelände / straße which means off-road/on-road (by BMW Motorrad Malaysia page). So this F 800 GS can easily be taken for an urban ride or for a more tricky road somewhere other bikes can’t go. The F 800 GS is priced at a little higher that the R at RM59,888 (OTR excluding insurance). Is this the bike you will consider for 800cc category?\nAn overview of highlights of the new BMW F 800 R.\n•      Compact, sporty naked bike with high level of riding dynamics and agility.\n•      Liquid-cooled parallel twin with a capacity of 798 cc, 4-valve technology, DOHC cam follower valve drive and unique mass balancing.\n•      Output 64 kW/87 bhp at 8000 rpm, torque 86 Nm at 6000 rpm.\n•      Excellent pulling power for maximum riding fun on country roads.\n•      Manifold injection with electronic engine control.\n•      Torsionally stiff aluminium frame and dual swing arm.\n•      Dry weight/road-ready weight: 177/199 kg.\n•      Fuel tank positioned under seat for optimum centre of gravity.\n•      High-performance Brembo brake system, optionally with\nBMW Motorrad ABS.\n•      Newly designed front side trim sections in body colour.\n•      Front mudguards in body colour.\n•      Spring of rear spring strut finished in red.\n•      Sport windshield in body colour (now as standard).\n•      White direction indicators (now as standard).\nSource: BMW Motorrad Malaysia\nAdvertisements",

Bhd, a company under the NAZA Group of Companies, today launched the stylish and innovative American motorcycle brand; Victory Motorcycles.\nY.B. Datuk Haji Ahmad Haji Maslan, Deputy Minister of Finance graced the event to officially launch the Victory Motorcycles brand together with Datuk Maruan Mohd Said, NAZA World Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Investment Division and Mr. Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, Vice President of NAZA Two Wheels Division in a ceremony at the Victory Motorcycles showroom in Glenmarie, Shah Alam.\nVictory Motorcycles, a premium and international motorcycle brand boasts a range of easy-riders that presents the ultimate combination of modern style, handsome designs and a good amount of V-Twin muscle to deliver exceptional performance.  \nEstablished in 1998, the brand was the first new major American-made motorcycle company to be introduced in recent years. Full production of its first motorcycle, the V92C, began in Spirit Lake, Iowa in the summer of that year and by 1999, the V92C was already receiving ‘Motorcycle Cruiser of the Year’ awards from the American press. Victory Motorcycles has since expanded its model line-up, captured the hearts of countless ardent bikers and made great advancement in the international market for cruisers and touring motorcycles.\n“The New American Motorcycle” brand has made a name for itself by designing bikes with progressive styling that stray away from the ‘classic’ look people have come to expect of American V-Twin motorcycles.\n“Young in comparison to other premium motorcycle brands in the market but by no means inferior in quality or performance, Victory Motorcycles has earned itself a reputation for providing forward-thinking designs that are in tune with the needs of dedicated bikers and for redefining standards of power in American motorcycles. Every bike is built by riders to handle the demands of a true rider and ensure the best riding experience,” remarked Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, Joint Group Executive Chairman of NAZA Group of Companies.\nNAZA has invested RM5 million on the 6,000 sq. ft facility which features a full-fledged 3S Centre manned by a well-trained team of sales and technical personnel. Harmony Fabulous Sdn Bhd is introducing the Malaysian market to the brand with the complete Victory Motorcycles range of 13 models. The variety in the range ensures that the needs and riding styles of every cruiser enthusiast is catered for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",
        "motogp \n\nThe Action Begins in Austin for Grand Prix of The Americas for Yamaha Racing Team \n\n\nPosted on April 20, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi kicked off the inaugural Grand Prix of the Americas weekend today with the first practice sessions at the Circuit of The Americas in Austin, Texas. The morning’s first session delivered far slower times than had been recorded at the private test a few weeks ago with cold temperatures and little rubber on the track adding several seconds to the previous times. The afternoon saw the temperature double from the morning and lap times tumbled for all riders.\nReigning World Champion Lorenzo completed the first of the two sessions in second place and the second in fourth, improving by over two seconds. Teammate Rossi improved a place from sixth to fifth over the two sessions and also took a large chunk out of his morning time, shaving an impressive four seconds off by the end of the second practice.  \n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo, 4th, Time – 2’06.637\n“In the morning we were competitive compared to our rivals but this afternoon when the track improved they had a better feeling and a better confidence to improve much more than us. We were unable to make profit from the improved track conditions. We need to improve the bike to gain some seconds. The track was better for everyone but for the moment it gives our rivals more confidence to go faster. We are better but still not enough.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi, 5th, Time – 2’6.868\n“The practices are not so bad because we improved a lot compared to this morning and we could stay close to Jorge. Unfortunately the Hondas are very fast which we already knew from the test. We hope to make it better this weekend but especially Marquez is very fast and also Pedrosa and Bradl are faster than us so we have to work and try to improve for tomorrow.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“That’s the first day in Austin done. We’re position four so of course we’re not so happy; we’re struggling a bit to find the correct grip. The morning session wasn’t great, it was cold and everybody struggled and in the afternoon we struggled a bit more. We are trying to find some extra grip, to drop the lap times we need more on the back. Hopefully tomorrow we can find the right way to improve and close the gap. It’s important to be on the front row and close to the fast lap times.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“We know that the characteristics of this track are not the best for us. We still have one and a half days to work on our set up so we will focus on closing the gap to the front. Unfortunately this morning the track conditions were not good, we couldn’t work properly so we lost one session. We have identified the area we need to improve so I am optimistic that tomorrow we can make a big step.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrutchlow stars on Texas debut\nThe Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team’s Cal Crutchlow demonstrated what a fast learner he is today, the British rider immediately setting a fast and competitive pace on his debut at the spectacular new Circuit of the Americas (COTA) in Texas. Faced with the difficult challenge of learning the long and technical track, which features 20 corners, the longest straight on the 18-round MotoGP calendar and a 134ft climb from the start line to the first corner, the 27-year-old excelled in both 45-minute practice sessions to challenge for the top six throughout. He impressively dropped his pace in this afternoon’s FP2 by well over four seconds compared to the opening 45-minute session to move up from eighth to sixth in the rankings. Crutchlow ended with a personal best time of 2.06.899 to finish just 0.031s behind Valentino Rossi. And all five riders that finished in front of the former World Supersport Champion have previous experience of COTA having attended a private test session at the state-of-the-art facility near Austin last month.\nA slippery surface provided the biggest challenge for British rider Bradley Smith, who only felt confident enough to push anywhere close to his limit towards the end of FP2. Smith finished 13th fastest in FP1 and although he was able to shave close to four seconds off his pace this afternoon, he remained in the same position on the combined leaderboard. He finished the day with a quickest pace of 2.09.424 and the 22-year-old is confident that with more track knowledge to call upon tomorrow he will be challenging for a place inside the top 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow – 6th, Time – 2’06.899\n“Firstly I want to say a huge thanks to my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew, management and staff at Yamaha and Dorna and COTA officials for helping us get out on track today. The fire in the garage on Wednesday night wasn’t the ideal start to the weekend but my crew have worked non-stop to get everything ready for today and I am proud to work with them. Today was always going to be difficult because this track is really technical, difficult to learn, and you need time to be able to learn all the secrets to go fast. So to be sixth fastest and make such big progress is pleasing. We expected the gap to the front to be quite big and honestly I thought I’d be a little bit further away. I got held up a few times on my good laps too so I’m sure I could have gone a bit faster. This track is amazing with so many different challenges from hard braking, fast straights and lots of changes of direction. We still have a lot of work to do and it will be difficult to be near the front in the race. I need to improve in the braking area. We need to calm the bike down but to be the best of those that didn’t test here is all I can really ask for.”\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith – 13th, Time – 2’09.424\n“It was great to finally be on track today and get a first taste of what is an amazing track but incredibly difficult to learn. After the fire in the garage on Wednesday night my crew and even my old team from Moto2 have been working flat-out to make sure we were ready. So just being on track felt like a big achievement today. This morning was very difficult because I have never ridden with such little grip, and that doesn’t help you learn the track. Going into this afternoon where we did have grip, it took me a while to actually adapt to the track. We improved the bike and I felt much more comfortable at the end and we have a direction to follow for tomorrow morning. What is critical is being able to put the bike where you want and at the moment I am struggling in that area. You have to be so specific here but I am happy to be four seconds faster this afternoon. That’s good progress but I need to make the next step. I know my weak points and I will be ready to make the improvements.”\nAdvertisements",

Many reader has been talking about this bike in forums, blogs and also on FB. Taking a look at this Benelli TnT 600, it sure should be something to talk about since it features inline-4 600cc engine with RM29,999 price that is amazingly lowest in its class. The real contender to this bike is the Yamaha XJ6, but that one is price at RM41k which is about RM11k more expensive than TnT 600. After reading about it, I wonder what is the TnT stands for, turns out it mean ‘Tornado Naked Tre’, then what does the ‘Tre’ stands for. Well, it is for the frame type, that is Trellis frame. In some other country, TnT 600 also known as BN 600. One of the most interesting design in this TnT 600 is the use of undertail double exhaust that looks very Italian just like the Aprilia Shiver 750.  \n2011 Aprilia Shiver 750\nRoda-Roda magazine has reviewed this bike in Jun edition and it turns out that they liked it. The maximum speed achieved it 230km/h and at that speed there are no vibration that sent to your body. The sound of the inline-4 engine is nice too. The 600cc engine can churns out 80kW (107hp) 60kW (82hp)at 11,000 RPM with 52Nm of torque at 8,000RPM. That is quite high revving for this kind of bike. Long distance riding are taken care with the big fuel tank at 15liter (1.4 reserve) for lower fuel stops and longer range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenelli TnT 600 is CKD in Rawang, Selangor and that is one reason the price is super low for this kind of machine with great look and great performance. The name Benelli it self is a 100-year old brand from Italy that are now getting more popular today in the world after a long time of silence. Anyway, the brand is actually own by China QianJing Group of China (QJ) since 2005, but they are sure making a good effort to bring back the Benelli brand back to its glory.\nBenelli TnT 600 is also known as BN600 in Australia and some other country\nThis article is written a little bit to late since there is one more bike that are going to fight for your money that is the 2013 Honda CB500F which retails OTR at only RM29,550.35.

Expect these bikes to come to Malaysia soon.I guess Yamaha Mio MX (a.k.a Yamaha Ego) will definitely makes it entry to Malaysia. Yamaha Mio MX is the new version of previous Yamaha Ego S (Yamaha Mio Soul anywhere else) here in Malaysia. Maybe the name in Malaysia is Yamaha Ego MX?Also, Thailand have another Fi bike that is Honda Wave 110i. Previously, Honda have introduced Honda Wave 125i with Fi which is the first Fi cub bike. I also think this bike will make it to Malaysia since the Boon Siew Sdn Bhd is taken by Japanese entity that is Honda Motor Co. The new company is named Boon Siew Honda Sdn Bhd.I really hope we can see lots of changes in motorbike environment in Malaysia since we are really way behind our neighbouring country like Thailand.Some says that Malaysia motor market is not big, that’s why most manufacturer tends to focus their new model on country that have much larger market like Vietnam, Thailand, Philippine and Indonesia.Some burning question here, will the price of the Fi bike higher than carburetted bike? What about repair, will it cost much higher?For more information, click hereRead also about fuel injection bikes here\nAdvertisements",

        "700cc\nHonda\nINTEGRA \n\nHonda Integra 700cc Dual Clutch Transmission Maxi Scooter on Boon Siew Honda Malaysia website – RM64,688 \n\n\nPosted on November 26, 2012November 27, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nBoon Siew Honda has silently updated their website with the newcomer in their lineup, the Honda Integra. This Integra is a maxi scooter with 670cc 2-cylinder engine that can provide 38.1kW at 6,250 RPM and 62Nm of pulling power at 4,750 RPM. This bike is absolutely larger than the recently launched Honda PCX 150. One of the interesting features that can be found on this maxi scooter is the 2nd generation of 6-speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) from Honda. Previously, this type of DCT has been used on Honda DN-01, but that is the 1st generation. Based on the power of this bike, it can be a logical choice for executives who wants to escape from traffic but thinks that the Honda PCX 150 is not powerful enough. Anyway, at RM64,688, we need to think twice about it since that is almost 6 times the price of the PCX. Maybe you think 6 times, before buying this bike, but at least, you’ll have a choice. This kind of bikes reminds me of Yamaha T-Max which is very popular in Europe since the regulations there needs the scooter or bike to have more than 150cc engine to be legal to be taken to highway. In Malaysia, this kind of maxi scooter is almost non-existant, only recently being introduced by Sym Maxsym 400i (UPDATE: There is the market for maxi scooter in Malaysia. There is BMW C600 and C650GT, Gilera GP500 and Nexus 50, Piaggio MP3 and Xevo 400. Yamaha T-Max, Suzuki Burgman and others are also available via parallel import. Thanks to reader JalanJalan for the info). For Honda to bring this bike to Malaysia is a brave action by itself and I know they are trying to wins the hearts of the riders again in Malaysia. Well, this makes me happy. 8 more pictures after the jump:  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://www.boonsiewhonda.com.my/product-integra_main.html\nAdvertisements",

        "400cc\nCBR400R\nharga\nHonda \n\nGallery, Features and Tech Specs: 2014 Honda CBR400R launched in Japan – ¥700,000(RM23,290) \n\n\nPosted on June 13, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nIt is now official that Honda CBR400R is actually is the real thing. This beauty will place in the middle of the range between CBR250R and CBR500R. The engine featured for this bike is 399cc 2-cylinder liquid-cooled with 67.0mm x 56.6m bore and stroke dimension. Based on this configuration we can see that the engine is high-revving one that should satisfy the buzz while taking it to the limit.  Honda has been very active launching new bikes almost every two month and that is a good thing for rider like us. Even the CBR400R and CBR500R differs by ‘only’ 100cc, it can actually reflects to lower price and lower license restrictions in some country which again a good thing.It is as usual equipped with the PGM-FI for that accurate fuel metering at 9,500RPM for 46hp and 37Nm at 7,500RPM of torque. Roller rocker arm and silent cam chain are also used to minimise the power loss due to friction. Other parts that is given special treatment is the piston and connecting rod that uses low-friction coating that has been used in CBR600RR. The connecting rod are joined to the cranskshaft with 180 degree phase that ensure a balanced engine with granted quiteness. Transmission takes the power from the engine to the tyre by 6-speed gearbox for that close-ratio gearing and fuel efficiency. The fuel mileage for this CBR400R is good at 39.7km/l so you can enjoy longer ride with fewer fuel stops. The total weight of this bike measures at 192kg.\nThe meter now features all-digital display that provides fuel indicator, RPM rev, speed, fuel efficiency data (km/l) and also a clock. The security system here featured the H.I.S.S that refers to Honda Ignition Security System. This system will disable the engine ignition if non-original key are inserted to the key ignition starter.CBR400R comes in two version, one with ABS and the other non-ABS with price difference of about ¥20,000(RM650). There are 3 colour to choose that is black, red and HRC signature livery which always looks good. From the side profile, I can’t really see any difference between this and the CBR500R.\n\nThe dimension of this bike good and provides seating position at 785mm which should be easy to manouvre around town and traffic stops. The tail light now are also good even with the plate number holder installed. However, I wish the front and rear signal indicator light to be integrated with the light cluster, but I know it is due to the Europe safety regulation that required the signal indicator to be separated. Nevermind.\nTwowheelsblog reported that CBR400R will be first available in Japan, then to some Asian countries after that. Are we one of the Asian countries which will get it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs of 2014 Honda CBR400R\n\n\n\n\nCBR400R [ABS]\n\n\nModel\nHonda · EBL-NC47\n\n\nTotal length (mm)\n2,075\n\n\nOverall width (mm)\n740\n\n\nHeight (mm)\n1,145\n\n\nWheelbase (mm)\n1,410\n\n\nGround clearance (mm)\n140\n\n\nSeat height (mm)\n785\n\n\nWeight (kg)\n192 [194]\n\n\nRiding Capacity (people)\nTwo\n\n\nFuel consumption rate (km / L)\n39.7 (60km / h fixed area traveling test value)\n\n\nMinimum turning radius (m)\n2.7\n\n\nEngine type\nNC47E\n\n\nEngine Type\nTwo-cylinder water-cooled 4-stroke DOHC 4-valve series\n\n\nTotal displacement (cm 3)\n399\n\n\nInner diameter × stroke (mm)\n67.0 × 56.6\n\n\nCompression ratio\n11.0\n\n\nMaximum output (kW [PS] / rpm)\n34 [46] / 9,500\n\n\nMaximum torque (N · m [kgf · m] / rpm)\n37 [3.8] / 7,500\n\n\nFuel supply system\nElectronic <electronically controlled fuel injection system (PGM-FI)>\n\n\nStarting method\nStarter\n\n\nIgnition device format\nFull transistor battery ignition\n\n\nLubricating method\nPumped splash combination formula\n\n\nFuel tank capacity (L)\n15\n\n\nClutch type\nCoil type spring wet multi-plate\n\n\nTransmission format\n-Mesh 6-speed return\n\n\nGear ratio first gear\n3.285\n\n\n2-speed gear ratio\n2.105\n\n\n3-speed gear ratio\n1.600\n\n\n4-speed gear ratio\n1.300\n\n\nGear ratio 5-speed\n1.150\n\n\nGear ratio 6-speed\n1.043\n\n\nReduction ratio (primary / secondary)\n2.029/3.000\n\n\nCaster angle (degrees)\n25 ° 30 ‘\n\n\nTrail amount (mm)\n102\n\n\nTire (front)\n120/70ZR17M/C (58W)\n\n\nTire (rear)\n160/60ZR17M/C (69W)\n\n\nBrake type (front)\nHydraulic disc\n\n\nBrake (rear)\nHydraulic disc\n\n\nSuspension (front)\nTelescopic\n\n\nSuspension (rear)\nSwing arm (Pro-Link)\n\n\nFrame format\nDiamond\n\n\n\n \nOne of the interesting thing that I’ve about this CBR400R is that it might come in the flavour of CB400F and CB400X based on the brochure details info (refer to the screenshot below).\n \n\n \n \nAdvertisements",
        "1100cc\n1200cc\nBMW\nR nineT \n\nThe BMW R nineT – puristic classic flat twin boxer style \n\n\nPosted on October 17, 2013October 17, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nThe BMW R nineT, which has been created to mark “90 years of BMW Motorrad”, radiates purism and power in undisguised form. It skilfully blends the boxer engine’s rugged character and the design traits of various motorcycle eras with cutting-edge technology and a modular concept that offers the rider maximum scope for personalisation. Strictly reduced to the essentials, the BMW R nineT – or just nineT for short – is made all the more alluring by its hand-built feel and strong emotional appeal.  \nThe classic roadster bike is built to cater to the many motorcycle enthusiasts who yearn for unadulterated, stress-free riding pleasure. When it came to developing the design of the nineT in particular, terms such as “puristic simplicity”, “emotion” and “authentic, traditional materials” were also high on the list of priorities. Styling cues from old-school motorcycle manufacture are thus united with the very latest drive and chassis components on the nineT to produce a sensational motorcycle that is just as adept at cruising along serenely as it is at powering down country roads.\nPowered by a classic boxer engine.\nLike the first ever BMW motorcycle from 1923 – the legendary BMW R 32 – the new BMW R nineT is driven by the classic flat twin boxer engine with its punchy response from standstill. This construction principle has been synonymous with unmistakable design, abundant torque delivery and inimitable acoustics for 90 years now. The nineT employs the 1,170 cc air/oil-cooled boxer unit. It produces 81 kW (110 hp) at 7,750 rpm and musters up a maximum torque of 119 Nm (88 lb-ft) at 6,000 rpm.\nConceived for maximum customisation.\nThe nineT pools together the genes from 90 years of BMW Motorrad and its unique concept has been designed to keep customisation fans happy. During each stage of the puristic roadster’s development, the focus was very much placed on enabling riders to tailor it to their personal preferences in a variety of ways. The choice of modifications ranges from BMW Motorrad genuine accessories to custom-made add-on or accessory parts from specialist customisers, making it possible to create a truly unique machine.\nThe high scope for customisation offered by the nineT is down in no small part to its special frame concept. The tubular steel spaceframe that was specially developed for the nineT incorporates the boxer engine as a load-bearing element. The frame’s basic construction consists of a front frame section with integral steering head and a rear section with swingarm mounting.\nThe removable pillion frame allows the nineT to carry a passenger or to be set up for just a solo rider, when it cuts a truly stylish figure. Together with the aluminium tail cover available as a special accessory, this injects the nineT with a striking solo character that is reminiscent of the early café racers.\nExhaust positioned on left with twin silencers and personalisation options.\nThe exhaust system that runs down the left-hand side with two silencers placed one above the other is fully in keeping with the concept of a classic sporty roadster. There is room for customisation here too, courtesy of the BMW Motorrad accessory range. Adding a real touch of technical finesse to the nineT, for instance, is the Akrapović unit made of titanium. By fitting a short or long connecting pipe, the silencer can furthermore be mounted in either a lowered or a raised position, radically altering the appearance and character of the nineT.\nTraditional chassis design combined with high-performance technology.\nThe telelever usually fitted on the boxer models from BMW Motorrad has been replaced on the BMW R nineT by an upside-down telescopic fork borrowed from the S 1000 RR superbike, resulting in a distinctly classic look paired with absolutely top-class engineering. The rear suspension employs the paralever single-sided swingarm in conjunction with a central spring strut.\nThe housing for the rear axle drive includes three mounting points that can be used to attach a bracket for positioning the licence plate and light unit on one side, for instance. What’s more, the swingarm on the nineT is designed in such a way that a 17-inch wheel with a width of 6 inches can be fitted instead of the standard 5.5-inch-wide version and submitted for individual approval if applicable.\nDesigned as an out-and-out roadster, the nineT follows in the tyre tracks of role models from the past by featuring wire-spoke wheels with black anodised alloy, non-flanged rims, black aluminium hubs and stainless steel spokes. Radial 4-piston monoblock brake callipers work in unison with floating 320 millimetre brake discs and BMW Motorrad ABS to provide sure stopping power.\nPared-down design and hand-built feel.\nOne of the overriding design objectives was to reduce the bodywork as far as possible in order to achieve a puristic look. The attention to detail that consistently infused the work of the designers and engineers on the nineT is a further attribute that shines through over and over again.\nThe sides of the 18-litre aluminium tank have been painstakingly brushed by hand and then coated. The aluminium plate with embossed nineT lettering on the right above the air intake duct is likewise befitting of the bike’s hand-built feel.\nThe surfaces of many forged aluminium parts, including the yokes and the handlebar clamp bracket with BMW Motorrad lettering, have been glass bead-blasted and then given a natural anodised finish. The circular headlamp with the BMW emblem in the centre of the bulb cover pays homage to various role models from 90 years of BMW Motorrad.\nA classic Black storm metallic paint finish with contrasting silver and metallic highlights was chosen to match the character of the nineT.\nSpecially designed electrical system to allow plenty of scope for customisation.\nThe bike’s electrical system has been specially configured for greater technical flexibility, thereby facilitating the installation of alternative electrical components, such as headlights or turn indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlights of the new BMW R nineT:\n\nPuristic design.\nHand-built feel of the workmanship.\nAir/oil-cooled twin-cylinder boxer engine with a displacement of 1,170 cc. Output 81 kW (110 hp) at 7,750 rpm, maximum torque 119 Nm (88 lb-ft) at 6,000 rpm.\nIdeally suited to customisation.\nModular frame concept with removable pillion frame and frame end-piece.\nClassic wheel suspension concept using high-quality upside-down telescopic fork at the front and paralever at the rear.\nExhaust system with two silencers on the left-hand side, with variation options.\nTraditional wire-spoke wheels with black rims and hubs.\nRadial 4-piston monoblock brake callipers, steel-braided brake lines and floating 320 mm brake discs.\nModel plate riveted onto steering head in classic BMW Motorrad style.\nBespoke range of special accessories made to BMW Motorrad’s customary high standards of quality.\n\nAdvertisements",

This philosophy has been brought to this new era with the introduction of Honda Super Cub 110 Pro.\nThe amazing features about this cub is that its fuel economy can reach up to 66.2km/l. This is way more fuel efficient than the current Honda Wave 110RS which only clocked about 49.4km/l. This is being done by equipping this bike with PGM-FI fuel delivery that replaces the carburetor.\nThe design keeps the retro looks, but all the features are all modern and technologically advanced (compared to the original cub).\nFor the top of the line version, Honda Super Cub 110 Ultra, it comes with i-VTEC and 6-speed twin clutch transmission for maximum fuel economy. This setup also give the power rating of this bike at 29hp. This is the most powerful 110cc 4-stroker ever.

Stoner won his second career title with Honda in 2011, and decided to retire at the end of 2012. Since then, he has been racing in the V8 Supercars series, a car racing in Australia. Stoner has returned to Honda as a test rider, working on the evolution of the current RC213V since August.  Stoner could not ride on the first day of scheduled testing, October 2, due to poor weather, but testing commenced as planned on the following day under cloudy skies. Stoner tested the RC213V MotoGP works machine in the morning, and in the afternoon also tested the Production Racer, a machine being developed based on the RC213V. Despite it being his first ride on the test model, Stoner lapped the circuit with high average speeds worthy of the RC213V and deep-banked cornering. Honda is developing the track-only Production Racer to enable teams and riders to race in the MotoGP class in 2014 at a reasonable price.\n\n\nCasey Stoner:\n“Unfortunately the weather played a big role in this test which was a little frustrating not to be able to share the workload over the two days. We tried to do everything today but it was a little difficult, and we also had the threat of rain again. We started with the current RCV, trying to find a base setting and then work from there. We had two variations of chassis’ to try and some big modifications and improvements in my opinion. We also tried the production bike which was more impressive than I predicted. It had a similar feeling to the RCV but with a little less power and different feeling in engine braking. With some small modifications I believe this bike will be competitive and I look forward to the next test with it! In general it was a good, but busy day”\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nHonda\nRC213V-S\nRCV 1000 \n\n2015 Honda RC213V-S on sale this July 13 – USD184,000 (RM688,178.40 direct conversion) \n\n\nPosted on June 12, 2015June 12, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe RC213V is a machine exclusively for racing that has won consecutive championships in the MotoGP class of the FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix (hereinafter called “MotoGP”) in 2013 and 2014. Honda has made changes to some of the specifications of the RC213V, and will now introduce this as the RC213V-S. It is possible to ride the RC213V-S on public roads, and Honda will start accepting order entry for this new model on July 13, 2015. The maximum power output is at 159PS at 11,000RPM and can be further enhanced with the use of Racing Kit to maximum 215PS at 13,000RPM.\nIn 1954, Honda declared its intention of participating in the Isle of Man TT races, which were a part of the Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix at the time. Honda developed its own racing vehicles and in 1959, five years after the declaration, started competing in the Isle of Man TT races. In 1961, Honda successfully won the TT race championships in the two classes it entered. The total number of cumulative racing victories for Honda reached an unprecedented 600 wins in 2005, which rose to a cumulative 695 victories as of June 11, 2015. Since the Isle of Man TT races, Honda has positioned its racing activities in a wide variety of races as its “laboratory on wheels,” and has incorporated the feedback from the wide-ranging technologies developed for competition in these races into its commercially available production models, relying on these technologies as a way to help maintain and evolve the excellent performance and reliability of Honda motorcycles.  \n\nThe new RC213V-S is not merely the result of a feedback of technologies created by Honda through its competition in races into a commercially available model, but rather represents a wholly new endeavor to make it possible for a machine developed for competition in MotoGP races to run on public roads. To win in the world championship races, it is necessary to enter a machine that runs the fastest in the world, but in Honda’s view, the rider needs to maneuver the machine well, and so Honda sees ease of use as the means necessary for winning races. In other words, Honda has a principle that the fastest machine in the world is also the machine that is the easiest to maneuver in the world. Ever since competing in the Isle of Man TT races, Honda has consistently developed machines exclusively for racing toward the goal of creating the world’s easiest machine to maneuver based on this Honda principle, racking up victory after victory in races along the way.\n\nThe RC213V-S has been developed according to this Honda principle, making it possible for the RC213V, which has won MotoGP championships for two seasons in a row in 2013 and 2014, to run on public roads. The RC213V-S has inherited the specifications of the RC213V to thoroughly ensure mass concentration and reduced friction, as well as all key aspects in manufacturing that set the RC213V apart as a MotoGP machine from ordinary mass production models, with overwhelming differences which involve light weight and precise machining of the components, plus superior expert skills required in manufacturing. In addition, the RC213V-S is equipped with control technologies used on the RC213V. The RC213V consists only of the necessary parts for winning races, based on the idea of changing specifications as necessary according to the rider and course. To achieve the specifications that make the RC213V-S eligible to run on  public roads, the minimal amount of necessary changes and additions has been made compared to the RC213V.\n\nFor the RC213V-S, a machine for public roads, the regions with sales planned are Europe, the U.S., Australia and Japan. The manufacturer’s recommended prices are set at €188,000 in Europe (tax-inclusive) (Germany*1), ¥21,900,000 (tax inclusive) in Japan, A$244,000 (tax inclusive) in Australia, and US$184,000 in the U.S.\n*A kit exclusive for use on closed circuits is offered as an option. (This kit is not available in the U.S.)\nFor purchase of an RC213V-S, applications for order entry will be accepted around the world starting 0:00 (CET) on July 13, through the order entry form on the exclusive website (www.rc213v-s.com).\n*1: Selling price in Europe here means the selling price in Germany. Selling prices in Europe vary by country. (Details will be posted in the order entry form on the exclusive website.)\n\nCharacteristics of the RC213V-S\nAs the purpose of development of the RS213V-S, rather than trying to replicate the dynamic performance of the RC213V, the focus of the development approach was on recreating as much as possible the complete vehicle packaging of the RC213V and its riding feel. To enable riding in speed ranges that approach the world of the RC213V, an optional sports kit is available exclusively for riding only on closed courses such as racing circuits.\nIn this way, the RC213V-S makes it possible to experience the riding feel of the RC213V on public roads, while also enabling riding at a higher level on closed circuits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RC213V consists only of the necessary parts for winning races, based on the idea of changing specifications according to the rider and course. But given the premise of riding on  public roads for the RC213V-S, minimum possible changes and additions have been made to the RC213V as requirements for running on public roads, while inheriting all other elements of the RC213V.\n■ Main changes and additions to the RC213V-S in comparison with the RC213V\n[Changes made for maintenance aspects]\n\nWhile inheriting the camshaft gear train structure, a switch was made for the pneumatic valve to a coil spring system.\nThe seamless transmission was changed to a conventional system.\n\n* For the changes above, the same specifications as those for the RCV1000R, an open category racing machine sold on the market, were adopted.\n[Additions made for riding on ordinary public roads]\n\nHeadlight\nTaillight\nLicense plate lamps\nFront and rear turn signals\nRight and left rearview mirrors\nSpeedometer\nMuffler with a catalyst\nLicense plate holders\nHorn\nHonda Smart Key\nSelf starter\nSide stand, etc.\n\n[Changes made for riding on ordinary public roads]\n\nSteering angle: 15 degrees　→　26 degrees\nTires: RS10 made by Bridgestone Corporation\nFront brake disc: Made of stainless steel, manufactured by Yutaka Giken Co., Ltd.\nBrake pad: Made by Brembo S.p.A.\n\n■ Spec. comparison between RC213V-S and RC213V (spec. for Europe: All values are reference values.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel name\nRC213V\nRC213V-S\nRC213V-S (with kit)\n\n\nOverall length (mm)\n2,052\n2100\n【2100】\n\n\nOverall width (mm)\n645\n790\n770\n\n\nOverall height (mm)\n1,110\n1120\n【1120】\n\n\nWheelbase (mm)\n1,435\n1465\n【1465】\n\n\nMinimum ground clearance (mm)\n115\n120\n【120】\n\n\nSeat height (mm)\n–\n830\n【830】\n\n\nVehicle weight (kg)\nOver 158 (after racing)\n170 (dry)\n160 (dry)\n\n\nMaximum number of riders\n1 person\n1 person\n1 person\n\n\nMinimum turning radius (m)\n–\n3.7\n6.4\n\n\nEngine type\nLiquid-cooled 4-stroke, DOHC 4-valve V4\nLiquid-cooled 4-stroke, DOHC 4-valve V4\nLiquid-cooled 4-stroke, DOHC 4-valve V4\n\n\nTotal displacement (cm3)\n999\n999\n999\n\n\nBore × Stroke (mm)\n–\n81.0 × 48.5\n81.0 × 48.5\n\n\nCompression ratio\n–\n13.0\n13.0\n\n\nMaximum output (kW[PS]/rpm)\nOver 175kW\n117[159]156hp/11000\nOver 158[215]/13000\n\n\nMaximum torque (N･m[kgf･m]/rpm)\n–\n102[10.4]/10500\nOver 118[12.1]/10500\n\n\nFuel supply\n–\nPGM-FI (Programmed fuel injection system)\nPGM-FI (Programmed fuel injection system)\n\n\nStarter\n–\nSelf\nSelf\n\n\nIgnition\n–\nFull transistor, battery ignition\nFull transistor, battery ignition\n\n\nFuel tank capacity (L)\n20\n16.3\n16.3\n\n\nClutch\n–\nDry multi-plate, coil sring\nDry multi-plate, coil spring\n\n\nTransmission\n–\nConstant mesh, 6-speed return\nConstant mesh, 6-speed return\n\n\nTransmission gear ratio\n1st\n–\n2.125\n2.125\n\n\n2nd\n–\n1.647\n1.647\n\n\n3rd\n–\n1.368\n1.368\n\n\n4th\n–\n1.217\n1.217\n\n\n5th\n–\n1.100\n1.100\n\n\n6th\n–\n1.032\n1.032\n\n\nReduction gear ratio(primary/secondary)\n–\n1.933/2.471\n1.933/2.353~2.933\n\n\nCaster angle (degrees)\n–\n24.6\n【24.6】\n\n\nTrail (mm)\n–\n105\n【105】\n\n\nTire\nFront\n16.5\n120/70ZR17M/C\n120/70ZR17M/C\n\n\nRear\n16.5\n190/55ZR17M/C\n190/55ZR17M/C\n\n\nBrake\nFront\nHydraulic double disc\nHydraulic double disc\nHydraulic double disc\n\n\nRear\nHydraulic disc\nHydraulic disc\nHydraulic disc\n\n\nSuspension\nFront\n–\nTelescopic\nTelescopic\n\n\nRear\n–\nPro-Link\nPro-Link\n\n\nFrame\nDiamond\nDiamond\nDiamond\n\n\n\n–  Previously unannounced\n【 】Values may vary as Sports kit allows adjustment of various settings.\nSource: Official Honda Press Release\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp\nYamaha \n\n2014 Grand Prix of The Americas Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team Preview \n\n\nPosted on April 10, 2014April 10, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n Circuit of The Americas Layout\n\n \nAfter a two-week break, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP is on its way for the second round of the season: the Grand Prix of the Americas in Austin, Texas, on the 13th of April.The 2014 season may have only just started, but the GP riders have already displayed some intense racing at the Losail circuit in Qatar. The first race of the season was full of action and drama, a preview of what is to come at Circuit of the Americas (COTA).\nThe first Grand Prix of the year was an event of mixed emotions for Movistar Yamaha MotoGP. Valentino Rossi had a brilliant start to the season, starting from tenth on the grid, the Italian battled through the field to fight Marc Marquez for victory. In the end the Doctor settled for second, with only 0.259 seconds between them. Rossi aims to continue his form at COTA and improve on last year’s sixth place.\nJorge Lorenzo had a challenging start to his 2014 campaign. The Spaniard led the pack at Qatar after one of his iconic fast starts, but unfortunately crashed out of the race on the first lap. This weekend he sets out to put his name on the score board at the Texas Grand Prix, where he took third position last year.\nThe Circuit of the Americas was constructed in 2012. The 5,513m long track is run counter-clockwise and has a mixture of fast straights and tight hairpins. There are 20 corners in total, 11 left turns and 9 right turns, and the longest straight is 1,200m. COTA is not typically described as a ‘Yamaha-circuit’, but with the use of last year’s data to make amendments, the YZR-M1 should be competitive nonetheless.  \n\n \n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n“I really want to go to Austin, especially after the first race in Qatar. The season started well but now we need confirmation. Last year I made one of the worst races of the season in Texas, and this year I want to see if we can be competitive everywhere. Getting a good result in Austin would mean a lot for me and for Yamaha. It would mean that the direction taken is the right one. We will try to do our best to be competitive also on the Austin circuit. I’d like to have fun like I did in Qatar.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n“After a very disappointing race result in Qatar I look forward to racing at Austin to try to get a good result and forget as soon as possible all the things that happened in Losail. COTA track was not one of the best tracks for us last year. We had some difficulties to adapt our bike to the layout and lack of grip but finally we found out how to manage for the race. In the end we got a good result and we finished only three seconds behind the winner. I guess this year the pace could be even better because our bike has made one step ahead with the new seamless and the chassis is pretty good. Also, I feel almost perfect, physically at one hundred per cent and that is so important to try to fight for the victory elsewhere.”\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team Director\n“For sure we are all very eager to get to Austin and begin practice on Friday. Last year it was one of the most challenging races for us because although we had tested there we had no previous race data to work with. We have made significant improvements with the M1 since then, especially in the area where we were suffering at the first Austin race with acceleration and braking. In the middle of the season we introduced the seamless gearbox that has helped us to improve the acceleration of the bike and in the winter we made improvements to braking, especially with Valentino, using electronics and set up. As with last year we expect there to be a real lack of grip on the first day but we will improve every session as the grip level increases. We are confident that Vale will continue his momentum after an excellent start to the year and, after a less than ideal beginning in Qatar, we know that Jorge will be a key protagonist, treating this weekend as his first race of the 2014 season!”\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 12 British MotoGP: Marquez emerges victorious in spectacular Spanish duel at Silverstone – 1st Marquez, 2nd Lorenzo, 3rd Rossi \n\n\nPosted on September 2, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive year the British Grand Prix was the venue for a spectacular duel between Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez and Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo, but this year it was Marquez who was the victor at Silverstone as the reigning World Champion beat his Spanish rival to the chequered flag.\nThe battle between Marquez and Lorenzo lasted almost the whole race and resulted in the winning race time being the quickest ever recorded at the Silverstone circuit. After trading the race lead a few times, Marquez managed to pull a small gap on the final lap to beat Lorenzo to the finish line by 0.732 seconds. On the other Movistar Yamaha MotoGP M1 Valentino Rossi was able to resist the challenge of Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa and Ducati Team’s Andrea Dovizioso to take third place.  \nAfter cool conditions for the first two days of the race weekend, Sunday presented much warmer conditions resulting in a peak track temperature of 34°C recorded at the start of the race; 4°C warmer than any other session this weekend. Although the soft compound rear slick was preferred by the vast majority of riders in the cooler temperatures, the warmer weather today saw a shift in front tyre choice for the race with ten of the twenty-three riders deciding to use the medium compound front, with the remaining thirteen riders deciding to keep using the soft compound front slick. The welcome rise in track temperature today wasn’t significant enough to have an influence on rear tyre choice for the race with all except four riders deciding to use the softer rear slick compound available to them; medium for the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders, and soft for the Ducati and Open-class entrants.\nCourtesy of his eleventh win of the season Marquez now extends his lead over his teammate Pedrosa in the standings to eighty-nine points, while Rossi remains in third on the championship table but closes the gap to Pedrosa to just ten points with six rounds remaining the 2014 MotoGP™ season.\n \nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“Conditions for the race were the warmest for the entire race weekend and this had quite an influence on race tyre choice, particularly for the factory riders. Although most riders preferred to use the soft compound front slick on the previous days, the higher track temperatures this afternoon resulted in many of the factory riders choosing to use the medium compound front slick for the race, which was the hardest front slick we brought here this weekend. Despite the warmer temperatures, the softer rear slick options were still used by almost every rider and overall, tyre performance was consistent over the twenty laps. Our tyre allocation performed very well this weekend and the average speed for this year’s race was the fastest ever recorded at Silverstone which was a pleasing result for us.”\n \nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“Today I didn’t expect for Jorge to be so strong. I had the same rhythm as FP4 but he was pushing a lot at the beginning. I was trying to manage my tyres at the start but I had to stay with him otherwise he could open up a gap. In the second part of the race my rhythm was slightly better and in the end it was nice to come back and win here.”\n \nBritish MotoGP™: Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n40’51.835\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n40’52.567\n\n\n0.732\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n41’00.354\n\n\n8.519\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n41’00.529\n\n\n8.694\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n41’01.073\n\n\n9.238\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n41’16.581\n\n\n24.746\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nStefan BRADL\n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n\n\n41’18.552\n\n\n26.717\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n41’18.745\n\n\n26.910\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n41’25.290\n\n\n33.455\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nScott REDDING\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n41’30.929\n\n\n39.094\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "250cc\nExiv 250\nhyosung\nnaza \n\nSpyshots: Hyosung (Naza) Exiv 250 spotted – rumored RM13-14k \n\n\nPosted on April 13, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nHyosung Exiv 250 has been spotted on the road probably for testing before going to be launched.  The overall look of the bike is quite ‘edgy’ as of there is many edges of the bike’s body. The tank and the front shroud shows a cyber-like design with that sharp styling. On my first observation, it also looks a little bit like the KTM RC8 styling.\n\nRear suspension is handled by the monoshock system but at acute angle like the one as used in Kawasaki ER-6. This kind of rear monoshock setup are popular in naked bike category as it is exposed and shows the street-cred it is looking for. The exhaust system is the short and stubby type like the one we have seen in Yamaha XJ-6. This will give a good kind of style that naked bike should be. The chassis is unmistakenly Trellis Frame in the color white that complements the overall ‘purity’ looks of the bike.  \n\nWhat I like the most about this bike is the design of the wheel. It features 10-spoke star-like design that is nice, simple and just right for this kind of 250cc bike. Also interesting is the use of the petal brake disc plate that is commonly used by Kawasaki, that said to be better in terms of heat and water dissipation. Front and rear brakes are nicely handled by the brake disc system.\n\nThe meter cluster features all-digital system, but we have no idea what information does it display as it is turned off as shown in the picture above. Just by the way of how it looks in the picture, I think that is a nicely done meter as compared to the Naza Blade 250/650.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRumors said that this bike will be launched next month. The original bike is the Hyosung Exiv 250, but I’m thinking the actual production name will be Naza Exiv 250 as per Naza Blade. Priced of this Naza Exiv 250 are said to be RM13-14k.\n \nThanks to Akmal Ibn Jelani Al-muari for the tips!\nAdvertisements",

The lastest and sharpest version of the bike that Haslam and Rea race for the Pata Honda team in the World Superbike championship was being presented by Honda Motor Europe to motorcycle journalists from all over the world.\nBoasting front and rear adjustable Öhlins suspension and Brembo monoblock brakes, the new Fireblade SP also features a blueprinted engine and a single seat unit to offer owners even greater focus on trackday action. For Haslam and Rea the launch also offered an opportunity to re-acquaint themselves with the Losail circuit which returns to the World Superbike championship calendar in 2014 for the first time since 2009.  \n“What a week!”, said Haslam after returning from Qatar. “It was the best fun ever to ride around Losail with all the journalists on the Fireblade SP. It’s an awesome machine and the circuit lets you have a lot of fun, so I ended up doing about 300 laps, I think!”\nRea, who flew in from Australia, where he is spending the winter, also enjoyed himself, saying: “It was like ‘a-smile-a-mile’ and I had great fun with Leon, his dad Ron and my TT legend mate, John McGuinness.

The bike is now easier to start, even in the morning. The pickup is very good and I can feel my bike is more energetic and the power delivery is more consistent from low-to-mid RPM. No more torque shock in that RPM region. After this, I’m going to test the performance on high RPM. My only concerns is about the durability. I hope Magnum 3X can last as long as the NGK would, so I don’t have to replace it often.\nAdvertisements",

The Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 season will open next weekend at the Buriram Circuit, Thailand where it will be held as a support event to the second round of the World Superbikes Championship (WSBK).\nThis year, five Malaysians riders will form up the grid, with four them making a return form last year’s roster, accompanied by one new rookie. A special introduction ceremony was held earlier today. Amongst the guests present included Sepang International Circuit (SIC) CEO Datuk Razlan Razali, as well as Troy Chapman, Cluster General Manager, Shell Lubricants SEA.\nReturning to grid this year are non other than Shafiq Rasol, Fakhrusy Rostam, Adam Norrodin, and Helmi Azman. Joining the awesome four is newbie Azroy Anuar who made the cut from the selection process held after last year Malaysian MotoGP race weekend.  Azroy comes fresh out of the venerable Malaysian Cub Prix and KBS-MAM Kapcai Endurance series, just like the returning four riders. The youngster hailing from Kajang, Selangor has got the ambition to match his talent, with the hopes of one becoming a world champion.\nShafiq, the soft-spoken Malacca native, looks set on improving his 2014 performance. Shafiq was regarded as the best performing Malaysian rider in the series last year after becoming the first to break the all-Japanese podium domination, and the first non Japanese rider to score a race win. Shafiq also went on to end the 2014 season by placing 5th in the championship standings.\n\nAdam Norordin, on the other hand, becomes the only Malaysian rider from the Asia Talent Cup Grid to expand his horizons. Alongside three other Japanese riders, Adam will compete in both the Asia Talent Cup series and the Spanish CEV Moto3 championship as well. Suffice to say, both Adam and Shafiq will be two riders to look out for once the season begins next weekend in Thailand.\nMotoMalaya.net will be bringing you extensive coverage of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 season throughout the year.

        "parts\nsecurity \n\nReview: Grip-Lock – add more security to your bike – RM175 preorder, RM195 normal price \n\n\nPosted on March 9, 2013March 10, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nThere are few reasons why we spend so much money for security of our bike. Some installed alarm just like cars, some use big padlock and some use disc brake lock. Whatever lock they use, the purpose is to protect the bike from inconsiderate thief. Now, there is a new kind of lock named Grip-Lock which is made in New Zealand. So far, there are no other brand that produces this kind of grip lock as far as I know. It comes in 4 different colour that is Black, Yellow, Red and Green. The one that I get for the review is the one in Yellow which I really liked. This is because the Yellow colour is very striking and at least can make my bike less prone to choosen as the target for the thief. This kind of high visibility yellow is being used by other products manufacturer such as helmet manufacturer, HJC which make Flourescent Yellow helmet.  \nThe Grip-Lock is easy to use and there are two pads for you to adjust the grip of the Grip-Lock to your bike handle. You can also adjust the brake lever lock position by adjusting the black brake bar inside the Grip-Lock. You see further in the picture below.\n\nThe Grip-Lock is also easy to setup and you don’t have to squat down to lock your bike. Usually, when we have to lock the brake disc pad or the chain sprocket using the padlock, we need to squat down and installed the lock and do the same thing when we want to unlock it. Using this Grip-Lock, it will make your locking work easier since you just have to installed in on your bike handle and brake lever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the outside, this Grip-Lock looks innocent enough but actually there are 3 steel bars inside it that is covered with 30% glass filled nylon. It can withstand the torture of a saw and pricking, but if somebody were to use big sawing machine, I think it could fail too. To see a person doing that to your bike is a clear attention grabber, so, no need to worry about it. Still, if somebody were to take your bike and put it inside a lorry, just about any lock won’t work. At least, we have taken the steps to avoid it from happening.\nSo, have you take the security steps to protect your bike?\nUPDATE(10/03/2013): The price is RM175 for preorder and it is at RM195 normal price. Sorry.\nGrip-Lock is available for online purchase in Malaysia via this address: www.facebook.com/imgriplocked\nor you can contact Mr Mohamad Iftitah at [email protected] or 014-602 2006.

It has been a while since we have seen any 400 cc bikes being produced. Most of the manufacturer likes to make 250cc, 600cc and 1000cc bikes as their lineup. Previously 400cc bike are being made since there is restriction in license for those who wants to ride 500cc bikes and above in Europe, so, this 400cc bike are made as the loophole in the restriction.  \nI’m seeing 400cc bikes as a great and unique category of superbikes since it can features milder power, lighter weight and lower price range. This will make it is more accessible to low income bikers that needs to upgrade their moped to higher capacity bike or even the 250cc bikers upgrading to more powerful bikes. What is even more great news is that this one is said to be produced in Thailand which mean that we just might get this to Malaysia soon. This is due to the fact that Thailand factory is for Asia and global market production bikes from Honda.\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2011/12/27/scoop-honda-cbr-400r-bocor-alus-dari-young-machine/\nAdvertisements",

This is Momoto MM1 that is originally known as the Petronas FP1. The launching of this bike is due today 28th June 2012 at Sepang International Circuit. Bro Apeyjal will have his own track time with this MM1 and I guess he will just have a good time with it. I’m happy to know that this racing legend will come back again to our shore after all the story that went up about it being stored somewhere in UK. It is great to know somebody has taken the effort to bring this FP1 back in its full glory.  \n\nPreviously, the Petronas FP1 is specially made for homogolation  rule in World Superbike Racing series that requires a commercial bike with at least 150 units developed. This 899.5cc race bike officially has made to the list of the first Malaysian made superbike. It is made for Foggy Petronas racing, hence the name FP1. If I’m not mistaken, the price at the launch in 2003 is RM115,000. That is a lot of money for a performance bike.\n\nThere are two colour choices available for this Momoto MM1 that is black and the other one is white. Both of the colours are great for this bike, but in my humble opinion, the original Petronas green still looks good and unique. Based on my readings and sources, this MM1 might be available for sale to public soon. The price is not available at the moment. For what is worth, the legend is back!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: Apeyjal Kacung FB\nAdvertisements",

Each of the variant have its own colours choice and boy, it is a lot of colours to choose from. The one in the picture above in the Street variant, where you can see the ‘S’ logo at the center of the front cover of the bike and also on the fairing.  This one have 2 colour choices that is white/red and black/red.\nThis Tune-up variant as the above pictures have 3 colour choices that is the blue/white, black/red and white/silver. The Tune-up I think is the basic and cheapest variant since it features balck coloured side cover compared to the rest of the variant that is tw-tone coloured matching the overall colour scheme.\n\nThe top-of-the-line variant is this one, the Forward version. It have cast alloy 5-spoke wheels compared to the Street and Tune-up version which only features steel spoke wheel. The colour scheme here are much richer since it have the combination of gold on its body.\n\nThe meter cluster here are one of my favourite since it features the excellent combination of analog and digital display. The speedometer is large and it is analog combined with the digital display of the fuel meter and odometer. The fuel meter have 9 bar that helps for better riding information about the fuel measurement. The turn signal are very good that is split into two. The temperature and FI indicator are also shown nicely on the top of the speedometer along with the high beam indicator on the right.\n\nThe underseat compartment also gets an upgrade in terms of spaciousness. Now, it can fits a helmet! In this picture, I think it is open-face helmet with visor that is being placed inside the compartment.\n\nThe ignition key are equipped with shutter and now comes with push button type to open the seat. This is a nice addition and can makes filling the fuel up is easy thing.\n\nThe front look are now much modern with the lines and curves that makes it looks futuristic. The headlamp are also updated with sharper look that complements the overall ‘cyber’ theme.\n\nThe tail light are also one part that you’ll love to see it. It just looks great. The plate number light has been separated from the tail light and this setup is the same like superbike plate number lighting. Anyway, I prefer it to be combined like usual. Or maybe I’m just too conservative.\n\nSide stand switch. That is one features that I want all bike to have. Side stand switch enable the bike to be started only after the side stand has been lifted and this can helps in accidentally riding the bike while the side stand is still in drop position. That always happened to me with my 135LC ES.\nI must say that Honda engineers has make a very good looking bike with this Click 125i. The engine are also good as it is an all new eSP engine which is claimed to be powerful, fuel efficient and fun. I just hope that is true.\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2012/01/11/detail-honda-click-125i-sudah-helm-in-bro/\nand: http://aphonda.co.th\nAdvertisements",

They have been aggressive this year in introducing new interesting bikes for all of us. After the surprise of the new Ninja 250R, we are awaken with the new Z800 for the Z750 replacement and also by the Ninja 300 just few days ago.  Now, they are giving us the 2013 Kawasaki ZX6R with 636cc.\n2012 Kawasaki ZX10R\nThe ZX6R are now taking the design cues heavily from its bigger brother that is the ZX10R. We can see the influence in the head light and with the use of gold-coloured upside down front suspension. The dual head light are now separated by and air ram duct and the design is now more edgy than the curvy style of the 2012 ZX6R. There is nothing wrong with the design of the 2012 ZX6R. In fact, it is held up as my favourite 600cc bike design of all time. The improvement made by the Kawasaki designer is a good effort considering they are making a good bike better. The air ram duct on the center does really helps for the performance with minimal effort. In the photomontage, the front fork is being hidden by a black fork protector, but the leaked image shows a gold-coloured upside down fork which really resemble the setup of the ZX10R. Even with the 636cc, the name of the bike is still ZX6R. The 636 numbering is being shown on the side of the front fairing. I’m thinking, if the ZX6R borrows the design heavily from ZX10R, what can we expect for the version of 2012 ZX10R?\n2013 Kawasaki ZX6R Photomontage\nThe 2012 version (current) of the ZX6R is equipped with 599cc engine with the measurement of the bore and stroke at 67.0 mm x 42.5 mm and producing power to 94.1 kW {128 PS} @ 14,000 rpm and 66.7 N∙m {6.8 kgf∙m} @ 11,800 rpm.\n2012 Kawasaki Ninja ZX6R\nWe can expect a slight power increase when the 2013 rolls out on the street soon.

The three-day festival open to the public was held in the Bukit Kiara Equestrian Resort and Club, Mont Kiara, also brought out several debuts from the group.\nBesides the concepts (including the BMW Motorrad Concept Roadster), the group launched a total of eight new vehicles including two new BMW Motorrad models. The first of which is the highly anticipated and updated 2015 S1000RR superbike, which is accompanied alongside by the all-new R1200R roadster.\nHere’s what we managed to garner of the new newest Motorrads to reach our soil.\n2015 BMW S1000RR\n\nYou’ve seen and read all about it in our extensive report from its debut at INTERMOT last year, and now, at last, it is here on our soil. Regarded as one of the most potent one-litre superbikes of all time, the new and heavily updated 2015 BMW S1000RR is more than just an aesthetic facelift.\nUnderneath, the S1000RR’s manic DOHC 999cc in-line four-cylinder has been sharpened, now producing 198hp @ 13,500rpm and peak torque raised to 113Nm @ 10,500rpm. Based on previous reports, the 2015 S1000RR’s chassis gains with a revised frame geometry, and its weight lightened slightly, promising increased agility and handling abilities.\n\nAlso sharpened are the on-board electronic suspension components. Both the DDC and DTC features gain with a new set-up, as has the entire suspension system. Next comes the Shift Assistant Pro, granting riders will clutch-less up- and down-shifts. Completing the upgrade is an updated instrument panel as well.\nThe 2015-year BMW S1000RR is now available for purchase via authorised BMW Motorrad dealers nationwide.

Reportedly inspired by the BMW Motorrad Concept Roadster that was displayed during the BMW World Malaysia 2015, the R1200R looks set to welcome more roadster fans towards the brand.\nSlotted below the R Nine-T custom roadster, R1200R is powered by a 1,170cc liquid/air-cooled boxer twin-cylinder engine lifted from the brand’s venerable R1200 GS adventure sport. Generating 125hp @ 7,750rpm and peak torque of 125Nm @ 6,500rpm, the mill powers the roadster using its six-speed transmissions and a shaft drive unit.\n\nAs with all BMW Motorrad bikes, the R1200R comes standard with ABS brakes, with traction control offered as a cost-option, whilst a multiple riding modes is available as standard.

Said price also includes BMW Motorrad’s two-year unlimited mileage warranty plan as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 BMW Motorrad Prices\nShortly after the launch, BMW Group Malaysia also too the opportunity to release its revised pricing scheme for all Motorrad models post-GST.

This Ducati 1199 Panigale S Senna Limited Edition, is a tribute to the F1 racer, Ayrton Senna, legendary Brazilian champion, who has passed away in 1994. An emotional tribute with that dark gray, black and red livery.\nMarking Ducati’s participation at the Two Wheels Motorcycle Show in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Italian manufacturer presented a surprise Senna version of their 1199 Panigale S model.\nRealised exclusively for the Brazilian market, a limited edition series of just 161 motorcycles are to be produced, signifying the number of F1 Grand Prix raced by the Brazilian star. The special livery colour was chosen by Ayrton Senna himself during his visit to the Ducati factory only a few weeks before his last race in Imola in 1994, and later used to produce a first series of 300 motorcycles designed to honour star in 1995.  \nThe first Ducati tribute to Senna was a 916SP finished in grey with red wheels, the “916 Senna I”, of which only 300 were produced, with two more versions, the “916 Senna II” and “916 Senna III” built in 1997 and 1998. All three versions of the Ducati 916 Senna model were limited editions and remain highly sought-after by collectors world-wide.\nDucati, in close agreement with the Senna Foundation and wishing to contribute to the charitable and educational goals the Foundation pursues, decided to pay homage once again, expressing its passionate respect for one of the most prestigious “Ducatisti” ever with the 1199 Panigale S Senna.  \nStarting from June 2014, the 1199 Panigale S Senna will sport the special Senna colour scheme and each of the 161 motorcycles will be supplied with a racing exhaust system and each have its individual production number inscribed on the top fork clamp.\nNumber 01/161 of the Senna limited edition version of Ducati’s industry-benchmark Superbike will be displayed on the Ducati stand of the TWO WHEELS Motorcycle Show in Sao Paulo, alongside one of the original Ducati 916 Senna models.\nAdvertisements",

GRRRRR!!!\nWe are all waiting patiently to the launched of this AE-86 replacement the FT-86, or in this case the Subaru BRZ. Subaru has shown a new version of the BRZ that is the Concept STI. STI are very close to Subaru and their products are one of the greatest such as the Subaru Impreza WRX STI Version.  \nThe tail light of the BRZ are different that the one we seen for the Toyota FT-86 II. This one is much more square and it have some kind of Audi tail light feel.\nThe side profile of this BRZ Concept STI looks fast even when standing still. The ground clearance is low and suited the overall look of a sports car.\nFor a sports car with STI naming, it needs to have huge wings and this BRZ have it correctly. Previous version of STI also have huge wings.\nThe 15-spoke wheels looks perfect with overall styling of the BRZ. The air duct at the front bumper also adds nice little details of a sports car.\nTwin double exhaust at the rear makes a proper sports style for proper sports car. I think, this car will definitely be the choice of many drifters when it launched soon since it got that everything that is right for a drift car.\nvia: Autoblog\nAdvertisements",

        "150cc\nKawasaki\nninja krr-zx150\nNinja RR \n\n2012 Kawasaki Ninja RR in Indonesia – 150cc 28hp 2-stroke power – legend of the east \n\n\nPosted on February 19, 2014February 19, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n \n\nCould it be possible that Indonesia is the only country in the world to ever have the production of the facelifted Kawasaki Ninja RR (or also known as the Ninja KRR-ZX150 in Malaysia)? This bike has been introduce to the world in 2012 for the Indonesian market. While they were enjoying their new ride of the facelifted Ninja RR with slimmer body and new styling, we in Malaysia are waiting for it to come here. Then, as of 2014, we heard that the 2-stroke Ninja KRR-ZX150 is going to be replaced with another bike that is equipped with 4-stroke engine. Based on this information, there will be no more hope for us to see this facelift bike to be available in Malaysia.  \n\nPowered with 149cc KIPS(Kawasaki Integrated Powervalve System) HSAS(High Performance Secondary Air System) 2-stroke engine, the Ninja RR push out 28hp that is nicely configured to meet the EURO II regulation. 28hp is a good number to look at for a 150cc bike. The bike that replace this Ninja RR is the Ninja RR Mono that is 250cc 4-stroke bike that can also push out 28hp.\nOne of the interesting part about 2-stroke bike is about how easy it is to be modded. The easiest way to modify to get extra power is to use a better exhaust that can give 1 or 2 more horsepower to your ride. Further modification can include the usual port and polishing, using higher performance engine bearing, better reed valve, and higher compression ratio piston. One of the highest performing 150cc bike is the Yamaha TZM 150 that can maxes out 35.5hp.\n\nKawasaki Ninja RR Special Edition are also available in Indonesia with a different graphics and special white base colour. The wheel are also in special bronze gloss colour that suits it. In my opinion, Ninja RR can be everyday bike for riders  to go to work or study but also like to feel the power when they have a chance for it on the road.\nSeeing the Kawasaki Ninja RR to leave the market this July 2014 will make many riders sad to see it go. It is a bike that should stay as long as there riders want to buy it and I think there are still more riders wanting to buy it in any given day.\n2012 Kawasaki Ninja RR Tech Specs\n\n\n\n\nFRAME\n\n\nFront suspension\n41 mm Telescopic Fork motomalaya.net\n\n\nRear suspension\nMonoshock Suspension\n\n\nFront brake\nTwin-piston caliper disc brake system\n\n\nRear brake\nTwin-piston caliper disc brake system\n\n\nFront tyre\n90/90 – 17 49S Tube-Type\n\n\nRear tyre\n110/80 – 17 57S Tube-Type\n\n\nLength x Width x Height\n1930 mm x 720 mm x 1095 mm\n\n\nWheelbase\n1,305 mm\n\n\nGround clearance\n145 mm\n\n\nWeight\n134 kg\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n10.8 Liter\n\n\nENGINE\n\n\nType\n2 – stroke, 1 cylinder, Cranked case, Reed Valve,KIPS, HSAS\n\n\nMaximum Power\n21 KW (28hp) / 11.000 RPM, EURO II\n\n\nMaximum Torque\n20 Nm / 9.000 RPM, EURO II\n\n\nCarburetion\nMikuni VM 28\n\n\nBore x Stroke\n59,0 x 54,4 mm\n\n\nVolume\n149 cm3\n\n\nCooling system\nLiquid-cooling\n\n\nCompression ratio\n6.9 : 1\n\n\nDRIVETRAIN\n\n\nTransmission\n6 – Speed\n\n\n1st ratio\n2.700 (27 / 10)\n\n\n2nd ratio\n1.706 (29 / 17)\n\n\n3rd ratio\n1.300 (26 / 20)\n\n\n4th ratio\n1.091 (24 / 22)\n\n\n5th ratio\n0.952 (20 / 21)\n\n\n6th ratio\n0.864 (19 / 22)\n\n\nFinal Drive Type\nChain Drive\n\n\nFinal Drive ratio\n7.874 @ Top Gear\n\n\nEngine oil capacity\n0.8 Liter\n\n\nLubrication system\nOil Injection\n\n\nLiquid coolant capacity\n1.3 Liter\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.kawasaki-motor.co.id/product-detail/ninja-150-rr\nAdvertisements",

Bhd (HLYM) launched its 16th Yamaha Balik Kampung Road Safety Campaign 2014. Jointly organised by HLYM and the Malaysia Motorcycle & Scooter Dealers Association (MMSDA), the road safety campaign themed “Brek Cermat, Balik Selamat”, echoed the magnitude of understanding the motorcycle’s brake function, condition and limitations. It also highlighted how vital it is to take a break when on a long journey back to the kampung during the festive season of Hari Raya.  \nThe Deputy Minister of Transport, Yang Berhormat   Datuk Abdul Aziz Kaprawi, was there to officiate the launch at Sungai Besi Toll Plaza. It was evident during the event that performing maintenance of motorcycles regularly and having sufficient rest before and during a long ride were the main focus for this year’s campaign. These steps significantly help   to reduce the risk of accidents and ensure riders’ safety which are essentially the key messages that Hong Leong Yamaha Motor hopes to spread to the entire nation. During the event, a free 15 poi nt safety check on all brands of motorcycles as well as offering of advice to motorcyclists on the importance of periodic maintenance were conducted as they have been for the past 16 years. Another staple of the campaign is the Yamaha Safety Riding Science demonstration (YSRS) that is aimed at educating motorcyclists on safety riding skills from a scientific approach. The demonstration will be carried out at all five locations, starting from Sungai Besi Toll Plaza, this year.\nThis year’s theme “Brek Cermat, Balik Selamat” weighs in on the emphasis of skill, knowledge and better understanding of using the correct braking techniques. The campaign articulated the function of a brake, effects of braking and braking techniques in its attempt to reach out to riders all over Malaysia. “Understanding the capability and limitations of oneself also plays a big part in keeping safe. Arming yourself with merely the knowledge on how your motorcycle functions is certainly not enough,” said Mr. C.H Ng, Managing Director of Hong Leong Yamaha Motor. “The rider must also ensure the body and mind are not over-exhausted. If rest is necessary, then taking that break is far more important than reaching the destination fast.”\nA strong support group that has continuously been committed to making this campaign a success are the Road Safety Department of Malaysia (JKJR), Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS), Road Transport Department of Malaysia (JPJ), Ministry of Transport (MOT) and other relevant agencies. After all, aimed at educating all motorcyclists to inculcate safe riding habits and to prioritize vehicle maintenance certainly makes for a great campaign to hold close to the heart during this festive season.\nAs part of the effort to enhance the road safety campaign, FKR Tyre Manufacturer will also be stationing its technical advisors at each of the locations listed below to conduct checks and educate motorcyclists on tyre maintenance. In addition, 100 new SIRIM approved helmets will be given away free to replace unsafe, old or worn out helmets at each location, courtesy of KHI Helmets and AEON Credit Service.\nThe participants of the 15 points maintenance check will receive a complimentary bottle of Yamalube Carbon Cleaner, a free safety vest, courtesy of P&O Insurance, and a Yamaha booklet featuring the highlights of the event, safety tips as well as reflective stickers.\nHong Leong Yamaha Motor will conduct the 16th Yamaha ‘Balik Kampung’ Road Safety Campaign at the following locations starting at 9am:\nDate / Day Location   Venue\n8 Jul.

        "250cc\n650cc\nCB650F\ncbr250r\nCBR650F\nHonda\nmalaysia bike \n\n2014 Honda CBR250R dual headlight launched and CB650F, CBR650F previewed in Malaysia – standard RM19,999, Repsol RM20,999, Trico and ABS RM22,999 (basic) \n\n\nPosted on June 27, 2014June 27, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nThat is a very long title that I have to write. Yes, the rumors are correct and indeed the 2014 Honda CBR250R dual headlight has finally landed to Malaysia. Most of the changes are cosmetics like the obvious use of the dual headlight compared to the 2011 Honda CBR250R that use single headlight. This design follows the design of the headlight of the CBR1000RR. In Indonesia, the CBR250R gains few optimization on the intake airflow and new exhaust muffler design of the 1-cylinder 249cc DOHC MC41 engine with the bore and stroke dimension of 76.0 mm x 55.0 mm that maxes out 29ps at 9,000RPM with the torque rated at 23Nm at 7,300RPM. For Malaysia version, we can’t confirm about this changes since we are not able to get the official technical specification yet, but since this CBR250R is Asean CKD in Thailand, we think it should carry the same specs like the Indonesian and Thai version.\nThe price of the 2014 Honda CBR250R dual headlight is RM19,999 for the standard version, RM20,999 for the Repsol and RM22,999 for the Trico and C-ABS version (all prices are basic not including tax, insurance and registration). This number is way above our estimation of RM16,500 because we thought maybe Honda wants to fight the price of the Kawasaki Ninja 250SL at RM17,689. For that, we’d say sorry.  \n\nAlso there at the launch is the 2014 Honda CB650F and CBR650F, but it is there for a preview only. The bike will only be available in August 2014. It is a very interesting bike since it comes with inline-four 650cc engine that Honda says ‘entry-level to Honda inline-four’ that should reflects it affordability. The price for the CB650F and CBR650F are estimated to hover around RM42k-49k (since BSH says that it might be priced below RM50k).\n\nThe 16-valve inline-four DOHC engine claimed to push 85.8hp and 46.4 lb-ft of torque. That is a healthy power from the inline-four engine.

I have seen in my hometown in Kelantan, a Honda C70 uses an ignition coil which is sourced from Perodua Kancil (a car, if you guys out there don’t know). The owner of the bike show me that the ignition produced was powerful when he pulled the spark plug about ONE feet away from the engine, but the spark can still ‘sparked’. He said that this kind of high spark power can deteriorate your piston quickly, as the spark can make a hole in the piston.\n8 more pictures after the jump\nItem is available for sale here: http://motomalaya.net/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=62\nAdvertisements",

The V-twin 2-cylinder engine is much more powerful than the normal single-cylinder CBR250R whereby this one maxed out 30PS (29hp). This one also relates to the price that is higher at estimated 30% more than the CBR250R.  \nThe headlight follows the cues from the CBR250R, but now fitted with Trellis frame for that awesome naked look. The design look very unusual and not so conservative which is suitable for riders who dare to be different. Anyway, at some angle, this VTR-F looks alike the Ducati Monster M600 as featured in our blog before.\nThis is what riders what in terms of entry level bike, a small engine but with high performance configuration. The V-type engine is usually spared to 500 and above bikes and to see it trickles down to this 250cc is a good idea from idea in this era of downsizing and fuel-efficient design.\nvia: Visordown: http://www.visordown.com/motorcycle-news-new-bikes/vtr250f-launched-in-japan/22329.html\nAdvertisements",

At the speed of 100km/h, J-Force IV is quieter than the J-Force III as shown on the graph above.  \n\nThe J-Force IV are also better in terms of the airflow inside the helmet to makes it feels cooler as you wear it for long distance riding. There are newly designed top air outlet and side outlet that helps to achieve this cooling effect.\n\nThe inside are padded with fabric named ‘quup’ that is made by Toray Industries Inc that are able to absorb moisture and breathable up to 2 times more than the conventional nylon.

On the first impression, I can see that it holds the design cues of the Modenas CT110/100 that extends all the way from the headlight, chassis and rear suspension. The difference that we can see is that it now carries a larger displacement at 120.3cc. We already know that the real benefit for the EFI system for any engine is about the accurate fuel and air mixture that are controlled by Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or FCU (Fuel Control Unit) which provides great fuel efficiency. This 118FI really show its benefit with 50km for each liter of fuel burned. That relates to about 215km per fuel tank of journey since this bike also carries 4.3 liter of tank capacity.\nModenas 118EFI is price at RM4775.40 which is quite affordable for a bike with this technology.

It is good to know that the Leo Vince GP Corsa exhaust system do give benefit to the performance to the engine.  \nLeo Vince GP Corsa - Aluminium - RM548\nFrom the dyno chart we can see that there is about 2.5hp gain on the mid-RPM range. Even though there are no changes of the horsepower on the top RPM range, that is also good news because this Corsa exhaust does not drop its performance at that range since there are many aftermarket exhaust that is not even better than the stock exhaust at the top RPM range.\nYamaha FZ150i FCU by FSR Technology - RM400\nHere is the statement from FSR Technology:\n\n\nRed Line = LeoVince Corsa exhaust (no silencer)\n Blue Line = Standard exhaust Bike Specs: \n 1.

Huge gain of up to 2.5hp in the midrange RPM band.\n Combined with our FCU, we can recommend this exhaust for those who are using the UMA Racing camshafts on a standard block. 16.7hp peak power is about 1.5hp better than a standard FZ, without changing the engine block.\n\n— at FSR Technology\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

This can be a great leap taken by HLYM since it has been a very long time we haven’t seen any 250cc bike from Yamaha in Malaysia. If this is true, YZF-R25 will fight against the popular Kawasaki Ninja 250 which is also a 250cc bike equipped with inline-two engine. Yamaha YZF-R25 is a very interesting bike since it features a powerful engine in its class for a 2-cylinder 4-stroke engine with a styling that looks Japanese enough. The bike can produce 35.5hp at 12,000RPM and 22.1Nm at 10,000RPM. Based on this information, we can see that this engine is a high-revving engine and because of that it can gives a nice growl when it get revs high.  \n\nOn a other note, we have now the specific date of the launch of the 2014 CBR250R dual headlight that is on 27th. That is just 2 days away (on Friday). We are hoping to see this bike soon and very eager to know the price. We have estimated the price earlier at RM16,500 but that doesn’t seem possible. Maybe it will be price the same with current model that is at  RM18,799.00 for the non-ABS and RM21,799.00 for ABS variant. Still, we are hoping Boon Siew Honda to announce a lower price.\n\nThanks to bro Norick!\nAdvertisements",
        "carburetor \n\nCarburetor: What is it? \n\n\nPosted on August 11, 2008 by eddy \n\n\nA carburetor (North American spelling) or carburettor (Commonwealth spelling), is a device that blends air and fuel for an internal combustion engine. It was invented by Karl Benz before 1885[1] and patented in 1886.[2] It is colloquially called a carb (in North America and the United Kingdom) or carby (chiefly in Australia).\nThe word carburetor comes from the French carbure meaning ‘carbide’.[3] To carburete means to combine with carbon. In fuel chemistry, the term has the more specific meaning of increasing the carbon (and therefore energy) content of a fuel by mixing it with a volatile hydrocarbon. \n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\n\n1 History and development\n2 Principles\n3 Operation\n\n3.1 Basics\n3.2 Off-idle circuit\n3.3 Main open-throttle circuit\n3.4 Power valve\n3.5 Accelerator pump\n3.6 Choke\n3.7 Other elements\n\n\n4 Fuel supply\n\n4.1 Float chamber\n\n\n5 Multiple carburetor barrels\n6 Carburetor adjustment\n7 Catalytic carburetors\n8 Manufacturers\n9 External links\n10 References\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nHistory and development\nThe carburetor was invented by Karl Benz before 1885[1] and patented in 1886.[2] It was apparently also invented by the Hungarian engineer Donát Bánki in 1893.[citations needed] Frederick William Lanchester of Birmingham, England experimented early on with the wick carburetor in cars. In 1896 Frederick and his brother built the first petrol driven car in England, a single cylinder 5 hp (4 kW) internal combustion engine with chain drive. Unhappy with the performance and power, they re-built the engine the next year into a two cylinder horizontally opposed version using his new wick carburetor design. This version completed a 1,000 mile (1600 km) tour in 1900 successfully incorporating the carburetor as an important step forward in automotive engineering.\nCarburetors were the usual fuel delivery method for almost all gasoline (petrol)-fuelled engines up until the mid-1980s, when fuel injection became the preferred method of automotive fuel delivery. In the US market, the last carbureted car was the 1991 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor equipped with the 351 in³ (5.8 L) engine, and the last carbureted light truck was the 1994 Isuzu. Elsewhere, Lada cars used carburetors until 1996. A majority of motorcycles still utilize carburetors due to lower cost and throttle response problems with early injection set ups, but as of 2005, many new models are now being introduced with fuel injection. Carburetors are still found in small engines and in older or specialized automobiles, such as those designed for stock car racing.\n\nPrinciples\nThe carburetor works on Bernoulli’s principle: the faster air moves, the lower its static pressure, and the higher its dynamic pressure. The throttle (accelerator) linkage does not directly control the flow of liquid fuel. Instead, it actuates carburetor mechanisms which meter the flow of air being pulled into the engine. The speed of this flow, and therefore its pressure, determines the amount of fuel drawn into the airstream.\nWhen carburetors are used in aircraft with piston engines, special designs and features are needed to prevent fuel starvation during inverted flight. Later engines used an early form of fuel injection known as a pressure carburetor.\nMost carbureted (as opposed to fuel-injected) engines have a single carburetor, though some engines use multiple carburetors. Older engines used updraft carburetors, where the air enters from below the carburetor and exits through the top. This had the advantage of never “flooding” the engine, as any liquid fuel droplets would fall out of the carburetor instead of into the intake manifold; it also lent itself to use of an oil bath air cleaner, where a pool of oil below a mesh element below the carburetor is sucked up into the mesh and the air is drawn through the oil covered mesh; this was an effective system in a time when paper air filters did not exist.\nBeginning in the late 1930s, downdraft carburetors were the most popular type for automotive use in the United States. In Europe, the sidedraft carburetors replaced downdraft as free space in the engine bay decreased and the use of the SU-type carburetor (and similar units from other manufacturers) increased. Some small propeller-driven aircraft engines still use the updraft carburetor design, however many use more modern designs such as the Constant Velocity (CV) Bing(TM) carburetor[citation needed].\n\nOperation\n\n\n\n\n A high performance 4-barrel carburetor.\n\n\n\nFixed-venturi, in which the varying air velocity in the venturi alters the fuel flow; this architecture is employed in most downdraft carburetors found on American and some Japanese cars\nVariable-venturi, in which the fuel jet opening is varied by the slide (which simultaneously alters air flow). In “constant depression” carburetors, this is done by a vacuum operated piston connected to a tapered needle which slides inside the fuel jet. A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. These types of carburetors are commonly equipped with accelerator pumps to make up for a particular shortcoming of this design. The most common variable venturi (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers. The UK location of the SU and Zenith-Stromberg companies helped these carburetors rise to a position of domination in the UK car market, though such carburetors were also very widely used on Volvos and other non-UK makes. Other similar designs have been used on some European and a few Japanese automobiles. These carburetors are also referred to as “constant velocity” or “constant vacuum” carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford’s VV (Variable Venturi) carburetor, which was essentially a fixed venturi carburetor with one side of the venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a wider throat at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.\n\nUnder all engine operating conditions, the carburetor must:\n\nMeasure the airflow of the engine\nDeliver the correct amount of fuel to keep the fuel/air mixture in the proper range (adjusting for factors such as temperature)\nMix the two finely and evenly\n\nThis job would be simple if air and gasoline (petrol) were ideal fluids; in practice, however, their deviations from ideal behavior due to viscosity, fluid drag, inertia, etc. require a great deal of complexity to compensate for exceptionally high or low engine speeds. A carburetor must provide the proper fuel/air mixture across a wide range of ambient temperatures, atmospheric pressures, engine speeds and loads, and centrifugal forces:\n\nCold start\nHot start\nIdling or slow-running\nAcceleration\nHigh speed / high power at full throttle\nCruising at part throttle (light load)\n\nIn addition, modern carburetors are required to do this while maintaining low rates of exhaust emissions.\nTo function correctly under all these conditions, most carburetors contain a complex set of mechanisms to support several different operating modes, called circuits.\n\nBasics\n\nA carburetor basically consists of an open pipe, a “throat” or “barrel” through which the air passes into the inlet manifold of the engine. The pipe is in the form of a venturi: it narrows in section and then widens again, causing the airflow to increase in speed in the narrowest part. Below the venturi is a butterfly valve called the throttle valve — a rotating disc that can be turned end-on to the airflow, so as to hardly restrict the flow at all, or can be rotated so that it (almost) completely blocks the flow of air. This valve controls the flow of air through the carburetor throat and thus the quantity of air/fuel mixture the system will deliver, thereby regulating engine power and speed. The throttle is connected, usually through a cable or a mechanical linkage of rods and joints or rarely by pneumatic link, to the accelerator pedal on a car or the equivalent control on other vehicles or equipment.\nFuel is introduced into the air stream through small holes at the narrowest part of the venturi. Fuel flow in response to a particular pressure drop in the venturi is adjusted by means of precisely-calibrated orifices, referred to as jets, in the fuel path.\n\nOff-idle circuit\nAs the throttle is opened up slightly from the fully closed position, the throttle plate uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind the throttle plate where there is a low pressure area created by the throttle plate blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the throttle is opened, thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through the regular open throttle circuit.\n\nMain open-throttle circuit\nAs the throttle is progressively opened, the manifold vacuum is lessened since there is less restriction on the airflow, reducing the flow through the idle and off-idle circuits. This is where the venturi shape of the carburetor throat comes into play, due to Bernoulli’s principle (i.e., as the velocity increases, pressure falls). The venturi raises the air velocity, and this high speed and thus low pressure sucks fuel into the airstream through a nozzle or nozzles located in the center of the venturi. Sometimes one or more additional booster venturis are placed coaxially within the primary venturi to increase the effect.\nAs the throttle is closed, the airflow through the venturi drops until the lowered pressure is insufficient to maintain this fuel flow, and the idle circuit takes over again, as described above.\nBernoulli’s principle, which is caused by the momentum of the fluid, is a dominant effect for large openings and large flow rates, but since fluid flow at small scales and low speeds (low Reynolds number) is dominated by viscosity, Bernoulli’s principle is ineffective at idle or slow running and in the very small carburetors of the smallest model engines. Small model engines have flow restrictions ahead of the jets to reduce the pressure enough to suck the fuel into the air flow. Similarly the idle and slow running jets of large carburetors are placed after the throttle valve where the pressure is reduced partly by viscous drag, rather than by Bernoulli’s principle. The most common rich mixture device for starting cold engines was the choke, which works on the same principle.\n\nPower valve\nFor open throttle operation a richer mixture will produce more power, prevent detonation, and keep the engine cooler. This is usually addressed with a spring-loaded “power valve”, which is held shut by engine vacuum. As the throttle opens up, the vacuum decreases and the spring opens the valve to let more fuel into the main circuit. On two-stroke engines, the operation of the power valve is the reverse of normal – it is normally “on” and at a set rpm it is turned “off”. It is activated at high rpm to extend the engine’s rev range, capitalizing on a two-stroke’s tendency to rev higher momentarily when the mixture is lean.\nAlternative to employing a power valve, the carburetor may utilize a metering rod or step-up rod system to richen the fuel mixture under high-demand conditions. Such systems were originated by Carter Carburetor[citation needed] in the 50’s for the primary two venturis of their four barrel carburetors, and step-up rods were widely used on most 1-, 2-, and 4-barrel Carter carburetors through the end of production in the 1980s. The step-up rods are tapered at the bottom end, which extends into the main metering jets. The tops of the rods are connected to a vacuum piston and/or a mechanical linkage which lifts the rods out of the main jets when the throttle is opened (mechanical linkage) and/or when manifold vacuum drops (vacuum piston). When the step-up rod is lowered into the main jet, it restricts the fuel flow. When the step-up rod is raised out of the jet, more fuel can flow through it. In this manner, the amount of fuel delivered is tailored to the transient demands of the engine. Some 4-barrel carburetors use metering rods only on the primary two venturis, but some use them on both primary and secondary circuits, as in the Rochester Quadrajet.\n\nAccelerator pump\nThe greater inertia of liquid gasoline, compared to air, means that if the throttle is suddenly opened, the airflow will increase more rapidly than the fuel flow, causing a temporary “lean” condition which causes the engine to “stumble” under acceleration (the opposite of what is normally intended when the throttle is opened). This is remedied by the use of a small mechanical pump, usually either a plunger or diaphragm type actuated by the throttle linkage, which propels a small amount of gasoline through a jet, wherefrom it is injected into the carburetor throat. This extra shot of fuel counteracts the transient lean condition on throttle tip-in. Most accelerator pumps are adjustable for volume and/or duration by some means. Eventually the seals around the moving parts of the pump wear such that pump output is reduced; this reduction of the accelerator pump shot causes stumbling under acceleration until the seals on the pump are renewed.\nThe accelerator pump is also used to prime the engine with fuel prior to a cold start. Excessive priming, like an improperly-adjusted choke, can cause flooding. This is when too much fuel and not enough air are present to support combustion. For this reason, carburetors are equipped with an unloader mechanism: The accelerator is held at wide open throttle while the engine is cranked, the unloader holds the choke open and admits extra air, and eventually the excess fuel is cleared out and the engine starts.\n\n[edit] Choke\nWhen the engine is cold, fuel vaporizes less readily and tends to condense on the walls of the intake manifold, starving the cylinders of fuel and making the engine difficult to start; thus, a richer mixture (more fuel to air) is required to start and run the engine until it warms up. A richer mixture is also easier to ignite.\nTo provide the extra fuel, a choke is typically used; this is a device that restricts the flow of air at the entrance to the carburetor, before the venturi. With this restriction in place, extra vacuum is developed in the carburetor barrel, which pulls extra fuel through the main metering system to supplement the fuel being pulled from the idle and off-idle circuits. This provides the rich mixture required to sustain operation at low engine temperatures.\nIn addition, the choke is connected to a “fast idle cam” or other such device which prevents the throttle from closing fully, which could starve the venturis of vacuum and cause the engine to stall. This also serves as a way to help the engine warm up quickly by idling it at a higher than normal speed. In addition, it increases airflow throughout the intake system which helps to better atomize the cold fuel and smooth out the idle.\nIn older carbureted cars, the choke was controlled by a cable connected to a pull-knob on the dashboard operated by the driver. In most carbureted cars produced from the mid 1960s onward (mid 1950s in the United States) it is usually automatically controlled by a thermostat employing a bimetallic spring, which is exposed to engine heat. This heat may be transferred to the choke thermostat via simple convection, via engine coolant, or via air heated by the exhaust. More recent designs use the engine heat only indirectly: A sensor detects engine heat and varies electrical current to a small heating element, which acts upon the bimetallic spring to control its tension, thereby controlling the choke. A choke unloader is a linkage arrangement that forces the choke open against its spring when the vehicle’s accelerator is moved to the end of its travel. This provision allows a “flooded” engine to be cleared out so that it will start.\nSome carburetors do not have a choke but instead use a mixture enrichment circuit, or enrichener. Typically used on small engines, notably motorcycles, enricheners work by opening a secondary fuel circuit below the throttle valves. This circuit works exactly like the idle circuit, and when engaged it simply supplies extra fuel when the throttle is closed.\nClassic British motorcycles, with side-draft slide throttle carburetors, used another type of “cold start device”, called a “tickler”. This is simply a spring-loaded rod that, when depressed, manually pushes the float down and allows excess fuel to fill the float bowl and flood the intake tract. If the “tickler” was held down too long it also flooded the outside of the carburetor and the crankcase below, and was therefore a fire hazard.\n\nOther elements\nThe interactions between each circuit may also be affected by various mechanical or air pressure connections and also by temperature sensitive and electrical components. These are introduced for reasons such as response, fuel efficiency or automobile emissions control. Various air bleeds (often chosen from a precisely calibrated range, similarly to the jets) allow air into various portions of the fuel passages to enhance fuel delivery and vaporization. Extra refinements may be included in the carburetor/manifold combination, such as some form of heating to aid fuel vaporization such as an early fuel evaporator.\n\nFuel supply\n\nFloat chamber\n\n\n\n\n Holley “Visi-Flo” model #1904 carburetors from the 1950s, factory equipped with transparent glass bowls.\n\n\nTo ensure a ready mixture, the carburetor has a “float chamber” (or “bowl”) that contains a quantity of fuel at near-atmospheric pressure, ready for use. This reservoir is constantly replenished with fuel supplied by a fuel pump. The correct fuel level in the bowl is maintained by means of a float controlling an inlet valve, in a manner very similar to that employed in toilet tanks. As fuel is used up, the float drops, opening the inlet valve and admitting fuel. As the fuel level rises, the float rises and closes the inlet valve. The level of fuel maintained in the float bowl can usually be adjusted, whether by a setscrew or by something crude such as bending the arm to which the float is connected. This is usually a critical adjustment, and the proper adjustment is indicated by lines inscribed into a window on the float bowl, or a measurement of how far the float hangs below the top of the carburetor when disassembled, or similar. Floats can be made of different materials, such as sheet brass soldered into a hollow shape, or of plastic; hollow floats can spring small leaks and plastic floats can eventually become porous and lose their flotation; in either case the float will fail to float, fuel level will be too high, and the engine will not run well unless the float is replaced. The valve itself becomes worn on its sides by its motion in its “seat” and will eventually try to close at an angle, and thus fails to shut off the fuel completely; again, this will cause excessive fuel flow and poor engine operation. Conversely, as the fuel evaporates from the float bowl, it leaves sediment, residue, and varnishes behind, which clog the passages and can interfere with the float operation. This is particularly a problem in automobiles operated for only part of the year and left to stand with full float chambers for months at a time; commercial fuel stabilizer additives are available that reduce this problem.\nUsually, special vent tubes allow air to escape from the chamber as it fills or enter as it empties, maintaining atmospheric pressure within the float chamber; these usually extend into the carburetor throat. Placement of these vent tubes can be somewhat critical to prevent fuel from sloshing out of them into the carburetor, and sometimes they are modified with longer tubing. Note that this leaves the fuel at atmospheric pressure, and therefore it cannot travel into a throat which has been pressurized by a supercharger mounted upstream; in such cases, the entire carburetor must be contained in an airtight pressurized box to operate. This is not necessary in installations where the carburetor is mounted upstream of the supercharger, which is for this reason the more frequent system. However, this results in the supercharger being filled with compressed fuel/air mixture, with a strong tendency to explode should the engine backfire; this type of explosion is frequently seen in drag races, which for safety reasons now incorporate pressure releasing blow-off plates on the intake manifold, breakaway bolts holding the supercharger to the manifold, and shrapnel-catching ballistic nylon blankets surrounding the superchargers.\nIf the engine must be operated in any orientation (for example a chain saw), a float chamber cannot work. Instead, a diaphragm chamber is used. A flexible diaphragm forms one side of the fuel chamber and is arranged so that as fuel is drawn out into the engine the diaphragm is forced inward by ambient air pressure. The diaphragm is connected to the needle valve and as it moves inward it opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, thus replenishing the fuel as it is consumed. As fuel is replenished the diaphragm moves out due to fuel pressure and a small spring, closing the needle valve. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady fuel reservoir level, which remains constant in any orientation.\n\nMultiple carburetor barrels\n\n\n\n\n Holley model #2280 2-barrel carburetor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Colombo Type 125 “Testa Rossa” engine in a 1961 Ferrari 250TR Spyder with six Weber two-barrel carburetors inducting air through 12 air horns; one individually adjustable barrel for each cylinder.\n\n\nWhile basic carburetors have only one venturi, many carburetors have more than one venturi, or “barrel”. Two barrel and four barrel configurations are commonly used to accommodate the higher air flow rate with large engine displacement. Multi-barrel carburetors can have non-identical primary and secondary barrel(s) of different sizes and calibrated to deliver different air/fuel mixtures; they can be actuated by the linkage or by engine vacuum in “progressive” fashion, so that the secondary barrels do not begin to open until the primaries are almost completely open. This is a desirable characteristic which maximizes airflow through the primary barrel(s) at most engine speeds, thereby maximizing the pressure “signal” from the venturis, but reduces the restriction in airflow at high speeds by adding cross-sectional area for greater airflow. These advantages may not be important in high-performance applications where part throttle operation is irrelevant, and the primaries and secondaries may all open at once, for simplicity and reliability; also, V configuration engines, with two cylinder banks fed by a single carburetor, may be configured with two identical barrels, each supplying one cylinder bank. In the widely seen V8 and 4-barrel carburetor combination, there are often two primary and two secondary barrels.\nMultiple carburetors can be mounted on a single engine, often with progressive linkages; four two-barrel carburetors were frequently seen on high performance American V8s, and multiple four barrel carburetors are often now seen on very high performance engines. Large numbers of small carburetors have also been used (see photo), though this configuration can limit the maximum air flow through the engine due to the lack of a common plenum; with individual intake tracts, not all cylinders are drawing air at once as the engine’s crankshaft rotates[4].\n\nCarburetor adjustment\nToo much fuel in the fuel-air mixture is referred to as too rich, and not enough fuel is too lean. The mixture is normally adjusted by one or more needle valves on an automotive carburetor, or a pilot-operated lever on piston-engined aircraft (since mixture is air density (altitude) dependent). The (stoichiometric) air to gasoline ratio is 14.7:1, meaning that for each weight unit of gasoline, 14.7 units of air will be consumed. Stoichiometric mixture are different for various fuels other than gasoline.\nWays to check carburetor mixture adjustment include: measuring the carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, and oxygen content of the exhaust using a gas analyzer, or directly viewing the colour of the flame in the combustion chamber through a special glass-bodied spark plug sold under the name “Colortune”[5] for this purpose. The flame colour of stoichiometric burning is described as a “bunsen blue”, turning to yellow if the mixture is rich and whitish-blue if too lean.\nThe mixture can also be judged after engine running by the state and color of the spark plugs: black, dry sooty plugs indicate a too rich mixture, white to light gray deposits on the plugs indicate a lean mixture. The correct color should be a brownish gray. See also reading spark plugs.\nIn the early 1980s, many American-market vehicles used special “feedback” carburetors that could change the base mixture in response to signals from an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. These were mainly used to save costs (since they worked well enough to meet 1980s emissions requirements and were based on existing carburetor designs), but eventually disappeared as falling hardware prices and tighter emissions standards made fuel injection a standard item.\nWhere multiple carburetors are used the mechanical linkage of their throttles must additionally be adjusted to synchronism for smooth engine running.\n\nCatalytic carburetors\nA catalytic carburetor mixes fuel fumes with water and air in the presence of heated catalysts such as nickel or platinum. This breaks the fuel down into methane, alcohols, and other lighter-weight fuels. The original catalytic carburetor was introduced to permit farmers to run tractors from modified and enriched kerosene. The U.S. Army also used catalytic carburetors with great success in World War II, in the North African desert campaign[citation needed].\nWhile catalytic carburetors were made commercially available in the early 1930s, two major factors limited their widespread public use. First, the addition of additives to commercial gasoline made it unsuitable for use in engines with catalytic carburetors.

Very expensive I must say. Good thing is not cheap, and cheap thing is not good. That is very true.\nThis FAG 6305TB.P63 high speed engine bearing is very recommended if you want to get smooth running engine with good power delivery.\nI have used two pieces of FAG high speed engine bearing for my Yamaha RX-Z and the results were good and beyond my prediction. Before this, I have used 15T-40T 428 sprocket set for Yamaha RX-Z. My bike has been less pickup and not good at low RPM. But when I use the FAG high speed bearing, I can use 15T-37T 415 sprocket and the power are good from low to mid to high RPM.\nGreat product, highly recommended and worth the money!\nCheck it out at online store here: http://motomalaya.net/store\nAdvertisements",

        "300cc\nJ300\nKawasaki \n\n2014 Kawasaki J300 – innovative urban transport solution \n\n\nPosted on December 7, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nKawasaki has revealed its first maxi-scooter for the urban market with the tag line – innovative urban transport solution. Motorcycle are known to be the one to be used to beat the gridlock of traffic in the rush hour that is between 7.30-8.30am and 4.30-5.30pm. By using scooter, it would be easier to ride it since ‘everything’ is almost automatic. No clutch lever to press, no gear to change. Just start and go.\nKawasaki shown this J300 at EICMA, Italy that comes with 4-stroke liquid-cooled 299cc engine that provides 28PS at 7,750RPM and 28.7Nm of pulling power at 6,250RPM. Braking is checked with the use of single 260 mm petal disc with dual-piston caliper for the front and single 240 mm petal disc with dual-piston caliper for the rear. Seat height is low at 775mm and this could mean an easier ride for Asian people too. Fuel tank is big at 13 liter and this can provide long distance travel comfort by having less fuel station stops. The rear suspension is adjustable for single or two person riding setup. This can provide comfortable and stable ride. The front suspension gets the 37mm  telescopic forks for precise control and sporty feel.  \n\nKawasaki also prepares a good amount of accesorries for riders comfort and needs. There is the rear box that can provides ample space for riders to put their riding gear and some of small luggage while travelling back and forth from work. Kawasaki also think differently by also providing the leg cover for the rider to that they didn’t get wet and this can also helps in cold conditions that might freezes the riders leg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is said that this scooter is a joint cooperation with KYMCO from Taiwan which is one of the prominent scooter manufacturer there. They have made some good scooter in 400cc displacement and well received. This is a viable option for Kawasaki to learn first to make a scooter and after this I think they can improve by making their own developed scooter. Looking at this time, many manufacturer are looking to cut cost up to a point they tarnish their reputation little by little. There is quality from Kawasaki that we always rely on and hoping that they will keep it that way.\n2014 Kawasaki J300 Specs:\n\nEngine\n\n\nEngine type\nLiquid-cooled, 4-stroke Single\n\nDisplacement\n299 cm3\n\nBore x stroke\n72.7 x 72.0 mm\n\nCompression ratio\n10.8:1\n\nValve/Induction system\nSOHC, 4 valves\n\nFuel system\nFuel injection:φ34 mm x 1\n\nIgnition\nECU Control (Full transistor)\n\nStarting\nElectric\n\nLubrication\nForced lubrication, wet sump\n\nTransmission\n\n\nTransmission\nCVT with centrifugal clutch\n\nFinal Drive\nBelt\n\nPrimary reduction ratio\n2.220 ~ 0.790\n\nFinal reduction ratio\n7.222 (43/16 x 43/16)\n\n\n\nFrame\n\n\nFrame type\nTubular diamond, steel\n\nRake/Trail\n28o / 113 mm\n\nWheel travel, front\n110 mm\n\nWheel travel, rear\n100 mm\n\nTyre, front\n120/80-14 M/C 58S\n\nTyre, rear\n150/70-13 M/C 64S\n\nSteering angle, left / right\n40o / 40o\n\nSuspension\n\n\nSuspension, front\n37 mm telescopic fork\n\nSuspension, rear\nTwin shocks with 5-way adjustable preload\n\nBrakes\n\n\nBrakes, front\nSingle 260 mm petal disc; Caliper: Dual-piston\n\nBrakes, rear\nSingle 240 mm petal disc; Caliper: Dual-piston\n\n\n\nDimensions\n\n\nDimensions (L x W x H)\n2,235 x 775 x 1,260 mm\n\nWheelbase\n1,555 mm\n\nGround Clearance\n145 mm\n\nSeat height\n775 mm\n\nFuel capacity\n13 litres\n\nCurb Mass\n191 kg\n\nPerformance\n\n\nMaximum power\n20.3 kW {28 PS} / 7,750 rpm\n\nMaximum power with RAM Air\n28.7 Nm {2.9 kg/m} / 6,250 rpm\n\n\nvia: http://www.kawasaki.co.uk/J300\nAdvertisements",

        "125cc\nHonda\nhonda technology\ntechnology \n\nCrankshaft Offset on 2012 Honda 125cc Global Engine \n\n\nPosted on December 24, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nWhat is crankshaft offset? I have been reading about Honda technology online book and found this picture that explains about it. \nBased on the diagram, it is easy to understand how crankshaft offset works. As the name suggests, the crankshaft position which usually placed directly below center the piston are now placed ‘offset’ from the center. What happens is that the power stroke in every combustion that burns inside the chamber are now transferred directly to the crankshaft from the piston.\nThe benefit of this crankshaft offset method is that less friction will occur from the movement of the piston when it moves from Top Dead Center (TDC) to Bottom Dead Center (BDC) since all the movement are concentrated to the connecting and crankshaft, not to the side of the cylinder block.\nReliability of the engine are now increased since the all the section of the connecting rod takes the abuse of the power stroke, not just the top or bottom part.\nWith this benefit, it is easy to see an engine that is fitted with crankshaft offset will have more power and better reliability.\nThe only downside of this method is just the engine casing needs to a little larger to accomodate the offset crankshaft.\nAdvertisements",

For the Race Blu version, it is the same livery that the European get on October 2012.  \n\n \n \nThe other changes we want to see is the inclusion of ABS brake system, but I can’t find any mention of it in the brochure.

The show is taking place just 70km from the headquarters and factory of Pata, Italy’s famous snack manufacturer which is title partner of the Pata Honda team for the second year.  \n\n\n\n\nJonathan Rea – \nPata Honda World Superbike\n\n\n\n\nIt was quite difficult at times in 2013 and the season ended badly in injury, but my leg feels OK now. It’s not quite 100% and I have some discomfort walking on it, but on the bike it’s fine. This team feels like a family to me now and knowing all the faces and how the team works helps me to get the best out of the package and the people around me. We all share the same goals but it feels like there’s been a change of mentality for this season – everyone is even more focused than usual. By the time we get to Phillip Island we will have tested a lot, and we’re really pushing hard, so I think that if anyone is in good shape to challenge at the front when the season starts, it’ll be me and my team.\n\n\n\n\nLeon Haslam – \nPata Honda World Superbike\n\n\n\n\nLast season was definitely one to forget for me. We started a little bit on the back foot and then I broke my leg just after round two. I’m training again quite strongly now and the team’s been working 24-7 on the bike, mainly on the electronics, so we’ll be aiming to maximise what we have from the start of the season and see where that puts us. It’s fantastic to have Pata back on board this year – it’s a really good, family-run company and I didn’t really get a chance to show them what I’m capable of last year. I’d love to repay them with some podiums and some wins this season and have some good after-race parties!\n\n\n\n\nMichael van der Mark – \nPata Honda World Supersport\n\n\n\n\nWe have already tested the CBR600RR and there have been a lot of improvements which we noticed immediately. The team has overcome some of the big problems we had last year with some new software updates so we can head into the new season with some confidence. I was very happy with my first season in World Supersport and to get on the podium in my first race at Phillip Island was fantastic. So, it’s great to be back with the team again and I can’t wait to start racing again. \n\n\n\n\nLorenzo Zanetti – \nPata Honda World Supersport\n\n\n\n\nYes, I think I improved a lot as a rider last year after quite a difficult start. The bike has definitely improved as well, especially in the electronics, and I think we have a good way forward for this coming season. I am really looking forward to working with this team again and to challenging for the podium in every race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRonald ten Kate – \nteam manager\n\n\n\n\nIt’s clear that 2013 wasn’t a great year for us – the riders got injured quite heavily but, in a way, that allowed us to step back and review the whole situation, looking at the bike and what we would be needing for the coming season. So, we’ve had a big development plan and brought in a lot of parts for the bike. The electronics have been upgraded massively over the winter and we’ve got a good testing programme, so I think we can say we’re better prepared than ever before. The new Honda Fireblade SP is good step forward, especially for road riders and those taking it on to the track. We’re already using a lot of that upgraded technology like suspension and brakes, and the engine improvements will be useful, too. We’re pulling out all the stops and with four talented and determined riders, I firmly believe that we can compete for race wins this season and even two championships.\n\n\n\nCarlo Fiorani – \nHonda Motor Europe\n\n\n\n\nIt is very nice for us to have Pata and Tonello and all our other sponsors with us again for the 2104 season. They have once again confirmed their support for this team, even though the results last year were not very good. We had two big crashes with our Superbike riders and we had many issues, so its good that we can retain the trust of our sponsors and we will try our hardest to reward their continued faith. The team has worked hard, even over the Christmas period, to make a competitive Honda CBR1000RR Fireblade SP for the 2014 season. The bike is a step forward from last year  and, of course, we will be pushing harder than ever to get some good results.\nAdvertisements",

There are 2 version of the seating as you can see in the above picture. One is the normal two-seater as in the Polar White and Lime Green, but the Ebony and Sunbeam Red is single-seater. Small, slim and fun. It is all that you need for a great ride.\nvia: https://www.facebook.com/yas.kawa.3\nAdvertisements",
        "1000cc\nmotogp\nYamaha \n\nValentino Rossi is on 5th place on Sepang test \n\n\nPosted on February 26, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing were back in Malaysia today for the first day of the second official test of the 2013 season at the Sepang International Circuit. The riders were able to test throughout the morning but were then forced to call off the remainder of the day’s testing due to rain. Reigning World Champion Jorge Lorenzo was again quick to get up to pace, managing to complete a total of 25 laps before retiring for the day in second position, 0.235 seconds from first. The Mallorcan spent the day focusing on bike set up in the search for better acceleration from his M1.   \nItalian rider Valentino Rossi suffered a technical issue with the 2013 YZR-M1 early in the session however was able to continue testing with the 2012 machine to gather valuable data. Rossi completed the day’s riding in fifth position, less than half a second from first.\n\nJorge Lorenzo – Laps 25, Time – 2’01.815\n“Not so much new stuff today, we just tried to improve our current settings. We made some modifications but nothing special. For the next two days, more of the same! We need to improve the acceleration a little bit but for the moment no new bits to try. The track was more slippery than the first test due to the rain which has left the tarmac in a worse condition.”\n\nValentino Rossi – Laps 25, Time – 2’02.028\n“The first day is not so bad, but we were unlucky because we had a small problem with the bike which had the new chassis so we had to stop and use the old bike. We made some tests with that using just one tyre and my pace and my lap times were not so bad. After we waited for the afternoon for the real work but the rain came so we decided to stop continue tomorrow. If it rains again tomorrow we will do some laps in the wet conditions.”\n\nTest Times\n1. Dani Pedrosa ESP Repsol Honda (RC213V) 2m 1.580s (Lap 17/43)\n2.

        "250cc\nYamaha\nYZF-R25 \n\n2014 Yamaha YZF-R25 Officially Unveiled in Indonesia – 2-inline DOHC 8-valve 36PS 250cc power – Rp 53million (RM14,893.00) \n\n\nPosted on May 20, 2014May 21, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n2014 Yamaha YZF-R25 has been unveiled officially in Indonesia for its world premiere. It is a very interesting bike and focuses on the performance which is exactly what Yamaha should do and they do deliver. It comes in 3 colour choices that is Diablo Red, Racing Blue and Predator Black. That Racing Blue version really reminds me of the livery of the YZR-M1 that is being used currently in MotoGP 2014.\nAs I told you earlier this is an interesting bike. I love this bike as soon as I know the official specs. It delivers 36PS (35.5hp, 26.5kW) at 12,000RPM with torque rated at 22.1Nm at 10,000RPM. This is definitely one of the highest power rating for a 250cc bike compared to currently available in the market. As a comparison, look at these numbers: 2011 Kawasaki Ninja 250 2-cylinder is at 32hp, 2011 Naza Blade 250 V-Twin 2-cylinder at 28.8hp and YZF-R25 only lower than 1998 Kawasaki ZX250R 4-inline at 45hp (this one higher la cause 4-inline, I put here to compare only la bro).  \n\nThe engine is the highlight of the bike as it is equipped with 4-stroke DOHC 8-valve (4-valve per cylinder) 2-cylinder inline liquid-cooled configuration. It is definitely fuel injection type with TCI (Transistorized Control Ignition) ignition system. One thing to note is that this engine is tuned to handle a high compression ratio at 11.6:1 that provide better ‘kick’ for each power stroke of the bike engine. The bore and stroke dimension of YZF-R25 are overbore at 60.0 x 44.1mm which shows the high-revving-happy of the engine.\nTransmission fitted for this YZF-R25 is the sweet 6-speed gearbox with multiplate wet manual clutch system. 6-speed gearbox will enable you to play nicely with the engine high RPM to maxes out the 36PS from it.\nBraking system is handled by disc brake system for both front and rear tyre. The front brake system features 298mm floating disc(two-piece type) 2-piston caliper. The rear brake system is handled by 220mm one piece disc with 1-piston caliper.\nSuspension are also given special treatment by Yamaha as the front telescopic fork are now 41mm which can be considered big in its class. For comparison, the other bike that use big front fork diameter is the KTM Duke 200. Rear suspension is the usual monocross suspension that provides great handling.\nYamaha favourite frame type is the diamond-type and it is again being used in this YZF-R25 as it offers high stiffness and low weight for that easy handling especially when taking corners.\nThe one question that you’ll want to ask is whether this will come to Malaysia or not. Well, please be happy as the YZF-R25 are reported by Sinar Harian that it is now on the list of bike that will come to Malaysia, but don’t know when.\n2014 Yamaha YZF-R25 price in Indonesia is Rp 53million (OTR) (RM14,893.00 direct conversion, or with 30% excise tax and 5% sales tax import duty at RM20,105.55)\nYamaha YZF-R25 Technical Specs/Specification\nType : 4-stroke, 8-valve DOHC liquid-cooled motomalaya.net\nCylinder/position : 2/inlinemotomalaya.net\nBore X Stoke : 60,0 X 44,1 mmmotomalaya.net\nCompression ratio : 11,6 : 1motomalaya.net\nFuel System : Fuel Injectionmotomalaya.net\nIgnition system : TCI (Transistorized Control Ignition)motomalaya.net\nSpark type : CR9Emotomalaya.net\nBattery : GTZ8V (MF Battery 7.4 Ah)motomalaya.net\nStarter : Electric Startermotomalaya.net\nLubrication: Wetmotomalaya.net\nEngine oil capacity: Total = 2,40 L ; Servis = 1,80 L ; Oil filter change = 2,10 L\nLength x Width x Height : 2.090 mm X 720 mm X 1.135 mm\nSeat height : 780 mm\nGround clearance : 160 mmmotomalaya.net\nWheel base : 1380 mm\nCaster angle : 25 degree\nTrail : 95 mmmotomalaya.net\nMaximum output : 26,5 KW(36 PS) @ 12.000 rpmmotomalaya.net\nMaximum torque : 22,1N.m @ 10.000 rpmmotomalaya.net\nCurb mass: 166 kgmotomalaya.net\nFuel tank capacity : 14,3 L (Res : 3 L)\nChassis type: Diamondmotomalaya.net\nTransmission: Manual, 6-speedmotomalaya.net\nClutch : Wet, Manual clutch , Multiplatemotomalaya.net\nFront & Rear tyre : Tubeless 110/70-17M/C(54S) & 140/70 – 17M/C(66S)\nFront and rear brake : Floating Ø 298mm, 2-Piston & Disc Ø 220mm 1-Pistonmotomalaya.net\nFront suspension : Telescopic Fork (diameter 41 mm)\nRear suspension : Monocross Suspension\nFront lamp : DC Halogen 12V,55W (H7)\nRear lamp: LED\nImage and info credit to: http://tmcblog.com/2014/05/20/yamaha-indonesia-resmi-rilis-sportbike-yamaha-yzf-r25/ and https://www.facebook.com/Yamaholigan?fref=photo\n \nAdvertisements",

Honda Wave 125X is one of the new bike introduced in Malaysia this year along with Suzuki Shogun, Yamaha Lagenda 110ZR, Naza Prisma and Modenas Kriss 120.I use Honda C70 long time ago when I was at university. It was a very reliable bike. You can drive it anywhere and the maintainance is very low. I remember at that time I used to fit the C70 with oversize carburetor that is RX-S carburetor for 115cc bike. The power and torque from it is very large but the piston and original block seem to be able to take all the pressure and stress.Honda is reliable and reliability is Honda. Honda Wave 125X here also have the same spirit with other Honda Cub series being reliable and indestructible.The styling of the Honda Wave 125X is good but nothing more than that compared to Yamaha LC135, Lagenda ZR and Suzuki Shogun 125SP. Everything that Honda have here is very basic and very traditional. You can see it still use double shock system, 125cc engine and rear drum brake.The exhaust got a little bit of modification with the race-style muffler just like Suzuki Shogun or like the AHM exhaust.For more information, click here.\n\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\nGixxer 150\nsuzuki \n\n2014 Suzuki Gixxer 150 introduced in India by Salman Khan \n\n\nPosted on January 27, 2014January 27, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nGixxer is the named reserved for the GSX-Rs. Whether it is GSX-600R, GSX-750R or GSX-1000R, most riders lovingly called their GSX-Rs, Gixxer. But in India, Suzuki has released the Gixxer 150, a naked bike with 150cc engine. Usually, the naked version of the Suzukis are named GSR, like the GSR750. Anyway, it is a good move from Suzuki to introduced the Gixxer 150 after a long hiatus since the introduction of the FXR150. This brings back its competitive edge to challenge the TVS Apache, Bajaj Pulsar and Honda Trigger in India. Said to be powered by the 13.8hp engine based on the GS 150R.  \nThe Gixxer bears the resemblance of the GSR750 in terms of styling and comes with the tubular steel chassis type. The wheels are nice with that 6-spoke Y design. Front brakes are 2-piston caliper disc brake setup and the rear carries the usual drum setup for affordability measures. One interesting thing to look at is the exhaust muffler which looks striking and looks like from the bigger brother of 600cc bikes.\nThe usual question is whether this bike will makes its way to Malaysia or not? So far, there is no news or even rumors about it, but, I’m hearing Suzuki might CKD the GSX-1000R soon for the Malaysian market. So far, still rumors.\nvia: TMCblog: http://tmcblog.com/2014/01/27/new-suzuki-gixxer-155-resmi-dirilis-di-india-nih-foto-full-body-nya/#more-54741\nand indianautosblog: http://indianautosblog.com/\n \nAdvertisements",

Some of the parts here are expensive, but quality is proven as Motul YYPang team has always been on the podium.Exhaust pipe are the easiest performance upgrade we can do to our bike whether is Yamaha, Honda, Suzuki, Modenas, big bike or small bike. For 2-stroke bike, exhaust pipe is very important as it is very closely related to performance of the bike and that is very true if you look at the exhaust pipes YYPang has to offer for Yamaha Y125Z bike. It has 6 different pipes!Different exhaust dimension will give different performance at different RPM. For stock exhaust pipe, the pipe is tuned for good overall performance with almost silent sound. But, if you look for the sprint test exhaust pipe, you can see it is shorter and the ‘belly’ or the chamber is slimmer. This is due to the fact that this exhaust need to perform very well and at its very best at highest RPM. Meaning that the performance of this sprint test exhaust is not good from low to mid RPM. In sprint test, who doesn’t hit the throttle to full carb opening and highest RPM?Choose your exhaust wisely.\n\nAdvertisements",

The Japanese company’s rise to glory was characterised with quick-found success in the championship with a first pole position in its maiden year, a first podium in 2003 and a first race victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix in 2004. From this point onward, Bridgestone’s success rapidly gained momentum with multiple victories in the 2005 and 2006 seasons, culminating in a first MotoGP™ championship title with Ducati’s Casey Stoner in 2007. A second MotoGP™ championship followed in 2008 with Yamaha’s Valentino Rossi, resulting in Bridgestone receiving the honour of being named the first ever Official Tyre Supplier to the series in 2009, thus achieving its objective of distinguishing itself as the world’s premier motorcycle tyre manufacturer.\nA long and successful involvement in MotoGP™, supported by significant investment, has given Bridgestone an edge over the competition through the transition of race-proven technologies from the circuit to the road. Motorcycle riders around the globe will benefit from Bridgestone’s long and successful involvement in MotoGP™ for many years to come.\nBridgestone expresses its deepest gratitude to the riders, teams, FIM, IRTA and Dorna, as well as motorsports fans around the world, for their support over the years.Although it is planning to exit the MotoGP™ World Championship at the end of the 2015 season, Bridgestone will continue to do its best in promoting motorsport as part of its portfolio of activities.\nShu Ishibashi – Senior Vice President Chief Marketing Officer Responsible for Group Global Marketing, Bridgestone Corporation\n“Since 2002 Bridgestone has invested large amounts of resources into MotoGP, to help us achieve the goal of becoming the world’s foremost tyre manufacturer. During this time we have forged a strong and successful partnership with Dorna and the teams, which culminated in our company being the first ever Official Tyre Supplier to the championship. MotoGP has proved to be an extremely valuable tyre development platform that has helped us introduce highly advanced technologies into our range of road tyres, to the benefit of consumers. The increase in our brand awareness since joining the series has also been an excellent outcome for us, and we are proud that we have been involved in a series that continues to grow in popularity year-on-year.While Bridgestone will withdraw from the MotoGP championship after 2015, we are considering other opportunities to maintain our position of as a key player for motorsports fans all around the world.”\nKyota Futami – General Manager, Global Motorsport Department, Bridgestone Corporation\n“It is with some sadness that we will make our exit from MotoGP after such a prosperous participation in the sport. Yet, having achieved everything we set out to do when we entered the championship over ten years ago, including sharing in many MotoGP World Championships, our company believes it is the right time to implement an exit strategy from the series. Over the next two seasons we will continue our world-class level of support to all the teams and riders, and will keep investing heavily in our MotoGP tyre development programme. We will continue to push the boundaries of motorcycle tyre development over the next two years to ensure that we leave the championship at the end of 2015 in the best way possible.”\nAdvertisements",

        "4-stroke\n400cc\nDuke 390\nKTM \n\n2014 KTM 390 Duke launched in Malaysia – RM27,935.10 OTR [UPDATED: Gallery added, topspeed 177km/h] \n\n\nPosted on October 22, 2013April 28, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nIt has come and it will rock the biking scene in Malaysia. The first information that we all want to know is the price and here it is: RM26,500 basic price and RM27,935.10 on the road and might differs a bit between shops. This 390 Duke is CKD in Kedah at KTM Motonation Factory.\nKTM 390 Duke comes with 43hp single-cylinder engine that provides enough grunt for a bike this size. For a comparison, the CB500F have 47hp which is comparable to this KTM 390 Duke. \n\nTested by Rafi Superbike, this KTM 390 Duke topspeed is 177km/h. That is a nice number for this naked bike that should perform well on rough terrain where speed is not the priority. This also shows the good engineering of KTM  engineers for this single-cylinder engine.\nThe frame used is the usual by KTM that is the orange Trellis frame that provides maximum strength and chassis rigidity at the same shows the muscular look of the bike body.\nKTM 390 Duke should be available in the shops by next year and will be a great addition to the already popular KTM 200 Duke.\n\nThe overall design of the bike is not much different than the 200 Duke since it is actually based from the chassis of the 200 Duke but further strengthen to handle the power from the 390 engine. It is unmistakably KTM style that is very radical and very different for the bikes that we always see from the streets. I think this bike would be a great commuter ride for those who are looking for more power than kapcais and the same this able to speed on multi terrain road.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages from the KTM Malaysia-CKD FB and ktm.com\n \n \nAdvertisements",

It features 1kW of motor (equivalent to 1.34hp). The battery can be charged from zero based to fully charged for 3.5 hours. At 39cent per charge, CTRIC can be taken to 65km (my daily ride is less than 30km, so, there is a market for this bike). Suggested price for this bike is RM5,000, but it is said that the maintainance cost is 50% less than the internal combustion engine since it doesn’t have to use engine oil, filters, spark plugs and so on.\nNot available yet. Modenas is now waiting for green light by the parliament to make this bike can be taken to the public road.\nUPDATE (16/06/2011): It is launched!

        "150cc\nPrimavera\nvespa \n\n2014 Vespa Primavera launched by NAZA Premira – a revitalized favourite – RM11,888 \n\n\nPosted on September 12, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nNAZA Premira Sdn Bhd, the sole and official importer and distributor of Vespa scooters in Malaysia, introduced the Vespa Primavera – a brand classic with a refreshed look, in an official launch ceremony at the ACME South Café in Bangsar.\nThe Vespa Primavera, originally launched into post-war Italy in 1968, was the scooter that brought a breath of fresh air to a changing world in the form of stylish mobility. It went on to become one of the most admired and enduring models in the brand’s history; also making Vespa into the worldwide phenomenon that it is today. Now the legendary two-wheeler has returned to delight a whole new generation of scooter enthusiasts.  \nThe new Primavera sports a more streamlined look with key elements echoing the image of the stylish Vespa 946. Youthful, innovative, swift and dynamic, the Primavera combines the most advanced Piaggio technology with a host of contemporary features to offer a gleaming new design that fits hand in hand with this model’s story.\nPresent at the official launch were Mr. Brendan Ang, Area Sales Manager, Piaggio Asia Pacific, Mr. Abdul Hamid Ismail, Senior Vice President, NAZA World Group of Companies, Mr. Zakaria Ismail, Senior Vice President, NAZA World Group of Companies and Mr. Farouk Faisal, General Manager of NAZA Premira Sdn Bhd.\n“Vespa has rejuvenated a classic by combining key features of the much-loved Primavera with the latest Piaggio technology. The new design is remarkably trendy, more comfortable and stays loyal to the history of the original model. It’s a sophisticated ride with improved fuel efficiency, smooth power delivery and enhanced riding pleasure; making it ideal for maneuvering through the hustle and bustle of city streets.” stated Datuk Wira Hj SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, NAZA Group of Companies Joint Group Executive Chairman.\nHe added that, “Vespa has seen increasing popularity in Malaysia recently, with more people recognizing the brand as a lifestyle product rather than just a means of mobility. We are confident that the local market will warmly welcome the Primavera’s return and that this model will capture the attention of two-wheel enthusiasts nationwide. Vespa Malaysia is proud to announce that in celebration of this iconic model’s return, we are introducing a 1 year or 10,000km warranty specifically applicable for the Vespa Primavera. This is a market first and will redefine customer care.”\n“To date, we have 9 dealer networks in Peninsular Malaysia that comply with the Piaggio Corporate Identity (CI) and we aimed to add on another 11, making it of 20 dealer networks across Malaysia,” Datuk Wira HJ SM Faisal furthered.\nAdvertisements",

But sometime, you might also get BP7ES or even BP9ES. The different number on the spark plug relates to the heat transfer of the spark plug to minimize the carbon deposit that usually stuck at the spark arcing area of the spark plug.

In my humble opinion (pada pendapat saya dengan rasa rendah diri), both bike are great, but the ES version are absolutely desirable. Very desirable. I think it can be a great replacement for Y125Z that has been stopped production. Anyhow, Y125Z is completely different beast because it is two-stroke bike. I’m guessing this ES will be next popular bike from Yamaha which can be placed along the legends like the RX-Z and Y125Z.\nIt will be ‘All Conquering’.\nSo, here it is:\nDifferences:\n1. The foot protector in ‘P’ shape for ES is projected forward while the SS version is projected backward that looks like inverted P.\n2. The crankcase design is difference. Maybe this show new crankcase design for ES version. SS version crankcase is the same like the 2006-2010 135LC version.\n3. Kick starter also designed differently.\nUPDATE (25/04/2011):\n4. The wheel of ES is Enkei brand, SS is Yamaha brand.\n5. The wheel of ES got wheel lining in red colour.\n6. The wheel of ES in black colour, SS in gunmetal gray.\nMore comparison of the specs below.

The benefit of this kind of gear is that you can easily shift to 1st gear in traffic stop.\nComparison of gear ratios shows that the 5th gear of ES version is OD (overdrive).

We can expect better pickup and top speed by fitting this block to the Wave 110RS or the Dash.\n12 more pictures after the jump  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Hitting the top speed at 221.6km/h (137.7mph), this bike one of the faster bikes at the time.\nThe sales of this MH900e is unique where the it is sold online directly by Ducati. This means that there are no middleman handling the transaction. It is Ducati direct to the customer. A great record to be remembered when the first batch of 1,000 unit of the MH900e is snapped online just by 31 minutes after the sales start on January 1st 2000, 12.01am.\nIt is more interesting that this particular bike pictured above is the one that is available in Malaysia.

        "135cc\n135lc\n135LC 5-speed\nmalaysia bike\nparts\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\nInstalling BMC Air Filter FM624/04 and NGK G-Power CPR8EAGP-9 Platinum Alloy Spark Plug for my Yamaha 135LC ES 5-speed \n\n\nPosted on December 12, 2011December 12, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nBMC Air Filter inside the air filter box\nI have installed the BMC Air Filter for my 135LC ES with the code FM624/04. I have wrote a preview of the BMC Air Filter here. BMC Air Filter is a superflow air filter which can maintain 98% of air flowing to your engine. The normal paper air filter can only provide 60-70% air flow to the engine. You can imagine this if you try to breathe with a mask covered with paper. I think you won’t be comfortable inside it. I also have changed the spark plug to NGK G-Power CPR8EAGP-9 Platinum Alloy which have smaller center electrode that provide better spark. Usually the changes of air filter should came with the change of spark plug for better performance.   \nRemove the 4 bolt to get into the air filter\nAfter installing the BMC Air Filter, I can immediately notice my bike become much lighter and I don’t have to twist my throttle hard to send in the power. I can feel the bike is easier to move. Throttle response also being improved. You can have much more rapid throttle action with this BMC Air Filter  installed. For example, I can now easily move my bike from 40km/h in 4th gear to 80km/h in much shorter time. I don’t know the actual time, but it really is much shorter that what I felt previously with the stock air filter. I’m very happy with the throttle response and the feel of my bike right now. It just feel much more responsive and eager to accelerate. It feels like a beast waiting to be unleashed.\nTake out the air filter cover after the 4 bolt has been removed\nOne more thing that I notice is that, I can have lower throttle opening to achieve the same speed with stock air filter. The throttle response are now much more linear and predictable, especially in 4th gear. You’ll know how the power will go when you twist the throttle. No more lazy power delivery. Everything is fast and quick.\nI have talked to Mr. Giulio, the area manager of BMC Air Filter  about the performance of it. He said that by installing this air filter, the carb will be leaner since there are much more air flow to the carb. The good thing about the BMC Air Filter is not just about the cotton air filter but about the frame that is made from PU (polyurethane) than is flexible and evenly attached to the filter element using polyurethane epoxy glue. The cotton filter element is preoiled to prevent dirt gets into the engine. Without the oil, the cotton filter element  will not works well. The cotton filter element of BMC Air Filter have filtration size from 10-20 micron which can easily filter sand, dust and debris. Normal polyester filter element can have the filtration size at 80 micron, which are not able to filter small sized sand.\nRemove the bolt here to take out the center cover\nIn 2010, Max Biaggi have used this BMC Air Filter and win the WSBK champisonship. In 2012, BMC Air Filter are going to sponsor the Yamaha Factory Racing team and you are going to see the BMC sticker at the bike. Usually it is being attached to the swing arm of the bike. BMC Air Filter also has made the CRF (carbon reinforced filter) that is made specially for the WSBK but now available for sale for superbikes usage. Price is not cheap though!\nBMC Air Filter also has being used in Eurocopter helicopter and they have tested the helicopter is Nevada, which is a desert full of sand. The test result are good since BMC Air Filter provides good filtration and minimise the maintenance cost of the Eurocopter.\nBut, what about the top speed? Has it increased after you used this BMC Air Filter? Let me be honest with you. The answer is NO. Using BMC Air Filter is not going to increase the top speed of the 135LC ES 5-speed, but it provides shorter time to achieve its stock top speed that is at 120km/h. I have asked this question too to Mr. Giulio and he said that I’m correct, since high performance air filter only provides better air flow that benefit the throttle response, but for top speed, you need to modify at least the exhaust system. Yoshimura guys? Hehe… Maybe next.\nOh, the price of the BMC Air Filter FM624/04 for 135LC ES is RM278 RM228(confirmed price by Manfred from QBEE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

The design follows the bigger brethen that is the Z750 and Z800, with the engine and chassis derived from the popular Ninja 250R. The naked bike in this 250cc are something that most manufacturers are now fighting to gain riders acknowledgement and of course, the rider’s money. The design of the headlight of this Z250 really resemble the Z800. One unusual thing that can be seen is the signal indicator are now separated on the top of the headlight which I think, looks better. It retains the goodness of the chassis and the 2-cylinder 4-stroke engine that has been fitted to the Ninja 250R.  \n\nOne good news for all of us in Malaysia is that, this bike will come to our market very soon. This has been rumored by my source. The launch in Malaysia maybe later than we expect in January, maybe around end of February or March. The price in Indonesia is IDR48.5million which valued at RM15,539.79. I guessing this bike will be price around RM22-23k when it arrives here. Hopefully, it will be cheaper.\n2013 Kawasaki Z250 Pearl Stardust White\n2013 Kawasaki Z250 Ebony Black\n2013 Kawasaki Z250 Red\n \nvia: https://www.facebook.com/pages/BALU-OTO-WORK/149809748421638 via: https://www.facebook.com/iszmacabrez and https://www.facebook.com/mohdadzreem.talib\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nYamaha Factory Racing Prepare for ‘Home’ Grand Prix at Mugello \n\n\nPosted on May 29, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing set up for their ‘home’ race in Italy this weekend for the Gran Premio d’Italia at the Autodromo Internazionale del Mugello near Florence. Nestled deep in the Tuscan hills, the Mugello circuit is just over 300km from the team’s base in Gerno di Lesmo, near Milan. The track is a favourite for both Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi, with each scoring multiple victories across classes. Lorenzo can claim one 250cc win, two second place premier class finishes in 2009 and 2010 and the last two consecutive premier class victories in 2011 and 2012.\nRossi’s Mugello record includes one 125cc win in 1997, a 250cc win in 1999 and then an incredible seven-year consecutive premier class win streak at Mugello from 2002 to 2008, making him the only Grand Prix rider ever to take seven straight wins at his home race.   \nThe Mugello circuit is one of the fastest tracks on the MotoGP calendar. With a straight of over a kilometre in length fans can expect to see some incredible speeds as the 1000cc machines get pushed to the limit. The rest of the 5.245km track is guaranteed to provide exciting racing with 15 turns, varied camber and gradient changes and high speed chicanes set on an extra wide track with many overtaking possibilities.\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n“I’m looking forward to visiting Mugello after suffering a very disappointing weekend at Le Mans. It was a tough race for us and I want to recover points at Mugello, a good track for me. I like the circuit a lot because of its layout, plenty of long and high-speed corners. I have a lot of good memories there and I would like to make a positive weekend.   I think also for Yamaha it is a good place to get the best performance. The circuit is amazing to ride and also the temperature is quite warm, as well as Jerez. The crowd is also very passionate there.   The only weak point for us is the long straight, where maybe our rivals are stronger than us, but in general the track is very suitable for our bike. I can`t wait to go to Italy and find the pace. We need to cut away the gap to the front but anyway, the Championship is long so we have to be calm.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n“I am very happy that we go to Mugello. I love this track and I’m really happy to go back there with Yamaha. This is a track that I really like and a good result is important. Unfortunately we are still not fast enough so we need to improve, especially in dry conditions. We must work hard and improve the bike. The Mugello race will be difficult, but we will try to do everything to get the best result. A podium would be really nice. I believe that there will be many people at Mugello so I’m happy and the heat in Mugello is always good!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“Well, after Le Mans where the result was very disappointing for us we need to make a good race. After three races where we have not found the pace wanted we will try to get some good points to keep our focus on the Championship. We know our rivals are really strong but there are still 14 races to go, this is quite long and the first track where we have to fight for the victory is Mugello. This circuit I think suits Jorge and Yamaha quite well so we hope to start in a good way.”\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“I’m really looking forward to the Mugello race. This is our first home race and it’s a really nice circuit, a really nice place and there are always a lot of fans there. I think now that Valentino is back with a competitive bike more people will come to see the race as well. We always get a good result at this circuit so we are looking for a completely different result from Le Mans. We will start the first practice really focused to prepare the entire weekend in the best possible way and we will see what will happen on Sunday afternoon.”\nAdvertisements",

It features 35.5 horsepower at high-revving engine of 12,000RPM. The engine is using the offset cylinder to maximise the power delivery to the crankshaft as the connnecting rod will be in straight position when the piston hits BDC (bottom dead center). Also included is the proven DiASil alloy cylinder that minimises friction to the wall of the cylinder from the piston.  \nForged aluminium piston ensures the total mass of the piston is low (thus making it lightweight) and at the same time, tough enough to handle the 35.5hp. The connecting rod are carburized which mean it is carbon-hardened to enables it to be strong.\n\nOf course, the engine is fuel-injected to ensures the accurate fuel metering and able to maxes out the power it can.\n\nIt is a truly beautiful bike with a great engine.

Present at the event were En Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, Vice President of NAZA Two Wheels & Four Wheels Division and Mr. CW Juan, General Manager of Next Bike Sdn Bhd. Ducati Monster 1200 comes with 135hp at 8,750RPM and 116.6Nm at 7,250 RPM . The more powerful version of the Monster 1200 carry the S insignia that gives out 145hp and 124.7Nm for a rider who are hungry for more power.\n“The latest incarnation of the ever iconic Ducati Monster is a very important model to Ducati and Next Bike Sdn Bhd. To date, many have found homes in Malaysia. We aim to sell 100 – 120 units of this Monster 1200 family in 2014,” said Datuk Wira Hj SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, Joint Group Executive Chairman of NAZA Group of Companies.  \n \n“The biking community here is strong and very supportive towards the brand and this particular model, something we are very appreciative of. We are aware that there are still enthusiasts who want something more serious which is why we have decided to bring in the Monster 1200,” furthered Datuk Wira Hj SM Faisal.\n\n“We hope that the introduction of the Monster 1200 leads to a stronger bond between Ducati Malaysia and Ducatistis in the country. This new bike will definitely strengthen the Ducati brand here but its successful introduction gives us no reason to rest on our laurels. We are committed to delivering more exciting models in the future of which one would be coming next month on top of ensuring that the ownership satisfaction of our customers is not just maintained, but enhanced over time,” Datuk Wira HJ SM Faisal added. \n\nDespite being a thoroughly more serious track machine than other models in the Monster range, the family DNA is still evident in the Monster 1200. The naked performance bike features the model’s signature Trellis frame, ensuring that onlookers make no mistake of the bike’s identity.\n\n2014 Ducati Monster 1200 price is RM106,888 and Monster 1200 S price is RM119,888. Price is from Sinar Turbo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nH2\nKawasaki \n\nKawasaki Ninja H2 is coming on 30th September at Intermot – supercharged Kawa? \n\n\nPosted on September 2, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe media and my FB timeline has been flooded with a teaser from Kawasaki with the tag Ninja H2. Ninja H2 has already been made earlier in 1972 configured with 3-cylinder 2-stroke 750cc engine. It produces 74hp at 6,800RPM and 7.9kgm of torque at 6,500RPM. That number is not impressive for today value, but in that era of 70s, it can be said to be the “king of the streets”. For comparison, the 2013 Kawasaki ZX-6R 636 4-stroke inline-4 engine can produce 129.3hp at high 13,500RPM.\nSo, to be the “king of the street” again, the Ninja H2 must have a powerful engine but it can’t be from another 2-stroke engine. One option they have is to supercharge the engine. Why not turbocharged it? I think, the supercharged engine will have a more linear power delivery and this can eliminate ‘power shock’ after the rider exit a turn. Compared to turbocharger, the power can shock the rider after the engine hits certain RPM range and when the boost is sufficient. Will Kawasaki us a supercharged engine? Then, what will be the price? Oh, the dilemma and the thoughts…\nAdvertisements",

        "agv\nvalentino rossi edition \n\n2012 AGV Pista GP helmet \n\n\nPosted on March 27, 2012 by eddy \n\n\nAGV Pista GP Helmet\nPista in Italy means track. So this AGV Pista GP is a helmet specially made for track rider. Previously, this helmet has been codenamed ‘Project 46’ with Valentino Rossi involved in the development of the helmet. This new helmet from AGV is extremely good. Here is what Rossi said about it:\n“I am very happy with the interior shell”\n“Great aerodynamics, it feels like I am not wearing a helmet”\n“Excellent ventilation, it is really noticeable”\n“Exaggerated visibility, like switching from the TV to the cinema”.\nIt features lots of improvement from the previous flagship helmet from AGV, that is the GP Tech. The shell for this state-of-the-art helmet is from carbon fiber which provides lightweight construction and high strength properties. The helmet is made in a process called ‘reverse engineering’, whereby the helmet is designed around the head contours of the rider. In this case, it was Rossi’s head. The visor has been improved with +15 degree opening that helps the rider to view the track better when flat out on the tank. All this without compromising the safety.\nOne of the concern of a rider like us is about the price. I think this one will not come cheap, maybe you need to save a lot money in long time before you can buy this. Or you can sell your bike to buy this helmet.\nAGV PISTA GP TECHNICAL DATA SHEET  \nSAFETY\n•  Exterior shell in 4 sizes entirely made of carbon composite fibre.\n•  Interior shell in EPS in 4 sizes.\n•  Shell  and  EPS  dimensions  optimized  using  the  FEM  (Finite  Elements  Analysis)\nsystem.\nDESIGN\n•  Designed to maximise comfort, ergonomics, safety and aerodynamics.\n•  Designed to minimise interference when wearing a racing suit and protective hump.\nVENTILATION/AERODYNAMICS\n•  IVS (Integrated Ventilation System) with wide channels hollowed directly in the shell\nand holes that allow direct air flow to the rider’s head.\n•  Ventilation system, designed and optimized in a wind tunnel, comprising 4 front air\nintakes (3 at the front and one on the chin guard) and 2 rear extractors.\n•  Air  intakes  are  in  the  “always  open”  position  with  protective  metal  frames  and\nmeshes. Plastic caps are available for bad weather. Total surface area of air intakes\n193% larger than the GP-Tech.\n•  Large  rear  spoiler  optimized  in  a  wind  tunnel  to  maximise  aerodynamic\nperformances and ventilation also at high speeds. Spoiler designed to detach from\nthe helmet in the event of an accident to increase the passive safety of the helmet.\nVISOR/ VISOR MECHANISM\n•  New visor mechanism in metal with roto-translation opening. Quick release system\nfor tool-free removal and replacement of the visor in seconds. Surface of the visor\nmechanism reduced by 71% compared to the GP-Tech.\n•  Safety  system  with  an  external  screw  attached  to  the  mechanism  base,  reducing\nthe risk of the visor detaching in the event of a fall. Visor front locking system that\nreduces the risk of accidental opening, also in the event of an accident. Visor micro-opening system incorporated in the front locking system.\n•  Flat,  non-scratch  and  anti-fog  RACE  visor  with  wide  field  of  vision,  equipped  for\ntear-off strips with 100% protection from UV rays.\n•  Visor, in compliance with the Class 1 optical standard, is free from visual distortion,\nwith a thickness up to 3.5mm for extra protection.\n•  Field of vision increased by 15° on the horizon, optimized for a rider lying flat on the\ntank.  Overall field  of  vision  increased  by  about  8%  compared  to  the  GP-Tech  and\nthe main rivals.\nINTERIOR SHELLS\n•  Removable nose guard.\n•  Removable wind-proof chin strap protection.\n•  Fully removable and washable inner liners;\n•  Breathable, micro-perforated Lycra crown pad with concave 3D structure that is pre-shaped in a single piece according to the morphological characteristics of the head,\nwithout  stitching  in  the  sensitive  areas,  and  differentiated  density  foam.  Option  of\npersonalising  the  crown  pad  fit  at  4  support  points,  thanks  to  inserts  with\ndifferentiated hardness.\n•  3D cheek pads in Dry-comfort with sanitizing treatment, differentiated density foam\nand incorporated neck protector for extra comfort and soundproofing.\n•  Inner liners covered by three patents.\n•  Double D retention system.\nWEIGHT/DIMENSIONS\n•  Front section reduced by 3% compared to the GP-Tech. Lateral section reduced by\n6% compared to the GP-Tech.\n•  Weight: 1.250g (+/- 50g) for size M.\n•  Sizes: XS – XXL.\nYou can check out more information about it here: http://www.agv.com/en/pages/display/pista_gp/index\nAdvertisements",

        "250cc\nYamaha\nYZF-R25 \n\n2014 Yamaha YZF-R25 – the 250cc supersports from Yamaha really exists [UPDATED: 3 more pictures added] \n\n\nPosted on November 20, 2013December 3, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nIt is true. Yamaha is really preparing a 250cc bike. Taufik from tmcblog.com has updated us about the Yamaha YZF-R25 (not R4 as rumored) 250cc bike with this delicious YZR-M1 livery.\nThe chassis features a twin spar which provide lightness and rigidity. The concept shows the Akrapovic exhaust setup and air intake on the headlight which comes out like the one in  MotoGP M1.\nThe race version of this machine might not be a finished product but the production version should take the design cues heavily.  \nThe engine are said to be 2-inline 249cc liquid-cooled type and that’s all we know about the engine. No power and torque figures yet but the usual 250cc bike can churns out 30-32PS (take as example Ninja 250 at 32PS).\nRossi has done a video ads about this bike and he said in his accent that “this bike really packs a punch”. He still got that marketing skill in his skin. The bike looks very much alike the YZR-M1 and I wish the production version to stay at that theme.\nThe rear features nice fenderless style and the tail light is nicely done simply with that small shape. Akrapovic is installed and that already make the bike looks race ready. The tyre are wide and complements the overall look of the bike. The monoshock suspension is retained and that should make the riding much more predictable and sharper.\nInteresting and absolutely machine of dream. You can drool now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVia: http://tmcblog.com/2013/11/20/ini-dia-yamaha-r25-250-cc/ and http://global.yamaha-motor.com/news/2013/1120/tms-02.html#01 and https://www.facebook.com/YamahaR25\nAdvertisements",

Another top 10 in the bag is pretty rewarding for us. It’s just unfortunate Hafizh got caught up behind Corsi when he crashed. Should Hafizh had that chance to hold his opening lap position place, it would be another chapter totally in the race.

I want to get the point at the next race with same pace which I had,” said Azlan.\nTeam manager, Tadayuki Okada said, “Azlan did not make a good start but quickly moved up to 16th and kept a consistent, competitive pace throughout the race. I am just a bit disappointed that he missed the points due to strong wind.

        "125cc\nFuture Helmet-In\nHonda\nhonda malaysia \n\nMy opinion about the Honda Future Helmet-In \n\n\nPosted on July 27, 2012July 27, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion about this new Honda Future 125 on MM FB page and also on this post. I personally likes the features available for this bike. There are a few important features that I think are very important for this Honda Future to beat other bikes in the same category. The bikes in the same category are Axelo, Wave 125, Lagenda 115 and Ace 115. Even though Lagenda 115 and Ace 115 are 115cc and 120cc bikes, we can still consider it in the same category as there are no offering from both of the manufacturer that can provide 125cc 4-stroke moped model. Also, the price not differs much.\nImportant features of the Honda Future Helmet -In\n1. Helmet-in Underseat Box\nThis is one of the very important feature of this new Honda bike. I have been struggling to keep my helmet every time I park my bike. You can use the helmet hook that is available on most bikes, but imagine if that time is raining. Your helmet will successfully become a good water basin. By keeping the helmet under the seat you can make sure it doesn’t become wet. Good thing!\nIf you were someone who like to wear expensive helmet like original SHOEI, ARAI or AGV, even just riding moped, you’ll definitely be thankful of this feature. You can properly secure the helmet invisibly under the seat. At least, we can reduce the potential of the helmet being stolen since it is not visible on the bike. Anyway, it’ll be a great loss if you lose everything including your bike to a thief. In the end, the helmet-in feature is an important feature for any moped that can give lots of benefit and enhance the security of helmet  which is a good addition to this Honda Future (I don’t like the name Future though, since it is not so much futuristic at all).  \n2. BIGGG fuel tank at 5.6l\nHonda bikes are well-known for its fuel-efficiency, but most of their bikes only have small fuel tank that is ranging from 3.5l (iCOn) to 3.7l (EX-5). In Malaysia, we need a big fuel tank capacity for extended journey with minimal fuel stops. Some of my friend riding everyday to go to work from Shah Alam to Rawang with his 135LC(4.0l) and everyday he needs to top up his fuel tank on the way back to his home. This thing has become normal to him become because he experienced it everyday, but wouldn’t it be better if you still have some fuel left after your journey for the day. I mean, you only need to top up the fuel once per two day. That would be great. Honda Future comes with 5.6l of fuel tank capacity, that is 60% more capacity that iCon or 51.35% more capacity when compared with EX-5! How are you going to neglect that feature when long journey is why you need to ride a bike? In my humble opinion, this is a very needed features for a long distance traveler and should be for your consideration if you are one of them.\n3. Wider seat\nWith the ability for this Honda Future to be a long haul bike, Honda has make the bike better by having a wider seat. Long distance traveling are also known as ‘iron butt ride’ since the butt can really hurts. You need a butt made of iron to endure the torture of that long journey. Honda knows this and the introduction of the feature to this bike will make the riding less torturous and more comfortable for us all.\n4. Front and rear disc brake\nUsually Honda likes to use traditional drum rear brakes for their moped. This is good too since drum brakes are known to be simple to repair, maintain and at the same time is light weight. Anyway, in Malaysia, the fatality rates of bikers are among the highest in the world and having a more powerful brakes can at least help to increase the safety of the bikers. In my opinion, disc brake are much better than drum brake is it has better reliability rate. What I mean is that, the drum brake shoe (pad) doesn’t last very long compared to disc brake pad which can last for at least few years without changing (depends on your riding style though!). Based on experience using rear drum brakes on my RX-Z, I need to adjust it timing every month. After 3 month, I already need to change the drum brake shoe to a new one. Compared to the front disc brake which actually handles 70% of my braking, it is not being changed yet even up to this day and still working good! Long haul rider will need to get this for your ride, it can increase the ability of your braking so that you maneuver on the road will be better and of course, it will enhance the safety of your journey.\nGuys, all that is being written based on my humble and low-knowledge opinion being in this arena of motorcycle without any bias to any brand. I hope it can give you some idea about whether you can choose this bike as your next bike. You are invited to comment below to make this article better. Thanks for your time!\nYeah, here is the price again for Honda Future Helmet-In electric starter / alloy wheel sport rim / double disc brake OTR = RM6,200.\nAdvertisements",
        "250cc\nDuke 250\nKTM\nRC250 \n\n2015 KTM 250 Duke (RM17,888) and RC 250 (RM18,888) unveiled at KTM Lifestyle Showroom, Malaysia – time for 250cc KTM! \n\n\nPosted on June 30, 2015December 14, 2015 by eddy \n\n\nKTM Malaysia CKD has given the riders in Malaysia a taste of 250 series offering from Austria. These two bikes has launched earlier in KTM Lifestyle Showroom, Kota Damansara, to show that KTM is ready to compete with its competitors in the segment of 250cc naked and sports category. KTM RC 250 and Duke 250 are always in the talks of the riders when we see the 200 KTM or the 390 KTM. It is perceive in the riders mind that 200cc is small, where 390cc is too big, so they want something in the middle, which is the 250cc bike from KTM. Now, their wish has been granted.  \nLets get into KTM Lifestyle first. KTM Malaysia CKD is a good company where it always handle event and activities to support the riders who rides KTM. There is always a weekend ride at least once a month. If you ever join their event, you’ll know that they provide a great event with super low entry fee. You must join the event if you own a KTM.\n\nThe KTM RC 250 and Duke 250 are identical in every way you see it physically when you compare with its 200 counterpart. As they say, this is actually a wolf in sheep clothing. Looks tame on the outside, but very fierce on the inside. Other than the ‘250’ sticker on the mid-fairing of the RC 250 and on the tank of the Duke 250, it just look the same like the RC 200/390 and 200/390 Duke.\nKTM RC 250 and 250 Duke adds to the family of the RC and Duke series which is very popular among riders who like to try new thing. I said new things because this KTM just don’t exists yet 5 years ago with these kind of bikes!\n\nThe highlight of the bike of course is the light weight 248.8cc engine that can maxes out 31.3hp (23kW) at 9,000RPM along with the torque at 24Nm at 7,250RPM. Compare this to 151kg Ninja 250SL at 28hp @ 9,700RPM and torque 22.6N.m @ 8,200rpm. Or the 166kg YZF-R25 power at 35.5hp, 26.5kW @ 12,000RPM with torque rated at 22.1Nm at 10,000RPM. I think the KTM RC250 provides the perfect balance of performance and lightness of the bike. KTM RC250 only weighs at 147kg. When you own this bike, you’ll talk power-to-weight ratio.\n\nOne special features that separates the RC 250 and 250 Duke away from the RC 200/390 and 200/390 Duke is the implementation of the anti-hopping clutch as KTM says it (slipper clutch). Anti-hopping clutch works when the the rotation of the rear tyre is faster than the rotation of the crankshaft under braking, thus the anti-hopping clutch ‘slips’ the clutch so that there are no ‘hopping’ occurs.\n\nIt is still equipped with the same Moto3 inspired Trellis frame that is in the iconic KTM orange colour. KTM has fitted the largest front suspension in 250cc sports category at 43mm USD suspension from WP Suspension.\n\nKTM RC 250 features an innovative rear seat design where you see the rear tail cover also works as the rear seat. We have said in early review of the KTM RC 200/390 that this is actually a clever solution.\n\nAnother great features that separates the RC 250 and 250 Duke from the 200 is the availability of the ABS as standard. The ABS module is from Bosch 9MP. ABS works when there is difficult braking situation occurs. One thing that should be mention too is the Pirelli Diablo Rosso II tyres that comes as standard.\n\nAlso offered is the PowerParts series where the quality is guaranteed by KTM as it is developed by them. I’d like to have the windscreen racing bubble, this definitely helps to cheat the wind when riding on the highway.\n\nWe think KTM RC 250 and 250 Duke will be a popular bike soon. This can be related to the price that is affordable enough with the premium parts offered. But what will happen to RC 200 and 200 Duke? For that, we leave it to you.\nPrice for the KTM 250 Duke is RM17,888 (basic)\nPrice for the KTM RC 250 is RM18,888 (basic).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

As you can see, from 0-1/4 opening of the throttle, the pilot jet takes the job to deliver fuel to mix with air inside the carburetor.After the 0 opening and before it reach 1/3 opening, throttle valve takes the job.After that, from 1/6-3/4 opening, needle jet takes the job.Next, from 1/4- <3/4, jet needle takes the job.And finally, the main jet takes the job after full opening of the throttle valve.\nThen, how to tune this carburetor?The basic rule of tuning carburetor is to make the fuel-air mixture remains consistent at any throttle valve opening, but you can also tune it to your preference.For example, let say I have my bike to have good mid throttle valve opening performance for better pick-up for mid-RPM. So, what I can do is to modify the jet needle only. I need to get a thinner jet needle so that more fuel can be mixed when throttle valve is in 1/4-3/4 position.\nOne more thing, when you bore the carburetor to get a larger diameter for the airflow, you also need to modify or replace all the jets to a suitable one. You need to get thinner jet needle, larger diameter needle jet, larger main jet and larger pilot jet. If not, the mixture of the fuel-air will become to lean (less fuel, too many air).\nSimply said, the bore size of the carburetor air intake must be proportional with the size of the jets.\nNow, you can try to modify your own carburetor. Do this with your own risk!\nFor more info, click here\nAdvertisements",
        "parts \n\nApple Racing Gasket – No Engine Sealant Needed and Non-Asbestos \n\n\nPosted on March 27, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe popular gasket for many bike tuners in Malaysia, Apple Gasket (not to be confused with Apple Computer) has been around for many years and has equipped us with lots of gasket size for our tuning needs. One of the gasket made by Apple is this racing 60mm complete gasket set for Yamaha 135LC. Usually the tuners need to custom made the gasket by themselves since there are no replacement gasket for bigger bore engine. Even if it is available, it would be very hard to find but this, Apple Gasket is easily available in many workshop in Malaysia based on my observation. Apple Gasket is made by NP Gasket and it is good to know that they listen to tuner needs.   One more reason to choose Apple Gasket is due to the construction material that doesn’t use asbestos. This is good to the environment and equally good to your health. This is due to the fact that asbestos can cause Mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that is caused by the exposure to asbestos. IMO, a good rider is a healthy rider. So, next time when you are going to look for gasket, look for Apple Gasket!\nThe price are also affordable at RM15-30 depends on your bike model.

For now it is okay but, after I change my original exhaust to Yoshi Racing exhaust, I think I need to do something about it. This is because the new exhaust has released more power and torque than the original standard exhaust.My next sprocket change is to 16T-39T as pictured above. I haven’t installed this yet as I’m a little bit busy for now. This changes I think will not effect much on the performance since I only use it on short trip. Using smaller rear sprocket can give benefit for long distance traveling since it can give lower RPM at the same speed using standard sprocket. It can also give better fuel efficiency since it revs low.You should also check for the material that is used to make the sprocket. As you can see in the picture, the rear sprocket is being made with High Carbon Steel(HCS). HCS is a lighter material than steel. Also HCS is better in terms of durability since it can withstand pressure and the friction from the drive chain. The best material for sprocket is made from the mixture of metals also known as alloy. Alloy is much tougher, lighter and eventually more expensive. The hardest material that is known to man is diamond, but I have never seen sprocket being made from diamond before.Here is another information about sprocket material for industry application at http://www.daviesmarketing.com\n“Sprocket Materials\nMost standard sprockets are manufactured from steel. They can be made from many type of material, but the offerings from most manufacturers are based upon their own equipment limitations and the tooling available to cut the teeth.\nBelow is a listing of typical sprocket materials and their most frequent application environments.\nSteel – Is considered the most typical construction material. It is available in different hardness levels (covered later) and is used in all types of applications.\nBronze – Is a metal used in non-magnetic applications where ‘no sparking’ is required. It can also withstand the abuse of some corrosive environments.\nBrass – Is also a non-magnetic application material with the ability to stand up in a number of corrosive environments.\nStainless Steel – This is the most common material used for corrosive environments. It is widely applied throughout in the food processing industry and most manufacturers have types approved for direct food contact.\nTitanium – Light weight and very strong, this metal is a silvery, dark grey colour and is designed for highly corrosive applications or direct chemical exposure such as in the electrical industry where printed circuit boards are cleaned.\nAluminium – Silvery, light weight metal that can resist corrosion but is restricted to light duty, light load applications. Typically used in belt and pulley applications (timing belts).\nNylon (Plastic) – As with roller chain, nylon is also used for anti-corrosive environments, as well as for quietness. \nNylon materials are also generally less expensive than metal. Nylon sprockets can be used in the food industry, as they hold up well in wash down situations. These plastic sprockets can be constructed from electro-conductive through heat resistant styles – similarly found in plastic chain.”What is the sprocket that you are using now?

With refined torque delivery and peak torque of 113 Nm (83 lb-ft), an increase in engine output of 4 kW (6 hp) to 146 kW (199 hp), plus a reduction in weight of 4 kg to 204 kg with a full tank of fuel and Race ABS (making allowances for equipment), the superbike that first debuted in 2009 is entering a new generation. Besides eliciting even sharper performance from the new S 1000 RR, particular attention was also paid to designing the bike to be even more rider-friendly. Whether it is used for everyday riding, flitting through bends on country roads or being put through its paces on the race track – the new S 1000 RR excels in every respect.\nOptimised drivetrain for even greater performance and rideability.\nThe enhanced performance of the new RR in terms of drive power can be attributed to the re-engineered cylinder head with new duct geometry, new intake camshaft and even lighter intake valves. Furthermore, an airbox with a modified capacity combines with an intake system with shorter intake lengths to make mixture preparation more effective than ever and give the new S 1000 RR added punch. A further key contributing factor to the improvement in power and torque characteristics is the new exhaust system, which now dispenses with a front silencer and weighs around 3 kg lighter. Rideability and response from standstill both benefit from an increase in torque upwards of approx. 5,000 rpm, a more linear torque curve, as well as a wide torque plateau that allows the rider to summon up almost maximum pulling power between 9,500 (112 Nm) and 12,000 rpm (113 Nm / 83 lb-ft).\nNew frame structure and chassis geometry for superior riding precision and even better handling. Further improved Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) from the HP4 as an ex-works option.\nChassis-wise, the new RR has been honed with the introduction of a new, lighter frame structure offering an optimised blend of rigidity and flexibility. Together with the optimised chassis geometry featuring redefined values for the steering head angle, wheel castor, wheelbase and swingarm pivot point, it promises even better handling, increased traction and unequivocal feedback, particularly when riding at the limit. The tasks of wheel suspension and damping continue to be performed by fully adjustable spring elements, but with modified negative spring travel for more banking clearance and greater agility. As a factory-fitted option, the new S 1000 RR can also be specified with the new improved version of the electronically controlled Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) suspension – already familiar from the HP4 – that provides the basis for a chassis set-up with absolutely no compromises.\nThree riding modes as standard, plus two more available for fine-tuned adjustment by opting for the Pro riding mode feature.\nTo enable optimum adaptation to the prevailing riding conditions, the new RR bike already comes with three riding modes as standard: “Rain”, “Sport” and “Race”. If the Pro riding mode option is selected, these can be supplemented by the two additional modes “Slick” and “User”. The Pro riding mode option also features Launch Control for flawless racing starts as well as the programmable pit-lane speed limiter for sticking exactly to the pit-lane speed limit. When this feature is activated, it has the additional effect of producing the impressive soundtrack familiar from the world of motorcycle racing. The HP Gear Shift Assist Pro, which can likewise be ordered as an ex-works option, enables lightning-fast clutchless upshifting and downshifting.\nRefined control system set-up. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) with precision calibration in seven +/- steps. \nThe new RR already leaves the factory with Race ABS (semi-integral) as well as Automatic Stability Control (ASC) included as standard. In conjunction with the optional Pro riding mode feature, it can be equipped with Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) including banking sensor and precision calibration. All control systems have been retuned and further improved in terms of their control precision and characteristics.\nFirst ever superbike with cruise control (optional). Innovative instrument cluster design, new electrical system and lighter battery.\nFor the first time, the RR is now also available with an electronic speed control for staying within the current speed limits (ex-works option).\nThe multifunctional instrument cluster comprises a new dial for the analogue rev counter as well as a redesigned LCD display offering a far greater array of functions.\nThe new S 1000 RR furthermore features a new electrical system and a more powerful sensor box, along with a smaller battery weighing around 1 kg less.\nDesign that is more dynamic than ever with stunning colour schemes.\nLast, but by no means least, there is the completely restyled bodywork that speaks an even more dynamic design language.

        "250cc\n250R\ncbr250r\nCBR300R\nHonda\ntechnical specification \n\nConfirmed: 2014 Honda CBR250R will follow the double headlight design as of the CBR300R coming this 24th April to Japan – estimated RM18,254 \n\n\nPosted on April 20, 2014April 20, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nHonda Japan has give a confirmation about the availability of the CBR250R that will use the double headlight design as of the recently introduced CBR300R in Thailand. This is logical and actually cost effective since the similar design will use similar parts hence minimizing the variety of the parts that the factory needs to prepare. I have read earlier that this CBR250R will be the global model along with the CBR300R. I’m thinking that for the country specific regulation, the country might get the CBR300R or CBR250R but not both. We have seen that Thailand got the CBR300R, so Malaysia and Indonesia might be getting the CBR250R.\nThe design of the 2014 CBR250R is absolutely interesting which is sportier and much more race-like in terms of the appearance. The highlight of the design is the use of the double headlight that looks like the CBR1000RR (a.k.a The Rabbit). In my opinion, the double headlight looks much more modern and looks more ‘balanced’. The design is different than the 2011 CBR250R which follows the design cues of the VFR1200.  \nThe engine are still the liquid-cooled single-cylinder 4-stroke 4-valve DOHC but now tuned to extract 1kW more power than the previous 2011 CS250RE engine. Modifications has been done to the connecting tube and the intake duct for better airflow that provides better performance of the engine. The 2014 Honda CBR250R engine is rated at 29PS at 9,000RPM and maxes out the torque at 23Nm at 7,500RPM. It still carries the oversquare dimension where the bore x stroke is measured at 76.0 x 55.0mm. Oversquare engine are characterised by its rev-happy engine that gives exhilarating top end power. As shown above, you need to get to 9,000RPM to extract the maximum power of 29PS out of it. The fuel system are managed by the Honda PGM-FI that will provide accurate fuel measurement to the engine and this will definitely help in terms of the fuel-efficiency. This bike can go 50.1km for every liter of fuel at constant speed of 60km/h. This means that you can take it to 651.3km with just one full tank of 13liter.\nCBR250R in Indonesia will have its contender from Kawasaki that is the RR Mono that is recently launched that make the category of single-cylinder 250cc bike more interesting. Comparing to the RR Mono at 28hp, the CBR250R has the advantage in terms of engine power. The RR Mono bore x stroke measures at 72.0 x 61.2mm which is also oversquare but not as oversquare as the CBR250R. (Note: Oversquare means that the bore is larger than the stroke dimension).\n2014 Honda CBR250R is priced at Japanese Yen 577,000 that translates to RM18,254 (direct conversion bro, no import tax added).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2014 Honda CBR250R Technical Specifications\n\n\n\n Common name\n CBR250R\n\n\n Model Code\n\n Honda · JBK-MC41\n\n\n Total length × width × height (mm)\n 2,035 × 720 × 1,120\n\n\n Wheelbase (mm)\n 1,380\n\n\n Ground clearance (mm)\n 145\n\n\n Seat height (mm)\n 780\n\n\n Vehicle weight (kg)\n 161 [164]\n\n\n Riding Capacity (people)\n Two\n\n\n Minimum Turning Radius (m)\n 2.5\n\n\n Engine model type\n MC41E · water-cooled 4-stroke DOHC 4-valve single-cylinder\n\n\n Total displacement (cm 3)\n 249\n\n\n Inner diameter × stroke (mm)\n 76.0 × 55.0\n\n\n Compression ratio\n 10.7\n\n\n Maximum output (kW [PS] / rpm)\n 21 [29] / 9,000\n\n\n Maximum torque (N · m [kgf · m] / rpm)\n 23 [2.3] / 7,500\n\n\n Fuel consumption rate ※ 2 (km / L)\n Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport notification value fixed area fuel efficiency\n 50.1 (60km / h constant speed test value) <2 occupants when>\n\n\n WMTC mode value (class)\n 32.4 (class 3-1) ※ 3 <1 occupants when>\n\n\n Fuel supply system format\n Electronic <electronically controlled fuel injection system (PGM-FI)>\n\n\n Starting method\n Electric starter\n\n\n Ignition device format\n Full transistor battery ignition\n\n\n Lubricating method\n Pumping splash combination formula\n\n\n Fuel tank capacity (L)\n 13\n\n\n Clutch type\n Coil spring wet multi-plate\n\n\n Transmission format\n Mesh-type 6-speed return\n\n\n\n Transmission gear ratio\n 1 speed\n 3.416\n\n\n 2-speed\n 2.250\n\n\n 3-speed\n 1.650\n\n\n 4-speed\n 1.350\n\n\n Fifth\n 1.166\n\n\n 6-speed\n 1.038\n\n\n Reduction ratio (primary / secondary)\n 2.807/2.571\n\n\n Caster angle (degrees) / Trail amount (mm)\n 25 ° 30 ‘/ 98\n\n\n Tire\n Front\n 110/70-17M/C 54S\n\n\n Rear\n 140/70-17M/C 66S\n\n\n Brake type\n Front\n Hydraulic disc\n\n\n Rear\n Hydraulic disc\n\n\n Suspension system\n Front\n Telescopic\n\n\n Rear\n Swing arm (Pro-Link)\n\n\n Frame format\n Diamond\n\n\n\nimages via: http://tmcblog.com/2014/04/20/kayaknya-ahm-sudah-mulai-daftarkan-tpt-cbr-250r-dual-keen-eyes-nih/\nalso: http://pertamax7.com/2014/04/19/honda-japan-launching-new-honda-cbr250r-2015-dual-headlamp-tenaga-naik-menjadi-2855-ps-tembus-50-kmliter-mulai-rp-553-jutaan/\nand: http://www.honda.co.jp/news/2014/2140418-cbr250r.html\nAdvertisements",
        "Honda\nHonda Cars\ninfo \n\nHonda Develops New Technology to Weld Together Steel and Aluminum and Achieves World’s First Application to the Frame of a Mass-production Vehicle \n\n\nPosted on September 7, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nTOKYO, Japan, September 6, 2012 – Honda Motor Co., Ltd. today announced that it has newly developed a technology for the continuous welding of the dissimilar metals of steel and aluminum and applied it for the first time in the world to the subframe of a mass-production vehicle, a key component of a vehicle body frame. Honda will adopt this technology first to the North American version of the all-new 2013 Accord, which will go on sale in the United States on September 19, 2012, and will expand application sequentially to other models.  \n\nStriving to reduce vehicle weight in order to increase fuel economy, Honda focused on Friction Stir Welding (FSW) and developed a new technology for the continuous welding of steel and aluminum. This technology generates a new and stable metallic bonding between steel and aluminum by moving a rotating tool on the top of the aluminum which is lapped over the steel with high pressure. As a result, the welding strength becomes equal to or beyond conventional Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding*1.\nThis new technology contributes to an improvement in fuel economy by reducing body weight by 25% compared to a conventional steel subframe. In addition, electricity consumption during the welding process is reduced by approximately 50%. It also enabled a change in the structure of the subframe and the mounting point of suspension, which increased the rigidity of the mounting point by 20% and also contributed to the vehicle’s dynamic performance.\nFurthermore, Honda established a new method to apply this technology to mass-production vehicles. Conventionally, FSW required use of large equipment, but Honda developed a FSW continuous welding system applied to a highly versatile industrial robot. This system also can be used for aluminum-to-aluminum welding and thus, the welding system with the same specifications can be used for production of a full-aluminum subframe.\nHonda also developed a non-destructive inspection system*2 using a highly-sensitive infrared camera and laser beam, which enables an in-line inspection of the bonding location for every unit.\n\n*1\nA welding technique most commonly used for welding of identical materials such as steel-to-steel or aluminum-to-aluminum\n*2\nA system that evaluates quality without actually destructing the parts\n\nAdvertisements",
        "1000cc\nmotogp \n\nRound 7 Catalan MotoGP 2014: Pedrosa on pole position for the Catalan Grand Prix – Lorenzo on second \n\n\nPosted on June 15, 2014June 15, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nDani Pedrosa claimed pole position at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for the second year running, after the Repsol Honda rider set a time of 1’40.985 to lead an all-Spanish front row at the Catalan Grand Prix.\nOn another hot day where track temperatures reached over 50°C, Pedrosa kept his cool to claim the front slot on the grid from Yamaha Movistar MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo by just 0.115 seconds. Completing the front row was Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez, who crashed while chasing his seventh-straight pole position but still managed to clock the third quickest time of 1’41.135. All riders on the front row used the medium compound slicks front and rear during their time attack in Qualifying Practice 2.\nThe peak track temperature today of 54°C was recorded during Free Practice 4, with today’s objective for the teams being to find a tyre combination that could tame the greasy track conditions brought on by the scorching temperatures. With grip hard to come by from the track surface, the riders looked for maximum grip and stability from their tyres, and as a result, the medium compound front slick was preferred by almost every rider. Rear tyre choice for the race also became clearer after today’s practice sessions, with the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders, and the majority of the Ducati riders almost certain to race the medium compound rear slick. Most of the Open-class riders look set to choose the soft compound rear slick for the twenty-five lap Catalan Grand Prix.  \nWeather forecasts indicate a high probability of rain tomorrow, and tomorrow’s Warm Up session at 0940 local time (GMT+1) may be the only opportunity for the riders to assess the circuit in wet conditions before the race commencestomorrow afternoon at 1400.\nMasao Azuma – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“Today we had the same hot conditions and during the practice sessions the riders were able to test a few different tyre combinations, so we now have a much clearer idea of what will be used for the race. The combination of the high track temperature and the low-grip surface here at Montmeló means that the riders need as much grip as possible from their tyres to compensate. This means that we don’t expect any Factory-class riders to use the hard compound rear slicktomorrow; instead the medium compound will be their main race tyre. Rear tyre choice for the Open-class riders is more varied, with most of them preferring the soft compound rear, while others feel the medium compound rear offers more consistent performance over race distance. Front tyre choice is more straightforward, with almost every rider preferring the medium compound front as it gives good cornering grip and strong braking performance at the end of the straights. There is still a strong possibility of rain tomorrow, in which case the teams will have two wet tyre compound options to choose from for the race. ”\nBridgestone slick compounds available: Front: Soft, Medium & Hard; Rear: Soft, Medium & Hard (Asymmetric) \nBridgestone wet tyre compounds available: Hard (Main), Soft (Alternative)\nWeather:  FP3 – Dry.

For this circuit, Bridgestone provides asymmetric rear slicks with slightly softer rubber on the left shoulder to offer better grip and warm-up performance e in the slower corners, while the harder right shoulders provide greater stability in the faster right-hand corners. Rear slick options for the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders are the medium and hard asymmetric rear slicks, while the open class and factory concessions riders can use the soft and medium asymmetric rear slicks. With a wide range of track conditions possible at the Jerez, the front tyre allocation for the Spanish Grand Prix is the soft, medium & hard compound front slicks.\n\nThe Jerez circuit is extremely abrasive when wet, so the hard compound option is the main wet tyre this weekend, with the soft compound being the alternative wet option for the front tyre and the extra-hard compound for the rear.\n\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“We have had three exciting races to start the MotoGP season and with this weekend’s Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez, we start the European leg of the championship. Jerez is one of the greatest venues on the calendar due to the flowing circuit layout and the hordes of passionate fans that make the pilgrimage to the circuit each year. It is a circuit where Honda have won the last three years, but this year with so many manufacturers exhibiting strong performance it is hard to pick a winner this weekend. As we are racing in Spain, I hope that both Marc and Dani are fit to ride for the Repsol Honda Team at Jerez in front of their adoring fans.”\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“Jerez is a track with a varied layout that includes both fast and slow corners, so for this circuit we need to provide tyres with a balanced character to provide good handling in every situation. At this circuit we provide asymmetric rear slicks with softer rubber on the left side to provide better grip and warm-up performance in the left-hand corners, while the harder rubber on the right shoulder offers more stability in the sequence of right-handers from turn nine to twelve. The track surface is smooth yet can be abrasive so as well as good grip and stability, our tyre allocation for this circuit must have high levels of durability.

This bike is rated at 125cc 4-stroke type engine. If the picture here is the base model for the all new Modenas, I think many riders in Malaysia will be happy.\nThe rumors earlier states that the monoshock chassis will follow the setup of the near-horizontal monoshock setup like the one we see on the Kawasaki ER-6. This Athlete 125 really have that kind of monoshock setup as shown in the picture. The lower spec model is the Kawasaki Fury 125 which has stainless steel wheel with front brake disc only. The price for this bike is estimated at USD1,380(RM4,179) in Philippines.\nI writing this news based on input by readers and by my guess only.

The fuel economy has been proven with the ECE40 Mode test that shows this bike can go all the way to 338 kilometers on one full tank. That is less petrol station stop to worry about. This is provided with the presence of 5.6 liter fuel tank with new 4-stroke SOHC 125cc engine that recorded 7.6% fuel improvement. Customers will be able to choose from two distinct variants of the same model, as well as a Special Edition. Variant 1 boasts sporty wheels, electric starter and front disc brakes; whilst Variant 2 combines the electric starter, sporty wheels and front and rear disc brakes. All two variants come in choices of three colours – Luminous Orange, Pearl Magellanic Black and Candy Scintillate Red. Interestingly, the Special Edition colour comes in Mat Charcoal Gray Metallic, and which features an electric starter, sporty wheels as well as front and rear disc brakes.  \nENHANCED FEATURES:\nPracticality That Endures\nThe Honda Future features a larger 19-litre U-box that can easily accommodate a full-face helmet. The bigger 5.6 litre fuel tank also allows longer traveling distances, of up to 338km, 100km more than the Wave 125 X Ultimo, without the constant need for re-fuelling stops. Other innovative highlights include a side battery casing that allows for easy maintenance access, a push-seat function and automatic key lock shutters.\nUnrivalled Fuel Efficiency and Eco-Friendliness\nGrounded on the ECE40 MODE research, the fuel consumption of the Honda Future has been mapped at 60.3km per litre, a 0.5km per litre improvement as compared to the Wave 125 X Ultimo. The Euro 2 engine also provides improved fuel-burning efficiency and cleaner emissions that makes the Honda Future an eco-friendly motorcycle.\nComfort Comes First\nThe overall design cues of the Honda Future makes it perfectly adaptable to a range of riders of all shapes and sizes. In order to live up to the expectations of a long-distance moped, the Honda Future is built with a wider seat. The enlarged seat space allows for a more comfortable ride for the rider and pillion over long distances. An ingenious moulded front design also eliminates the need for the use of screws in order to reduce vibrations from the front cover.\nSafety. For Your Peace Of Mind\nThe Honda Future includes a novel rear LED light that is more visible in any riding conditions.

SP399 is one of the most popular wheel in modification scene since it is lightweight, high quality, easy to clean have and nice style. Anyway, this wheel design is not originally from RB since it is being used as a stock wheel for Yamaha Y125ZR in 2001 by Enkei.\nThis bike is still in progress of modifying, so, I shall visit the shop again to see what it looks like when everything is well finished and ready to run.\n6 more pictures after the jump\nAdvertisements",
        "BOSCH\nparts \n\nBOSCH Motorcycle Stability Control – Improved Safety On Two Wheels \n\n\nPosted on October 5, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nBosch has developed motorcycle stability control (MSC), the first brake control system for motorcycles to ensure the best possible stability in all riding situations. It supports the biker during both braking and accelerating, and while riding straight as well as while cornering. The motorcycle’s handling – and thus all the pleasure of riding – remains unchanged. The system will already be available at the end of 2013 with the KTM 1190 Adventure and 1190 Adventure R 2014 models.\n“Almost one in two fatal motorcycle accidents occurs in a bend,” says Gerhard Steiger, president of the Bosch Chassis Systems Control division. “The Bosch MSC motorcycle stability control can help further reduce the number of accidents.” In 2010, more than 5,000 motorcyclists died in road accidents in Europe alone. Studies show that ABS on its own can prevent around one-quarter of all motorcycle accidents that lead to injury or death. The new stability control will increase this number even further.  \nImproved safety – also in bends\n“The technical basis of the MSC is the ABS enhanced system for motorcycles,” says Fevzi Yildirim, head of the Bosch centre of competence for powered two-wheeler safety in Japan. “The new functions are made possible by an extensive array of sensors and sophisticated software.” This system offers motorcycle manufacturers and their demanding customers a whole range of safety functions:\n\nThe lean and pitch angle-dependent ABS control improves riding stability in all riding situations as well as braking effectiveness.\nThe traction control regulates the maximum engine torque so that even on variable or slippery road surfaces, the driving force is efficiently transferred to the road and the drive wheel does not lose its grip.\nWhen braking heavily in curves, the MSC reduces the motorcycle’s tendency to return to an upright position. This involuntary righting of the machine leads to a larger cornering radius, which often results in the motorcycle leaving its lane. In these situations, the eCBS electronic combined brake system creates the best possible distribution of brake force between the wheels, and thus stabilises the bike during cornering.\nThe MSC also reduces the risk of ‘lowsiders’. These are accidents in which the motorcycle capsizes during cornering and the wheels slide out toward the outside of the bend. They occur when too much brake force is applied during cornering and the wheels are not able to transfer sufficient side force onto the road. MSC counteracts this by detecting the risk of a lowsider and limiting the maximum brake force. The eCBS function distributes this maximum available brake force between the wheels, ensuring the best possible brake performance under cornering conditions.\nThe eCBS function ensures optimum distribution of brake force at all times – even when the biker mistakenly uses only one of the two brakes, or brakes with too much force.\nThe wheelie-mitigation controls the engine torque, preventing the front wheel from lifting uncontrollably and at the same time ensuring maximum acceleration.\nThe rear-wheel lift-up mitigation function keeps the rear wheel on the road by reducing the maximum brake force on the front wheel when riding on surfaces with high friction coefficients. Riding stability is maintained, taking pitch rate and longitudinal acceleration into account.\n\nElectronic systems identify the limits of driving dynamics\nThe motorcycle stability control uses an extensive array of sensors to register the driving dynamics of the machine. Wheel sensors measure the rotational speed of the front and rear wheels, and an inertia sensor module computes the vehicle’s lean and pitch angles more than 100 times per second. By analysing the sensor data, the difference in speed between front and rear wheels, as well as other motorcycle-specific parameters such as tyre size, tyre shape, and sensor location, the ABS control unit calculates the physical limits of brake force on the basis of lean angle.\nIf the motorcycle stability control recognises that a wheel is starting to lock, the ABS control unit activates the pressure modulator in the hydraulic brake circuit. This lowers the brake pressure and builds it up again within a fraction of a second, with the result that exactly as much brake pressure is applied as is necessary to keep each wheel from locking.\nFor motorcyclists, the Bosch MSC can be a lifesaver. However, just like ABS, it cannot suspend the laws of physics. In particular, extreme misjudgement of the riding situation and major errors on the part of the biker can still lead to an accident. Nonetheless, the system supports bikers in borderline situations, helping them get more out of their motorcycles, while keeping them much safer at the same time.\nAdvertisements",
        "Moto Malaya \n\n2013 Honda CBR600RR Official Video \n\n\nPosted on August 17, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nSo two key factors drove development of the new CBR600RR: improved racetrack performance, combined with the ability to be ridden — and genuinely enjoyed — on a twisty road or city street by riders of all experience levels.\nFocus was placed upon the chassis, with the goal being creation of a bike that offered control and handling far beyond its class. The CBR600RR’s new inverted Showa 41mm Big Piston Forks deliver an incredibly smooth ride on the road, while offering great connection to the front tyre when on the limit at the racetrack. Lightweight, 12-spoke cast aluminium wheels — similar to those on the CBR1000RR Fireblade — are also used, for greater feedback.\nIts 599cc four-cylinder engine’s sophisticated PGM-DSFI fuel injection system — fed a large volume of air by the Direct Air Induction System — and its ECU have been re-mapped for improved throttle response and feel throughout the rev-range. The Intake Air Control Valve also now operates through all rpm ranges. These improvements make the bike easier to ride at ‘normal’ speed, with increased performance under sports or racetrack conditions.\nThe CBR600RR’s stunning and very clean new styling is a blend of Honda’s current RC213V MotoGP race bike, with aerodynamic lessons taken directly from the 2011 RC212V. Fittingly, for a motorcycle that shares DNA with one of the world’s ultimate race machines, a Repsol colour will now be available on the CBR600RR. Inspired by Honda’s 2012 MotoGP bike, this colourway is also available on the NSC50R, CBR250R and CBR1000RR for 2013.

        "BMW\nC evolution\nelectric \n\n2014 BMW C evolution Electric Maxi Scooter has arrived – top speed 120km/h, range 100km \n\n\nPosted on May 2, 2014May 2, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nDynamic riding fun with zero emissions.\nThe arrival of the new C evolution marks the start of a new chapter in the urban mobility segment for BMW Motorrad. The two conventionally powered maxi scooter models – the C 600 Sport and C 650 GT – already succeed in combining the superb ride qualities of a motorcycle with the specific agility of a scooter and the design’s inherent comfort. The new electrically powered C evolution now goes even further by fusing riding fun and dynamism with the benefits of zero-emission performance to create a whole new experience on two wheels.\nIn keeping with the BMW Group’s sustainability strategy, BMW Motorrad is taking a fully committed approach to electric mobility. As with BMW i, development of the C evolution revolved around creating a visionary vehicle concept offering maximum everyday practicality and an inspirational design.\nPowerful drive unit with liquid-cooled electric motor and air-cooled high-voltage battery. Range of 100 kilometres (62 miles) under practical conditions.\nThe C evolution is powered by a drivetrain swing arm with liquid-cooled permanent magnet synchronous motor via a toothed belt and ring gearing. The rated power output is 11 kW (15 hp), with a peak output of 35 kW (47 hp). This enables the C evolution to achieve a top speed of 120 km/h (75 mph, electronically limited) and gives it better acceleration than some maxi scooters powered by engines with displacements of 600 cc or more.\nThe generous 8 kWh capacity of the air-cooled lithium-ion high-voltage battery allows the two-wheeler to cover a range of up to 100 kilometres (62 miles) before it needs to be charged from any domestic mains supply. When plugged in to a standard 220V domestic socket with a 12A charge current, recharging fully from empty takes around 4 hours (with 220V / 16A = 3 h).  \n\nIntelligent recuperation and four ride modes ensure riding fun as well as efficiency.\nBMW Motorrad has opted for a form of energy regeneration for the C evolution that has never been seen before on a single-track vehicle. Recuperation takes place automatically both when coasting with the throttle closed and when braking.\nRiders of the C evolution can set their preferred mix of dynamic performance and efficiency by selecting from the four ride modes. In Road mode, for instance, they have at their disposal maximum acceleration, approximately 50 per cent energy regeneration when coasting and full regeneration when braking. In Eco Pro mode, meanwhile, acceleration and therefore energy consumption are restricted, while the maximum possible amount of energy is recuperated. Sail mode suppresses recuperation while coasting, allowing the C evolution to glide along virtually free of any braking effect when the throttle is released. And for an added touch of dynamism, Dynamic mode combines full accelerating power with a high degree of recuperation.\n \nSupreme safety thanks to synergies with BMW Automobile.\nAs part of the BMW Group, BMW Motorrad was able to harness synergies with BMW Automobile during development of the C evolution. Besides adopting the same energy storage modules and electronic componentry used in the BMW i3, this was particularly beneficial for electrical safety, which is to passenger car standard. The C evolution is the first electrically powered two-wheeler to meet the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety and the ECE R100 standard governing high-voltage safety, both of which have been ratified by the leading carmakers.\nAs far as the chassis is concerned, the C evolution no longer has a main frame in the conventional sense. The central component here is the battery casing made from diecast aluminium, which has a steering head support made from steel tubing attached to it at the front and, at the rear, the single-sided swing arm as well as a rear frame, also made from steel tubing. The task of wheel suspension and damping is performed by an upside-down telehydraulic fork at the front and a spring strut mounted on the left at the rear. As on all vehicles from BMW Motorrad, the C evolution comes equipped with safety-boosting ABS together with powerful disc brakes as standard.\n \nTorque Control Assist (TCA) for superior traction control.\nThe new C evolution is available with Torque Control Assist (TCA), which works in a similar way to the Automatic Stability Control feature on BMW motorcycles with combustion engines. TCA limits the motor’s torque depending on the slip at the rear wheel.\nTo ensure optimum controllability of the drive torque for the rider, the electric motor’s control electronics monitor the rear wheel speed and reduce the drive torque if a certain plausibility threshold is exceeded. TCA is a particularly useful aid for the rider when starting off and prevents uncontrolled spinning of the rear wheel on road surfaces with reduced grip (e.g. wet cobblestones).\nThe Torque Control Assist additionally serves to stop the rear wheel from skidding when a sharp rate of recuperation produces a correspondingly high level of drag torque, especially on slippery road surfaces.\n \nLarge TFT colour display and LED daytime running light.\nA host of other features further underline the innovative character of the C evolution. It is equipped with a reversing aid, for instance, that enables easy manoeuvring at walking pace. There is also a first in the form of an LED daytime running light, which additionally dims to double as the sidelight. And for added comfort on cold days, there are heated handlebar grips.\nA large TFT colour display in the instrument cluster offers a wealth of information. Apart from the current speed, the rider is also kept informed of data such as the average consumption in kWh/100 km, total power consumption, battery charge status in kWh, average speed, voltage of the on-board electrical system and the high-voltage system, as well as the remaining range in kilometres taking into account the selected ride mode. A bar graph furthermore indicates the current level of energy draw or regeneration.\n \nInspirational design.\nLast but not least, the C evolution also charts new territory in terms of styling and colour scheme. Design-wise, the C evolution fits harmoniously into the BMW Motorrad family, while the colour combination of Light White non-metallic and Electric Green symbolises its ability to blend maximum eco-friendliness with superb dynamic performance.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highlights at a glance:\n•      Innovative electric drive system via drivetrain swing arm with liquid-cooled permanent magnet synchronous motor, toothed belt and ring gearing.\n•      Rated power output 11 kW (homologated according to ECE R85) and 35 kW peak output.\n•      Maximum torque 72 Nm (53 lb-ft).\n•      Top speed 120 km/h (75 mph).\n•      Acceleration 0 – 50 km/h (31 mph) in 2.7 s.\n•      Acceleration 0 – 100 km/h (62 mph) in 6.2 s.\n•      High range of 100 kilometres (62 miles) in practical operation.\n•      4 ride modes available to choose from: Road, Eco Pro, Sail and Dynamic.\n•      Reversing aid for supremely easy manoeuvring.\n•      Torque Control Assist (TCA).\n•      High-voltage battery with high capacity of 8 kWh and innovative air cooling.\n•      Intelligent recuperation when coasting and when braking.\n•      Recharged from the domestic mains supply.\n•      Takes just 4 h to charge to 100 % capacity at 220V / 12A (220V / 16A = 3 h).\n•      Synergies with BMW Automobile harnessed during development.\n•      Electrical safety to passenger car standards.\n•      Hybrid chassis with agile handling due to low centre of gravity.\n•      Powerful braking system with ABS.\n•      Large TFT colour display.\n•      LED daytime running light and sidelight.\n•      Inspirational colour scheme and design.\nAdvertisements",

After the initial release, it is found that this bike is very light and very fast. This can be seen by the application of two-piston caliper for the rear and front brakes. I guess the drum brakes just won’t do the job well. What Yamaha did next for the second model is to limit the speed of the bike to 150km/h only.

Aggressive styling and naked looks make it desirable enough for riders in search for good middleweight street bike.\nDucati confirm their 2012 Streetfighter 848 with the first officially released images of the brand new model set to add everyday accessibility to the Italian manufacturer’s famous naked sport bike family.\nCombining a new and brilliantly engineered 848 Testastretta 11° engine with the enhanced geometry of a chassis that provides confidence-inspiring agility, the Streetfighter 848 has enriched its user-friendliness with a smooth and flexible power delivery, revised ergonomics and Ducati Traction Control.\nThe Ducati Streetfighter scored a round one knock-out when it entered the ring for the first time at the Milan show back in November 2008, winning the ‘Most Beautiful Bike’ award and raising the bar for extreme nakeds. Its asphalt-ripping reputation became the desire of sport naked connoisseurs throughout the world and the Streetfighter 848 will now widen that appeal even further with enhanced usability.\nAvailable from November 2011 onwards, the new fighter is dressed in red for Ducati traditionalists, while yellow makes a return for mid-range purists and “dark stealth” provides a matte-black reminder of the Streetfighter’s aggressive image.\n2 more pictures after the jump  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "helmet\nparts\nRiding Gear\nSHARK \n\n2014 Shark Vision-R Series 2 Full-face Touring Helmet – estimated RM1,500 \n\n\nPosted on March 27, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nNow available in UK SHARK dealers is the new Vision-R Series 2 helmet. Designed with touring riders in mind, the helmet sits in the brands Discovery division. Taking features from the original Vision-R, the Series 2 has received some upgrades to make it even better.\nThe helmet as the name suggests, still benefits from the largest panoramic vision field available on the market. The visor aperture is 25% larger from top to bottom and 10% wider horizontally, compared to that of a standard visor aperture. The extra 10% given to peripheral vision increases lifesaver visibility, which makes the helmet ideal for learners or those new to motorcycling.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Series 2 has an upgraded ventilation system with improved airflow and bigger vents and operating switches. Noise has also been reduced in the new version and its auto-seal system makes the visor adhere to the helmet, ensuring a better seal and insulation. The visor can also be opened and set into a de-mist position.\nFor glasses wearers it has SHARK’s Easy Fit system where glasses can sit comfortably into a recessed partition of the helmets lining, which is fully removable and washable. There’s also a handy pocket to fit a SHARKTooth Bluetooth system.\nThe Vision-R Series 2 is available in a variety of styles and colours, with an RRP of £219.99 for the Blank and Blank Matt versions. The RRP for the Syntic, Synctic Matt, Escapade, Inko, Diekel, Smoke and Smoke Matt is £249.99 (MYR1,500).\nAdvertisements",
        "motogp \n\nRound 9: German MotoGP™ – Race: Marquez completes dominant weekend with a sixth successive win at Sachsenring \n\n\nPosted on July 13, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team’s Marc Marquez signed off a dominant weekend at Sachsenring by winning today’s German Grand Prix ahead of teammate Dani Pedrosa, the two-time MotoGP™ World Champion extending his run of success at the German circuit to six successive victories.\n\nStarting on pole position, Marquez lost out to Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo at the start of the race and held second place for the first few laps, before passing Lorenzo on lap five and streaking away for his second win of the year. Underlining his scintillating pace at Sachsenring, Marquez set a new Circuit Lap Record of 1’21.530 on lap 10 and crossed the finish line in a race time of 41’01.087 – the shortest ever overall race time at Sachsenring, beating the old mark by over eleven seconds. On the other Repsol Honda Team RC213V, Pedrosa took a solid second place finishing 2.226 seconds behind Marquez, while Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi took the final podium place a further three seconds behind. Marquez and Pedrosa both selected the combination of the hard compound front slick and the medium compound rear tyre for the German Grand Prix, while Rossi used the asymmetric front slick in combination with the medium compound rear on his way to third place.\n\n\nA warm change today resulted in track temperatures reaching their highest level of the weekend. A peak track temperature of 44°C was recorded just before the start of the race and resulted in some riders altering their original race tyre choice. In a rare occurrence, three different front slick options featured in the race with the asymmetric, medium and hard front slicks all being utilised in the German Grand Prix. The asymmetric front slick was by far the most popular choice with nineteen of the twenty-five starters choosing this option, while four riders selected the medium front slick and just two riders – Marquez and Pedrosa – opting for the hard front slick. Rear tyre choice for the race saw a more even split across the field, with fourteen riders selecting the medium compound rear and the remaining eleven riders selecting the soft compound rear slick.\n\nThird place for Rossi means his championship lead over teammate Lorenzo, who sits in second place grows to thirteen points at the halfway point of the season. Meanwhile, Ducati Team’s Andrea Iannone’s fifth place finish in the German Grand Prix ensures he holds onto third place in the standings, 48 points behind Lorenzo.\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“The rise in track temperatures today resulted in some late changes on the grid in terms of front tyre choice but overall, all of our slick options performed very well during the race. We saw very few incidents in the race and the pace was extremely quick with a new Circuit Record Lap and overall race time record adding to the Circuit Best lap record we saw yesterday so I am really pleased with how our tyre allocation performed at this demanding track. Congratulations to Marc for yet another victory at Sachsenring and also to Repsol Honda on a commanding 1-2 result. It may be four weeks until the next MotoGP race at Indianapolis but it will be a very busy period for Bridgestone Motorsport as we support teams in a MotoGP test at Misano next week, while also aiming for our tenth consecutive victory as a tyre supplier at the Suzuka 8 Hours Endurance Road Race which takes place on July 26.”\n\nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda Team – Race Winner\n“With the medium front tyre I felt slightly better this weekend, but I decided to use the hard front tyre for the race to help me in the final laps, but from the beginning of the race I felt good on the bike. This weekend we made a really good job so I’m happy to get this win and it’s a good result before we go on holiday. However, we still have to work hard so that we are even stronger in the second half of the season.”\n\n\nBridgestone slick options: Front: Soft, Asymmetric Front, Medium & Hard; Rear: Soft, Medium & Hard (Asymmetric)\nBridgestone wet tyre options: Soft (Main), Hard (Alternative)\nWeather:   Dry.

The CTX delivers maneuverability and comfort brought by coupling a low center of gravity with less tiring low-vibration characteristics to realize an uninterrupted stress-free ride even as the distance adds up. Excellence in both stability and cornering offers users quiet and stable high-speed cruising. On top of this, the super-controllable engine characteristics found in the CTX series realize a smooth launch, speed changes and decelerating combined with smooth power response. Honda has thus achieved a level of comfort never experienced before through its pursuit of super-controllability accomplished by the best-fitting engine characteristics for every condition.  \nThe CTX styling inherits Honda’s own “horizontal motive design” from its flagship model, the GL1800 (GOLDWING) – a model enjoying high acclaim worldwide. From the overall styling all the way down to the very details including the seat and silencer, the horizontal motive design melds harmony with functional beauty.\nThe CTX series incorporating Honda’s technologies seeks to reduce susceptibility to variations in the riders’ experience and body size and offers a comfortable ride for any rider. These models also give users the opportunity to experience a stress-free ride in a wide variety of uses, from long-distance rides to street transport.\nEquipped with the liquid-cooled inline 2-cylinder 670cc engine designed for compactness and a low center of gravity, the CTX700N and CTX700 announced today are entering the market as the first CTX series.\n2013 Honda CTX700\nThese new models sprung from Honda’s “Comfort Technology Experience” concept, and were developed under the keywords of “easy, comfortable and exhilarating.” The models feature a compact, low-center-of-gravity engine full of torque and producing a delightful throbbing feel in the low- to mid-speed ranges together with a smooth high-quality controllability that remains true to the goals of superior fuel efficiency and easy handling, featuring the liquid-cooled, inline, 2-cylinder 670cc engine design.\nPutting the compact engine to its best use, the CTX700N and CTX700 support a wheelbase of 1,530mm. Nimbleness and high cornering performance are attained by a centralized mass achieved by the placement of heavy components near the vehicle’s center of gravity and by optimizing the front-rear weight distribution. Engine mount position and frame rigidity balance have also been optimized to reduce vehicle body vibration while lowering the weight and offering the reassurance of straightforward handling.\nFor the frame and suspension, Honda’s original horizontal motive styling comes configured with a newly designed rear sub-frame (seat rail), resulting in only 720mm of seat height to provide a vehicle standard with a sense of security. A framework that exploits the toughness of steel pipes realizes a high degree of responsiveness and flexibility against ever-changing road surfaces. In addition to enjoying excellent riding stability and turning performance, the rider can enjoy the high-quality riding taste featuring the right amount of pleasing vibrations. Bringing these features all together, the CTX700N and CTX700 have been perfected as models that are less susceptible to the riders’ experience and body size in order to offer a comfortable ride for all riders.\nThe riding position is set with a high degree of freedom in mind so that the greatest number of customers can enjoy riding in suitable positions accommodating the wider variety of physiques found around the world. Comfort is at hand in a diversity of situations including rides that start in a congested urban area or travel along a highway or outside the city. The seat also delivers a ride with a sense of security through optimized hardness and shape, while securing a low seat height of 720mm with good ground reach facilitated by the seat shape. Passenger movement is in no way hindered over the delightfully enjoyable, long comfortable rides. At the same time, a step position that allows the passenger to extend their feet forward brings even more improvement to the riding position’s degree of freedom.\nFor styling, Honda’s unique and stout horizontal motive design was selected in Honda’s quest to give the rider a sense of freedom through the up-close feel embodying the world view of the GOLDWING (GL1800), known for nimble transport on the street and a stress-free ride. The models are nimbly configured with a low center of gravity using a shape that honors the horizontal motive design. The forward glare of the front face and the “front-massive form” convey an impression from the front of a mass so dense that no concept like this has existed before.\nTo enable the widest possible variety of customers to ride with a sense of security, model types incorporating more lightweight, compact and highly useful DCT (dual clutch transmission) will be available for both the CTX700N and CTX700. Also adopting ABS (anti-lock brake system) as standard equipment, these model types with DCT will offer the user an “easy, comfortable and exhilarating” ride so that a broad spectrum of customers can experience riding comfort in a simple and easy way.\nThe CTX700N and CTX700 make use of a diversity of comfort technologies thought up by Honda. We are bringing these models to market to give a wider variety of customers than before the opportunity to experience the appeal of stress free, exceedingly comfortable motorcycle.

        "car\nFT86\ntoyota\nYamaha \n\nYamaha to Tune the Upcoming Toyota FT86 II / Scion FR-S \n\n\nPosted on July 19, 2011July 19, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nScion FR-S\nThe most awaited Toyota FT86 II / Scion FR-S which is the successor of the popular car used by Takumi in Initial-D comic that is the Toyota AE86 or also known as Hachiroku (which means 86), is going to be tuned by motorcyle maker, Yamaha to get ‘inspiring’ sound for its engine. Previously, Yamaha have also tune Lotus cars. Specifically, the Exige.  \nScreenshot from Autoblog\nThis gives me a new perspective to Yamaha company. They are trusted by Toyota and Lotus for engine tuning, so, it is one of the reason why I believe Yamaha bike engine are one of the superior engine in bike world. Yamaha are very hard at work to produce new engines. For example, for 115cc engine, Yamaha have 3 different engine. One is for the Yamaha Ego 115, Yamaha Nouvo S 115 and one more for the Lagenda 115Z. For 135cc, Yamaha have 2 different engine. One for Nouvo 135LC (2-valve) and one for the 135LC (4-valve). If this were from other manufacturer, I think they will use the same engine for all the model that have the same engine capacity. But not Yamaha. They just make new engine because they can.\nSource: Autoblog\nAdvertisements",
        "motogp \n\nRound 16 – Australian MotoGP: Rossi wins at Phillip Island to lead Yamaha clean sweep – 1st Rossi, 2nd Lorenzo and 3rd Smith \n\n\nPosted on October 19, 2014October 23, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi won his first race at Phillip Island in ten years as the Italian rider led a Yamaha clean sweep of the top three podium positions at the Australian Grand Prix.\nRossi started from eighth on the grid but was able to make up positions in the opening laps of the race and by the third lap was in third position. Rossi then got involved in an entertaining battle with teammate Jorge Lorenzo and after trading places a few times with his teammate, eventually seized second place from Lorenzo with ten laps remaining. Rossi then found himself in the lead of the race after Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez came unstuck at turn 10 on lap eighteen and the Italian rider went on to cross the finish line 10.836 seconds ahead of his Movistar Yamaha MotoGP stablemate Lorenzo. Finishing in third place for his first premier-class podium was Monster Yamaha Tech 3’s Bradley Smith a further 1.5 seconds behind Lorenzo.  \nA cool change in the afternoon dramatically lowered ambient temperatures for the race, creating challenging conditions for the riders. The track temperature peaked at 34°C at the start of the twenty-seven lap race and then with a strong wind blowing off the sea, continued to cool further as the race progressed. The cool change resulted in some riders that originally opted for the soft compound front slick options electing to change to the extra-soft front slick, although rear race tyre choice wasn’t that different to what the riders used in race simulations yesterday. Of the twenty-three riders twelve selected the extra-soft compound front slick for the race, nine chose the soft compound asymmetric front slick, while just two riders selected the soft compound symmetric front slick. For the rear tyre, fifteen riders selected the medium compound rear slick and the other eight riders selected the soft compound rear.\n2014 World Champion Marc Marquez’s first DNF of the season at Phillip Island sees him remain on 312 championship points while behind him, Rossi now moves into second place in the standings on 255 points. In third place is Lorenzo on 247 points with just two rounds remaining.\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“Well done to Valentino on taking the top step of the podium at Phillip Island and continuing Yamaha’s excellent run of success to four consecutive victories. The fight for second place in the championship took an exciting turn this weekend but there is no time to catch our breath as the last leg of the triple-header takes place next weekend at Sepang. The new rear slick tyres that we developed for Phillip Island proved to work well for all the riders and we were able to complete a full race distance with good durability and performance. I would like to thank the teams and riders for their efforts to adapt to our new tyres this weekend.”\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“After fine conditions in this morning’s Warm Up session, a cool change in the afternoon saw ambient and track temperatures fall quickly just before the start of the race. The cooler weather did result in more riders choosing the extra-soft front slick than if conditions had remained the same as this morning, but overall the tyre combinations utilised during the race were similar to what we saw yesterday in FP4. I am pleased with our rear tyre performance this weekend as the consistent performance and durability matched our expectations and all riders from all the manufacturers were able to adapt to using this tyre. The cool ambient temperatures and strong wind combined to create tricky conditions which resulted in a few riders crashing in the final stages of the race. We will now analyse the data we collected to determine if any changes need to be implemented next year at Phillip Island.”\nValentino Rossi, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP – Race Winner\n“It’s fantastic to win today because it was a great race. Unfortunately I had to start from far back on the grid but I knew I had quite a good pace. After the second corner I saw that Marc and Jorge were already in front and I thought it would be hard to catch them, but I was able to overtake many riders and catch Jorge. It was difficult to pass him at first, but in the end it was a great battle and I was a little bit faster and could pass him. Marc wasn’t too far ahead of me so I tried to stay focused on staying in second place, but after Marc crashed it meant I could win the race so it was great to be back on top of the podium at Phillip Island after my last victory here ten years ago.”\nAustralian MotoGP™ Top 10 Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n40’46.405\n\n\n\nExtra-soft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n40’57.241\n\n\n10.836\n\n\nExtra-soft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n40’58.699\n\n\n12.294\n\n\nExtra-soft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n41’01.298\n\n\n14.893\n\n\nSoft (Asym)\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nHector BARBERA\n\n\nAvintia Racing\n\n\n41’16.494\n\n\n30.089\n\n\nSoft (Asym)\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n41’16.559\n\n\n30.154\n\n\nSoft (Asym)\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nScott REDDING\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n41’16.563\n\n\n30.158\n\n\nExtra-soft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nHiroshi AOYAMA\n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar\n\n\n41’19.571\n\n\n33.166\n\n\nExtra-soft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nAlex DE ANGELIS\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n41’19.982\n\n\n33.577\n\n\nExtra-soft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nNicky HAYDEN\n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar\n\n\n41’20.549\n\n\n34.144\n\n\nSoft (Asym)\n\nMedium\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

The Crypton 110 basically is the same bike with the Yamaha Lagenda 110 that we have in Malaysia before it is being replaced with the Lagenda 115Z/ZR. The differences that we can see is the use of sportier front fairing and different headlight.  \n\nOn the rear, we can see the use of the separated signal lamp from the brake light as this one in Europe need to follow the regulation to have separated signal lamp. On closer inspection, I can see that the rear brake light is almost the same with the Modenas Ace 115 brake light design.\n\nThe bike itself in Malaysia has been great seller and compete head to head with Honda 110cc bikes like the Honda Wave 110. It got that comparable fuel efficiency and a good design too.\n\nThe front design looks sportier and this can be a good selling point for the Crypton in Argentina, Greece and some other Europe countries. Based on my experience with the Lagenda 110 in Malaysia, the handling of the bike is respectable and very sharp for a bike this small.

But the real highlight was in the last lap when I was fighting with Sena Yamada and Bo for second place. That would be a battle that I will remember,” said an elated Khairul.\nHe added, “Thank you to Honda Team Asia for preparing a great bike, my family who always believed in me and also my friends and supporters back home in Malaysia.”\n \nMoto3 Race Results\n1.Aron Canet (SPA) 21’05.594s\n2.Khairul Idham Pawi (MAS) 21’06.201s\n3.Bo Bendsyneyder (NED) 21’06.365s\n4.Sena Yamada (JPN) 21’07.057s\n5.Lorenzo Dalla Porta (ITA) 21’07.142s\nKHAIRUL IDHAM CEMERLANG RAIH PODIUM DI LE MANS\nKhairul Idham Pawi mencatat kejayaan manis buat Malaysia setelah berjaya meraih podium pada saingan Kejuaran Moto3 Junior Dunia di Le Mans, Perancis, semalam.\nBermula dari petak ke-10, pelumba Honda Team Asia berusia 16 tahun itu memperaga aksi cukup bertenaga apabila menamatkan 12 pusingan perlumbaan sebagai naib juara dengan masa 21’06.201s, ketinggalan kepada juara Aron Canet dari Sepanyol yang menamatkan perlumbaan dengan masa 21’20.520s.\nTempat ketiga dimenangi Bo Bendsyneyder dari Belanda dengan masa 21’06.365s.\nPerlumbaan yang sepatutnya berlangsung sebanyak 17 pusingan dipendekkan kepada 12 pusingan apabila perlumbaan asal diberhentikan setelah bendera merah dikibarkan akibat insiden kemalangan melibatkan pelumba Itali, Arbolino.\nKemenangan di Perancis meletakkan Khairul sebagai pelumba Malaysia kedua yang berjaya menamatkan perlumbaan di atas podium di Kejuaraan CEV Repsol FIM selain Hafizh Syahrin Abdullah yang kini  beraksi di pentas Moto2 Kejuaraan Grand Prix Dunia.\n“Saya sangat gembira dengan kemenangan ini terutama setelah sekadar bermula dari barisan ketiga.

        "Michelin\nparts\nPilot Power 3 \n\nMichelin Pilot Power 3 launched in Superbike Performance Day at Sepang – 85% road, 15% for track use – RM612-RM852 \n\n\nPosted on October 20, 2013October 23, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nMichelin today has launched an addition to their tyre lineup, the Pilot Power 3. It retains the 2 compound technology as the Pilot Power 2CT, but upgraded with better configuration named 2CT+ (2 Compound Technology Plus) which features a hard compound base layered with soft compound on the shoulder of the tyre. Hard compound on the centre of the tyre enables it to handle the massive power of acceleration and at the same time good for braking grip. The soft compound as featured on the shoulder enable the rider to great a good grip while taking a lower lean angle and this will provide a great confidence to the rider of the tyre so the can ride faster.\n\nOne of the rider said that this Pilot Power 3 is a good alternative. It gives a good confidence and the handling was nice. Anyway, the ride at the track was too short to even heat up the tyre to its maximum performance. As said in the title, this tyre is targeted for daily commuters that use their superbike 85% on the road, but occasionally getting wild on the track maybe in the weekends at 15% of the time. So, this Pilot Power 3 can be a great choice. It is even better since Pilot Power 3 have excellent wet braking distance (shortest distance) according to the test by DEKRA, which is a third-party company.  \nRiders can feel confident taking the tyre to work in the morning on dry road, and still can go home safely even if it is raining on the evening which makes the road wet and slippery. And if the rider wants to get to track, they also can do it. A good balanced tyre for the occassion, but as the old saying, ” good things is not cheap and cheap things is not good”. Michelin Pilot Power 3 is a targeted for the premium market which is more costly, but it will give a better value for money in the long run since it have longer durability as compared to Pilot Power 2CT at 20% more mileage. If you usually use up the tyre at 1,000km, this Pilot Power 3 should give 200km more for your riding enjoyment.\n\nOne of the interesting bike seen at the Michelin Pilot Power 3 launch is this Honda CBR600RR that features carbon fibre wheel by Rotobox. That doesn’t comes cheap. The rider also wears the AGV Pista GP Project 46 which is also made from carbon fibre and also very expensive. The Superbike Performance Day at Sepang was really a great day to be. There are many interesting bikes there likes the BMW HP2, Ducati 916, Suzuki GSX-R600 and many more.Michelin also provides tyre change there along with an expert from Ohlins to help the riders to tune their bike to its full potential. This is a great effort from Verati Sdn Bhd and Michelin to provide first hand experience in bikes professional tuning. The star of the show is the Michelin Pilot Power 3 that should cater the need of the rider in Malaysia. It is also good to know that the event is the first event planned for Asia, and Malaysia has been lucky enough to be choosen as the first stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelin Pilot Power 3 is made in Spain and should be available by next year.

The KTM 1290 Super Duke has been an interesting bike to get to know to. It comes with a mighty engine with lots of torque, hence the nickname The Beast.

There are many sizes available that is 39, 38 and 37.  Using smaller size rear sprocket will increase the top speed, but at the same time decrease the pick-up of your Duke 200. For your information, the stock sprocket size for KTM Duke 200 is 14T front and 42T rear.  \n\n \nChanging the sprocket is the easiest way to increase the top speed of your bike without modifying your engine. This modification will change the characteristic of the Duke 200 but will you can adapt to it after few minutes riding it.\n\nI think the change to smaller size for the rear is something that the Duke 200 should do since there is so much power from the lightweight bike of 129kg that churns out 25hp. 15-37T might be a good size to test. Anyone dare to do it?\n\n \nThere is also this steel KTM sprocket for better reliability with the size of 37T for that higher top end. But there are some people says that the is an electronic speed cut off that limits the top speed to only 140km/h. Is this true?\nYou can buy the parts via: https://www.facebook.com/pages/SING-MOTORCYCLE-ACCESSORIES/247228276350\n \nAdvertisements",

        "400cc\nSR400\nYamaha \n\n2014 Yamaha SR400 – 35 years of heritage \n\n\nPosted on November 16, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nAnyone who was old enough to ride a motorcycle in the 1970s will remember the fanfare that greeted the launch of the original Yamaha SR models. Inspired by the dual purpose XT500 which was launched a few years earlier, the single cylinder SR400 and SR500 were announced in 1978, and went on to become some of Yamaha’s most popular and enduring models.\nWith their relaxed torque output, slim and agile chassis design and classic styling, the Japanese-market SR400 and European-market SR500 became firm favourites with enthusiasts who were looking for a simple machine that captured the very spirit of sports motorcycling. In many European countries including Germany, Austria and Belgium, groups of SR500 owners formed enthusiasts’ clubs, many of which still run to this day. To underline its appeal, the SR500 went on to win consecutive ‘Moto of the Year’ awards from Germany’s Motorrad magazine – one of the highest circulation motorcycle titles in Europe. During the same period the bike was establishing a cult following in Europe and Japan, with many SR models being handed down from father to son.  \nEnduring appeal since 1978\nMeanwhile, in Japan, legislation relating to the motorcycle licensing system in the mid 1970s had created demand for 400cc models, and so the SR400 became a top seller in its home market. Virtually identical to the SR500 but running with a shorter stroke to achieve a capacity of 400cc, the SR400 has continued to attract massive interest in Japan over the last 35 years, with thousands of owners and enthusiasts turning up to SR rallies throughout the country.\nWhat is also interesting is that more than half of the owners of the SR400 in Japan are younger than the bike they ride! Users born after 1978 now make up the majority of owners in Japan, which demonstrates clearly that this timeless motorcycle has an enduring appeal with the newer generation of riders.\nThe return of a legend\nFor 2014 the return of the SR will spearhead Yamaha’s growing Sport Heritage line up, which offers today’s riders the opportunity to experience the joy and pleasure associated with simpler and more traditional designs.\nYamaha’s classic big single has a genuine heritage and pureness of design that sets it apart from some other ‘retro’ models. There can be no doubt that the SR400 is the real thing, and with an authentic engine and chassis specification and original kick start mechanism, this charismatic twin-shock thumper is aimed at the many riders who are looking to rediscover the very soul of motorcycling.\nFor many riders, the character, soul and image of a machine is far more important than its 0-100km/h acceleration figures or potential lean angle. Having been brought up with the ready availability of high performance motorcycles all around them, an increasing number of today’s riders have decided that what matters to them are the fundamental qualities such as simplicity, ease of use and timeless design. With its relaxed torque, light and agile chassis and sheer mechanical beauty, the SR400 is designed to appeal to those riders who are looking for a motorcycle with a real heritage and character, and one which fully engages its owner.\nIn addition to its appealing character and easy performance, the SR400 also offers many possibilities for those riders who want to customize their machine, whether that involves adding a few bolt-on parts or going the whole way and creating a café racer, street scrambler or bobber.\nBy offering a return to the fundamental values of biking, and instilling a new pride of ownership with the rider, the SR400 is ready to make friends with a whole new generation of owners that were born after the bike made its original debut some 35 years ago.\nIdeal for customization\nThe interest in customization is growing, and many of today’s riders are looking to create their own unique motorcycle by using special parts. With its twin shock chassis and single cylinder air-cooled engine, the SR400 is the ideal starting point for any customization project.\nWith its simple design, this timeless motorcycle can be transformed into a café racer, bobber or street scrambler, allowing the owner to create his or her own unique special.\nENGINE\nAir-cooled 4-stroke single-cylinder engine\nWith its pulsing power delivery, throbbing exhaust note, strong physical presence and mechanical simplicity, the big single holds a special place in the hearts of motorcyclists all over the world.\nAt the very soul of the SR400 is an air-cooled 4-stroke single cylinder SOHC 2-valve engine which is technically almost identical to the original design, with a few exceptions.\nThe SR400 runs with a bore x stroke of 87mm x 62.7mm and a compression ratio of 8.5:1, and this well proven formula gives an excellent torque output that allows the SR400 rider to accelerate strongly from low revs without having to downshift. Also contributing to the SR’s healthy torque output is a large-capacity air cleaner, as well as a big 47mm intake valve and optimized flywheel mass, which work together to give the SR400 an effortless and relaxed running character.\nFuel injection for easy starting and good economy\nThe major difference between the original engine and the reborn powerplant is the use of a new fuel injection system, which allows the bike to conform with current emissions regulations, and also makes the SR400 easier to start than the original model.\nThis compact and simple new fuel injection unit delivers smooth engine running in a variety of riding conditions, and it occupies the same space as the original carburettor to maintain the original looks of the engine. Another advantage of this new fuel injection system is that it ensures excellent fuel economy, allowing the rider to achieve optimum range from the 12-litre fuel tank.\nEasy kickstarting\nOur engineers wanted to ensure that the 2014 model is true to its original character, and so the only way to start the new SR400 is to kick it! Riders who may have owned an original SR400 or SR500 will remember that kickstarting the older models required something of a special technique which could take some time to master.\nHowever, the good news for the new generation of SR400 owners – and also for older riders who may be returning to this Yamaha big single – is that the new fuel injection system ensures much easier starting. The bike now runs with a newly designed transistor ignition system that generates a better spark which also helps when starting the bike up. An indicator on the right side of the cylinder head shows when the piston is in the best position for starting, and a decompressor lever on the left side of the handlebars supports the rider in starting the engine smoothly.\nBeautifully finished air-cooled engine\nAs well as its relaxed and easy torque delivery, another everlasting attraction of this engine is its sheer mechanical beauty. With its large air-cooling fins, shiny crankcases and gracefully curving exhaust pipe, this big single is a classic design in every sense of the word. In an era when many engines are hidden behind fairings, the sight of the SR400’s big air-cooled engine is a joy to behold.\nTo prevent discolouration of the big-bore exhaust pipe its exterior surface has been treated with a special nano-film coating, while the polished engine cases feature a clear-coated buff finish to maintain the gleaming looks of this classic powerplant.\n3-way catalyser with oxygen sensor\nHidden inside the SR400’s chrome plated muffler is a 3-way honeycomb-type catalyser coated with platinum and other precious metals, and this system – together with the new fuel injection system – allows the air-cooled single cylinder engine to exceed current EU emissions regulations.\nEngine Technical Highlights\n\n400cc air-cooled 4-stroke single cylinder engine\nSimple and effective SOHC 2-valve design\nBore x stroke 87mm x 62.7mm\n8.5:1 compression ratio\nRelaxed torque for easy riding\nCompact and simple fuel injection system\nExcellent economy with proven reliability\nKick to start system\nDecompressor and piston position indicator for easy kick starts\nDry sump lubrication with oil carried in the frame\nLarge-capacity air cleaner\nEasy-action clutch lever\nTransistor ignition\nChrome-plated exhaust system with 3-way catalyser\n\nCHASSIS\nTubular high tensile steel semi-double cradle frame\nStaying absolutely true to the original layout, the 2014 SR400 is equipped with a compact and slimline semi-double cradle frame which perfectly complements the character of the single-cylinder engine. This proven design is manufactured from tubular high tensile steel that offers the optimum balance of strength, rigidity and weight, giving an agile feel and easy handling character.\nOil in frame\nThe SR400’s frame has been designed to carry the engine oil which runs through the main downtube and into the engine, and this oil-in-frame design offers a number of advantages over a wet sump system. Pumping losses within the engine are reduced, and because there is no need for an oil sump beneath the engine, the SR400’s ground clearance is higher. This design also allows for a slimmer body, which gives plenty of potential options for riders who want to build their own custom bike.\nPlush front and rear suspension systems\nThe SR400 is equipped with traditional upright front forks that give 150mm of wheel travel for a smooth ride and easy steering. At the rear end this classic big single is fitted with a proven twin shock system that offers 100mm of suspension movement. Together with the well-padded dual seat, the smooth action suspension ensures a relaxing ride, making the SR400 one of the most comfortable ways to get about in the city or countryside.\nClassic 12-litre teardrop fuel tank\nThroughout its long history, the SR400’s fuel tank design has remained largely unchanged, with the only real ‘update’ over the years being different paint and graphics. The SR400 is equipped with the same familiar teardrop style fuel tank which is virtually identical to the original design, with the exception that the 2014 tank offers a capacity of 12 litres.\nThe focal point of the graceful teardrop tank is Yamaha’s classic tuning fork logo, and the plain colour scheme is highlighted by a simple ribbon-type band that runs around the tank’s sides.\nFront disc brake and rear drum\nThe SR comes with a drilled front disc which is slowed by a modern 2-pot caliper. Braking at the rear end is provided by a sealed drum brake, and this proven front disc/rear drum combination delivers smooth braking performance with plenty of feel.\nBalance-type centre stand\nIt is anticipated that the SR400 will attract many owners who will want to carry out a variety of maintenance jobs themselves, such as routine inspections, customization projects and tyre changes. In order to facilitate this work in the garage at home, the SR400 is fitted with a balance-type centre stand which makes maintenance easier and more convenient.\nLightweight aluminium rims with 18-inch front and rear tyres\nThe latest reincarnation of the SR400 is equipped with 18-inch spoked front and rear wheels that perfectly match the character of this traditional big single. These stylish wheels are equipped with lightweight aluminium rims which ensure low unsprung weight for smooth suspension characteristics.\nChassis Technical Highlights\n\nLight, slim and agile chassis\nClassic style with timeless good looks\nPotential to customize into café racer, bobber or street scrambler\nTubular high tensile steel semi-double cradle frame\nSpace-saving oil-in-frame design\nTelescopic front forks and twin rear shocks\n12-litre fuel tank with classic Yamaha tuning fork logo\nSpoked wheels with lightweight aluminium rims\n18-inch front and rear tyres\nFront disc brake and rear drum brake\nBalance-type centre stand\nChrome plated mudguards, headlight rim and grab bar\n\nAdvertisements",

Boasting 139MPG* and a 5.2 litre fuel tank, the Address 110 is set to become the commuting scooter of choice.\nPractical touches include under-seat storage in excess of 20 litres that will comfortably take a full face helmet and riding gear, and rear handbrake for use when parked. The Address benefits from a new fuel injection system and reduced overall weight, which comes from sporty, redesigned bodywork and cast aluminium hollow-core wheels.\n2015 Suzuki V-Strom 650XT ABS\nV-Strom 650XT ABS\nBased on the already popular V-Strom 650, which has been the top selling dual-purpose machine in the 650-800cc class in the last decade, the V-Strom 650XT comes with more adventure as standard.\nThe new V-Strom 650XT takes design cues from the DR Big, the first dual-purpose machine to feature the now standard ‘beak’ design synonymous with models in the adventure sector. A new beak blends smoothly into the existing front bodywork, with air ducts that channel airflow to the radiator.\nNewly designed, lightweight, wire-spoked aluminium wheels aid in the adventure-styling of the new V-Strom 650XT, and shock absorption performance is increased on unpaved roads. Its arrival is anticipated as early as December this year.\n2015 Suzuki Bandit 1250S ABS\nBandit 1250S ABS\nBandit is back for 2015, with the iconic machine on sale in the UK early next year. With the original Bandit models developing a cult following, the latest incarnation uses the newest version of Suzuki’s 1255cc inline four-cylinder engine and gets a styling update to bring it into 2015.\nAfter repeated wind tunnel testing, the redesigned fairings, with new radiator shrouds, offer improved aerodynamics, with venting just below the headlights, as well as better wind and weather protection for both rider and pillion.\n2015 Suzuki Inazuma 250F\nInazuma 250F\nThe A2-licence friendly and ideal commuter, comes clad with a newly designed fairing for 2015, with the Inazuma 250F unveiled at Intermot.\nAdding extra wind protection to the popular city-wise machine, which boasts an impressive 85MPG figure, cost conscious commuters can now travel even further in comfort.

        "150cc\nFSR Technology\nTuneBoss \n\nFSR Technology TuneBoss for 2013 Yamaha FZ150i – advanced standalone wireless ECU from Malaysia – RM430 \n\n\nPosted on January 16, 2015January 17, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nTuneBoss is an advanced standalone Engine Control Unit (ECU) designed by FSR Technology Sdn Bhd. As most already know, the ECU is the brain of the bike. It controls all critical parameters such as the ignition timing, air-to-fuel mixture (AFR) ratio based on inputs and sensors such as the Throttle Position Sensor and Manifold Sensor.\n\nFSR Technology was founded in 2011 by 2 computer engineers, Farhan and Suffian. The R stands for Research or Racing. These homegrown electronics wizards from Malaysia designed the entire ECU from scratch, from the hardware, the firmware right up to the software. The capabilities of this TuneBoss ECU are going to make tuners and performance enthusiasts very happy.\n\n\nMost tunable aftermarket ECUs, require a computer connection to be tuned. This usually involves cables (like OBD from cars). FSR Technology is taking things to the next level by having Bluetooth wireless connectivity standard on all their TuneBoss ECUs. This means you can tune it whenever you like by connecting it to your smartphone via Bluetooth without ever dealing with messy cables.\nA lot of information can be displayed on your Android smartphone via the TuneBoss app. You can see the speed, the RPM, battery voltage, engine temp (manifold sensor), throttle position sensor (TPS), ignition timing, errors (signal light not functioning, radiator fan not working, etc). Simply said, whatever you ECU can read and sense from the sensor, you can have it displayed on your smartphone. Fuel and spark adjustment is also possible right from your phone.\n\n\nWhat about cut-off? Can we remove it? This question always comes up and the answer is, YES!\nTuneBoss comes with a 10% increase in rev limit compared to the stock ECU. This means that if the stock ECU is limited to 10,000RPM, TuneBoss will increase this limit to 11,000RPM out of the box.\nBut we want more! Future upgrade modules will enable the TuneBoss to rev up to 13,000+RPM, which is suitable for extreme mods and for closed circuit racing. You need to pay a fee to enable the TuneBoss to rev it to this point and as said by Farhan, he wants you to know what the risk you are taking if you try to make its rev higher. Of course, a higher RPM limit can make the engine less reliable. You just need to find the sweet spot of engine power and a suitable RPM limit. There is also a quickshifter upgrade module which will be released in February 2015.\n2013  and earlier Yamaha FZ150i comes with stock output at 14.88hp. Based on my interview at their booth at International Motorcycle Fest at Shah Alam Stadium, their fully modded bike was measured on dyno at 21hp. The number is quite a feat from a bike with 150cc 4-stroke engine. Their latest numbers are now at 25+hp. That is a 70% increase over the stock bike!\nThe first TuneBoss model supports the 2013 and earlier Yamaha FZ150i. They are now focusing their attention on the 2014+ Yamaha FZ150i and Lagenda 115z FI, so the 2013 Yamaha FZ150i TuneBoss ECU are now in limited stocks.\nThe price for the TuneBoss ECU is at RM430 and that is cheap if you compare its competitors. A tuneable ECU from Taiwan is priced at RM700 and that doesn’t include yet the wireless module. For a wireless module, it can fetch up to RM1,000.\nThere is only a single, full-featured TuneBoss model for each bike model. This makes it easy for bike owners as they just need to buy one and get all the features.\nGreat job FSR Technology!\n[TuneBoss App can be downloaded here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fsrtech.tuneboss.manager ]\nMore info at http://facebook.com/fsrtech\n\n \nAdvertisements",
        "250cc\nshell\nShell Advance Asia Talent Cup \n\nAsia Talent Cup: Indonesian Andi wins for first time \n\n\nPosted on March 30, 2015March 30, 2015 by kesh \n\n\n\nIt was a day of celebration for Indonesian rider and his fan when rider Andi Izdihar took his first ever victory at the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup.\nAndi beat Japanese rider Sasaki and Thai rider Chantra to take 1st place, but it did not come easy for the 17 year old Indonesian. It was a tough dice between the top two with both swapping places continuously throughout the 14 lap race. Ultimately the top two were separated by just 0.029 seconds at the finish line.\nRace 2 of the second round in Losail Circuit in Qatar however was essentially a carbon copy of the first one, which took place on Saturday.\n\n20 riders stars on track (2 riders Australian Taylor and Philippino rider Paz withdrew from the race), but a leading group of 11 riders quickly formed.\nSaturday’s race winner Kunimine stayed at the middle of the pack, while the pace of the race was slightly faster than Saturday with winds staying calm at about 11km/h.\nInterestingly, the 11 leading riders were separated by just 1.5 seconds, and this made for some fabulous and often hairy race moments as all the riders aimed for the racing line at the same time. This however led to Thai rider Atiratphuvapat and Kunimine touching slightly, with the latter unfortunately crashing out.\n\nAfter the race, Race Direction reviewed the incident between Atiratphuvapat and Kunimine, and decided to give the Thai rider a one-minute penalty, which relegated him down to 18th, and promoted Chantra onto the podium in 3rd place.\nWith the leading ten riders split by just a second as they started the final lap, the action became even more frenetic as riders tried to get themselves into the best position to allow them to take advantage of the slipstreams on offer on the long straight, in the race to the line. Atiratphuvapat was the first out of the last corner, but it was Izdihar, who managed to gain the biggest advantage from the leaders breaking the air in front of him, taking the race win by just 0.029s from Sasaki in 2nd.\nThe Malaysian riders too had a good race, with four of them making it into the top 10. Adam Norrodin made it up to second place, and only lost it on the last corner, on the last lap. He eventually finished in 6th place, while Helmi Azman took 5th. Fakhrusy Rostam took 9th and Shafiq Rasol took 10th. New comer Azroy Anuar finished in 13th.\nDirector of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup, Alberto Puig: “In this second race we have seen a good fight just like yesterday, especially on the last lap, where we saw the riders set the fastest lap. Here we have finished a run of four races in two weekends, and the conclusion is very positive, since both Sepang and Chang and have seen riders set a very good pace. We now have a break of three months; it’s time to train and for riders to continue their preparation at home. “\nAyumu Sasaki has ended up on the podium in each of the four races so far (three 2nd’s & one 3rd) and he leads the standings in the 2015 Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup with a total of 76 points, ahead of Chantra and Masaki by 15 & 24 points respectively.\nThe Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup returns in Sepang between 31 July – 2 August, and will form part of the WorldSBK round taking place that weekend.\n\nAdvertisements",

A car that uncompromisingly furthers the development of the lightweight sports car in its very essence. A 270 km/h driving machine based on the XL1, the most efficient car of all time. Efficiency and emotion compellingly recombined. At the rear of the XL Sport sits one of the finest achievements in engine technology – the V2 adapted from the new Ducati 1199 Superleggera, the world’s most powerful two-cylinder motorcycle. \nLike the XL1, of which only 250 units will be built, the Superleggera is also being manufactured in a limited edition (500 units), in a process that embraces hand fabrication and high-precision industrial manufacturing technologies alike. The XL1 and the Superleggera, two icons of lightweight carbon and magnesium design technology, thus unite to create a unique sports car. With the XL Sport, the group brands Volkswagen and Ducati impressively demonstrate how high-tech developments can lead to synergies between brands and be used by both parties as modules for new concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTen key facts about the world premiere of the XL Sport:\n\nThe XL Sport was developed on the basis of the XL1.\nThe vehicle is propelled by the world’s most powerful two-cylinder engine.\nThe Ducati V2 engine generates 147 kW / 200 PS.\nAerodynamics of the XL Sport are better than those of any other sports car.\nXL Sport’s 200 PS sufficient to achieve 270 km/h.

The bike carries the familiar livery in red, orange and black combination which always looks great and fast.\nCasey Stoner now ride with the number ‘1’ race plate since he is the 2011 MotoGP Champion. Dani Pedrosa rides with the ’26’ number race plate. I’m hoping there will be a very competitive battle for this 2012 MotoGP season.\nThe official press release at MotoGP.com is after the jump  \n\nAfter the winter break, team riders Casey Stoner and Dani Pedrosa returned to the media spotlight refreshed and eager to start the new season. Alongside them were HRC team bosses, Shuhei Nakamoto (HRC Executive Vice President), Hideki Iwano (Director, Assistant to Team Principal), Shinichi Kokubu (Technical Director) and Livio Suppo (Communications and Marketing Director). This was also the first opportunity for the media to see the new RC213V bike complete with 2011 World Champion, Casey Stoner’s number ‘1’ emblazoned on the front.\nThe team arrived in Malaysia on Saturday and returned to the Sepang track on Sunday for the first time since Marco Simoncelli’s tragic accident in the race on 23rd October. As a mark of respect, the whole team visited the corner where Marco lost his life, laid a wreath of flowers and held a minutes silence.\nThis season the MotoGP world returns to 1000cc bikes and HRC head into the 2012 season determined to retain the World Championship.\nCasey Stoner:\n“The off season has been really good, we got to go back home and spend some time with family and friends in Australia over Christmas which was great. Then we came back to Switzerland to get everything in order for the baby’s arrival, Adriana’s due in just a few weeks and so we’ve been preparing, as best possible!\nAfter such a strong season in 2011, we remain focused and don’t expect to be in top form immediately. I am sure Honda have done a fantastic job with the new 1000cc machine over the winter break and I’m really looking forward to getting back on the bike and seeing what we can do, hoping to start strong again. We know there will be a lot of serious competition out there, Ducati have been putting a lot of effort in as have Yamaha so it will be interesting to get out on track and see what everyone’s got. However, it’s early days and I think we’ll have to wait until the race in Qatar before we really know our competitors true pace and the package they have for 2012, but we’re ready for it.”\nDani Pedrosa:\n“It’s nice to be back with the team for the first Sepang test. I’m really excited to get on the bike again after the test we did in Valencia in November. Sepang is a good track for testing and we have still many things to discover out about the new bike. It’s been a long time since we were last riding and at the first test it’s always important to get the feeling back, the first sensations. We will have three long days here to work with the team and HRC and it’s necessary to be very focused in order to get good information to move forward for the second test. I guess the main target in this test will be to know the bike and the new Bridgestone tyres.”\nShuhei Nakamoto – HRC Executive Vice President:\n“We start this new 2012 season with a clear target: to work stronger than ever to defend our MotoGP World titles in this new 1000cc category. We finished the 800cc era winning the triple crown and we will fight to win this again in 2012. We fully trust in our riders Casey Stoner and Dani Pedrosa to deliver this big challenge and we will give them all our technical and human support.\nThe RC213V is an evolution of the last version of the RC212V based on the same concept. The machines we have brought here to Sepang are basically the same machines we tested in Valencia back in November with only a few differences. In fact, Casey and Dani will have one machine the same as Valencia, and the other one with a slightly different chassis, based on their own requests. This is the first time back to Sepang since we lost Marco Simoncelli last October, on Sunday we visited the scene of his accident and laid some flowers and said a final ‘Ciao’ to him. I believe by starting this season strong will be a fitting tribute to Marco.”\n\nAdvertisements",
        "Civic Type-R\nHonda Cars \n\n2015 Honda Civic Type-R officially unveiled – 310PS VTEC Turbo hot hatch \n\n\nPosted on March 3, 2015March 3, 2015 by eddy \n\n\nAfter a five year wait, 2015 sees the arrival of the world’s most keenly anticipated hot hatch, the Honda Civic Type R. Billed as a ‘race car for the road’, the all-new Civic Type R will set new standards in the high-performance front-wheel drive hatchback segment.\nThe production version of Honda’s latest hot hatch icon is revealed for the first time at the 85th Geneva Motor Show (5 to 15 March; Stand 4250, Hall 4), and more images of the car can be viewed at: www.hondanews.eu/gb\nType R vehicles have garnered a cult following around the world and the new model more than lives up to the high expectations. A world-first application of Honda’s new 2.0 litre VTEC TURBO engine, aggressive function-led styling, and pioneering new chassis technologies combine to deliver one of the most immersive and rewarding driving experiences available in any sector.\nThe new 2015 Civic Type R will be powered by the most extreme and high-performing engine in the 22-year history of the red ‘H’ badge, signalling the start of a new performance era for the Honda brand.  \nAll-new turbocharged 2.0 litre VTEC TURBO engine\nAt the heart of the Civic Type R is an all-new, direct-injected turbocharged 2.0 litre VTEC TURBO petrol engine, which delivers power, torque and performance figures unmatched in the front-wheel drive hot hatch segment. Peak power output is 310 PS* at 6,500 rpm, and peak torque is 400 Nm* at 2,500 rpm – both higher than for any previous Honda Type R model.\nRed-lining at 7,000 rpm, the engine – part of Honda’s next-generation Earth Dreams Technology series – features an advanced new turbocharger with VTEC technology that boosts low-end torque and delivers sustained acceleration.\nThe Civic Type R’s blistering performance is unmatched in the front-wheel drive hot hatch segment: the 0-to-100 km/h (62 mph) sprint is covered in just 5.7 seconds* – making it the fastest accelerating performance front-wheel drive hatchback – and top speed, where permitted, is a class-leading 270 km/h (167 mph)*.\nThe new engine is mated to a slick-shifting six-speed manual transmission, safeguarding an intimate, rewarding connection with the drivetrain, and power is directed through the front wheels.\nFunction dictates form\nThe styling changes that are unique to the Civic Type R give the car an aggressive, purposeful stance, yet almost all have a functional purpose. The sleek and aerodynamically-efficient design reflects a car developed to perform at speed. The focus on aerodynamics has ensured high-speed stability and high levels of downforce.\nTo achieve this aim, the Civic Type R was subject to exhaustive aerodynamic analysis, testing and development. The development team tirelessly pursued its objectives through computer-based CFD modelling and wind tunnel testing at Honda’s dedicated automotive motorsports facility in Sakura, Japan; home of Honda’s Formula One engine development.\nThis development work was validated through extensive prototype testing both on the road and on track, including at the Suzuka Formula One circuit, the Nürburgring Nordschleife and at the company’s Takasu test facility.\nA new, almost completely flat underside aids airflow under the vehicle and combines with a rear diffuser to optimise downforce – effectively ‘sucking’ the car onto the road.\nThe rear wing has been reimagined from the Type R Concept. The structure of the airfoil – its angle, height and shape as well as its vertical end plates – have been carefully engineered to optimise downforce without causing a significant increase in drag at higher speeds. This helps improve road-holding abilities, particularly through high-speed corners.\nA wide front splitter and deep side skirts also manage airflow and reduce lift, while the front bumper has been shaped specifically to inhibit air turbulence around the front wheels, enhancing high-speed stability and reducing lift forces.\nHeat management was another major focus for the design team, influencing several prominent external design modifications. Enlarged upper and lower grilles in the front bumper allow greater volume of cooling air into the engine bay. The airflow is channelled to outlet vents above the wheels on the front quarter panels and vents at the trailing edges of the widened front wheel arches to provide greater cooling and ventilation for the high-output engine.\nNew lightweight, high rigidity 19-inch alloy wheels, unique to the Type R, complement the visual changes. They fill the enlarged wheel arches with 235/35R19 tyres that were developed specially for the Type R.\nTo help the driver manage the Type R’s prodigious power, the car is equipped with a high performance Brembo brake package, developed specifically for the car.  At the front, four-piston calipers apply braking force to 350 mm drilled discs.\nThe Type R is available in five distinctive colours that give the purposeful new styling added visual impact. As well as Championship White – shared with successive generations of iconic Type R vehicles – buyers can choose from Crystal Black (pearlescent), Polished Metal (metallic), Brilliant Sporty Blue (metallic) and Milano Red.\nA cabin with a sporting ambience\nA range of aesthetic and functional upgrades within the cabin reinforce the Type R’s sporting character. As with previous Type R models, the gear lever knob is made from machined aluminium alloy. High-backed sports seats, trimmed in suede-effect black fabric with red double stitching, provide driver and front-seat passenger with ample lateral support during harder cornering.\nMatching red double stitching also appears on the black leather-clad steering wheel and black gear-lever gaiter. The roof-lining is trimmed in black fabric, augmenting the focused ambience.\nNew suspension technologies for a rewarding, more agile drive\nA number of innovative new suspension systems, unique to the Type R, have been introduced to produce rewarding handling characteristics and to maximise power transfer to the road.\nA new four-point Adaptive Damper System, developed specifically for the Type R, enables continuous independent control of each wheel to deliver exceptional road holding performance, limit wheel-load transfer during sharp acceleration and deceleration, and to maintain a stable, flat ride. It also means that the ride is more comfortable and supple in everyday driving and cruising.\nAn advanced Dual Axis Strut Front Suspension system helps to reduce torque steer by 50 per cent compared to the standard Civic’s suspension set up, enhancing high speed stability, on-the-limit cornering and steering feel. At the rear, Type R’s H-shaped torsion beam suspension is constructed with a bespoke ‘crushed pipe’ which improves rear roll rigidity by 180 per cent, further enhancing stability in high-speed corners.\nThese systems are complemented by Dual Pinion Electric Power Steering, which helps to deliver rapid yet linear steering response and abundant feel.\nNew ‘+R’ mode increases responses for enhanced driving thrills\nThe new Civic Type R will mark the debut of the new ‘+R’ button that increases the response of various chassis and drivetrain systems. The result is an even more intense driving experience, ideal for the track and sure to be appreciated by the genuine sports-driving enthusiast.\nWhen +R mode is activated, engine responsiveness is heightened, with torque-mapping changed to a more aggressive and performance-focused setting. Steering receives reduced power assistance and is therefore more responsive to driver inputs, and basic damping force from the new four-point Adaptive Damper System is increased by 30 per cent. This means the behaviour of the car is firmer and more agile for high-performance handling.\nAll-new GT Pack offers further enhancements\nCustomers will have the option to specify their new Civic Type R with an all-new GT Pack.\nExternally, the GT Pack adds signature red highlights to the front and rear splitters for even greater eye-catching impact, but it’s under the skin where the GT Pack’s most significant upgrades will be found.\nThe driver will benefit from extra convenience features such as front and rear parking sensors, dusk sensing headlamps, rain sensing automatic wipers and electric fold door mirrors. Integrated Garmin satellite navigation (including four years of free map updates) is added to the Honda Connect  infotainment system. Audiophiles will be attracted by the addition of a CD player and a premium eight-speaker, 320 watt stereo system upgrade.\nAll occupants will appreciate automatic dual zone climate control air conditioning, and sophistication in the cabin is also boosted by red ambient lighting.\nThe GT Pack also includes Honda’s Advanced Driver Assist Systems. This comprehensive suite of sensor-based safety technologies includes Forward Collision Warning, Lane Departure Warning, Traffic Sign Recognition system, High-Beam Support System, Blind Spot Information and Cross Traffic Monitor.\nHonda’s City-Brake Active system will be fitted as standard on the Civic Type R.\nThe all-new Honda Civic Type R will go on sale across Europe from this summer. Full vehicle specifications will be announced in due course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Considering the turbo spins more than 10,000RPM when it is in action, highly detailed measurement and low amount of tolerance are needed to make it the best possible. At 200 miles per hour, I think you don’t want your turbo to be second class.\nCheck out the video embed after the jump  \n\nvia: Youtube via: http://jalopnik.com/5866757/how-a-turbocharger-is-made\nAdvertisements",

This same bike is known as the Yamaha Vega in Indonesia. It also has its similar twins here in Malaysia that is the Yamaha Lagenda 110. This bike launch coincides with the info from MotoMalaya regular tipster, Pengecat Bintang, about the the upcoming Lagenda 115 FI in Malaysia that are going to be equipped with fuel injection.  \n\nAt first, I was thinking this new Lagenda 115 FI might be the Yamaha Jupiter Z1 which has been recently launched in Indonesia and well received there. The Jupiter Z1 is a powerful and interesting bike in my opinion since it gets 20% more power from the same displacement with the renown handling of the agile bike. On further reading of the screenshot above, it seems that it might not be likely since the Lagenda 115 FI is going to follow the bike from Vietnam specs. Anyway, it is a good time for HLYM to introduce the small FI bike to wiser rider in Malaysia now. The estimated launching time for this bike, along with new XJ6, is next year. It can be as soon as January. I hope the price will be right for that kind of 115 FI bike, maybe just around RM5,500-6,000 max. If it is more than that, better get the 135LC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2012/12/03/yamaha-thai-rilis-spark-115i-yec-fi-next-vega-injeksi-kah/\nand https://www.facebook.com/pengecat.bintang\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\nD-Tracker 150\nKawasaki \n\n2012 Kawasaki D-Tracker 150 – Offroad Style On The Road at RM9,689 \n\n\nPosted on June 21, 2012June 21, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nKawasaki has just recently launched a gem in their bike lineup. This is Kawasaki D-Tracker 150. Before this, we are accustomed to one of the popular scrambler bike from Kawasaki that is the KLX150S, but this D-Tracker differentiate itself from KLX150S by having smaller tyre for both wheel at 14-inch but with wider profile compared to the KLX150S at 19-inch for the front and 16-inch at the rear.\n\nAnother great features is the 5-step adjustable Uni-Track rear suspension to better suits your riding style. Both of the brakes are equipped with single disc brake type with 212mm for the front and 156mm for the rear. If you are still thinking about the intake system of this bike, I can assure you that this bike is still using carburetor or more specific Keihin NCV 24. The 250cc D-Tracker X comes with the fuel injection system with Keihin 34mm single barrel throttle body and I thought this should comes with it too.\n\nAlso included is the electric starter for easier startup. One of the reason people like to use scrambler or offroad bike for daily uses is because of the higher strength and higher durability of the chassis and parts of the bikes. This can make the bike last longer than normal moped or automatic bike. You also don’t have to worry with bumps and pothole on the road if you accidentally get into them since this kind of bike are ready to take the abuse. Anyway, it might hurts your butt.\nPrice for 2012 Kawasaki D-Tracker 150 is at RM9,689.00.

        "1000cc\nBridgestone\nmotogp \n\nRound 4 Jerez, Spain: Fourth successive victory for Marquez after Spanish MotoGP™ triumph – 1st Marquez, 2nd Rossi, 3rd Pedrosa \n\n\nPosted on May 5, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Marc Marquez won his first ever Grand Prix at Jerez and made it four victories from four starts to take a commanding position in the MotoGP championship standings.\nStarting his one-hundredth Grand Prix, Marquez exchanged the race lead with Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi during the opening laps, before increasing his pace – setting the fastest lap of the race on lap five – to build a comfortable gap over his challengers. Marquez then controlled the race to cross the finish line 1.431 seconds ahead of Rossi in second place. In third place was Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa, who stormed home in the final laps but ultimately crossed the finish line just 0.098 seconds behind Rossi. All riders on the podium opted for the medium compound rear slick, with Marquez and Pedrosa using the medium compound front, while Rossi selected the hard compound front slick for the race.\nHot and dry conditions were present for the twenty-seven lap Spanish Grand Prix and during the race the track temperature reached its highest level of the weekend at 55°C. Although conditions were extremely hot, all three asymmetric rear slick options supplied this weekend worked well on the greasy track surface and were used during the race. The extra-soft rear slick was the most popular choice with ten riders selecting this option for the race. The soft rear slick was selected by seven riders, with the remaining six riders opting for the medium compound rear. Front tyre choice showed a strong preference for the medium compound option, with twenty of the twenty-three entrants choosing this option.\nMarquez’s flawless start to the season gives him a twenty-eight point lead in the MotoGP™ championship standings over teammate Pedrosa after just four rounds. Rossi remains in third place and a further eleven points adrift.\nKyota Futami – General Manager, Global Motorsport Department, Bridgestone Corporation \n“Repsol Honda and Marc dominated another race weekend and I’d like to congratulate Marc on winning his first ever Grand Prix at Jerez. This is such a fantastic venue for racing and this weekend was no exception, with the largest crowd in the last few years coming out to support the MotoGP riders. Both our front and rear tyre allocation for this race was changed from last year, and I am happy that it was received well by the riders. It was unfortunate to hear Danilo broke his wrist in his accident during Warm Up and I hope that he makes a quick recovery and is back on his bike soon. The next round is at Le Mans which in terms of layout is very different from Jerez, so it will be interesting to see if this will enable another rider to make a strong challenge for the race victory.”\nMasao Azuma – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“It was very hot all weekend but the conditions were consistent each day which meant the teams and riders had a lot of opportunities to evaluate their tyre options for the race. Jerez can be a difficult circuit when the temperatures are high, but our new expanded front tyre allocation ensured the riders had options to manage the challenging conditions. It was good to see that all three rear slick options we brought to Jerez performed well in the race and I hope we see similar variation in race tyre choice for the next round at Le Mans. For now our technical team will be on hand to assist the MotoGP test at Jerez tomorrow and once again it looks like it will be very hot here.”\nMarc Marquez – Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“Of course I’m really happy. It was a different kind of victory as at this circuit I struggled a little bit during the weekend. Everyone was so close in the race but at the beginning on the new tyres I felt good so I could push hard to create a gap as I knew at the end of the race Dani and Valentino would be strong. It was a special victory and we are in a good moment, so now we need to try and keep our advantage.”\nBridgestone slick compounds available: Front: Soft, Medium & Hard; Rear: Extra-soft, Soft & Medium (Asymmetric)\nBridgestone wet tyre compounds available: Hard (Main), Soft (Alternative – front), Extra-hard (Alternative – rear)\nWeather:  Dry.

The model is XN15. Check out the features as stated from their website below:  \nUltra-High Security \nHigh nickel-content stainless-steel construction, piercing alarm and polished good looks make the XN15 a remarkably effective way to protect your motorbike. Versatile and super-strong to fit right in with the finest motorcycle kit.\n\n\nLock: The XN15’s unique double-locking, carbide-reinforced hardened-steel 14mm pin resists picking, sawing, freeze-spray attack and more. \n\n\nAlarm: Shock & motion sensors linked to a sophisticated microprocessor trigger a 110dB alarm. The unit is self-arming, with no on-off switch, and re-sets to armed mode within 15 seconds if the attack stops.\nWith this kind of quality for security, the price for it is not cheap. This XENA XN15 is priced at MYR200. Even though it is expensive, it still a great buy since it can prevent your bike to be stolen. At least, the thief might think twice before choosing your bike with XN15 as their target. So, they just might take the bike next to your bike.\nThe cheaper version of XENA disc-lock comes in the model of X1. Priced at MYR90, this affordable version comes in four exciting colours that is stainless-steel, yellow, orange and black. In my opinion, you should choose the high visibility colours that is the yellow and orange ones since this can hinder thief away when they see the XENA lock in position.\n\nI also have checked the availability of it in Malaysia and happy to say that is available. You can check it out at Mudah.my link here: http://www.mudah.my/li?ca=9_s&th=1&q=xena&cg=0&w=3\nAlso check out here: http://www.xenasecurity.com/home/current/lock/\nbest motorcyle lock, kunci disk motosikal, disc brake lock\nAdvertisements",

After Bajaj Auto from India expands its share in KTM, the wisest thing to do is to scale down the big engine bike of KTM to small engine, low emission, fuel-efficient but still desirable and still KTM to fit the large Indian market. The bike that holds all the statement is KTM Duke 125.\nI never thought that KTM will ever takes this turn to make small bike as nice as this Duke 125. In my head, KTM is one of the greatest motorcross manufacturer along with Yamaha, Suzuki and Honda, that only cater the market for Europe and other countries other than Asia. Now, we are able to get our soul satisfied with this bike that is going to be marketed in 2011.\nKTM Duke 125 have everything that KTM bike should have. It have great design by Kiska, great chassis with chromoly steel, great brakes by Bybre (means By Brembo in India) and it got fuel-injection fuel system by Bosch. If you think hard enough, you might think that all this features are NOT meant for a 125cc bikes. This features has raised the price of this bike a little bit compared to Honda CBF 125, which is its competitor.\nThis bike is assembled in India with local parts, the wheel are made in China with KTM quality specification by Jingfi.\nSeven more pictures after the jump with technical specification.

        "motogp \n\nRound 11: Pedrosa sets record pace en route to maiden MotoGP™ win of the season at Brno \n\n\nPosted on August 18, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa set a scorching pace to take his first win of the MotoGP™ season ahead of the Movistar Yamaha MotoGP duo of Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi who finished in second and third place respectively.\nOn his way to victory, Pedrosa set a new Circuit Record Lap of 1’56.027 and kept a fast pace throughout the twenty-two laps of the Brno circuit, and despite a late push from Lorenzo, managed to cross the finish line 0.410 seconds ahead of his Spanish rival. Rossi enjoyed an entertaining battle with Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez during the middle stages of the race, before breaking away and comfortably claiming the final podium position. Today’s Czech Republic Grand Prix was the fastest ever race to take part at the Automotodrom Brno, with Pedrosa’s total race time being three seconds quicker than the existing record time set at last year’s Czech Republic Grand Prix.  \nIn what has almost become a tradition on race day, drops of rain fell and dark clouds loomed as the riders set out on the formation lap, but the rain didn’t eventuate allowing the twenty-two laps of the race to be run in dry conditions. The peak track temperature during the race was 29°C which was 7°C down on the highest reading yesterday. The cooler temperatures and threat of rain resulted in four of the twenty-four starters selecting the soft compound front slick, with the other twenty riders opting for the medium compound front slick. Rear tyre choice saw every rider except one select the softest rear slick option available to them; medium compound for the Factory Honda and Yamaha, and soft compound for the Ducati and Open-class riders.\nAlthough he finished off the podium for the first time this season, Marquez still holds a massive 77 point lead in the standings over his teammate Pedrosa, while Rossi is a further 13 points back and sits in third position overall on the championship points table.\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“We enjoyed another exciting race at the Brno circuit and it was pleasing to see Dani win his first race of the season in such convincing style, so congratulations to him and Repsol Honda, and also to the Movistar Yamaha MotoGP team on another fine double-podium. Another large crowd was on hand to witness today’s races and with so many exciting battles throughout the field, I am sure they will go home happy. We saw yet another Circuit Record Lap and total race time record set today, which is just the latest example of our tyre development keeping pace with the latest evolutions of MotoGP racing machines.”\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“Today for the race the track temperature was a bit cooler which resulted in some riders switching to softer slick options but overall, the riders chose the tyre combinations that they evaluated during yesterday’s race simulations. Both the soft and medium compound front and rear slicks worked well today with the different riding styles and setups utilised during the race. I am really happy with how our tyres performed at this demanding circuit as not only was there a new Circuit Record Lap set and overall race time record, both Dani and Jorge were able to lap within the 1’56 range for the entire race which shows the very consistent performance of our tyres. After another positive weekend, our technical staff will now shift their focus to tomorrow’s MotoGP group test, the data from which will help steer development of our race tyres for the remainder of this season and the next.”\nDani Pedrosa, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“The race didn’t happen as I originally planned, Jorge was so strong in the opening laps and he immediately opened a gap, so I had to change my strategy and push to the limit. In the opening laps I could feel my bike was working well and I was able to keep a good rhythm until the end. Only in the final stages I felt I was losing a bit of rear grip and suffered a little on corner exit, but I could manage the gap and win the race. It was a special day for me and my team as we’ve had some tough races so far this year.”\nCzech Republic MotoGP™: Top Ten Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’47.800\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’48.210\n\n\n0.410\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n42’53.059\n\n\n5.259\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n42’58.254\n\n\n10.454\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE\n\n\nPramac Racing\n\n\n43’05.439\n\n\n17.639\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n43’05.634\n\n\n17.834\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nStefan BRADL\n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n\n\n43’11.619\n\n\n23.819\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n43’17.421\n\n\n29.621\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n43’18.164\n\n\n30.364\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n43’25.439\n\n\n37.639\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "125z\nrx-z \n\nCatalyzer: What is it? \n\n\nPosted on July 19, 2008 by eddy \n\n\nRX-Z 2004 Catalyzer Exhaust Setup\n\nCatalyzer is the technology used in Yamaha RX-Z 2004, Yamaha 125Z and also LC135. In order to know what is catalyzer, you need to know what is catalysis. So, read on this article quoted from Wikipedia.\nCatalysis is the process in which the rate of a chemical reaction is increased by means of a chemical substance known as a catalyst. Unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed. Thus, the catalyst may participate in multiple chemical transformations, although in practice catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes.\nBackground\n \nThe production of most industrially important chemicals involves catalysis. Research into catalysis is a major field in applied science and involves many areas of chemistry, notably in organometallic chemistry, and materials science. Catalysis is important in many aspects of environmental science, from the catalytic converter in automobiles to the causes of the ozone hole. Catalytic reactions are preferred in environmentally friendly green chemistry due to the reduced amount of waste generated,[1] as opposed to stoichiometric reactions in which all reactants are consumed and more side products are formed. The most common catalyst is the proton (H+). Many transition metals and transition metal complexes are used in catalysis as well.\n \nA catalyst works by providing an alternative reaction pathway to the reaction product. The rate of the reaction is increased as this alternative route has a lower activation energy than the reaction route not mediated by the catalyst. The disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide to give water and oxygen is a reaction that is strongly affected by catalysts:\n \n\n2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2\n\n \nThis reaction is favoured in the sense that reaction products are more stable than the starting material, however the uncatalysed reaction is slow. The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide is in fact so slow that hydrogen peroxide solutions are commercially available. Upon the addition of a small amount of manganese dioxide, the hydrogen peroxide rapidly reacts according to the above equation. This effect is readily seen by the effervescence of oxygen.[2] The manganese dioxide may be recovered unchanged, and re-used indefinitely, and thus is not consumed in the reaction. Accordingly, manganese dioxide catalyses this reaction.[3]\n \n\n \nGeneral principles of catalysis\n \n\n \nTypical mechanism\n \n\n\nMain article: catalytic cycle\n\n\n \nCatalysts generally react with one or more reactants to form an intermediate that subsequently give the final reaction product, in the process regenerating the catalyst. The following is a typical reaction scheme, where C represents the catalyst, A and B are reactants, and D is the product of the reaction of A and B:\n \n\nA + C → AC (1)\nB + AC → ABC (2)\nABC → CD (3)\nCD → C + D (4)\n\n \nAlthough the catalyst is consumed by reaction 1, it is subsequently produced by reaction 4, so for the overall reaction:\n \n\nA + B → D\n\n \nAs a catalyst is regenerated in a reaction, often only small amounts are needed to increase the rate of the reaction. In practice, however, catalysts are sometimes consumed in secondary processes.\n \n\n \nCatalysis and reaction energetics\n \n\n\n\n\n Generic potential energy diagram showing the effect of a catalyst in an hypothetical exothermic chemical reaction. The presence of the catalyst opens a different reaction pathway (shown in red) with a lower activation energy. The final result and the overall thermodynamics are the same.\n\n\n \nCatalysts work by providing an (alternative) mechanism involving a different transition state and lower activation energy. The effect of this is that more molecular collisions have the energy needed to reach the transition state. Hence, catalysts can perform reactions that, albeit thermodynamically feasible, would not run without the presence of a catalyst, or perform them much faster, more specific, or at lower temperatures. This can be observed on a Boltzmann distribution and energy profile diagram. This means that catalysts reduce the amount of energy needed to start a chemical reaction.\n \nCatalysts do not change the favorableness of a reaction: they have no effect on the chemical equilibrium of a reaction because the rate of both the forward and the reverse reaction are both affected (see also thermodynamics). The net free energy change of a reaction is the same whether a catalyst is used or not; the catalyst just makes it easier to activate.\n \nThe SI derived unit for measuring the catalytic activity of a catalyst is the katal, which is moles per second. The activity of a catalyst can also be described by the turn over number (or TON) and the catalytic efficiency by the turn over frequency (TOF). The biochemical equivalent is the enzyme unit. For more information on the efficiency of enzymatic catalysis see the Enzyme#Kinetics section.\n \n\n \nFactors that affect catalytic rates\n \nCatalysis manifests itself in accelerated rates of reactions, and thus many catalytic systems are analyzed with attention to how those rates are affected, beyond the usual parameters that affect all reactions, e.g. temperature, pressure, and concentration. In autocatalysis, a reaction produces catalysts, thus the rates of reactions subject to autocatalysis accelerate with time.\n \nSome molecules inhibit catalysis by competing for the active sites. The strongest inhibitors are called poisons. Many catalysts used in petrochemical applications lose activity due to poisoning. Such catalysts are regenerated and reused multiple times to save costs and energy and to reduce environmental impact from disposal of spent catalysts.\n \nIn “product inhibition,” the rate of catalysis is slowed by the presence of products. When the equilibrium constant for a reaction is very high, however, rates can appear unaffected by the presence of products. In the catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes, for example, one does not observe inhibition by alkanes.\n \n\n \nTypical catalytic materials\n \nThe chemical nature of catalysts is as diverse as catalysis itself, although some generalizations can be made. Proton acids are probably the most widely used catalysts, especially for the many reactions involving water, including hydrolyses and its reverse. Multifunctional solids often are catalytically active, e.g. zeolites, alumina, certain forms of graphitic carbon. Transition metals are often used to catalyse redox reactions (oxidation, hydrogenation). Many catalytic processes, especially those involving hydrogen, require platinum metals.\n \nSome so-called catalysts are really “precatalysts.” Precatalysts convert to catalysts in the reaction. For example, Wilkinson’s catalyst RhCl(PPh3)3 loses one triphenylphosphine ligand before entering the true catalytic cycle. Precatalysts are easier to store but are easily activated in situ. Because of this preactivation step, many catalytic reactions involve an induction period.\n \n\n \nTypes of catalysis\n \nCatalysts can be either heterogeneous or homogeneous, depending on whether a catalyst exists in the same phase as the substrate. Biocatalysts are often seen as a separate group.\n \n\n \nHeterogeneous catalysts\n \n\n\nMain article: Heterogeneous catalysis\n\n\n \nHeterogeneous catalysts are present in different phases from the reactants. Most heterogeneous catalysts are solids that act on substrates in a liquid or gaseous reaction mixture. Diverse mechanisms for reactions on surfaces are known, depending on how the adsorption takes place (Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal).[4]\n \nFor example, in the Haber process, finely divided iron serves as a catalyst for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen. The reacting gases adsorb onto “active sites” on the iron particles. Once adsorbed, the bonds within the reacting molecules are weakened, and new bonds between the resulting fragments form in part due to their close proximity. In this way the particularly strong triple bond in nitrogen is weakened and the hydrogen and nitrogen atoms combine faster than would be the case in the gas phase, so the rate of reaction increases.\n \nHeterogeneous catalysts are typically “supported,” which means that the catalyst is dispersed on a second material that enhances the effectiveness or minimizes their cost. Sometimes the support is merely a surface upon which the catalyst is spread to increase the surface area. More often, the support and the catalyst interact, affecting the catalytic reaction.\n \n\n\n\n\n Heterogeneous catalysts are often “supported” on complex structures to maximize surface area.\n\n\n \n\n \nElectrocatalysts\n \nIn the context of electrochemistry, specifically in fuel cell engineering, various metal-containing catalysts are used to enhance the rates of the half reactions that comprise the fuel cell. One common type of fuel cell electrocatalyst is based upon nanoparticles of platinum that are supported on slightly larger carbon particles. When this platinum electrocatalyst is in contact with one of the electrodes in a fuel cell, it increases the rate of oxygen reduction to water (or hydroxide or hydrogen peroxide).\n \n\n \nHomogeneous catalysts\n \n\n\nMain article: Homogeneous catalysis\n\n\n \nHomogeneous catalysts function in the same phase as the reactants, but the mechanistic principles invoked in heterogeneous catalysis are generally applicable. Typically homogeneous catalysts are dissolved in a solvent with the substrates. One example of homogeneous catalysis involves the influence of H+ on the esterification of esters, e.g. methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol.[5] For inorganic chemists, homogeneous catalysis is often synonymous with organometallic catalysts.\n \n\n \nOrganocatalysis\n \n\n\nMain article: Organocatalysis\n\n\n \nWhereas transition metals sometimes attract most of the attention in the study of catalysis, organic molecules without metals can also possess catalytic properties. Typically, organic catalysts require a higher loading (or amount of catalyst per unit amount of reactant) than transition metal-based catalysts, but these catalysts are usually commercially available in bulk, helping to reduce costs. In the early 2000s, organocatalysts were considered “new generation” and are competitive to traditional metal-containing catalysts. Enzymatic reactions operate via the principles of organic catalysis.\n \n\n \nSignificance of catalysis\n \nEstimates are that 90% of all commercially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufacture.[6] In 2005, catalytic processes generated about $900 billion in products worldwide.(pdf) Catalysis is so pervasive that subareas are not readily classified. Some areas of particular concentration are surveyed below.\n \n\n \nEnergy processing\n \nPetroleum refining makes intensive use of catalysis for alkylation, catalytic cracking (breaking long-chain hydrocarbons into smaller pieces), naphtha reforming, steam reforming (conversion of hydrocarbons into synthesis gas). Even the exhaust from the burning of fossil fuels are treated via catalysis: Catalytic converters, typically composed of platinum and rhodium, break down some of the more harmful byproducts of automobile exhaust.\n \n\n2 CO + 2 NO → 2 CO2 + N2\n\n \nWith regards to synthetic fuels, an old but still important process is the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas, which itself is processed via water-gas shift reactions, catalysed by iron. Biodiesel and related biofuels require processing via both inorganic and biocatalysts.\n \nFuel cells rely on catalysts for both the anodic and cathodic reactions.\n \n\n \nHeavy chemicals\n \nSome of the largest scale chemicals are produced via catalytic oxidation, often using oxygen. Examples include nitric acid (from ammonia), sulfuric acid (from sulfur dioxide to sulfur trioxide by the chamber process), terephthalic acid from p-xylene, and acrylonitrile from propane and ammonia.\n \nMany other chemical products are generated by large-scale reduction, often via hydrogenation. The largest-scale example is ammonia, which is prepared via the Haber process from nitrogen. Methanol is prepared from carbon monoxide.\n \nBulk polymers derived from ethylene and propylene are often prepared via Ziegler-Natta catalysis. Polyesters, polyamides, and isocyanates via acid-base catalysis.\n \nMost carbonylation processes require metal catalysts, examples include the Monsanto acetic acid process and hydroformylation.\n \n\n \nFine chemicals\n \nMany fine chemicals are prepared via catalysis; methods include those of heavy industry as well as more specialized processes that would be prohibitively expensive on a large scale. Examples include olefin metathesis using Grubbs’ catalyst, the Heck reaction, and Friedel-Crafts reactions.\n \nBecause most bioactive compounds are chiral, many pharmaceuticals are produced by enantioselective catalysis.\n \n\n \nFood processing\n \nOne of the most obvious applicatoins of catalysis is the hydrogenation (reaction with hydrogen gas) of fats using nickel catalyst to give margarine.[7] Many other foodstuffs are prepared via biocatalysis (see below).\n \n\n \nBiology\n \n\n\nMain article: Biocatalysis\n\n\n \nIn nature, enzymes are catalysts in metabolism and catabolism. Most biocatalysts are protein-based, i.e. enzymes, but other classes of biomolecules also exhibit catalytic properties including abzymes, ribozymes, and synthetic deoxyribozymes.\n \nBiocatalysts can be thought of as intermediate between homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts, although strictly speaking soluble enzymes are homogeneous catalysts and membrane-bound enzymes are heterogeneous. Several factors affect the activity of enzymes (and other catalysts) including temperature, pH, concentration of enzyme, substrate, and products. A particularly important reagent in enzymatic reactions is water, which is the product of many bond-forming reactions and a reactant in many bond-breaking processes.\n \nEnzymes are employed to prepare many commodity chemicals including high-fructose corn syrup and acrylamide.\n \n\n \nIn the environment\n \nCatalysis impacts the environment by increasing the efficiency of industrial processes, but catalysis also directly plays a direct role in the environment. A notable example is the catalytic role of Chlorine free radicals in the break down of ozone. These radicals are formed by the action of ultraviolet radiation on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).\n \n\nCl· + O3 → ClO· + O2\nClO· + O· → Cl· + O2\n\n \n\n \nHistory\n \nIn a general sense, anything that increases the rate of any process is often called a “catalyst,”a term derived from Greek καταλύειν, meaning “to annul,” or “to untie,” or “to pick up.” The phrase catalysed processes was coined by Jöns Jakob Berzelius in 1836[8] to describe reactions that are accelerated by substances that remain unchanged after the reaction. Other early chemists involved in catalysis were Alexander Mitscherlich who in 1831[citation needed] referred to contact processes and Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who spoke of contact action and whose lighter based on hydrogen and a platinum sponge became a huge commercial success in the 1820’s. Humphrey Davy discovered the use of platinum in catalysis. In the 1880s, Wilhelm Ostwald at Leipzig University started a series of systematic investigations into reactions that were catalyzed by the presence of acids and bases, and found both that chemical reactions occur at finite rates, and that these rates can be used to determine the strengths of acids and bases.

        "135cc\nmalaysia bike\nreview\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\nMy Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed Review (UPDATED) \n\n\nPosted on November 28, 2011November 30, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nI have been using Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed for almost for 4 month now. I have made a wish to myself that I will buy a new first model of this Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed, and now my wish has been granted. My review will focus on my experience and knowledge about this popular bike starting from the first day I get it out from the shop to this day. Previously, I have been writing about Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed, whether it is a good buy or not here. For me, the answer is both yes and no. Why?  \nThe Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed as we all know comes with 5-speed transmission. The clutch lever position and the softness of the clutch feels very good and it is very easy to control the power from the engine to rear tyre with it. My gripe is that sometime I miss the Neutral gear when I want to park my bike, even though the gear shift is smooth, but when I want to change to gear ‘2’ while riding it, it easily slips to ‘N’ position. Maybe its me that is not good with the gear play.\nI was once want to say that this bike is ‘Corner Master’ since it features the wide rear tyre that helps cornering and handling of the bike, but taking low angle cornering with this stock tyre is not recommended. I suggest you to get Battlax BT090 to the rear tyre that you can have Cub Prix style cornering which is very low angle attack. Wide rear tyre also helps in terms of balance and control when you have pillion rider. On narrow tyre, you will feel that is not easy to take corner when you have pillion rider, but with this IRC NR82 2.50 wide rear tyre, you will feel the balance and control are as much as the same like you are riding alone. Having wide have is side effect too since it is heavier and this will make the top speed is lower than what we can expect from this bike.\nIRC NR82\n The overall body design of this bike is aerodynamic and it look like it is angry. This is due to the pilot light at the fairing that is now smaller and longer. The aerodynamic of this bike are good with many lines on the body that is used for better airflow. In my eyes, I think the design of this Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed is very nice and for me, it looks better everyday. The thing that I think need to be worked out by Yamaha engineers is to make a better tail light. The Y125ZR have the most beautiful tail light design of all time.\n\nThe meter cluster at first looks like a lamp bulb and this have been talked a lot in many forums and blogs. I ‘m okay with this meter setup, but I think they can do better. The meter actually works well in terms of helping you with the information about the bike. The gear position indicator, signal indicator and fuel meter are visible and easy to read in any condition. The backlight illuminates even in daylight after you switched on the key and this is good for safety. The front pilot light at the fairing will also illuminates as soon as you turn the key to ‘On’ position even if the bike is not being started yet. Looks cool! The key also have shutter that keeps you bike a little bit safer than the previous model. The underseat key hole anyway is being put at the back. It is not 3-way key like I expect it when I first see it. This is actually good, since sometime we have lock our bike and need to keep our helmet locked under the seat helmet pin. So, no need to re-open the bike lock just to open the underseat. The thing that I hate about the key is that it is too long and it is not easy to keep inside my pocket. Also, long key are easily bent when you misplaced and step on it.\n\nOne thing that I need to say here is about the basket from BKP, that I think you all should install. This is because you can fully open your seat without it hitting the basket! This is good since sometime we need to hold the seat with our head when we are trying to fill up the fuel.\n\n\nAbout the top speed, yes, it is can go only up to 120km/h only. I have test this and I managed to get 115km/h on straight riding position. It can go further to 120km/h if you ride it in ‘G’ (tunduk) position. Due to this issue, many have think to modified their ride. I’m thinking to install the Yoshimura exhaust pipe to this Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed, but some modification is needed since the length of the exhaust manifold for this bike is longer. I wish there is plug and play Yoshimura available.\nIf we take out the top speed factor, this bike power is very satisfactory. The torque are enormous. The way the power are delivered also good with the application of the butterfly slide carburetor, the Mikuni BS25. You can have rapid throttle opening just like scooter with this carb. You will not feel the bike hungry for more fuel. The power is there anytime and every time you twist the throttle. You twist, it goes. You twist, it goes. It just feels great. I like the feeling of this bike in 2nd gear all the way to 4th gear. The pickup is one of the best I have felt for a moped bike. Some people ask me whether this bike is easy to ride it slowly like at 20km/h, and I have test this in 3rd gear and I can tell you that you can ride it in 20km/h in 3rd gear without jerk feel. It just feels smooth. You can also hear the engine in nice sound when it is driven slow.\nThe engine sound of this Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed are not as silent as I thought at first. It is much more rough than the 4-speed version. The 4-speed engine sound is soft and feels like a sponge, whereby this 5-speed sounds a little bit like metal grinding each other. I have checked the oil and everything is in good condition.\nThe switch panel of this Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed is also an area that Yamaha needs to improve. In my opinion, it is not user-friendly and not easy to use. I have Lagenda 115ZR and I think it has better switch panel. You can read my article about it here.\n\nFuel consumption are one of the best from Yamaha for this bike. I can get 130km for full tank that is about RM6 (RON95 fuel price is RM1.90/l). I have tested this many times and that the number that I get. For a bike that is enjoyable and having large capacity 135cc, this number is good.\nThe performance of this Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed is very satisfactory. I need to tell you again that the pickup and torque are enormous and it feels there are too much power of it. This makes you wonder why the top speed is at 120km/h only. Yes, we know that the speedometer is heavier than the previous model, but I think it should get 140km/h in standard form. Where have all the power gone when we step to the 5th gear? That is what I feel about the top speed. Other than that, I really like the performance of this bike. It is a Corner Master, Acceleration Monster but not Top Speed Machine.\nSo, is it a good buy?\nYes, for me this bike fits the statement of a great riding machine. The acceleration and handling of the bike are superb.\nNo, just because the top speed. I just wish it got more. 140km/h should be enough for me.\nI hope my writings here will give a little or more info about the Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit 5-speed for you all. This is based on my experience and knowledge about this bike. If there are any mistake or anything that you want to say about it, feel free to comment.\nYou can also read more about Yamaha 135LC here.\nUPDATE (30/11/2011):I’ll be answering your question on the comment as below:\nAnswers to your Questions:\n1. Haziq Faris: What type of sidemirror did you use on your motorcycle?\nAnswer: The original 2006-2010 Yamaha 135LC side mirror.\n2. Haziq Faris: And why the paper clip are on the basket??\nAnswer:Check out the picture below.\nThe paper clip are used to hold loose paper and sometimes paper bag. This is good since the paper will not fly out when ride at high speed. Students should have this installed.\n\nAdvertisements",

The engine oil is pumped across a very sturdy aluminum oil cooler.  The tests show that the oil is cooled by 10deg C, with normal riding, and normal oil pressure is maintained.  The cooled oil is then pumped back to the crankshaft and up to the cylinder head.  The sturdy oil cooler has another advantage in that it’s mounted directly in front of the radiator and serves to product the radiato fins from rock damage.\nI’m spreading the word to you all reader since in my deepest opinion, this KTL Tecnic Oil Cooler Kit is a great product many extreme tuners are waiting for, since the problem with extreme modification to the engine is the heat. You can contact Josh via the information as shown below.

The 30-minute session began early at 9:00am local time and all 21 riders took the track.  \nThe first piece of good news we got for you is that Helmi Azman was cleared to take part in Qualifying – much to the relief of his fellow countrymen and family members present in support. However, Helmi’s pace was undoubtedly not optimal, resulting in him qualifying in 13th position just ahead of rookie Azroy Anuar in 14th, followed by wildcards Idham Khairuddin in 18th and Luth Erwan in 21st.\nAll eyes for the session were on three other Malaysians, that being Shafiq Rasol, Adam Norrodin and Fakhrusy Rostam as the trio battled it out against several of the grid’s Japanese riders for the fastest times. Setting the pace early on was Yuta Date and Ayumu Sasaki, but Rostam stormed up the timing board soon after, clocking in his best time of 2:18.419 to qualify fourth on the grid.\nTowards the later stages, Sasaki managed to squeeze in a blistering laptime of 2:17.285, which secured pole position for the 14-year-old Japanese speedster. Not far behind him was 14-year-old Kazuki Masaki who qualified second with his fastest time of 2:18.046 – a close 0.761 seconds behind Sasaki.\nThough both Sasaki and Masaki seized the day’s Qualifying session, they do have three Malaysians hot on their heels. Besides Fakhrusy in fourth, Shafiq Rasol qualified in third after clocking in his best time of 2:18.374, securing his first row starting position. Joining Fakhrusy in row 2 is Adam Norrodin who qualified fifth with his best time of 2:18.533.\nFor Team Malaysia, the session’s results prove to be very promising. Rest assure, all eyes are on Shafiq in row 1, as well as Fakhrusy and Adam on row 2.

        "300cc\nForza\nHonda\nmalaysia bike\nNSS300 \n\n2014 Honda NSS300 maxi scooter released in Malaysia – RM26,768 (Standard) and RM28,288 (ABS) \n\n\nPosted on January 4, 2014January 9, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nBoon Siew Honda Sdn Bhd raised the bar in the medium capacity scooter segment with introduction of the ultra modern NSS300 – a sleekly styled, easy ride daily commuter that blends agile performance with excellent comfort and value.\nSince the NSS300 made its world debut 13 years ago, it has evolved to exceed riders’ expectations about what a scooter can be. Veteran riders looking for a practical but sporty ride and younger riders who want to upgrade from a 150cc machine will find the NSS300 a refreshing choice that delivers in every aspect.  \n\nThis sporty sit-in scooter is designed to fit seamlessly into people’s daily lives, not only for commuting but also touring or sportier riding. Its slim dimensions and sleek fairing make for easy filtering through urban traffic and slotting into bike parking bays, yet spacious enough to accommodate two people in comfort.\nThe NSS300 is powered by a potent 279cc liquid cooled SOHC 4-stroke engine that delivers maximum power of 19kW at 7,500rpm and maximum torque of 26Nm at 5,000rpm. An automatic centrifugal clutch works in tandem with V-Matic transmission to deliver responsive power for the highway and instant acceleration around town even with a pillion rider. Using a highly efficient Programmed – Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system, the NSS300 is able to cover 354km from its 11.6L fuel tank, with excellent fuel efficiency of 30.8km/liter (WMTC mode). It is also good to know that the Euro 3 standard compliant engine contributes to reduction of CO2 emission that causes the greenhouse effect.\n\nThe chassis of NSS300 is constructed from an extremely strong and durable tubular steel underbone frame that provides confident handling in all conditions. Designed using Computer Aided Engineering (CAE), the underbone frame is rigid yet flexible enough to allow a certain degree of yield, which enables it to better respond to changes on the road. Ideal dimensions of 2,166(L) x 753(W) x 1,189mm(H) with a low seat height of 716mm make the NSS300 very easy to manage and navigate through tight traffic.\nThe impressive performance of NSS300 is matched with an equally efficient Combined Braking System (CBS) and front-rear discs that work to ensure peace of mind in a fast-stop situation. Similarly, comfort level is enhanced for a more reassuring ride with the use of 35mm telescopic forks, twin rear shock absorbers and double-sided aluminium swingarm.\nLooking and feeling good on the road are a key aspect of NSS300 ownership. It’s hard not to be drawn in by NSS300’s contemporary profile, sleek fairing with its twin halogen headlights frontage. Riders will also appreciate the practicality of a comprehensive metering cluster which features a speedometer, clock, dual trip-meters plus fuel and temperature gauges and oil level warning light.\nSpace is another plus-point that separates NSS300 from the ordinary. A large storage compartment can be opened, closed and locked with just the flick of a switch to accommodate two full-face helmets. Paired with dual fairing pockets to stow away smaller items, a 12V power socket for optional accessories, and the ID chip based theft deterrence HISS (Honda Ignition Security System). In essence, NSS300 is about sporty performance and safety, excellent build quality combined with value for money and durability, all rolled up in a stylish package that appeals to both novice and veteran riders alike.\nIntroduction sales price for the new NSS300 is RM26,768 (Standard version) and RM28,288 (ABS Version), with a manufacturing warranty of 2 years or 20,000km, whichever comes first. Available in three colour options of Asteroid Black Metallic, Pearl Himalayas White and Seal Silver Metallic.\n\nText and Images: Boon Siew Honda: http://www.boonsiewhonda.com.my/english/product-NSS300.html\nEditor’s Note: This model is the same with Honda Forza released in Thailand.\nAdvertisements",

Suzuki Ecstar MotoGP team piloted by Aleix Espargaro and Maverick Vinales inspire this livery. Blue is the iconic colour for Suzuki and this one really stands out.\nThe overall livery is in Suzuki blue colour and matched with a slight red on the bottom of the bike. There is also some attention given to the wheels with the application of the rim lining colour which we can relate to the Bridgestone style of differentiating the type of the tyre used in the race whether dry, intermediate or wet.  \n\nThere is also one more model that is given the MotoGp treatment that is the Suzuki Satria F150 (or Suzuki Belang R150 in Malaysia).

The trio are RC125, RC200 and RC390. The subject of this bike is to make it more track friendly and appeal to younger rider that are starting to learn to ride track bikes. Personally, I like the double headlight cluster that is enclosed in elongated frame that looks very different that what we always see. This might be the iconic look for KTM super sports bike for years to come as what BMW have done with the squinty headlight of the S1000RR.\nYou might already know the nice features of this bike that include steeper steering angle and more forward riding position. The wheelbase are much shorter for that ‘flickability’ manner. It retains the rigid Trellis frame from the Duke base model. Seeing this bike on the road will surely turns some heads around since the style is really noticable and spark a chat between rider and onlookers. Just enjoy the high resolution gallery after the jump and enjoy the sleepless night thinking of this bike:  KTM RC125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKTM RC200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKTM RC390\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nKTM RC125, RC200 and RC390 with Power Parts installed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial words from KTM:\n\nAfter successfully entering the Moto3 World Championship, where KTM won the title in its first year and once again dominated the current season; and after launching the official MY 2014 cup bike for the “ADAC Junior Cup powered by KTM”, it is now only logical for KTM to offer street legal sport bikes that benefit from the track racing experience, taking GP fascination to the streets. 2014 will already see three such KTM models that look as if they had escaped straight from the MotoGP pit lane: the RC 125, RC 200 and RC 390. The prime development directive for the new RC range was to build appealing, top quality sport motorbikes that radiate ample excitement with their racing concept and design, their cutting edge features and their aggressive performance while at the same time distinguishing themselves with the best possible rideability, great reliability, reasonable pricing and easy maintenance. The result: three uncompromising, fully faired racers, each of which is only identifiable as a street-legal bike by its cool dual headlights and rear view mirrors with integral indicators.\nRC = FULL SIZE RACING FORMAT \nWith the new RC models, KTM not only launches a new motorcycle concept for young sport riders and the young-at-heart, but also a re-interpretation of what actually constitutes a fully-fledged super sport bike, irrespective of displacement. All three models deliver a superior power-to-weight ratio, peerless agility and extreme banking clearance, and all three are distinguished by top quality high tech components. They are powered by the same highly developed, powerful and reliable DOHC singles as the Duke models 125, 200 and 390. However, similarities end at the frame. Combining precise handling with perfect stability at any speed, the ultra-lightweight geodesic of robot welded steel sections may remind some of the Duke models. However, the extremely rigid trellis frame has a significantly different geometry in order to do justice to the demands on ergonomics and riding dynamics of a true racer. A steeper steering head, less trail and a shorter wheelbase make the RC models even more agile and truly track worthy. Compared to the Duke models, less suspension travel and a more aggressive suspension set-up underscore these virtues. At 43 mm, the amply sized WP Suspension USD front forks have the same tube diameter as those of the KTM Superbike 1190 RC8 R – this is genuine racing equipment, ensuring maximum stability and precision. Developed in cooperation with Brembo, the braking system includes a 300mm front brake disc as well as standard ABS for the RC 125 and RC 390 – an equipment level unparalleled in this segment for maximum safety. Even the tires offer true, full size racing dimensions at 110/70ZR17 front and 150/60ZR17 rear.\nRC = UNCOMPROMISING RACING SPIRIT \nThe compact, three-chambered silencer of RC 125, 200 and 390 not only makes for some raucous racing sound but is also positioned beneath the engine close to the bike’s centre of gravity. This design trick contributes to centralise the masses, supporting the incomparable agility of the RC models. The racing bodywork, the narrow, flat tank and the clip-ons mounted below the upper triple clamp give the rider full mobility for commited track riding. The fully equipped multi-functional cockpit not only informs about a multitude of parameters, all the way down to average fuel consumption and remaining range, but also supports riders on the hunt for new personal bests with an adjustable shift light. The aerodynamic fairing removes the wind pressure from chest and arms, lowers helmet turbulence in a sporty riding position and ensures maximum top speed. And at the same time, thanks to the inimitable style of designer legend Gerald Kiska and the sporty graphics, the fairing tells everyone at the first glance that the RC 125, 200 and 390 are genuine super sport bikes.\n\nAdvertisements",

He completed Race 1 in 30’03.480s in a grueling wheel-to-wheel battle with Spaniard, Aron Canet who took the chequered flag in 30’03.397s while Italian, Nicola Bulega completed the podium steps in 30’.05.162s.  \nKhairul was hoping Race 2 would finally see him secure a victory in the closely fought Moto3 series but a waning bike in the closing stages of the 16-lap race forced him to settle for third with 30’08.601s, behind Joan Mir and Aron Canet who timed 30’07.546s and 30’07.618s respectively.\nAlthough slightly disappointed, the 16-year old was still pleased with his performance that saw him increase his point haul in the overall standings to 63 points, 23 points adrift Aron Canet.\n“I’m very happy with the race this weekend and many thanks to the team and engineers who have worked extremely hard to set up of the bike. I had a good start in Race 1 and was able to stick with Canet throughout the race but I made an error in the dying moments and finished second.\n“Race 2 was a bit more unfortunate as I got caught up in traffic and had to push really hard to chase the leaders. But once I caught up to them, my tyres had already worn out, making it really hard to control the bike. Rather than take risks, I played it safe and maintained my position to finish third.”\nRound 4 of the Moto3 Junior World Championship will take place in Motorland Aragon (Spain), July 5.\nResults\nRace 1\n1.Aron Canet (ESP) 30’03.397s\n2.Khairul Idham Pawi (MAS) 30’03.480s\n3.Nicola Bulega (ITA) 30’05.162s\n4.Albert Arenas (ESP) 30’05.391s\n5.Lorenzo Dalla Porta (ITA) 30’05.454s\n \nRace 2\n1.Joan Mir (ESP) 30’07.546s\n2.Aron Canet (ESP) 30’07.618s\n3.Khairul Idham Pawi (MAS) 30’08.601s\n4.Nicola Bulega (ITA) 30’15.175s\n5.Albert Arenas (ESP) 30’15.236s\n \nOverall Standings\n1.Aron Canet (ESP) 90 points\n2.Khairul Idham Pawi (MAS) 63 points\n3.Nicola Bulega (ITA) 55 points\n4.Joan Mir (SPA) 50  points\n5.Bo Bendsneyder (NED) 48 points\nAdvertisements",

        "Yamaha\nyamaha history \n\nHistory Of Yamaha Corporation (How Yamaha Started Making Good Motorcycles) \n\n\nPosted on March 25, 2008 by eddy \n\n\nYamaha was founded in 1887 as a piano and reed organ manufacturer by Torakusu Yamaha as Nippon Gakki Company, Limited (日本楽器製造株式会社, Nippon Gakki Seizō Kabushiki Gaisha) in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka prefecture, and was incorporated on October 12, 1897. The company’s origins as a musical instrument manufacturer is still reflected today in the group’s logo — a trio of interlocking tuning forks.[3]\nAfter World War II, company president Genichi Kawakami repurposed the remains of the company’s war-time production machinery and the company’s expertise in metallurgical technologies to the manufacture of motorcycles. The YA-1 (aka Akatombo, the “Red Dragonfly”), of which 125 were built in the first year of production (1954), was named in honor of the founder. It was a 125cc, single cylinder, two-stroke, streetbike patterned after the German DKW RT125 (which the British munitions firm, BSA, had also copied in the post-war era and manufactured as the Bantam and Harley-Davidson as the Hummer). In 1955, the success of the YA-1 resulted in the founding of the Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd.\nYamaha has grown to become the world’s largest manufacturer of musical instruments (including Pianos,“silent” pianos, drums, guitars, violins, violas, celli, and vibraphones), as well as a leading manufacturer of semiconductors, Audio/Visual, computer related products, sporting goods, home appliances and furniture, specialty metals, machine tools, and Industrial robots.\nIn October 1987, on its 100th anniversary, the name was changed to The Yamaha Corporation.\nIn 1989, Yamaha shipped the world’s first CD recorder. Since then, Yamaha has purchased Sequential Circuits in 1988 and bought a significant share (51%) of competitor Korg in 1989–1993.\nIt acquired German Audio Software manufacturers Steinberg in 2004, from Pinnacle Systems.\nIn July, 2007, Yamaha bought out the minority shareholding of the Kemble family in Yamaha-Kemble Music (UK) Ltd, Yamaha’s UK import and musical instrument and professional audio equipment sales arm, the company being renamed Yamaha Music U.K. Ltd in autumn 2007.[1] Kemble & Co. Ltd, the UK piano sales & manufacturing arm was unaffected.[2]\nOn December 20, 2007, Yamaha made an agreement with the Austrian Bank BAWAG P.S.K. Group BAWAG to purchase all the shares of Bösendorfer[3], intended to take place in early 2008. Yamaha intends to continue manufacturing at the Bösendorfer facilities in Austria.[4]The acquisition of Bösendorfer was announced after the NAMM Show in Los Angeles, on 28 January 2008. As of February 1, 2008, Bösendorfer Klavierfabrik GmbH operates as a subsidiary of Yamaha Corp.[5]\nYamaha Corporation is also widely known for their music program that began in the 1980s.\nOther companies in the Yamaha group include:\n\nBösendorfer Klavierfabrik GmbH, Vienna, Austria.\nYamaha Motor Company\nYamaha Fine Technologies Co., Ltd.\nYamaha Livingtec Corporation\nYamaha Metanix Corporation\nYamaha Pro Audio\n\n\nYamaha Motor Company Limited (ヤマハ発動機株式会社, Yamaha Hatsudōki Kabushiki-gaisha) (TYO: 7272), a Japanese motorized vehicle-producing company (whose HQ is at 2500 Shingai, Iwata, Shizuoka), is part of the Yamaha Corporation. After expanding Yamaha Corporation into the world’s biggest piano maker, then Yamaha CEO Genichi Kawakami took Yamaha into the field of motorized vehicles on July 1, 1955. The company’s intensive research into metal alloys for use in acoustic pianos had given Yamaha wide knowledge of the making of lightweight, yet sturdy and reliable metal constructions. This knowledge was easily applied to the making of metal frames and motor parts for motorcycles. Yamaha Motor is the world’s second largest producer of motorcycles. It also produces many other motorized vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles, boats, snowmobiles, outboard motors, and personal watercraft.\nIn 2000, Toyota and Yamaha Corporation made a capital alliance where Toyota paid Yamaha Corporation 10.5 billion yen for a 5 per cent share in Yamaha Motor Company while Yamaha and Yamaha Motor each bought 500,000 shares of Toyota stock in return.\n[Source: Wikipedia]\nAdvertisements",

Displaying his trademark efficiency the nine-time world champion made short work of the opening laps, passing Andrea Dovizioso, Stefan Bradl and finally Cal Crutchlow for fourth in turn seven. Rossi then began to close down Andrea Iannone and looked confident of scoring a podium finish until a sudden loss of grip on the right side of the front tyre left him unable to keep his pace, dropping him to eighth which he held to the line.\nTeammate Jorge Lorenzo experienced his second Grand Prix weekend to forget today, making a jump start at the beginning of the race and receiving a ride-through penalty as a result. He pitted immediately at the end of the opening lap and re-joined at the back of the field in 23rd. The four-time world champion then showed his dedication and professionalism, working hard to move back through the pack to earn his first championship points of the season. As he crossed the finish line he did so in tenth position, less than four seconds from Rossi in eighth.\nThe eighth place finish gains Rossi a further eight points to give a total of 28, dropping him to third on the overall standings. Lorenzo’s tenth place earns his first championship points of the season, putting him in 16th with six points.   \nThe Monster Yamaha Tech3 Team riders today finished round 2 of the MotoGP World Championship in a highly determined manner, with both riders achieving their best ever results in the premier class. Bradley Smith finished in 5th position after narrowly missing out on a debut podium, with rookie Pol Espargaro crossing the line in 6th to claim his first MotoGP points and as the quickest rookie.\nBradley Smith delivered a fierce campaign to challenge for a podium position, before guiding his Yamaha YZR-M1 home in what was his best ever MotoGP result. After having qualified in 8th, the British rider dropped back a place during the first lap, but soon set into a smooth rhythm and proceeded to move up the field, progressing up to 7th a few laps later. He then closed in on the Factory Yamaha of Valentino Rossi before passing him quickly. On lap 14 the young British rider overtook his teammate and swiftly caught the 5th placed rider three laps later, before hunting down the remaining competitors to challenge for the final podium position. Smith rode tirelessly to reach them, and then exchanged forceful moves with Stefan Bradl right down to the chequered flag fighting for 4th position. Even though the battle didn’t come to a lucky end, on what was once again a difficult racetrack for all the Yamaha bikes, Smith brilliantly showed his progression, finishing as the top Yamaha on the timesheets.\nRookie Pol Espargaro successfully clinched his maiden points scoring finish today at COTA, and completed the race as the fastest rookie by finishing in a highly impressive 6th position. The Reigning Moto2 World Champion had a positive start, and moved forward to 10th on the first lap. Espargaro skilfully forged ahead and continued to battle remaining with teammate Bradley Smith as they moved up the field. On lap ten, the Spanish rookie brilliantly overtook multiple world champion Valentino Rossi. Espargaro finally completed his impressive point scoring race by taking 6th place on the final lap.\nThe NGM Forward Racing Team leaves Texas with Aleix Espargaro finishing 9th overall and first open. After the great result scored yesterday in qualifying, Aleix struggled to make a good start, losing contact with the front group. He had issues with chattering and preferred to be a bit conservative to finish the race and get some good points. The result puts him 5th in the championship with 20 points.\nIt was an unlucky day for Colin Edwards who expected to get another result in his home grand prix. As with his teammate, Colin struggled a lot during the race and when there were 4 laps to go his bike stopped, obliging him to retire. With today’s retirement, Colin is 14th in the rider Championship.\nThe championship stays outside of Europe for round three, moving south for the Gran Premio de la República Argentina on 27th April.\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – 8th, +45.519\n“We destroyed the front tyre completely on the right side. I had the same problem during the weekend but less than this. This morning we made a good step and with a used tyre I could do all the warm up so we were quite positive. Unfortunately after seven or eight laps the front was gone and I had to go three seconds slower. It’s a pity because we could do another podium which was the target here in Austin, unfortunately it wasn’t to be.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – 10th, +49.111\n“I wasn’t thinking and was distracted and I made a big mistake in the start. I just tried to push at the maximum afterwards to get the best result but the race was almost over for me. I want to say sorry to the team as I destroyed my race, but at least I didn’t crash because it was a difficult situation with the tension and it was easy to make a mistake and get injured. The good thing is that I finished the race and got my first points in the championship but clearly it wasn’t our weekend.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Movistar Yamaha MotoGP Team Director\n“Unfortunately Valentino completely destroyed the right side of his front tyre after a few laps. We had suffered already this weekend with this and made some changes to the set up, this morning we could do 16 laps with the tyre still looking good so we thought the problem was solved. It’s a shame because as a result we lost the podium here in Texas, where we knew from the beginning it was going to be a tough race. As for Jorge, no matter how hard you prepare for a race weekend there are some things that cannot be anticipated. We all know he is one of the hardest working riders here and very rarely makes a mistake. He did a good job to make the best of it afterwards. I want to thank all the team for another weekend spent working extremely hard to overcome challenges and make a competitive bike for the race, we are looking forward to Argentina to come back even stronger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith – 5th, +22.963\n“I am very pleased with my performance during the 21 laps with this being the most physical track on the calendar in my opinion. I made it hard work for myself. It’s difficult to get a perfect setting around here as there are so many different corners, and it is impossible to make one setting which suits all of them. You have to make the best compromise. I was a bit too aggressive during the first laps, and overheated my brakes and the front tyre got really warm. So rather than risking anything, I let them recover, which took me 3 or 4 laps. I saw Pol come past me and then Valentino getting away, so I just had to take a breath. Once the tyres had stabilised, I started moving forward. I then thought either the bike is going to come to me or I am just going to have to sit where I am. With 12 laps to go, I realised that I had a chance and put my head down. I got to Bradl and gave everything I could, and when I reached those left right left corners, where I tried to go underneath him, my heart rate just went through the roof. I put all my cards on the table, as I knew that Dovizioso was edging away, but I am still really pleased to be the top Yamaha”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPol Espargaro – 6th, +26.567\n“I’m truly happy with today’s result; to finish my first MotoGP race in sixth position and in front of the Factory Yamahas makes me quite proud. I knew that I had to push as much as possible at the beginning, as I didn’t want to lose contact with the guys in front of me. I probably pushed a little too much and I could not keep the rhythm until the end of the race. But I’m happy that I was able to battle with my teammate during a certain stage of the race because Bradley is going really fast this season. Being the second Yamaha means we have not done a bad job at all. The biggest problem during the race has been the front tyre and I think all of the Yamaha’s struggled with it. We knew already from last year’s race that it would not have been an easy track for our bike. I can physically feel that it has been a very demanding race, the MotoGP bikes are exhausting. I have some pain in my shoulder because of the high number of left corners and especially during braking towards the end of the race. The team did a great job and I’m really giving it my all to learn and improve as quickly as possible. I’m already looking forward to the next round in Argentina in a couple of weeks”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAleix Espargaro – 9th, +47.605\n“This morning we struggled a lot due to the front chattering and it happened the same in the race. I couldn’t push. I had to be a bit conservative, focusing on finishing the race and getting some points. It was very frustrating but it was impossible for me to push more today. Anyway I’m confident for the next gp and I look forward to race in Argentina.”\n\n\n\n\nColin Edwards – DNF\n“We struggled the whole weekend and I also had an issue with my front tyre, that made my race even more complicated. With 4 laps to go, I had problems with the fuel pressure and my bike stopped, when I was in the back straight. My race was over. Now we will try to understand what happened.”\nAdvertisements",

        "engine oil\nshell \n\nShell Advance Ultra with PurePlus technology unveiled in Sepang, Malaysia – first motorcycle oil made from natural gas – available in Jan 2015 \n\n\nPosted on October 24, 2014October 24, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nShell Malaysia Trading MD Tuan Haji Azman Ismail (3rd from left) with Shell Lubricants Global Marketing GM Andrew Hepher and Motorcycle Oil Tech Manager Leo Kin Mun at the new Shell Advance Ultra soft launch\nShell provided a sneak peek into the Shell PurePlus Technology that will soon be incorporated into the Shell Advance Ultra premium motorcycle oils. This technology produces a high quality base oil from natural gas, instead of crude oil, yielding superior performing lubricants. The combination of these base oils and advanced additive technology will produce Shell Advance Ultra premium motorcycle oils with improved performance benefits.\nShell PurePlus Technology is a revolutionary gas-to-liquid (GTL) process, developed over 40 years of research that converts natural gas into crystal-clear base oil with virtually none of the impurities found in crude oil. The base oil is produced at the Pearl GTL plant in Qatar, a partnership between Shell and Qatar Petroleum, and the world’s largest source of GTL products today. GTL base oil provides enhanced viscosity, friction and volatility performance compared to more prominently used traditional base oils made from crude oil. Through the integration of the gas value chain in Qatar and Shell’s global Lubricants Supply Chain, Shell Advance Ultra with PurePlus Technology will be made available to motorcyclists in Malaysia from January 2015.  \nShell conducted a perception trial in Malaysia, which saw riders using different motorcycle bikes and engine capacities, riding through different Malaysian motorways, trunk roads and hilly terrains, to get initial reactions from opinion leaders on the use of the new Shell Advance Ultra motorcycle oil in their bikes. The most significant result was that at the end of the trial, 77% of riders[ A perception trial was conducted with a group of 13 bikers using the new Shell Advance with PurePlus Technology and Shell V-Power 97. Total mileage covered approximately 800km, routes included highways, trunk roads, hilly terrain, Multiple road bends and curves in Peninsular Malaysia\n] claim to experience smoother ride and more power with the combination of the new Shell Advance Ultra with PurePlus Technology and Shell V-Power 97.\nSome of the reactions from this trial included:\nThirty eight year-old Puon Swee Loong, owner of a 3-year old 800 cc Italian superbike, said “The bike feels brand new and it’s very obvious at full throttle. I have never experienced my bike stretching to 180km distance before the next refuel.”\nOwner of a 4-year old Austrian 1000cc superbike, Rossaedi Bin Hamid, said “I finally understand the importance of starting with a clean engine. Shell has helped me to remove residue thoroughly from the previous oil I was using so that my engine only contains this new Shell Advance Ultra, for a full-on experience!”\nZulkhibri bin Mohd Yusof, 40, who rides a 4-year old Japanese 650cc bike, said, “From first to second and third gear, the response was fast and clutch-changing was very smooth with this new Shell Advance Ultra with PurePlus Technology.”\nLeo Kin Mun, Shell’s Technology Manager for Shell Advance, said, “We are working very hard to deliver this technology in our Shell Advance Ultra range of motorcycle oils. Our customers can expect better performance benefits as well as our most advanced and latest lubricant technology in this premium product.”\n“There is a growing population of big capacity engine motorcycles in the country. With the new Shell Advance Ultra with PurePlus Technology, we have a first-of-its-kind lubricant with the potential to not only meet but also exceed the performance requirements of today’s high capacity and performance motorcycle engines,” Shell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd Managing Director Tuan Haji Azman Ismail said.\nThe 2015 season of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup will see Shell Advance Ultra made with this ground-breaking Shell PurePlus Technology being used in the racing motorcycles. Our drivers of the future will be riding their bikes with this premium motorcycle oil of the future.\nWatch this space to learn more about the product as Shell Advance Ultra with PurePlus Technology will be on sale in the Malaysian market from January 2015 with two viscosity grades 10W-40 and 15W-50. ENDS.\nShell PurePlus Technology\nShell has created an entirely new way to produce synthetic base oils, the main component of motor oil, from natural gas instead of crude oil via our patented Shell PurePlus Technology.\nBase oils are the key component of finished lubricants, making up on average of 75-90% of the end product and so this is a significant step-change in the industry.\nPearl GTL produces 140,000 barrels of liquid products per day and has the capacity to produce up to 1 million tonnes of base oil per year.\nPearl GTL is a fully integrated facility capturing the entire gas value chain – from offshore development and onshore gas processing to the conversion of gas to hydrocarbon liquids and the refining to finished products.\nOnce produced, the base oil from Pearl GTL is shipped to the Shell dedicated storage hubs in Houston, Hamburg and Hong Kong.\nFrom the hubs, GTL base oil is transported to a Shell lubricant oil blending plant. Shell has a global network of 50 lubricant oil blending plants.\nAt the Shell lubricant oil blending plants, the GTL base oil is blended with special chemical additives to produce cutting-edge finished motor oils and Shell will soon make motorcycle oils here as well. The motor oils are then packed and sent to the market.\nThe products reach end-consumers directly via retail outlets (general and motor shop shelves) or indirectly via dealer or independent vehicles workshops. Shell has a strong global distribution network of 150 distribution facilities and 2,000 distributors.\nShell Advance Ultra\nShell Advance Ultra provides Shell’s ultimate protection and performance for all modern motorbikes, whatever their engine size. It delivers excellent control with smooth gear changes, and a more enjoyable ride thanks to reduced noise and vibration. Its fully synthetic technology helps to prolong the life of your engine. Available in viscosity grades: SAE J 300 10W-40 and 15W-50. Both formulations meet: API SM and JASO MA2.\nPerception Trial:\nShell Malaysia Trading Sdn Bhd conducted a perception trial with a group of 13 bikers using the new Shell Advance with PurePlus Technology and Shell V-Power 97 over a fully-board 2 Day 1 Night riding trip with pre-determined route. Total mileage covered approximately 800km, routes included highways, trunk roads, hilly terrain, Multiple road bends and curves in Peninsular Malaysia. Bikes were of different make, model, engine capacity and bike age. Trial methodology includes perception of bikers upon using the new Shell Advance with PurePlus Technology. Existing engine oil was drained out before the trial commenced and engine was flushed two times with the new product. New product of biker’s preferred viscosity grade was filled into engine. An oil sample was collected from each bike for oil analysis right after change to the new product. The same set of parameters will be measured through the analyzing 0km and 5,000km oil samples – the changes will be able to support or not support another potential benefit/ marketing claims.\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\nExciter GP 150\nExciter RC 150\nYamaha \n\n2015 Yamaha Exciter 150 FI RC and GP Officially Unveiled in Vietnam – 15.4PS 150cc FI King of Street – VND45,450,00 (about RM7,354.90) \n\n\nPosted on December 18, 2014December 19, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Vietnam has unwraps the cover of the Exciter 150 RC / GP that comes with 150cc fuel-injection SOHC liquid-cooled engine that is the successor of the Yamaha Exciter 135 (135LC in Malaysia, Jupiter MX in Indonesia or T135 everywhere else). There is also a rumor that Indonesia will get this bike with the name Jupiter MX King. There are a lot of improvement of this Exciter RC 150 compared to the Exciter 135. \nThe first objective of this machine is to ‘boost the feeling of power’ and with that in mind the 135cc engine has been increased to 150cc in capacity to enables it to harness more power. It is also said that the project leader for this Exciter RC 150 is the same project leader who handles the Vixion (FZ150i) development project. Reducing power loss also taken into consideration here with the proven technology that is the DiASil cylinder use to minimise the friction. Also here to minimise the friction is the use of the roller rocker arm that are now being extensively in many small bikes.\n\nNot suprising to us, is the use of FI system to make sure fuel-efficiency for more milease and accurate fuel delivery in high speed for more power when in need.  The power rating of the Exciter RC 150 is 15.4PS @ 8,500RPM with the torque 13.9Nm @ 7,000 RPM. All these numbers beat the 1st generation Yamaha FZ150i which also 150cc FI bikes. \n\nWe can say that Exciter 150 FI is an all new bike as the chassis are also improved for more rigidity but still maintain the backbone or ‘underbone’ frame.\n\nWe have said earlier that the Exciter 150 FI wheelbase is looking longer than the Exciter 135 and yes, our prediction is correct as it is now measured at 1290mm, which is 45mm longer than Exciter 135 at 1255mm.\n\nThe front signal indicator are now separated from the fairing light and attached to the side panel which reminds me with the superbike indicator style.\n\nThe front fairing light are now much smaller but excellently executed which makes it looks sharp and dynamic. It also looks very much the same like the YZF-R25 front headlight. On the left of the fairing, there is the ‘150’ to show that this is the King of Street.\n\nRear indicator are separated as to follow the UNECE regulation. The rear brake light is LED and that can give a bright illumination in the night.\n\nThis one in the special model that is the Yamaha Exciter GP 150 that comes in iconic Yamaha Race-Blu colour with the Yamaha speed-block shape just like to one used in YZR-M1 in MotoGP.\n\nThe Exciter 150 FI meter is very nice with the digital and analog combination. You’ll get to see the gear indicator, analog tachometer, trip and of course the speedometer, in digital display. The fuel indicator is nicely integrated between the analog and the digital display which I think is brilliant design decision from Yamaha team.\n\nFrom the brochure here, we can see clearly that the bike is equipped with 1-piston caliper, but now it comes in bigger disc size that is at 245mm, which 25mm bigger than the Exciter 135 at only 220mm. The transmision is 5-speed for that sporty riding feel.\n\nMonoshock rear suspension are retained, but now the rear tyre is wider at 120/70-17, bigger than the Exciter 135 at 100/70-17, which for me is already big and wide tyre for a moped like this.\n\nThere are three colour choices for the Exciter RC 150 that is Yellow/Black, Red/Black and White/Orange combination. The one most riders will be interested to is the GP edition in Yamaha Race-Blu livery.\n\n2015 Yamaha Exciter RC 150 is VND44,990,000 or RM7,295.10 (direct conversion)\n2015 Yamaha Exciter GP 150 is VND45,450,000 or RM7,354.90 (direct conversion)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: tmcblog.com, 2banh.vn, Mus Mohd from FB and xe.tinhte.vn\nAdvertisements",

        "135cc\nair filter\nben spies\nBMC\ninfomercial\nparts\nracing parts\nsuperbike\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\nBMC Air Filters: The Made in Italy F1, MotoGP and WSBK Air Filter for Your Yamaha 135LC! \n\n\nPosted on June 14, 2011July 1, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nBMC High Performance Air Filter for Yamaha 135LC\n\nAs Motorcycle enthusiasts, we are always looking for different ways to improve the power output of our engines. One of the fastest and cheapest way to more horse power is to replace the restricted OEM Paper element Air filter with aftermarket ones. Many aftermarket companies now manufacture and offer high performance air filters. Most claim a power gain through increased airflow without compromising filtration. Air filters are designed to achieve high, virtually unrestricted airflows, while maintaining filtration levels critical to ensure long engine life.\nFIA GT\n \nBMC Air Filters \nLife is full of choices; there are so many different brands, different type of air filters available. You may opt for a free-flowing, low-restriction filter. But this decision usually means poor filtration ability, sacrificing clean air for horsepower. The downside may be shortened engine life due to dirt and grit getting into the engine.\nOr you may choose a filter that has very good cleaning capabilities but chokes out a few of those ponies you may have paid dearly to get. So what type of filter should you use? To better answer that question, you have to first understand the advantage and disadvantage to each option.\nWSBK 2010\nThere are a few different types of filtration elements among the air filters available off the shelves. They come in the form of Paper, Foam or Cotton Gauze.\nPaper\nPaper filters are generally used as OEM Air Filter because they are inexpensive and disposable. Due to its characteristics, good air-flow is sacrificed for good filtration and therefore as a whole is never consider for high performance application.\nFoam\nThey look very much like a sponge but are not as dense. These filters offer very good filtration and reasonable airflow. They are washable and are quite durable if reasonable care is used. The downside is that they can be damaged very easily and are prone to tearing if not handled with care.\nCotton Gauze\nCotton Gauze is generally regarded as the best material for air filters because of its excellent filtration and high airflow. This is because the “holes” in cotton are much looser than paper, giving high airflow, but because of characteristics such as interception; impaction, and diffusion, cotton fiber filters can block particles much smaller than the actual “holes.” High performance air filters use oiled layers of cotton gauze. Dust particles held suspended in the cotton gauze actually “becomes” part of the filter medium to all the more increase filtration without obstructing airflow to the engine, thereby outlasting paper filters in service life and performance. Although cotton filters are pricey, they can be cleaned and re-oiled at a long service interval.\nWSBK 2010\nBMC Air Filters are Made in Italy\n\nSince inception in 1973, Italian firm BMC was essentially a motorcycle accessories distributor. In 1995 BMC started producing his own air filters due to an inquiry of F1 air filters from Ferrari Team. BMC air filters are designed and produced by Italian Engineers, from racing air filters in F1, 24 Hour Le Mans to World Superbike Championship, BMC give you the highest performance to be used in extreme conditions. BMC air filters have proved to be the leading product in the category for its quality in material and construction.\nDrifting\nPerformance\nBMC air filters are designed and produced to ensure a higher air flow than original paper filters. BMC’s filtering material is composed of a special cotton gauze soaked with low-viscosity oil to give you the best air permeability, minimize the loss of air flow pressure passing through the air filter; this way ensures the best conditions for full exploitation of maximum power. They are made in a single piece with no welded joints in the corners, thus avoiding breakage or risk of leaks. Therefore, the benefits of replacing the original paper filter with a BMC cotton air filter in your motorcycles are evident.\nDesign and Materials\nQualified engineers using advanced software and expert technicians using the latest technologies produce the BMC air filters. A F.1 air filter, for example, must be very light, must be made of the best materials and must improve performance. For this reason, also for motorcycles filters we use only alloy mesh with epoxy coating to ensure protection from petrol fumes and from oxidization due to the humidity of the air. BMC incorporates parallel pleated cotton fabric and special filter oil to offer flow rates of up to 900 CFM. Let your Engine breath easier and faster with this top-of-the-line air filter from BMC.\nCarbon Racing Filter (CRF) for Yamaha YZF-R1 '09-'11\n\nBMC CRF\nThe “C.R.F.” Carbon Racing Filter is BMC’s new high performance sports air filter designed for road and competition vehicles. It features a 100% carbon fibre support structure with a cotton filter element.\nThe CRF has been designed and produced entirely by the BMC Racing and Advanced Composite Division, which is wholly concerned with the development of air filters and aspiration systems for the racing world: Formula 1 / MotoGP One / World Superbike.\nThe CRF has been created from extensive BMC knowledge acquired through more than 10 years experience in the racing sector, which has brought high level results and increased performance to super-sports engines.\nPrinciple characteristics of the CRF:\n\n\nThe CRF air filter makes use of innovative technical solutions to optimize the flow dynamics of the direct air into the engine. The geometry of the CRF has been devised with the objective of using the entire available volume of the standard air-box thanks to an extended filtration surface. The result is better air flow passage in the intake phase thereby maintaining constant air-box pressure.\nThe structure of the CRF is made of carbon fibre which interfaces directly with the original air-box, providing a perfect seal and easy mounting. The structure is manufactured with pre-impregnated carbon materials which are cured in an autoclave. Thanks to this the CRF air filter presents a much reduced total weight whilst having excellent characteristics in terms of rigidity and mechanical resistance.\nThe filtering element is made of a special multi-layer filtration material in RACE configuration which is impregnated with low viscosity oil held between epoxy-coated (to prevent oxidation) aluminium mesh. This enables increased permeability and low air flow resistance guaranteeing highly efficient filtration.\nThe CRF filter was conceived with the objective of withstanding the vibrations and heat produced in movement both in normal road and intensive track use.\nThe CRF filter, as are all BMC filters, can be regenerated and reused. Once the saturation level has been reached the filter can be regenerated through a process of washing and re-oiling using a special BMC kit.\nThe CRF air filter is a patented product with a deposited industrial model.\nThe CRF filter was created for those who require maximum return and performance from their motorbike. It is the definitive filter for those who look for:\n1) enhanced quality;\n2) technical development derived directly from the world of racing.\n\nAll this is available for the very first time as an aftermarket product.\n\nThis is the same branded air filters which Ben Spies uses. Namely they are a professional air filter manufacturer for big bikes but just for the Malaysian market, they have come out with a racing air filter for the Yamaha 135LC!\nThe price for the BMC Air Filter for Yamaha 135LC (FM624/04) is not cheap at RM248, but the official Malaysia distributor, QBEE Motor Group S/B (previously known as Yoshi Marketing) in collaboration with MotoMalaya are offering this at a discounted price for only  –> RM198! Until 31st July 2011 only. \nYou can order this directly by  sms/call 016-7211291 or email [email protected] to purchase the air filter. Please put in this quote: “I read MotoMalaya.com” to get this special price.\nTherefore, there isn’t really option to choose from, the choice is pretty much obvious.\nBMC Air Filter. If Ben Spies trusted it to campaign for WSBK championship, what about you?\nFor more info: http://www.bmcairfilters.com\nAdvertisements",

What more interesting that there is the tachometer that dominates the face of the meter. This make the EX5 looks serious for speed. You should know that there are some very fast EX5 Dream here. In Malaysia, I think Honda EX5 is one of the most modified bikes, so the introduction of this item is greatly appreciated.\nThere are very little info about this part and we don’t know whether it is readily available in the shop. The price is estimated at RM400 based on the price of the previous digital speedometer for 135LC.\nvia: Racing Boy FB\nAdvertisements",
        "1300cc\nFJR1300AE\nYamaha \n\n2014 Yamaha FJR1300AE \n\n\nPosted on October 5, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha has expanded its sophisticated long-distance tourer range for 2014 with the addition of the FJR1300AE. This new model, which sits between the FJR1300A and FJR1300AS in the range, offers riders an even greater overall motorcycling package as well as a superior ride quality thanks to Yamaha’s advanced electronically-adjustable suspension system. Debuted for 2013 on the FJR1300AS with its clutchless gear shift system, the FJR1300AE now makes this system available to customers who prefer to have a standard gear box system.  \nThe electronically-adjustable suspension system is designed to enable riders to vary the suspension’s performance to suit both the road’s surface and the load carrying requirements. With a choice of four main settings, the rider can be confident that no matter what the conditions, the Yamaha FJR1300AE will deliver the best possible set-up and ride quality.\nBy simply selecting an option via the easily located handlebar-mounted switch, the rider can select ‘One-Up’, ‘One-Up with Luggage’, ‘Two-Up’ or ‘Two-Up with Luggage’ suspension settings. The choice is then confirmed by a clear indication on the instrument panel. In addition to these four main settings, the system also offers the rider a choice of ‘Soft’, ‘Standard’ or ‘Hard’ damping for each setting, giving a total of 12 pre-defined suspension set-up options.\nFor even greater flexibility, settings can also be managed manually, allowing the rider to match the most precise setup requirements.\nAs the system is linked to both the front and rear suspension systems, any alteration is made in conjunction with the damping and preload on both front and rear systems and a balance is maintained to deliver smooth and consistent handling performance.\nIn order to fit the electronically-adjustable suspension to the bike, the FJR1300AE has new upside-down forks, updating not only the bike’s look but also its performance. The new forks contain independent damper mechanisms, splitting the compression and damping adjustment between fork legs. The compression damping mechanism is located within the left fork while the rebound damping is housed in the right fork – a system that is currently used on the Yamaha YZF-R1 as well as the Yamaha YZR-M1 MotoGP bike.\nSeparating out the damping forces between the fork legs is critical to the operation of the electronically-adjustable suspension as it allows the system to offer a wider and more accurate range of damping settings. The two distinct damping systems reduce the fluctuation in hydraulic pressure within the forks, helping to optimise the damping valve’s performance during hard and sustained use.\nWith the introduction of the 2014 FJR1300AE, Yamaha have further enhanced the long-distance capabilities of one of the most established sports tourers in Europe. Not only does the FJR1300AE come with class-leading engine and chassis performance combined with outstanding comfort levels, the electronically-adjustable suspension system significantly improves its already excellent ride quality.\nColours\nMagnetic Bronze\nMidnight Black\nRecommended Retail Price: £14,499 plus road fund and first reg. fees.\nAvailable: October in UK only.

        "800cc\nBMW\nF 800 R \n\n2011 BMW F 800 R featured in Korean King of Drama series \n\n\nPosted on January 5, 2014January 5, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nA vehicle can be much more desirable when it is featured in a popular culture such as a movie or a TV series. Take for example the Chevrolet Camaro that is featured in the Transformers movie. It has make the car memorable and desirable. It could the same to any motorcycle featured in any movie or TV series too.\nI have ‘accidently’ watched a Korean TV series, King of Drama, and suddenly stuck to the seat when I got to see the beautiful bike of the BMW make. I keep watching the bike to find what model the bike is and found out that it is BMW F 800 R. The headlight is unmistakenly BMW that shows one big right headlight and one small left headlight. This particular model from 2011 is ‘pure’ in terms of the design direction where it is still conventionally BMW.  \nIt got 798cc engine with parallel twin configuration 4-valve setup churning out 87hp at 8,000RPM and 86Nm of torque at 6,000RPM. This engine gives excellent pulling power and quick response with high fuel-efficiency to boot.\nCheck out the official words from BMW:\nSince its market launch in May 2009, the BMW F 800 R has provided impressive agility, sporty performance figures and light-footed handling combined with very low fuel consumption. In time for the start of 2012, the small BMW Motorrad roadster is to be given a visual makeover. Technically speaking, the new F 800 R will retain its well proven concept.\nThe engine is still the liquid-cooled parallel twin with 4-valve technology and a capacity of 798 cc. The highly distinctive engine provides impressive pulling power, a spontaneous response and a low level of fuel consumption. The engine output is 64 kW/87 bhp at 8000 rpm, producing a torque of 86 Nm at 6000 rpm.\nEven more than before, the sporty flair and agility of the BMW F 800 R is now reflected in its highly dynamic design. The front side trim sections have been redesigned. They also serve as radiator covers and are now finished in body colour, as are the front mudguards. What is more, the spring of the rear spring strut is finished in red to highlight the sporty character of this naked bike. The Sport windshield finished in body colour and the white direction indicators are now part of the standard equipment of the new F 800 R.\nThe new BMW F 800 R is available in three colour combinations. While Alpine white/Black satin gloss stands for uncompromising dynamic performance, Magma red/White aluminium metallic matt is sporty and provocative in style. Meanwhile Mineral silver metallic gives the new F 800 R a refined, technological touch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Headed by Mr Hua Heng, the company has grown to big shop since its inception in 1996. What is great about this shop is that they offer the latest and greatest bike whether in terms of superbike or underbones. For example, they have this Yamaha YZF-R6 WGP 50th Anniversary limited edition number 1350 out of 1500 production.  \n\nThe shop are cozy enough and their customer service is good. They took care of their customer really well. I spoke to Mr Hua Heng and he said that he always try to give the lowest price and lowest loan rates for their customers. No wonder his shop stands from 1996 until now and grown. There are interesting bike available at Berjaya Mega Motors. Few attracts my attention like the KTM Duke 200, Naza Blade 250 naked with very low price, Honda TransAlp, Yamaha T-Max 2012 Matte Black and 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R.

Some prefer the Belang and some prefer the 5-speed of 135LC. In my opinion, both of these bikes are great in their own way. There are many reasons a rider choose a specific bike, maybe it is because brand loyalty, fuel efficiency, styling, price and others. So, it is really up to you to choose which one you really like. Make your own research and get the best bike that you always wanted for. motomalaya.net\nThe reason why I did this comparison is because both of the bikes have nearly same specs with nearly same price.\nDiASil Cylinder\nFeatures of the technology\nThe DiASil Cylinder is an all-aluminum cylinder made possible by an exclusive Yamaha aluminum forging technology. Because it uses a 20% silicon aluminum alloy, it is possible to create a cylinder wall that is so hard and durable that it eliminates the need for a conventional steel cylinder sleeve. And, because the cylinder is all aluminum, it has excellent heat dissipation qualities and reduces engine weight at the same time. (Aluminum dissipates heat at 3.1 times the rate of steel.) The T135 is the first ASEAN market model and only the second Yamaha model of all to adopt this advanced technology, following the Japanese market model “Grand Majesty 250.”\nPAIR System\nReduces exhaust emission\nDOHC vs SOHC\nDOHC can provides better power but there is a lot more mechanical loss compare to SOHC since there is much more parts and weight to be moved by the crankshaft. The fewer parts of SOHC also provides lower maintainance cost.\nWritten by me with reference from:\n1. http://malaysianbikers.com.my/forum/index.php?topic=59043.385;wap2\n2. http://motomalaya.net/blog/2011/03/28/2011-yamaha-135lc-extreme-spirit-5-speed-brochure-in-high-resolution-1600px/2011-135lc-5-speed-brochure-4/\n3. http://www.yamaha-motor.co.jp/global/asean-touring/machine/\n4. http://motomalaya.net/blog/2010/07/01/2010-suzuki-belang-r150-technical-specifications/\nAdvertisements",

This craze has been taking over Malaysia and it is easy to find Street Cub like this anywhere in Malaysia. In fact, I also got to see one at my place in Banting. It is sure looking good.\nThe mods include the use of wide front and rear tyre to make it look like a chopper stance. The rear mudguard is shortened to expose more of the wide tyre.  \n\nThe handle is modified to use the design of the C50 which for now is absolutely rare. This make the bike looks retro enough and can bring childhood memories for those who have seen the C50 in their young ages. In my childhood, I only managed to ride my grandpa Honda C70 with the circle lamp (Honda C70 lampu bulat la tu).\n\nThis particular Street Cub is made single seater and this is reasonable since the tail has been cut short. A single seater bike is called egoistic bike since it carries one person per engine (I might be wrong here).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, I can say that this is one of the best looking mod style that I’ve ever seen so far.

        "250cc\n250SL\nKawasaki\nNinja RR\nNinja RR Mono \n\nRumors: 2014 Kawasaki 250SL (RR Mono) are coming to Malaysia this year – successor of KRR-ZX150? \n\n\nPosted on April 23, 2014April 23, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nA replacement for the Kawasaki Ninja KRR-ZX150 is needed as the UNECE regulation in 2014 has been implemented in Malaysia that makes the 2-stroke is no longer being able to be produced. A logical step that we can see is to replace the identical bike that can give about the same power of the 150cc 2-stroke bike. Kawasaki Ninja KRR-ZX150 can produce 29.6 hp which is a strong number for the 150cc lightweight 2-stroke bike.  \nMalaysia might be getting the Kawasaki Ninja 250SL (also known as RR Mono in Indonesia) as a replacement for the KRR-ZX150. Ninja 250SL is a fitting name for it which refer to Super Light, hence the shortform SL.  At 151kg curb mass, it is heavier than the KRR-ZX150 which only measured at 124.5kg. For a 250cc 4-stroke bike, it is unfair to compared with the 150cc 2-stroke since 2-stroke bike has fewer parts that reflects to the lower curb mass. So, comparing to the Ninja 250 2-cylinder, the Ninja 250SL is lighter as the Ninja 250 weighs at 172kg. That is also logical since the Ninja 250 is 2-cylinder which have more parts and being heavier. Still, if we even compared to the single-cylinder 250cc 4-stroke contender, the Honda CBR250R at 161kg, Ninja 250SL is 10kg lighter.\n\nThen, the next question that we are going to ask is, when will this Ninja 250SL going to be launch in Malaysia? Some says that June is the probable month for it, but that is too close. June is also the month for the WSBK in Malaysia and Kawasaki is a strong contender in WSBK. So, is it June? I’m thinking this year, but if it is June, that would be awesome.\nPrice? I don’t have any estimation for it yet, but if it is RM14,888, that just will eliminate all the competitors out there like the CBR250R (RM18,799 Standard) and even the Duke 200 (RM15,888 Non-ABS)\nAdvertisements",

That’s price can be considered an interesting price for a bike with 500cc from Honda. The previously launched 2013 Honda CBR600RR is around RM80-95k, which is quite expensive. This is still speculation about the price, but even if the street price of the CBR500R hits around RM39-40k, I would still consider it as interesting.

        "135cc\n135lc\n150cc\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\nYamaha 135LC is going to be 150cc and named Jupiter MX King in Indonesia? \n\n\nPosted on July 2, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nA hot news from TMCBlog has shown this decals of the rumored Jupiter MX King which is said to feature Jupiter MX 135cc engine base but upgraded to 150cc. However, it is not known this bike will be a moped like the current Jupiter MX, or naked like the Suzuki Belang R. In my opinion, since this is named the same as the Jupiter MX, it should be made to be like the moped style. This has been rumored for a very long time since the Jupiter MX engine (also known as the 135LC in Malaysia) have the same engine base as the Vixion (FZ150i).  \n\nThis news has come to the surface again since Indonesia is expecting to get a fuel-injection Jupiter MX, so if it is going to make the Jupiter MX FI, why not just use the Vixion engine common part? If the Jupiter MX King, Vixion and R15 all use the same engine base, this will make the mass production become larger and of course, lower the price of each engine made. The main difference for now is that the R15 uses 6-speed transmission as compared to the Jupiter MX and Vixion which only uses 5-speed transmission. For a moped that have a 150cc engine, it could be the only bike you need as it is practical and high performance. And that includes fuel-efficiency too since it is fuel-injection bike.\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2014/07/01/bener-kan-jupiter-mx-akan-150-cc-namanya-jupiter-mx-king-150/ and http://viewiewhite.wordpress.com/2014/07/01/hoott-info-next-jupiter-mx-150cc-ternyata-bukan-hoax-dan-di-beri-nama-jupiter-mx-king/\nAdvertisements",

        "1200cc\n1299 Panigale\n1300cc\nducati\nMultistrada 1200 \n\n2015 Ducati 1299 Panigale (205hp 166.5kg) and Multistrada 1200 (DVT engine) unveiled in EICMA, Milan – \n\n\nPosted on November 4, 2014November 4, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n2015 Ducati 1299 Panigale S\n\n\nThe 2015 Ducati Superbike family presents a major new player in the category: the 1299 Panigale. The latest arrival at the Bologna-based firm, with its 1285 cm3 Superquadro engine, raises the standards once again in terms of performance for supersports bikes on the international market. Thanks to an incredible torque of 144.6 Nm at 8,750 rpm, a dry weight of 166.5 kg, a maximum power of 205 hp at 10,500 rpm and a record-breaking power-to-weight ratio that puts its ahead of all competing road bikes, the 1299 Panigale is now the new benchmark for ultra-high performance bikes.\n\nThe new electronic package, specifically designed for the 1299 Panigale and incorporated in the three different Riding Modes, boosts performance even higher. Thanks to the presence of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), riders can count on Cornering ABS, along with Ducati Wheelie Control (DWC) and, on the S version, the Öhlins Smart EC, an event-based suspension control system. Moreover, the 1299 Panigale features, for the first time on a road-legal Ducati Superbike, the Ducati Quick Shift (DQS), now usable for down-changing too: this sharpens track performance even further while making the bike easier to use on a daily basis. On the 1299 Panigale, Ducati Traction Control (DTC), Ducati Wheelie Control (DWC) and Engine Brake Control (EBC) are all optimised thanks to an automatic tyre size and final drive ratio calibration system.\n\n\n\n2015 Ducati Multistrada 1200S – DVT engine equipped\n\n\nIt’s also a World Première for the new generation of Multistrada 1200 bikes, featuring the latest Ducati Testastretta DVT (Desmodromic Variable Timing) engine. In what is a first for the motorcycle industry, the DVT engine features a variable valve timing system with independent control of both the intake and exhaust camshafts. This optimises engine performance throughout the power range in all riding conditions, ensuring maximum power at high revs, smooth power delivery, punchy low-rpm torque and low fuel consumption in full compliance with the latest Euro 4 regulations.\nCompletely new, the Multistrada 1200 is technologically cutting-edge thanks also to the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) which dynamically measures roll, yaw and pitch angles as well as their rates of change, thus ensuring performance and safety standards that are unprecedented on a motorcycle. The presence of the IMU leads to substantial improvements in the operation of the ABS system, making it a ‘Cornering’ system capable of controlling braking even on bends where wheel lock could otherwise cause skidding with the bike leaned-over. The IMU platform also enables control of the Ducati Cornering Lights (DCL) housed in the Multistrada 1200’s full LED headlamp, a system in which an additional LED illuminates the inside of the bend to enhance night-time visibility. Moreover, the IMU allows the introduction of Ducati Wheelie Control (DWC): this detects and corrects any front wheel lift to ensure maximum acceleration and grip in complete safety.\nAll models now feature Electronic Cruise Control, which the rider can set as desired using controls incorporated in the switchgear on the left handlebar. On the S version a Bluetooth module is included as standard: via the Ducati Multimedia System, this allows the bike to be connected to a smartphone for easy multimedia control of key functions (e.g. receiving incoming calls, notification of text messages, or playing music) via the handlebar controls and colour TFT dashboard. Thanks to an iOS/Android app, the Bluetooth connection lets riders use bike data to activate other functions which enhance, extend or let them share their everyday riding or touring experiences via interaction with the ducati.com website and social networks.\n\nFor 2015, Ducati also wanted to take the exclusiveness concept that forms the backbone of the Diavel project and raise it to a whole new level. Titanium, carbon, craftsmanship, finishing touches of outstanding quality, a near-manic attention to detail, dedicated design, a limited edition of just 500 bikes: these are the core features of the latest addition to the Diavel family, the Diavel Titanium.\n\nThe Ducati 2015 World Première also saw an appearance by the two official MotoGP 2015 flag bearers,Andrea Dovizioso and Andrea Iannone, just ahead of their last race of the MotoGP 2014 season in Valencia on Sunday 9 November. After achieving pole position in Japan, taking numerous podium places and significantly cutting end-of-race gaps, the 2014 season can be seen as a highly positive one that augers well for 2015. In the coming year the team, headed by Luigi Dall’Igna, will be competing in MotoGP – a championship that remains central to Ducati’s strategy – with an all-new bike that is the result of this season’s incessant work and investment.\n \nIn addition to the new bikes presented by Ducati, 2015 also promises a host of new accessories, special parts and a new apparel collection, which includes both high-grade technical clothing items and the eye-catching apparel and accessory collection dedicated to the Scrambler world; the latter was presented at the W.P. Store showroom in Milan with a special event that saw press, public and enthusiasts flock to the highly original, fun-packed Scrambler Ducati “Land of Joy”.\nAdvertisements",

The data has been collected on all collisions and the impact distribution of the injury to the helmet. As you can see in the picture above, there is 19.4% of injury occurs at right side of the chin area and another 15.2% on the left side of the chin area. Combining these two numbers, it measured at 34.6% which is a large number compared to the rest of the location of the impact.\nNHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) also have researched about the use of helmets that can reduce the  risk of head injury by 69%. Without the helmet, riders are more prone to get brain injury which cost 13 times more to treat compared to the non-brain injury treatment.\nWearing helmets will not give negative effect to the health. Riders can still hears and see well. In fact, a good helmet can cut the noise from the surrounding for the extra care for the rider ear.  \n\nI think that is a good introduction of head safety in riding that I think I should tell you all. I just got my AGV Sun and Moon full-face helmet for RM700. Yes, that is quite expensive, but your life is more than that.\nNow, it is time to get your first full-face if you haven’t got one yet.\nvia: http://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/mc/guide/prevention.html\nnotified by: MotoCorsa\nAdvertisements",
        "shell\nShell Advance Asia Talent Cup \n\nShell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 – Drama in Sepang, Fakhrusy Rustam manages to get 3rd place \n\n\nPosted on August 2, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nFakhrusy Rostam takes second podium finish for Team Malaysia after dramatic Race 2 of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 Round 3 in Sepang.\nAs Race 2 of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 Round 3 unfolded in the Sepang International Circuit (SIC), it was hard to guess how the race would fare. Unlike yesterday, the Japanese brigade of riders got off to a strong start, but a red flag midway through the race and a last lap incident brought out several upsets.  \n\nAt the start, Japanese riders Ayumu Sasaki, Ai Ogura, Kazuki Masaki and Ryusei Yamanaka stormed ahead, with Thai rider ‘Chip’ Nakarin Atiratphuvapat not far in tow. Also in the lead group were Malaysian Adam Norrodin, Fakhrusy Rostam, and Shafiq Rasol. Despite being bumped down the order, the Malaysian trio kept on fighting to stay with the lead group.\nThe first incident came after just 10 minutes into the session when Chinese rider Yuanhang Chen high-sided out of Turn 6. Soon after, Chen’s fellow countryman Pengyuan Chen suffered the same fate in Turn 15, forcing official to red flag the session after completing just seven of the scheduled 13 laps. The race would resume soon after debris and injured riders were cleared off the circuit, with just five laps left to compete.\nLittle did many know, the remaining five laps would become one of the most dramatic moments in the series’ history. Again, the Japanese brigade got off to a good start here, but hot on their heels were the Malaysian riders plus Indonesian rider Andi Izdihar. Malaysian rider Adam Norrodin lost control of his bike whilst under heavy braking into Turn 1, taking out fellow countryman and rookie Azroy Anuar plus izdihar out of contention. This was a huge blow to Adam after taking second place in yesterday’s Race 1.\nFor the next four laps, the battle raged on between Sasaki, Masaki, Takuma Kunimine, and Chip Nakarin in the lead group whilst Malaysians Fakhrusy Rostam and Shafiq Rasol was battling Yuta Date and Gerry Salim in the second pack.\nDrama again struck in Sepang’s infamous final hairpin turn on the final lap when riders Kazuki Masaki and Ayumu Sasaki collided whilst challenging for the lead. This then allowed room for Chip Nakarin and Takuma Kunimine, who were battling each other for positions three and four, the room to advance up the order, but it was Thai sensation Chip Nakarin that had the advantage through the corner exit, and was first to claim the chequered flag ahead of Kunimine in second place.\nMalaysian Fakhrusy Rostam, who was running in fifth position, also took advantage of this, and crossed the line in third. In the process, Fakhrusy recorded his first podium finish and career best finish record simultaneously. It also brought Malaysia’s podium finish count up to two whilst racing on home soil this weekend.\n“Today’s race was indeed tougher than yesterday’s, and I struggled quite a bit. But in the last part, I managed to create a gap ahead of Shafiq Rasol down the back straight. Then, when I saw Sasaki and Masaki’s collision from afar, I knew I just had to keep it steady,” explained the towering Pasir Gudang native shortly after the race. Though it was a hard race for him, Fakhrusy was indeed delighted and elated with the podium finish.\nAs the weekend concludes here in Sepang, Ayumu Sasaki still leads the championship standings with his total score of 101 points so far. However, Chip Nakarin has also scored major points over the weekend, with his second win elevating him up to second place in the standings after collecting 82 points in total. Takuma Kunimine ranks third with 78 points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Malaysians are in the top 10 for now, starting with Adam Norrodin in eighth and Shafiq Rasol in ninth, both sharing the same score of 46 points. Helmi Azman ranks tenth with 43 points in total.\nRound 4 of the Shell Advance Asia Talent Cup 2015 will commence in China next month. The series will race in the Zhuhai International Circuit from Sept 18 to Sept 20. Stay tuned to our site for more updates.\nAdvertisements",

I have decided to DIY it since I think it can help me learn a lot about the bike and since I’m doing it myself, I know the service is being done with good care.\nThis is the step on how to change the oil and oil filter for 135LC ES 5-speed, after the jump  1. Look for the drain plug under the engine. The size is 19mm.\n2. Make sure you are using closed-type 19mm wrench to do the job. If you use, open-end wrench, you just might destroy the drain plug. Remember to put a container under the engine for the engine oil to flow out.\n3. The drain plug is connected to a filter with spring that will eject the drain plug straight to the container. Clean up this filter by using a fresh engine oil if there is some debris attached to it.\n4. Let the juice flow!\n5. Next up is to remove the oil filter. Remove the 3 nut attached to the oil filter cover. The size is 8mm. Again, make sure you are using close-type wrench.\n6. The good thing about DIY this is that you know you won’t be tricked by mechanic to change this nut to a non-original type.\n7. That is how you are going to hold the oil filter cover to remove it. Remove it slowly as it might drops to the floor and get scratched. I’m sure you don’t want that to happen.\n8. The oil filter can be inserted in one direction only, so, there will be no problem for you to fit it in again. Replace with new oil filter.\n9. No description needed\n10. Put back the oil filter cover on and carefully screw it tightly so that there won’t be any oil leaking from the oil filter cover after the engine is running.\n11. Put back the drain plug on. Observe the filter spring assembly. The rubber is on the top side.\n12. Screw it in tightly\n13. After the drain plug has been put on, then you can start pouring the fresh engine oil. Here I’m using Shell Advance AX7 10W-40 API SL Semi Synthetic. I’m only pour 900ml of the engine oil. The technical specification stated that it needs 1,100ml 1,000ml of engine oil with oil filter replaced (or 940ml only without filter change, thanks to Hasrul Hafiezan). I do this to make my engine feels lighter. DON’T TRY THIS TO YOUR BIKE if you are not sure what is the risk it might cause you. Anyway, I just might put the extra volume tomorrow.\n14. I also adds 50ml of X1R Small Engine Formula to my bike. The bike starts easier and it revs very easy. I’m going to try more of my bike tomorrow. I’ll update about the performance whether it is good or not. My engine oil is now at 900ml + 50ml = 950ml.\n15. Odometer reads 1,137km. An 137km late to service.\nI hope the post here helps to give you info and inspire you to do your servicing by yourself.\nThanks to Mr. Thanawi for his big help in this service work. He is the one who mostly do the work here.\nAdvertisements",

The material is made from plastic but by the way it looks, it is thick enough and can withstand the weather elements. The price is also affordable at less than RM80. For me, this is a better radiator guard as compared to the ones made by aluminium or even steel since this one doesn’t restrict airflow and the ducts are angled for better air to go through it.    \nIf that gets your attention, you’ll want to get this to your 200 Duke (This can also fits the 125/390 Duke).

        "600cc\nKawasaki\nZX-6R \n\n2013 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R 636 Officially Revealed – 131hp and KTRC \n\n\nPosted on September 16, 2012September 18, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nZX-6R has now officially released in New York and will be available in US and Europe but not in Malaysia for now. The bike has return to use the 636cc engine which replaced the 599cc previously. The 636cc is made by increasing the stroke of the engine from 42.5mm to 45.1mm. We can expect better torque around the low to midrange power band and this provide the bike better power handling from the engine. The power of this bike are massive considering is only a ‘600’ bike for 131hp at 13,500RPM. The torque are recorded 70.5Nm at 11,500RPM.  \n\nThe ZX-6R comes with ABS and KTRC (Kawasaki Traction Control), the same feature can only be found on ZX-10R previously. There are 4 mode available (including ‘Off’) that is Mode 1 for just a little traction control for much sliding, Mode 3 with more traction control applied for sporty driving with limited slip and Mode 3 to eliminates any chances of wheel slippage. There are also power control that comes in two settings, “Full” and “Low”. Full will give 100% of engine power sent to the rear wheel while Low will limits 80% of power. Both of the settings (KTRC and power control) works independently, so, you have maximum 8 settings to choose for.\n\nThis is definitely a great bike from Kawasaki. In terms of ‘interestingness’, I personally think that the current generation of ZX-6R carries the different aura than this ZX-6R 636. This makes both of the bike great in their own speciality. The 2012 ZX-6R contains a lot of curves and great double headlight but ZX-6R 636 have more sharp lines and edges which make its more beast-looking.\n\n2013 Kawasaki Ninja ZX-6R 636 Specifications\nEngine: Four-stroke, liquid-cooled, DOHC, four valves per cylinder, inline-four\nDisplacement: 636cc\nBore x stroke: 67.0 x 45.1mm\nCompression ratio: 12.9:1\nFuel injection: DFI® with four 38mm Keihin throttle bodies and oval sub-throttles\nIgnition: TCBI with digital advance\nTransmission: Six-speed\nFinal drive: 520 series X-ring chain\nRake / trail: 23.5 degrees / 4.0 in.\nFrame type: Aluminum perimeter\nFront tire: 120/70 ZR17\nRear tire: 180/55 ZR17\nWheelbase: 54.9 in.\nFront suspension / wheel travel: 41mm inverted Showa BP-SFF fork with top-out springs, stepless compression and rebound damping, adjustable spring preload / 4.7 in.\nRear suspension / wheel travel: Bottom-link Uni-Trak® with gas-charged shock, top-out spring and pillow ball upper mount, stepless compression damping, 25-way adjustable rebound damping, fully adjustable spring preload / 5.3 in.\nFront brakes: Dual 310mm petal rotors with dual radial-mount, Nissin four-piston, monobloc calipers\nRear brake: Single 220mm petal rotor with single-piston caliper\nOverall length: 82.1 in.\nOverall width: 27.8 in.\nOverall height: 43.9 in.\nFuel capacity: 4.5 gal.\nSeat height: 32.7 in.\nCurb weight: 423.4 lbs.\nColor choices: Pearl Flat Stardust White / Flat Ebony\nMetallic Spark Black / Flat Ebony\nLime Green / Metallic Spark Black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: twowheelsblog\nAdvertisements",

Following the announcement of Alvaro Bautista earlier, joining him will be Marco Melandri who has officially been signed, fresh from the conclusion of the 2014 Superbike season. In that season with Aprilia Racing, Melandri took 6 wins and another 5 podiums that contributed significantly to Aprilia’s World Superbike (WSBK) Manufacturers’ title win.\nRomano Albesiano, Aprilia Racing Director says, “With Marco Melandri the last piece of the puzzle has been put into place for Aprilia’s participation in next year’s MotoGP season. These have been very intense and exciting days where in just a few hours we went from the last round of Superbike at Losail to this new adventure in MotoGP. We are very pleased to announce Marco’s signing because this completes our team in the best way possible on the eve of a great challenge: with Melandri we now have an all-Italian bike-rider duo. We are moving into MotoGP a year ahead of schedule on wings of enthusiasm because of the double world Superbike championships we have just won. We moved our schedule up because we want the most demanding tracks and the most competitive championship in the world to gauge the quality of our work. Aprilia’s 54 world titles, the hundreds of wins on tracks all over the world give proof of technical skills and a winning attitude that deserve the limelight of the most prestigious stage.”\n\nAlvaro Bautista\n Born in 1982, Marco Melandri began his career at a very young age in minimoto, winning the Italian Championship in 1992 and 1994. Moving to 125CC he became Italian Champion for the category in 1997, a title that allowed him to début in the “eighth litre” MotoGP class. After earning third place in 1998 and second palce in 1999, Marco moved up a category to ride a powerful 250 two-stroke with Aprilia. This was the beginning of a Melandri-Aprilia match up where he finished fifth in the rider standings in 2000, third in 2001 and World Champion (with 9 wins and 2 podiums out of 16 races) in 2002.\nRising to the premier MotoGP category, Melandri immediately asserted his competitiveness, finishing out the year in second place. In the various MotoGP categories, Melandri has won 22 races and has been on the podium 62 times.\nAdvertisements",

Rather than meeting at sharp, definable angles as the sides of a triangle do, in a tri-oval these angles are instead rounded into smooth curves. While an oval has four turns, a tri-oval has an “extra” fifth turn.\nUPDATE (1/11/2010): I have found that the real name for this exhaust is AHM M1 Series, after I look at the catalogue at Stormbikers is Shah Alam\n\nAdvertisements",

The problem is that I hate to be lost and start asking people to go places. Usually, when I drive my car, it is easy to go places since I can mount my iPhone with Papago GPS loaded for my guidance. But when travelling using bikes, it is always a problem to look for guidance from the iPhone, so, this Moto-D iPhone & Android Mount for motorcycles is a great tool for me to mount my iPhone on the bike.

This is because there is a fault with the transmission system which leaves riders unable to select gears.\nThe recall is happening in the UK and according to Britain’s Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, the ‘transmission may fail’ as a result of a fatigue crack to an internal component.\nA notice on VOSA’s recall database says: ‘The gear shift cam segment stopper may develop a fatigue crack. If not identified, this could result in the inability of the rider to select gears.’\nThe recall is said to affect a small batch of 2015 models.\nThough it is highly unlikely, it is not immediately clear if Malaysian bikes are affected, the VOSA however did provide the start and end of the VIN number of affected bikes, so check your VIN number, and if it similar to the numbers stated below, it would be best for you to visit your mechanic.\nRN296######0009355 to RN296######0010782\nRN29F#####0001080 to RN29F######0002551\nRN291######0004601 to RN291######0005001\nDP041######0001239 to DP041######0001293\nDP046######0001835 to DP046######0001873\nRJ155######0008385 to RJ155######0008482\nAdvertisements",

Then, there is Honda CB400 Super Four which carries retro design styles that is looking very nice and comes with 4-cylinder engine that should give lots of torque.  \n2014 Honda CBR250R\nThe facelift for the bike in 2014 is a good move. It will make the CBR250R popular again after the introduction in 2010. This one follows the current design started by the CBR500R, which actually follows the based engine from CBR250R. In HRC Tricolor, it is looking good and desirable.\n2014 Honda CB400 Super Four\nPersonally, I think that the CB400 Super Four is a great bike to be offered in Malaysia if it is CKD in Thailand since that would give it a lower price and with that sense of style, it sure brings back the memories of the CB400 original feel. It is a good bike for daily commuters that are looking for 4-cylinder engine other than the usual 2-cylinder engine at this category.\nAdvertisements",

For 2013, Hernandez is with the Pramac Racing riding the Ducati machine. In my opinion, this is a very good move from LS2 to boost the brand reputation and also increase the sales of helmets just like what old saying, “You win on Sunday, you sell on Monday”. Even just by entering the MotoGP sponsorship the LS2 brand itself will be more recognizable and desirable. This is because the MotoGP racing is the pinnacle of motorcycle racing where safety and performance needs no compromise. So, when a rider trust a helmet, users can also trust it since the safety and performance of the helmet should be on par with any other helmet used in the racing. This also boost the R&D department for LS2 to make a better, safer and higher performing helmet for the MotoGP rider and this R&D can trickle down to the road helmet for the end user like us.  \nConfirmation of the news By SLGrafics to Speedrider\nThe helmet will gets the brilliant touch from Sander Lam of SLGrafics for the livery designs. We can expect after this, the replica of the #68 LS2 helmet to be sold on the market.

A single lap of each stint (a fuel “stint” lasts approximately one hour) will be electric powered, then the new Nissan DIG-T R 1.5 litre three-cylinder turbo engine will take over.\nThe incredibly small engine weighs only 40 kilograms (88 pounds) but produces an astonishing 400hp. The base engine is only 500mm tall x 400mm long x 200mm wide (19.68” x 15.74” x 7.78”). While the engine is technically too heavy to take as carry-on luggage on a plane – it would easily fit inside the luggage guides seen at major airports around the world.\nRevving to 7,500rpm, the Nissan DIG-T R produces 380Nm of torque. At a ratio of 10 horsepower per kilogram the new engine actually has a better power-to-weight ratio than the new engines to be used in the FIA Formula 1 World Championship this year.  \nWith the entire concept of the Nissan ZEOD RC focussing heavily on downsizing and efficiency, Nissan turned to new lubricants partner Total to help develop the engine. The French lubricants manufacturer has worked closely with Nissan engineers to develop fuel and lubricants to maximise the potential of the engine.\nThe Nissan ZEOD RC will occupy “Garage 56” at this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours, an additional entry reserved by the Automobile Club de l‘Ouest for new and ground-breaking technologies never previously seen at the classic French endurance event.\nLessons learned from the development of the revolutionary racecar will also be used in the development of Nissan’s planned entry into the LM P1 class of the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2015.\n“Our engine team has done a truly remarkable job with the internal combustion engine,” said Darren Cox, Nissan’s Global Motorsport Director.\n“We knew the electric component of the Nissan ZEOD RC was certainly going to turn heads at Le Mans but our combined zero emission on-demand electric/petrol power plant is quite a stunning piece of engineering.\n“Nissan will become the first major manufacturer to use a three-cylinder engine in major international motorsport. We’re aiming to maintain our position as industry leaders in focussing on downsizing. Lessons learned from the development of the engine will be seen in Nissan road cars of the future.\n“Our aim is to set new standards in efficiency in regards to every aspect of the car – powertrain, aerodynamics and handling. For the powertrain we have worked closely with the team at Total to not only reduce friction inside the engine, but within all components of the powertrain.\n“Friction is the enemy of horsepower and tackling that has been one of the efficiency targets we have concentrated on heavily.”\n\nAfter extensive dyno testing, the Nissan ZEOD RC hit the track for the first time last week with both the electric and internal combustion engines in place.\nBoth the petrol and electric powerplants run through the same five-speed gearbox that transfers power to the ground via Michelin tyres.\n“Being chosen by a car manufacturer as a technological partner to achieve a demonstration of innovation, is always a source of pride, especially on this legendary race – 24 Hours of Le Mans. It drives our researchers to find solutions and get the most out of the technical specifications as well as the fuel economy properties that our TOTAL QUARTZ lubricants range provides to all passenger cars,” said Philippe Girard, Scientific Delegate for Total.\nThe Nissan ZEOD RC will undergo an extensive test program over the next four months prior to it making its race debut at this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours on June 14-15.\nAdvertisements",

All riders on the front row used the combination of the medium compound front and rear slicks during their time attack in Qualifying Practice 2.\n\nConditions today were similar to yesterday, with cool and windy conditions in the morning session followed by warmer temperatures in the afternoon, with a peak track temperature of 43°C recorded during Qualifying Practice 2. The thirty-minute FP4 session was used to assess race tyre options and all three rear slick options brought to this circuit were utilised. For the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders, both the medium and hard compound rear slicks were used to good effect today and should figure on the grid for tomorrow’s race. For the Ducati and Open-class riders, the medium compound rear is the preferred option, although some riders will elect to use the soft compound rear for the race. Front-end stability while cornering and braking is extremely important at Circuit of The Americas and this is evident with the harder, medium compound front slick being the most popular option.\n\nThe weather forecast predicts a slight chance of rain for tomorrow’s twenty-one lap Americas Grand Prix which starts at 1400 local time (GMT -5). The riders will have one last chance to confirm their race setup during the twenty minute Warm Up session at 0940.  \n\n\nBridgestone slick compounds available: Front: Soft & Medium; Rear: Soft, Medium & Hard (Asymmetric)\nBridgestone wet tyre compounds available: Soft (Main) & Hard (Alternative)\nWeather:  FP3 – Dry. Ambient 22-23°C; Track 27-28°C (Bridgestone measurement)\n                 FP4/QP – Dry.

I expect to see all three rear tyre options being used for tomorrow’s race as they all performed well during race simulations, and the medium compound is likely to be the most popular choice.

        "contest\nshinko\nsr877 \n\nShinko SR877 Contest: WIN Shinko SR877 MC Tyre or Shinko T-shirts! \n\n\nPosted on December 20, 2011December 27, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nHi Readers, I just spotted this comment on my blog which was posted by another Shinko fan (fellow Shinkodian). Further, we will run one more contest with our facebook page.\n\nAm already having this tyre on my 2011 Yamaha LC135ES. Sizes are 80/80-17 front and 100/80-17 rear. Recommended by Mr. Chua at Ah Hong Motor. Please see Mr. Chua (Kok Sing) for great Shinko tyre deals. Tell him Crazy Wahid sent you.\nI apologize for my worded (read: long-winded) review below, but when people say “it’s grippy” I’ll always ask in return “what exactly do you mean by grippy?”  \nFirst of all, let me say that I’ve been very, very used to the venerable Dunlop TT900 for many, many years. So I had initial doubts when mounting these “Korean tyres” called “Sheen-Koh.” (http://motomalaya.net/blog/2011/03/30/shinko-evo-sr877-tyre-on-yamaha-lagenda-115zr-random-pictures/#more-3697)\nHaving ridden a month on them, I’ve tested them by riding to Genting Highlands via Ulu Yam and Bentong, also via the Karak Highway (at least 5 times already), plus twice through Kuala Kelawang.\n\nIn the dry, the amount of feedback while leaned over isn’t too much nor too little. Too much will overwhelm your senses, making you think you’re too fast into the corner, while too litlle gives you no confidence in whether the tyres are gripping. Both extremes will trigger your fear responses and making you close the throttle and losing midcorner speed, and ultimately hurt the drive out of the corner. Most riders compensate by downshifting hard and using the engine as a brake, in order to feel the tyres bite.\n\nAlso, do understand that when fully leaned over, the job of absorbing mid-corner bumps has to be handled by the tyres and chassis. This is where these tyres really excel. Road ripples and bumps are just rolled over without altering the cornering line. Only thing that’s robbing a bit of that confidence is the lack of compression and rebound damping on both ends of the LC (the rear bobs up and down after a bump. Sheesh!). Heavier springs/fork oil and a good rear shock (switching to YSS soon) will definitely sort it out. The TT900 on the other hand, while able to handle mid corner ripples, do kick the tyres off the ground sometimes.\nThe other thing is stability when flicking the bike over quickly. There’s a certain sureness that the front won’t wash out under you. Especially helpful when you’re tackling those decreasing radius turns. Once you’ve chosen your line, it just stays there, but will change lines the moment you instruct it to. No hesitation. However, the Shinkos do feel heavy for low speed turns, while just nice for medium- to high-speed ones. That’s because of the rounded profile.\nThe transition from fully leaned over on one side to the other (meaning changing directions) is also very commendable, needing just modest amounts of countersteering. The TT900′s on the other hand, need a hard shove and big shift of bodyweight to change direction.\n\nBut the one thing that amazes me the most is the way the Shinkos handle damp roads. I mean damp, not fully wet with standing water. I’ve taken a few corners at 110-120km/h in the dry, but I found i could still blast through them at 90-100km/h! On fully wet roads, under pouring rain, I could still tackle these same corners at 70-80km/h, but with the throttle constantly and smoothly rolled open. (Chop the throttle and you’d go down – NOW!) They do slide around (front and rear), I won’t lie to you, but with a relaxed body and good throttle control, those slides are FUN! They offer great feedback before sliding, so the confidence to ride fast in the rain is a bonus. However, the TT900s don’t slide around on standing water at all, honestly.\n\nOn the subject of braking, the Shinkos don’t stand the bike up if you braked in mid-corner. It’ll definitely handle trail braking but again the soft front suspension of the LC lets it down. This is a plus point for daily city riding, cos there are instances where braking while cornering is needed to avoid obstacles. They perform so good under extreme braking that the forks actually flex inwards and outwards, making the front hop, without the tyres locking up. I’ve yet to lock up these Shinkos under braking…\n\nDurability is subjective and relative, really. Anyhow, I’ve worn the rear down to 1mm to the wear indicators. Credit that to the heavy rear end of the LC135ES, my weight (80kg) plus high cornering speeds.\n\nThe TT900 is still good but getting a bit old-school when it comes to the new generation of Kapcais. Plus, the quality is inconsistent.\nThe Shinko SR877 on the other hand are superb tyres. Great looking and quality to boot. Go for it.\nIn partnership with The QBEE Motor Group, MM and QBEE has decided to organise a contest for our fellow bikers! \nParticipate Shinko Year End Contest and stand a chance to win 10 Shinko T-shirt and 1 set of Shinko Tires SR877.\nThis contest will ends on 31 Dec 2011. So,hurry up guys!\n\n\nStand a chance to win the NEWEST, the BEST, and the MOST ADVANCED TYRE for your bike! \n\n\nShinko Year End Contest by QBEE Motor Group S/B\n1 – ‘LIKE‘ QBEEmotor fan page.

        "Motor Star\nparts\nYamaha Lagenda, Jupiter Z, Crypton Z, Vega Force \n\nReview: Motor Star 2-spring rear suspension for Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR \n\n\nPosted on September 11, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nI have replaced the stock Yamaha gas rear suspension with a new product from Motor Star which is the 2-spring. As the name suggests, this Motor Star rear suspension comes with two different spring thickness attached to the suspension setup. Two different thickness of the spring means that it have difference rebound rate. The thinner one at the bottom are used to absorb the small bump and maintain the comfort when riding in straight line. The one that is thicker on the top is used to absorb harsher and bigger bumps on the road. In theory, this would be a great setup setup since the suspension are now not too hard or too soft.  \n\nAfter installing this Motor Star 2-spring suspension, I noticed that the rear are now higher that the previous rear suspension. This elevated give the bike much more racing stance. Also, I have no more worries on getting big and heavy passenger on the back since the suspension is making the bike higher. You can now take much lower cornering angle since the bike’s stand now have higher ground clearance. You also have higher confidence in taking your bike in unexpected off-road condition since your bike’s engine is far from the ground to be hit by rocks or divider.\n\nThis Motor Star 2-spring rear suspension is a good buy if you are looking something different that the usual single spring that you always see. The price is at RM118 per pair. Get it at a store near you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out for more information about Motor Star 2-spring rear suspension here: https://www.facebook.com/motorstar\nAdvertisements",

Leo Vince exhaust are usually know for their application for superbikes, so, maybe that’s why we seldom heard it in the arena of underbone bikes.  \nLeo Vince GP Corsa - Carbon Fiber Available For: Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki Retail Price: RM458\nLeo Vince is a company from Italy and hence they are known for making top quality exhaust parts as expected from Italian job. The price might be a little bit expensive, but I’m hoping the performance that we can get from the exhaust system can really match up the price.\nLeo Vince Cobra Available For: Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki Retail Price: RM548\nThis is due to the fact that moped riders are price-sensitive kind of rider. If they got a lot of money to spend, I think, they’ll get a superbike (that is including me). One question that we might want to ask is that whether this kind of exhaust is legal by the law of police and RTD (JPJ) in Malaysia?\nThanks to Roger Lau Jiu Yuan for the tips!\nAdvertisements",

        "MiniGP \n\nUnited Leperianz MiniGP Challenge – a great training ground for any motorcyclist \n\n\nPosted on September 29, 2014September 30, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nUnited Leperianz has conducted a series of MiniGP races just for the fun of it and they have invited specially newbie riders who would like to try out the real racing world. I was one of them and was a newbie as I have only tried the MiniGP once. There are 20 riders who are taking the challenge and most of them are newbies. One of them, John Chong, has never tried MiniGP before and he was determined to try it out.   \n\nThe race takes place at Elite Speedway Circuit which is 990m long and comes with 14 turns. Just imagine  you are taking 10 laps here, you’ll get to feel 140 turns in that laps and because of this Elite Speedway Circuit are also called circuit of thousand corners. Taking corners in actual racing is not easy and it forces you to use all your strength, your vision and your observation of the surrounding.\n\nThe race format is done in 4 stages. Stage 1, Practice (10 lap). Stage 2, Qualifying (10 lap). Stage 3, Race 1 (10 lap, reverse position, fastest rider starts at the back). Stage 4, Race 2 (12 lap, reverse position). Total lap for this race is 42 lap and for a newbie, this is very demanding in terms of stamina and mental strength. There will be a time when you think you can’t push further. You’ll feel your hand can’t grip the throttle anymore. You’ll feel you feet can’t be lift anymore.\n\nI’d say the event by UL is a very fun event. Safety is taken care by the discipline of each of the rider. Based on my experience with the riders here, they are very humble and always say that they are not fast, you are fast, but in reality, it is them that is fast. This is different than in the online world where some always think that they are faster than the rest of other biker and always ‘tapau’ other biker. In the track and when you are in that racing suit, you’ll respect each other because with respect, you’ll learn how to become better racer. You’ll learn how to takes corner from the faster rider. You’ll learn how to brake properly. You’ll learn how to position your body on the bike. And so much more.\n\nOn and off the track, you’ll make more friends. So, guys and gals, if you are near to Elite Speedway, try the MiniGP. Follow United Leperianz, Malaysian Riders or even MotoMalaya.net for more info about upcoming race.\nI would like to thank and congratulate the great work by United Leperianz, Malaysian Riders, Pitrides and all the people behind the scenes to make this race series work.

Berdasarkan info yang kami perolehi, Ninja ZX-4R itu dijangka akan diperkenalkan sekitar Suku Ketiga tahun depan (2024). \nUntuk rekod, Kawasaki Ninja ZX-4RR ini dikuasakan enjin 399cc 4-stroke DOHC dengan penyejukan cecair yang menawarkan ‘rev limit’ lebih 15,000rpm. Kuasa enjin pula disalurkan kepada tayar belakang menerusi transmisi 6-kelajuan dengan bantuan klac basah. Platform tersebut berupaya menghasilkan 79.1hp dengan bantuan Ram-Air. \n\nPerkembangan terbaru ini pastinya merancakkan lagi pasaran motosikal tempatan dengan kehadiran motosikal 4-inline 400cc itu. \nNamun, sementara menanti ketibaan model tersebut, kami lebih teruja dengan pelancaran Ninja ZX-25R yang akan berlangsung tidak lama lagi. Ini kerana motosikal tersebut akan dipasang sepenuhnya disini dan akan dijual dibawah lencaran Modenas. \n*Versys 650\nTerbaru, EMOS juga telah merasmikan pelancaran tiga model CKD 650cc menerusi Modenas Versys 650, Ninja 650 dan Z650. Ketiga-tiga model ini dijual dengan harga bawah RM40,000 sekaligus menghadirkan berita gembira buat peminat tempatan yang mahu merasaik jentera Jepun dengan harga lebih mesra. \nApa pun, kita nantikan pengumuman rasmi dari pihak EMOS mengenai pelancaran model akan datang itu. \nAdvertisements",

But of course there is still a lot of room for improvement,” said a delighted Takahashi.\n“I spent the past two days adjusting to the bike and Dunlop tyres while the engineers collected the necessary data to tune the bike. Indeed there was a lot of catching up to do as our rivals are all quite experienced but our efforts have so far been fruitful,” he added.\n“Having Zamri as a teammate helped a lot as well. We shared data and this speed up my progress.”\nSpeaking about the 2015 SuperSports 600cc grid, Takahashi commented, “It’s quite amazing how fast these riders are. If anything this gives us a clear indication the season is going to be really exciting and filled with a lot of close battles. I am looking forward to the first race two weeks from now.”\nSeparately Takehiro Yamamoto continued his dominance over the Asia Production 250cc (AP250) class as he picked up his pace by another 0.152 seconds, making him the only rider to dip under 1 minute 16 seconds throughout the three days of testing.\nThe TRICKSTAR Racing set the benchmark ahead of the season opener two weeks from now with 1’16.682s in the eighth and final test session today while Yamaha Factory Racing Indonesia duo, Galang Hendra and Sigit Purno posted their flying lap in the seventh session with 1’17.335s and 1’17.399s respectively.\nRounding up the top five were Takehiro’s teammate, Ryunosuke Hyodo with 1’17.749s followed by Yamaha Tunggal Jaya Racing Team’s Rusman Fadhil, 1’17.758s.\nThe opening round of the 2015 FIM Asia Road Racing Championship will be held at the Sepang Circuit on April 19.\nDay 3 Results\nSuperSports 600cc\n1.Yuki Takahashi (Honda) 1’05.459s 2.Yuki Ito (Yamaha) 1’05.471s 3.Makoto Inagaki (Yamaha) 1’05.475s 4.Zamri Baba (Honda) 1’05.476s 5.Yudhistira (Kawasaki) 1’05.503s\nAsia Production 250cc\n1.Takehiro Yamamoto (Kawasaki) 1’16.682s 2.Galang Hendra (Yamaha) 1’17.335s 3.Sigit Purno (Yamaha) 1’17.399s 4.Ryunosuke Hyodo (Kawasaki) 1’17.749s 5.Rusman Fadhil (Yamaha) 1’17.758s\nAdvertisements",

But, there are some differences that set it apart from the original model.\n\nThe handlebar are now much higher with an the handle attached to the fork tube to provide higher hand position.  This also mean that this bike should also have much more touring-like riding style which more upright position.\nOne question that always remains in Malaysian riders mind is that, whether this bike will make it here?

The wheel are clever as it uses stainless steel wheel which is different that the stock GT128 which comes in COM* (Comstar) cast alloy wheel.\nHID projection head light fitted with CF coverset\nThe front look of the GT128 looks like an owl already with the double lamp headlight, but with the addition of HID (high intensity discharge) light, it adds much meaner look and more ‘life’ to it. This HID headlight look very much the same like the one fitted to 2010 Yamaha YZF-R1. The reason this headlight is choosen is because it is compact and can save in weight.  \nRear tyre size is 130/70. Wide!\nThe tyre choosen for this bike is as large as it can be as the front tyre is fitted with 110/70-17 and 130/70 for the rear rubber. It looks great! I think this bike is going to take corners easily with full confidence by the rider. Also, using wide and large tyre can give better protection from being punctured by the debris on the road.\nFenderless!\nThe rear fender has been eliminated and this give way for more big fat tyre view with sporty looks.\nMore pictures inside the gallery below.

This CBR150R carries the cues from its bigger capacity lineup that is the CBR250R. It also features PGM-FI which enables precise fuel delivery and metering to the combustion chamber.\n\n \n\nOne more interesting colour for this CBR150R is the blue and white scheme which easily resembles the HRC colour scheme. Also,it looks like the 2012 Honda CBR1000RR in blue and white scheme.\n \n\nThis one in black colour scheme are suitable for those who are looking for something differrent than the usual Repsol or HRC colour scheme.\nVia: TMCblog\nAdvertisements",
        "150cc\nV-ixion Lightning\nYamaha\nYamaha FZ-150i, Yamaha Vixion \n\n2013 Yamaha V-ixion Lightning unveiled in Jakarta Motorcycle Show – Digital Pulse Speedometer upgrade \n\n\nPosted on November 3, 2012November 3, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nThere are interesting bikes that has been launched in JCMS from the two of the biggest names in industry that is Honda and Yamaha. Honda has just released the all new CB150R StreetFire, and Yamaha has strike back with the New Model Change of the V-ixion Lightning.  \nImage credit to TMCBlog\nOne of the upgrade is the use of the digital pulse speedometer that reads the speed of the bike by measuring the pulse inside the engine, not like the usual reading which use the rotation of the front wheel. This also means that there are no more speedometer cable from the front wheel send to the speedometer.\nImage credit to TMCBlog\nAs you can see from the picture above, there is no speedometer cable. The speed data is now being fed from the engine digital pulse.\n\nThe engine now have a digital speedometer port to send the data back to the speedometer on the dash. This should provide a better speed reading, but I’m not sure in terms of reliability of this parts in long term.\n\nThe new V-ixion Lightning is looking very beautiful in this red colour and shows the aggresive aspect of the bike.The head lamp now are much modern and the side half-fairing looks great. The engine is still carried from the previous generation, so it means that this one is still 5-speed.\n\nThe V-ixion Lightning is still using the tested and proven Deltabox frame (aka diamond-type frame). Yamaha has been using this type of Deltabox frame since the era of the Yamaha TZM150 2-stroke. Deltabox frame is light and provide great stiffness. (BTW, Trellis frame is also good in its own way).\n\nAnother upgrade of this V-ixion is the integrated key on the fuel tank. This make its look more like the Ducati Monster style setup. It also retains the shutter for double protection against theft.\n\nThe exhaust has been updated to compliment the modern look of th bike. It is said that this kind of muffler style is taking the design from YZF-R1. Also we can see the use of the rear brake disc which we have been waiting for so long.\n\nThe rear swing arm are now featuring the box type swing arm for higher strength and reliability.\n\nThe fuel cap designed to follow the ‘airplane’ style fuel cap.\n\nYamaha Motor Indonesia also introduce the special version of the V-ixion Lightning like the one pictured above. This bike is being fitted with the full official accessories available for the bike.\n\nOther than that, this full modified full fairing V-ixion is also shown for their visitors at JCMS. This one is really looking nice and should evokes the emotion of speed and style. The wheel are taken from the YZF-R15 which already looking good. It is so beautiful guys.\n\nAnother view from the side. As a conclusion, I think this is a great update from Yamaha for the V-ixion. The upgrade is looking much more modern and stylish. The official accessories equipped should please the tuners and modders out there.\nOne question always remains, when will it comes to Malaysia?\nPictures are from Yamaha Motor Indonesia FB and TMCBlog.\nAdvertisements",

This is a very different design that the current CBR250R which carry the influence of the VFR model. This CBR300R feature a double headlight that looks very good and follows the design started by the CBR500R. Since this is said to be global model, it should be available in Malaysia too, right? As read from the press release, CBR300R will be made in Thailand, which in turns makes it valid for Asean CKD. So, the price will be much different than the 2011 Honda CBR250R.  \nvia: honda.co.jp/news/2013/2131017.html\nAdvertisements",

But on further inspection, it doesn’t have to be removed. The exhaust installation is easy. You just need one 10mm spanner and two 12mm spanner for it. Don’t forget to get the exhaust gasket too (a.k.a packing).\n6 more pictures and exhaust sound via YouTube after the jump\n\nAt the first engine start, smoke starts coming from the front of the exhaust and that’s okay because the smoke is actually from the paint on the exhaust pipe. The sound of the CJ Ipoh is quite loud compared to stock exhaust.\nUPDATE (12/12/2010): I have reverted back to the stock exhaust pipe. This is because the sound of the CJ Ipoh is loud and this might make road user think I’m ‘mat rempit’.\nAdvertisements",

Kawasaki small bikes lower than 150cc previously are hard to find in Malaysia since they have collaboration with Modenas to make the small bikes.\nThis 2011 Kawasaki D-Tracker X with 250cc and fuel injection has now come to Malaysia in CKD (completely knocked down). This should lowers the price but at RM23,799.00 for a single cylinder engine, that is not cheap. For comparison, Kawasaki Ninja 250R with parallel twin engine is at RM23,500.00.\nEven with that kind of price, the specification of the D-Tracker X are good. You’ll get a dual purpose bike with 17″ wheels, large front and rear disc brake, fuel injected engines and great motocross styling from Kawasaki design house.\nDual purpose bike that have appearance like motocross and high ground clearance are now getting popular in Malaysia, due to the road condition here are not smooth. There are many pot holes all the way in federal road and some in city road. PLUS highway are good road, but it is not everyday the bikers use the road to get to work. One more reason for bikers to consider the off-road motocross bike is because there can be flash flood in just few minutes of rain especially in Shah Alam and Kuala Lumpur. When it happens, the normal moped tends to stall since the carburetor is placed lower than the one in off-road motocross bikes.\n2 more pictures and technical specification after the jump\n\n\n\n\nENGINE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nLiquid-cooled, 4-stroke, Single cylinder, DOHC, 4 valves\n\n\n\n\nDisplacement\n\n\n249 cm³\n\n\n\n\nBore and Stroke\n\n\n72.0 mm X 61.2 mm\n\n\n\n\nCompression ratio\n\n\n11.0:1\n\n\n\n\nPerformance:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) Maximum power\n\n\n18.0 kW {24.0 PS} @ 9,000 rpm\n\n\n\n\nb) Maximum torque\n\n\n21.0 N∙m {2.1 kgf∙m} @ 7,000 rpm \n\n\n\n\nFuel system\n\n\nDigital Fuel Injection system, KEIHIN single barrel ø34\n\n\n\n\nStarting\n\n\nElectric starter motor\n\n\n\n\nIgnition\n\n\nCDI\n\n\n\n\nLubrication\n\n\nForced lubrication (wet sump)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRIVETRAIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n6-speed, Constant mesh, Return shift\n\n\n\n\nGear ratios:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st\n\n\n3.000 (30/10)\n\n\n\n\n2nd\n\n\n2.000 (30/15)\n\n\n\n\n3rd\n\n\n1.500 (27/18)\n\n\n\n\n4th\n\n\n1.190 (25/21)\n\n\n\n\n5th\n\n\n1.050 (21/20)\n\n\n\n\n6th\n\n\n0.952 (20/21)\n\n\n\n\nFinal reduction ratio\n\n\n2.786 (39/14)\n\n\n\n\nClutch\n\n\nWet multi disc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRAME\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\nTubular, Semi-double cradle \n\n\n\n\nCaster (rake)\n\n\n25.5º\n\n\n\n\nTyre:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na) front\n\n\n110/70-17 M/C 54S Tube type\n\n\n\n\nb) rear\n\n\n130/70-17 M/C 62S Tube type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUSPENSION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront: Type\n\n\nTelescopic fork\n\n\n\n\nRear: Type\n\n\nSwingarm (Uni-trak)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBRAKES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront: Type\n\n\nSingle disc brake\n\n\n\n\nRear: Type\n\n\nSingle disc brake\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall length\n\n\n2,130 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall width\n\n\n795 mm\n\n\n\n\nOverall height\n\n\n1,125 mm\n\n\n\n\nWheelbase\n\n\n1,420 mm\n\n\n\n\nGround clearance\n\n\n225 mm\n\n\n\n\nSeat height\n\n\n860 mm\n\n\n\n\nCurb mass\n\n\n138 kg\n\n\n\n\nFuel capacity\n\n\n7.7 litres\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

People in Thailand got all the bike featured here, but none of them is available in Malaysia. Why? What is wrong with Fi bike in accordance with the rules and regulation here in Malaysia?But, there is one thing that make me happy for using carburetor type cub bike, look at the Honda Wave specification below:\nSpecifications Honda Wave 125 * Engine type: SOHC 2-valve 4-stroke air-cooled 124cc engine * Displacement: 124.9 cc * Bore x Stroke: 52.4 x 57.9 mm * Compression Ratio: 9,3:1 * Max Power: 9.3 PS @ 7,500 rpm (carburetor type), 9,18 PS @ 7.500 rpm(Fi) * Max Torque: 1.03 kgf.m @ 4,000 rpm (carburetor type), 0,99 kgf.m /5.000 rpm(Fi)  * Max speed: 115 km/h * Transmission: 4-speed * Clutch: Wet multi-plate centrifugal * Starter: Kick and electric starter * Frame Type: Underbone steel tube * Suspension (F): Telescopic * Suspension (R): Swingarm * Brake (F): Disc/Mechanically actuated drum * Brake (R): Leading trailing drum/Disc * Fuel tank capacity: 3.7 L\nRead the one with bold font. As you can see the carburetor-type Honda Wave 125 is more powerful and torquey than Fi sibling. Also, the maintainance is low and easy to repair compared to Fi which used ECU. Still, we in Malaysia should have Fi bikes(we have one actually, that is Yamaha FZ-150i).The special thing about Fi is about fuel efficiency. This is proven by the review of FZ-150i by Roda-Roda magazine in Malaysia September issue.Self modification to fit your bike with Fi is actually possible but I think it is not worth the effort.For more information, click here.\nAdvertisements",

I’m interested in this X-Bon helmet by X-Dot after reading about in the Kapcai magazine December issue.  \n\nX-Bon Helmet G5005F Matte Black\nThe greatest thing about it is that it features carbon fiber shell! This is NOT stickers, but actual carbon fiber that is made into the shell of the helmet.\nX-Bon Helmet G5005F Red\n \nCarbon fiber (CF) are known for its lightweight and super strong construction that exceed the strength of metal. I don’t know the actual weight of this helmet, but CF is definitely something that can help the helmet to become lighter to the rider’s head.\nX-Bon Helmet G5005F Blue\nAfter that, I’m thinking, what about the price? We all know that real CF doesn’t come cheap, but after looking for it inside the X-Dot website I was surprised to see that it priced at RM950. That is just a little bit expensive than the AGV K3 Celebr8 at RM850, but this AGV is not made from CF.\n\nWhat is more amazing is that X-Dot are now offering Photochromic Visor! What is Photochromic Visor you might ask. It is a technology of the visor plastic or glass that enables it to adjust the darkness of the visor colour automatically. It means that, this visor will be dark when you exposed it to sunlight, and become clear when you use it at night. So, no need to have double visor since that one photochromic visor can be dark or clear by itself.\nGood job X-Dot!\nAdvertisements",

The pared down appearance of the new S 1000 R exudes an aggressive, dynamic energy. Based on a well-thought-out overall concept, with 160 hp maximum power and a weight of 207 kg, as well as Race ABS, ASC and a choice of two riding modes as standard, the BMW S 1000 R sets new standards in the sports roadster segment.  \nIn-line four-cylinder engine with optimised low to mid-range performance.\nWhen modifying the S 1000 RR’s 999 cc four-cylinder in-line engine for use in the S 1000 R, the engineers were looking in particular to provide punchy response all the way through the rpm range. To provide the ideal set-up both for everyday use and for sporty riding on the open road, they significantly increased the low and mid-range power and torque. At the same time, maximum rpm has been reduced by approximately 2,000 rpm. Maximum power of 118 kW (160 hp) is reached at 11,000 rpm and peak torque of 112 Nm (approx. 83 lb-ft) at 9,250 rpm. Up to 7500 rpm, this engine version develops 10 Newton metres (approx. 7 lb-ft) more torque than the S 1000 RR. This provides punchy low-end response that is ideal on twisty single-carriageway roads. Among other things, this was achieved by using redesigned cylinder head ducts, modified cam profiles and appropriately modified engine management. The new BMS-X engine management system also supports an E-Gas “throttle-by-wire” system.\nASC (Automatic Stability Control), Race ABS and a choice of two riding modes as standard. Riding mode Pro with two additional modes and DTC optionally available.\nFor optimal adaptation to different conditions and rider requirements, the S 1000 R comes with two riding modes and ASC (Automatic Stability Control) as standard. The “Rain” and “Road” modes cater to different road surface conditions using different power and torque curves, and applying different levels of Race ABS and ASC intervention. This provides an important safety bonus, particularly under changeable road conditions.\nDynamic Traction Control (DTC), incorporating a further two riding modes – “Dynamic” and “Dynamic Pro” – is available as an ex-works option. This option allows riders to make the most of the S 1000 R’s sporty performance potential both on the road and on the race track. Dynamic Traction Control, which includes a banking angle sensor, offers safe and dynamic acceleration which is currently state-of-the-art for a production motorcycle.\nInnovative chassis and suspension technology with large damping reserves and high-performance brakes. Dynamic Damping Control (DDC) optionally available.\nHowever ambitious the riding style, the chassis and suspension of the S 1000 R is a match for the dynamic power delivery of the four-in-line engine. Based on that of the S 1000 RR, it uses the proven aluminium alloy perimeter frame, in which the engine forms part of the load-bearing structure. As on the RR, an adjustable upside-down fork and a dual swingarm with adjustable central spring strut guide the wheels front and rear. Roadster-specific suspension requirements are met by a slight change in geometry. As on the RR, vigorous, stable and above all safe braking is provided by a braking system that comprises a twin-disc brake with two radial 4-piston fixed callipers at the front and a single-disc brake at the rear, with partially integral Race ABS. Dynamic Damping Control (DDC), available as an ex-works optional extra, offers the benefits of electronic damping control. For further enhanced performance, in combination with enhanced active safety, this system dynamically adapts the damping to the current riding situation with split-second speed.\nDynamic styling.\nThe new S 1000 R’s sports roadster personality is also mirrored in the styling. With its “tail up – nose down” stance, the S 1000 R’s appearance immediately suggests aggressive performance and dynamism. Like the RR, the S 1000 R, too, is distinctive and instantly recognisable. It has a face that stands out in a crowd.\nMultifunctional instrument cluster.\nLast but not least, race-inspired features also extend to the cockpit of the S 1000 R. With an LC display with analogue rev counter, the instrumentation offers an unrivalled amount of information in this segment, from the gear display and riding mode display to a lap timer. For optimal gear changes, an individually programmable quick-shifter is fitted.\nHighlights of the new BMW S 1000 R:\nWell-thought-out overall concept sets new standards in the sports roadster segment.\nPared down styling with an aggressively dynamic look; clear family similarities with S 1000 RR.\nLiquid-cooled 999 cc four-cylinder in-line engine.

The changes that we can see  is that this time the front brake has been replaced to single-piston caliper compared to previous version that is equipped with 2-piston caliper. For this 115ZR, I think the single-piston is enough for the braking power since this bike can tops at 100km/h only in stock condition. The wheels are also now in black colour compared to the all blue colour for the previous model. At the time the blue wheel is introduced, it looks weird but now it is looking just nice. Black is a good colour too and it easily blends with this bike well.\nPrice for Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR 2012 is RM5,260\nAdvertisements",
        "1290 Super Duke R\n1290cc\n1300cc\nKTM \n\nGallery: 2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke R first launch in Asia at Sepang, Malaysia – RM133,000 (on the road) \n\n\nPosted on December 21, 2013December 23, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nMotonation Sdn Bhd has bring us this 2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke R in Sepang International Circuit, Malaysia for its  first ever launch in Asia. This indeed is a good move since the rider can test the power and mainly the torque of this bike in proper way, that is the circuit where you can max everything out of this bike, only if you dare. In the morning, it was raining while I was driving there and thinking that this test ride might be a wet test ride. Luckily it turns out sunny and the track is dry. The KTM 1290 Super Duke R has managed to awakens the desire within the riders soul with its radical design and a big engine under its Trellis frame. Looking very beautiful on every side you see it, this is the bike worth waiting for and now it is already touches its feet to Malaysia.\n2005 KTM Super Duke 990\nThe 1290 Super Duke R was developed since 2002, that is 11 years ago and the first final product is the KTM Super Duke 990 (as pictured above). The KTM Super Duke 990 was introduced in 2005 and has become an interesting naked bike to look for. It is then refined with two replacement model with same name in 2008 and 2011.\n\n2008 KTM Super Duke 990\n2011 KTM Super Duke 990\nThe 2005, 2008 and 2011 KTM Super Duke 990 comes in two colours that is in iconic KTM orange and another one in black. The design gradually become much more sharper and it looks like the evolution of this Super Duke can be compare like a stone carving taking shape slowly to become a sculpture. Then, there was the KTM RC8. The link of combining bigger engine to Super Duke 990 was triggered when somebody ask what if the engine of the RC8 fitted to the Super Duke? That would be awesome. The RC8 engine has a capacity of 1,195cc in liquid-cooled 2-cylinder 4-stroke 75° V arrangement which can maxes out 173hp. It is already good and could be a great combination to the Super Duke, but what the KTM engineers did is that they increase the engine capacity to 1,301cc and making this engine for a naked bike is bigger than the KTM RC8 which is a supersports.\n\nIn 2011, the idea was finalised and shown in the sketch above. The 2011 sketch shows a sharper and more stubby look of the Super Duke. The lines looks aggressive and the stance in like a beast waiting to pounds its prey (sounds like Sugomi, eh?).\n\nOn October 2013, the 2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke R is revealed to world and shows the design that is not far from the final sketch that still looks sharp and stubby. Actually, in my eyes, this bike looks better than the sketch, which is usually true in reverse (I mean, usually the sketch is more beautiful than the real bike, but this 2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke R is better than the sketch).\n\nNow that the engine is enlarged in the combustion chamber which also means the increase in HP and torque, how much actually the power it gets? The numbers shown that this sweet 1,301cc liquid-cooled 2-cylinder, 4-stroke, spark-ignition engine, 75° V arrangement engine is rated at 180hp at 8,870RPM and the torque at 144Nm at 6,500RPM. That is much more powerful than the RC8 which only measures at 173hp and 120Nm only and the RC8 engine is already powerful to boot. The next thing that happened is that the throttle has become very wild initially. At only 6% throttle opening, there will 30Nm available on tap. 6% is a very little number and if you look at the twist of throttle position, it almost like nothing.\nBosch 9M+ ABS Control\nElectronics are used to rectify the problem and Ride by Wire (RbW) is used. A good note from KTM Street Product Manager, Joerg Schueller: “the electronics used is to support the rider, not to limit“. The RbW used to make the initial throttle opening is much more controllable, so that the torque transferred gradually. This will give a smoother throttle control and eliminates the power shock. If not, you’ll wheelie the bike everytime you exceeds 6% throttle opening. In order for the electronics to manage the throttle feel, three things are included that is the ABS Control, Traction Control and Lean Angle Sensor. The ABS Control is from Bosch 9M+ which is small and advanced to manage the braking for this beast. Traction control are also managed by Bosch MTC with 3-modes (disengageable).\nThe RbW comes in three modes that is Street, Sport and Rain. For Street and Sport mode, the differences is about the initial throttle opening curve but the maximum power is not limited where you can tap the 180hp if you want to. The Rain modes limits the power to 100hp and the throttle opening curve are much ‘softer’ to avoid the slip on wet conditions.\n\nOne of the reason the high torque extracted by the engine for the 1290 Super Duke is contributed by the use of lightweight piston. As pictured above, the piston is very slim made to fit the 108mm x 71mm bore and stroke dimension which shows that this engine is oversquare that can revs high easily. With this configuration, the piston will have a shorter area of contact to the cylinder wall and this can minimise the power loss due to the friction of the piston touching the cylinder wall. The piston is also a special parts for this Super Duke where it is lighter when compared with the engine capacity and piston weight ratio. It  is lighter (in terms of the ratio) when compared to other bikes with the same engine capacity.\n\nThere is also a special model shown here that prepared with KTM PowerParts. On immediate observation, we can see that the exhaust is different which is Akrapovic. The livery is also a little bit different with few more brand names appears on it.\n\nAt the launch event, there are some familiar faces that we can see. There is Zulfahmi Khairudin and also Hafiq Azmi who were riding KTM last season. Next year, only Hafiq Azmi remains as the KTM rider. The tradition in KTM is that they will celebrate and honour their rider by giving a new KTM shirt to the new rider.\n\nMaking appearances for the test ride is no other than the popular comedian in Malaysia, Zizan Razak. Zizan test ride the bike and looks like he enjoyed it.\n\nJeremy McWilliams (next to Zulfahmi) who was the MotoGP rider in 90s were also there to test the bike.\n\nJeremy has been in MotoGP since 1993 until 2007. He helps to develop the KTM 1290 Super Duke R. Jeremy still got his guts when I see wheelie the bike easily on the straight and looks effortless. He only turns it down when taking corner.  It is a great day to enjoy and hopefully KTM will brings in more interesting bikes to Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke R technical specifications\n\n\n\nEngine type\n2-cylinder, 4-stroke, V 75°\n\n\nDisplacement\n1.301 ccm\n\n\nBore/stroke\n108/71 mm\n\n\nPower\n132 kW (180 HP) at 8.870 RPM, 144Nm at 6,500RPM\n\n\nStarting aid\nElectric starter/12V 11.2Ah\n\n\nTransmission\n6 gears\n\n\nEngine lubrication\nPressure lubrication with 3 Eaton pumps\n\n\nCooling system\nLiquid cooling\n\n\nClutch\nPASC slipper clutch, hydraulically operated\n\n\nEngine management/ignition\nKeihin EMS with DBW, double ignition\n\n\nFrame\nChromium-Molybdenum-Steel trellis frame, powder coated\n\n\nHandlebar\nAluminium, konifiziert Ø 28/22 mm\n\n\nFront suspension\nWP-USD Ø 48 mm\n\n\nRear suspension\nWP-Monoshock\n\n\nFront brake\n2 x Brembo four piston, radially bolted caliper, brake disc Ø 320 mm\n\n\nRear brake\nBrembo fixed mounted two-piston brake calipers\n\n\nBrake system\nBosch 9ME Combined-ABS\n\n\nChain\nX-Ring 5/8 x 5/16″\n\n\nSteering head angle\n65,1°\n\n\nWheel base\n1.482 ± 12 mm\n\n\nGround clearance\n140 mm\n\n\nSeat height\n835 mm\n\n\nTank capacity\n18 l Unleaded premium fuel (95 RON)\n\n\nWeight without fuel\n189 kg\n\n\n\nIt is finally here and this is the time to splash out the RM133,000 from the bank to get this 2014 KTM 1290 Super Duke on the road.

This is one in particular, the 2014 Yamaha MT-09, now available in CKD version and the price has been reduced to RM9,000 as it is priced at RM45,000 compared to the CBU version at RM54,000. That is a lot of amount of money that can be used to buy more accessories or performance parts for the MT-09.\nInline-3 engine is the direction Yamaha is taking for this naked street bike. Inline-3 engine will give a benefit in overall lightness of the engine and also making the dimension of the bike to be narrower. The engine can produce 115PS @ 10,000RPM with 87.5Nm of torque @ 8,500RPM. This combination will make the bike easy to accelerate since the engine is powerful and lightweight.  \nThe braking is handled by dual 298mm brake disc setup for the front and single 245mm brake disc setup for the rear.

        "Asian Road Racing Championship \n\nARRC Pre-Season Test Day 1 Results: Inagaki Sets The Groove At Sepang \n\n\nPosted on April 1, 2015April 2, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nAkeno Speed Racing’s Makoto Inagaki got off to a rapid start as he opened Day One of the FIM Asia Road Racing Championship pre-season test fastest ahead of Mohd Zamri Baba (Musashi Boon Siew Honda Racing) and Ahmad Yudhistira  (Manual Tech Kawasaki) at the Sepang Circuit.\nThe Japanese rider topped the SuperSports 600cc timesheets after logging in 1’06.139s in the first session, outpacing his Honda and Kawasaki rival by 0.012 seconds and 0.033 seconds respectively.\nWrapping up the top five for the day were Tomoyoshi Koyama (T Pro Yuzy Honda NTS) and M.Fadli (Astra Honda Racing Team) with 1’06.477s and 1’06.548s respectively.  \nThe SuperSports 600cc field was hoping to make further progress in the second session but a heavy downpour around 3pm brought an end to fast lap times for the day.\nAlthough the storm passed within the hour, the amount of surface water meant that a return to optimum dry conditions is unlikely before the scheduled 6pm closing time and as a result only seven riders went out to refine their wet setup.\n“This being Sepang, we were expecting rain and so we managed to get most of our work done in time before it came. However we are still very far from perfect,” confirmed Inagaki.\n“It was a short but very important test.

        "tips \n\nPrepare Yourself for Raining Season \n\n\nPosted on March 30, 2012March 30, 2012 by eddy \n\n\n\nRaining season is coming in Malaysia and you as riders should prepare yourself for it if your motorcycle is the only option for your daily use. If not, you can just easily drive a car.\nHere are my tips on driving on wet condition:\n1. Change your tyre to a medium-hard compound with aqua channel tread pattern to disperse the water away from the rubber.\n2. Test the slipperiness of your tyre by giving it a good hard brake so that you have better understanding of your tyre grip. If you are not sure, just drive slow and don’t take the risk.\n3. Anticipate danger in front of you so that you are aware to pull the brake sooner since disc brake have lower grip in wet. Also, try to pull the brake few times before really apply the braking force to dissipate the water on the disc plate.\n4. Prepare a full rain suit. Jacket and pants.\n5. The more grip the tyre is on the tarmac, the more slippery it is on cement or tiles (mosaic) pathway. So, be careful.\n6. Avoid riding on the road lines and markings since it is very slippery in wet condition. If you need to brake, stay away from it, then you brake.\nThat is just a little info based on my riding experience, hope it can give benefit to you.\nAdvertisements",

But this one from NOB1 model Silent Sport Series seems like having another target market. They target bikers who want to use high performance exhaust but wants to keep the sound level down. You can get top speed from it but it doesn’t produce any sound (that is what is stated on the brochure).NOB1 is an exhaust brand from Indonesia. The price for this exhaust is higher than AHM and YY Pang which is made in Malaysia. I guess the price is higher due to import taxes and delivery charges.Even though this exhaust is silent, you should know that this is racing performance parts. So, makes no mistake about its power.This exhaust is available in most bike shops. Price? Check it yourself!\nAdvertisements",

Last year, Michelin has introduced the Pilot Street and Pilot Street Radial which is a tubeless type tyre for the premium sporty under 250 rider who wants the best tyre in dry and wet condition.\nHere are 10 interesting features and info about the Michelin City Pro: \n\n1. Developed in 18 month. Few Yamaha 135LC are flown to France to test the tyre in variable conditions and aspects.\n2. Michelin City Pro resists 20% more pressure to be punctured as compared to the best competitor. \n3. Michelin City Pro comes with 21 variant at launch ranging from 14 to 18 inch tyre size. It is already able to cover 75% tyre market for moped and scooters.\n4. There are 3 ply layer that makes it more resistant to puncture.\n5. Claimed to be the best in wet condition among its competitor.\n6. 48 motor taxi in Thailand are picked to test the tyre for 6 month with accumulated mileage of 440,000 km.\n7. Only 4 punctures occurs in that 440,000km.\n8. Durability of this tyre are also high that it can go up to 20,000km.\n9. Comfort are also taken into consideration where the side wall are made to give enough flex.\n10. The Michelin City Pro is priced from RM53 to RM83. For example, the popular size of 70/90-17 is only at RM73 retail price where 80/90-17 is at RM83. I think that is competitive enough. It is claimed that Michelin is less than 10% more expensive than its strongest competitors.\n \nThere you have it. We will add more pictures and info soon for the full blown report.\nAdvertisements",

With this in mind, Suzuki stated that this Shooter 115Fi are 37% more fuel efficient compared to their same 115cc bike without FI system. 37% is a very large number for a moped in terms of fuel efficiency as we can see the bike can be ride longer with less frequent fuel stops. Also, an example of it is that if the bike can go 200km per fuel tank, now it can go all the way up to 274km roughly but that’s only in theory.  \nThere are 3 variant of the Suzuki Shooter 115Fi that is:\n– Shooter 115 Fi SR with alloy cast rim and front disc brake.\n– Shooter 115 Fi R with normal steel spoke rim and front disc brake.\n– Shooter 115 Fi with normal steel spoke rim and front drum brakes.\n\nThe engine is using LEAP technology that refers to Light, Efficient and Powerful. This concept is achieved by the use of roller rocker arm that minimise the friction, the optimised valve angle and valve spring and the use of lightweight piston and crankshaft. All this providing 6.9kW (9.3ps) at 8,000RPM which is very powerful for a bike at 115cc. This power specs is also the same with the Suzuki Nex scooter.\nOther features on the bike that is notable is the use of safety shutter key that can prevent theft. Included is the large underseat box (U-box) at 8.0L but still can’t fit the helmet in.\nA good choice from Suzuki to the ever growing market in Indonesia.\nvia: http://suzuki.co.id/suzuki_news_details.php?id=17154037&type=2&yearz=2013\nand via: http://ninja250r.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/suzuki-shooter-5.jpg\n \nAdvertisements",

The prestigious event was officially launched today by Yang Berhormat Dato’ Seri Mohamed Nazri bin Tan Sri Abdul Aziz, the Minister of Tourism and Culture Malaysia together with Mr Russell Avis, General Manager of SummerNats Australia, Mr J.P. Chin, Founder of JPM Motorsport and witnessed by Ms. Susan Kahwati, Senior Trade & Investment Commissioner of the Australian Trade Commission in Malaysia & Brunei and Datuk Razlan Razali, Chief Executive Officer of Sepang International Circuit.\n“This is the first international debut for SummerNats and it’s going to be big!” said JPM Motorsport Founder, J.P. Chin.  \nSummer Nationals or SummerNats, has grown into a genuine Australian icon, an annual auto festival that was the brainchild of renowned car enthusiast Chic Henry who kicked off the first event of its kind in 1988. Today, 26 years later, SummerNats is regarded as the biggest event in Australia. It was voted as Australia’s Favorite Event in 2013 and in 2014, attracting a total of 103,437 spectators.\nEvolving into what has become an annual pilgrimage for motor heads down under, up to 1,500 of the toughest Australian elite street machines descend on Exhibition Park in Canberra for a three-and-a-half day showdown in front of close to 100,000 spectators fueled by the judging of top street machines, the world’s best burnout battle, precision driving demos, horsepower heroics, and much more.\nSummerNats Malaysia sets out to emulate this high octane show in what will also be the SummerNats brand’s first ever foray outside of Australia. SummerNats Malaysia will however, diversify its attraction to welcome the world of custom motorcycles and superbikes, in addition to taking on a more family-oriented weekend for spectators.\n“Having an event, not only for the enthusiast, but one which caters to the entire family is something we strongly believe in. We’ve proven this to become a successful formula for three years running when we previously acquired the rights to host the Malaysian round of the Super GT Championship,” said Chin whose company not only promotes motor-racing events but has also successfully a carved a niche for itself in organizing concerts in Malaysia by international K-Pop artistes.\n“This marks a new milestone for JPM Motorsport. We see this exciting event, as another step towards realizing our vision and mission which is: to make motorsports accessible to enthusiasts by creating opportunities and proper platforms, and to build an active and dynamic motorsports lifestyle community through various events, and ultimately, and by doing so, becoming a leader through active participation and unique conceptualization of all motorsport related activities.”\nAs a leading promoter of international and world class events, JPM Motorsport believes Malaysia is an ideal hub for SummerNats given the increasing levels of appreciation and the growing number of enthusiasts as well as serious collectors of classic, custom, hot rods, muscle and super cars.\nEnvisioned not only to become Malaysia’s largest automotive event but a regional attraction for the ASEAN automotive market, SummerNats Malaysia will also serve as a large commercial and marketing platform for car manufacturers, exhibitors of automotive products and accessories to display and promote their products to the general public.\nThere will be hundreds vehicles on display which consists of American and European classic, sports and muscle cars, some of which are collectibles from JPM Motorsport’s very own auto musuem.  This includes legendary classics such as the AC Cobra, the Chevrolet Camaro SS, the Chevrolet Bel Air, the Chevrolet Impala and the all American, the legendary Ford Mustang. Also on display will be thousand custom made two wheelers and exotic super bikes.\nThe first edition of SummerNats Malaysia will feature 8 of the competition winning cars from Australia being put on display for Malaysian car enthusiasts.\nOne of the highlights of the event will be the SummerNats Street Machine parade which will involve not only Muscle Cars, Classic Cars, Supercars and Sports cars but also include all genre of motorcycles from choppers and superbikes, to sports bike and even interesting bikes like Vespa participating in a parade within and outside of the Sepang International Circuit. For bikers, JPM Motorsport will be organizing a Malaysia Riding Tour in which the final rendezvous point will be at SummerNats Malaysia.\nSummerNats Malaysia will also have ample local flavor, acknowledging homegrown talent by crowning the Best Local Custom Car and Motorcycle. The SummerNats Judging Pavilion will see cars and bikes alike competing against each other in 12 categories, judged by a panel of reputable judges from Australia and Malaysia through partners such as Tom’s Stickers.\nSummerNats Malaysia will also feature the best Burnouts involving both cars and motorcycles. Track time will also be provided for super car and sports car owners. The event is also being supported by the presence of a fleet of thoroughbred supercars from the Ferrari Owner’s Club of Malaysia, Porsche Club Malaysia, and the Lamborghini Owner’s Malaysia.\nAuto enthusiasts and spectators can also look forward to what is being planned as the biggest car and motorcycle gathering, in an attempt to set an all-new milestone under the Malaysian Book of Records. JPM Motorsport will be out to create another Malaysia book of records entry with the biggest bicycle gathering on Merdeka Day. The target is to have 10,000 cyclists gathered and for those who like, do some fun laps around the Sepang International Circuit.\nSummerNats Malaysia will include a motorshow with the aim of housing all reputable car and motorcycle brands during the weekend. And for those who love or intend to customize their cars, there will also be a special zone dedicated to aftermarket products and accessories.

As you can see from the picture above, the yellow 250SL is signed by Tom Sykes and thus making it rare and I think should only be for display at Kawasaki’s office. This indeed a very interesting bike as I have asked many media friends who are really liked the bike. It is slim since it is single-cylinder, but still got enough power to get it to 157km/h . Kawasaki 250SL are rated at 28hp at 9,700RPM. In my humble opinion, this could be a daily bike for any riders that are looking for a comfortable ride with more speed can kapchai but still retains the slim profile. For a commute of about 80-100km daily, it should be a good bike for it.

CVT can provide exceptional fuel economy but the problem with it is rubber-banding effect.\nThe more recent development in automatic transmission is dual-clutch system and now, being offered by Honda for its VFR-1200F. Even though VFR-1200F is not moped or underbone motorcycle, this development can be scaled for bikes below 150cc, in my opinion. We have seen the Honda’s PGM-FI version that has been transported to Honda Wave 125i, where it was thought impossible before. So, dual-clutch system might be coming soon to Honda’s moped lines.\nMore reading material can be obtained here: http://world.honda.com/motorcycle-picturebook/DCT/detail/\nAdvertisements",

This can appeal for younger rider who are looking for a beginner naked bike.\nEquipped with 124.7 cc 1-cylinder OHC  (bore x stroke = 52.4 x 57.8mm), it generate 7.8kW @ 7,750 RPM and 10.2Nm @ 6,250 RPM. Keep in mind that this bike is also PGM-FI equipped.\nWe can expect the bike to be fuel efficient and it is actually since it is measured 51.3km/liter. The fuel tank can fit 13 liter of petrol making the CB125F to be able to go 600km in one full tank. \n\nThe engine is considered small but for the urban city riding this bike is perfect. You can beat the traffic and still have the fuel to save. \n\nThe headlight is in hexagonal shape which is looking nice and should be able to illuminate the night riding nicely. \n\nThe rear end is ordinary but it is not make to make a presense felt. Just ride it, enjoy it and feel the wind.\nNo news when or will it come to Malaysia.\nAdvertisements",

Rear: Hard (various test compounds – asymmetric)\nWeather: Dry. Ambient 17-33°C; Track 22-52°C (Bridgestone measurement)\n\nBridgestone completed a successful three-day tyre test at Phillip Island, as the Official Tyre Supplier to MotoGP™ met its objective of testing a range of new rear slick tyres to deliver safety, performance and durability for a full race-distance at the Australian Grand Prix in October.\n\nBridgestone brought two front and eight rear specifications of slick tyre to the test, with six of the rear slick specifications being brand new test tyres developed specifically for the Phillip Island circuit. Five riders; Ducati’s Andrea Dovizioso and Cal Crutchlow, Repsol Honda’s Dani Pedrosa, and Yamaha Factory Racing’s Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi took part in the three-day test, completing a total of 861 laps.  \n\n\nThe experimental rear slicks provided for the tyre test featured developments in compound, construction and profile technology in order to find the optimum solution for a circuit that is the toughest on rear tyres on the whole MotoGP™ calendar. The first day of the test was used for initial testing of all six experimental tyres; the second and third days of the test were dedicated to race simulations on the tyres that were more found to be more suitable following analysis of tyre data and rider feedback. Out of the six experimental rear slicks provided, three specifications proved to be more promising both in terms of durability, performance, and rider feedback. These three rear slick options were tested extensively over the final two days of the test and the further positive rider feedback and data analysis acquired on these three options on the final two days means that they will form the basis of tyre development for the Australian Grand Prix in October. \n\nThe weather at Phillip Island was changeable over the three days, allowing Bridgestone to acquire tyre performance data in a wide variety of conditions. Track temperatures ranged from 22°C to 52°C and brief periods of rain were recorded on the final day of the test. The lower ambient and track temperatures on the final day of the test were a welcome change, as they allowed the riders to test the tyres in similar conditions to what can be expected for the Australian Grand Prix in October.\n\nBridgestone now heads to Qatar to support the final MotoGP™ pre-season test of 2014 at the Losail International Circuit from March 7-9.\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“This was a very positive test for Bridgestone as we achieved all our objectives. I would like to thank the riders and teams for all their hard work over the three days, as without them we couldn’t have achieved what we set out to do. Our primary focus was to find some suitable rear tyre options for this circuit, and out of the six experimental rear slicks we provided for the test, three options yielded some very encouraging results. These three rear slick options will now steer development for the race tyres we will provide for October’s Australian Grand Prix and following a successful three days, we are confident of delivering an allocation of tyres that will last the full-race distance while maintaining very high levels of safety and performance.”\n\nPhillip Island MotoGP™ tyre test – combined lap times\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nFastest lap\n\n\nGap\n\n\nTotal laps\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing\n\n\n1’29.068\n\n\n\n165\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nDani PEDROSA\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team\n\n\n1’29.381\n\n\n0.313\n\n\n178\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n1’29.387\n\n\n0.319\n\n\n136\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nValentino ROSSI\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing\n\n\n1’29.516\n\n\n0.448\n\n\n216\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n1’29.576\n\n\n0.508\n\n\n166\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

This products works by automatically dispersing small amount chain lubricant (also by Cameleon) to the chain in specific amount of time. You can set the time depending on the temperature and condition you are riding whether snow, hot, rain and so on. For example, you can set the time to 3 minutes, so that the chain lubricant will dispersed at that amount of time given.  \n\nThe benefit of auto chain oiler is that you’ll have a longer lasting chain and sprocket set. Also, this can also give a little increase in power delivery since the chain are now properly lubricated so there are less friction and heat generated by the chain and sprocket. You’ll have a safer ride too since the drive chain is in good condition most of the time. Even though this Cameleon Oiler is designed specifically for the superbikes, I think you can also use it on the kapcai and moped. The price is not cheap though.\n\nNow, ask yourself, when is the last time you oiled the chain of your bike?\nBTW, the price is at RM670.\nCameleon Oiler is available at http://www.qbee.com.my\nAdvertisements",

Rossi returned to form in spectacular fashion, taking his first GP victory for over two years in a faultless ride whilst teammate Lorenzo delivered a superhuman effort. The reigning World Champion underwent surgery on his collarbone following a free practice injury and then raced to an impressive fifth position just 36hrs later.   \nThe Sachsenring circuit has witnessed numerous victories for Rossi, the nine-time champion has taken a 250cc win in 1999 and four premier class MotoGP victories at the East German circuit in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2009. Lorenzo has yet to win at Sachsenring and will find the anti-clockwise circuit a challenge for his recently injured shoulder. Despite this the Mallorcan has the Championship firmly in mind and is yet again determined to give 100% on track.\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n“Sachsenring is going to be a little tough for me after the crash at Assen. It is true in Holland we achieved a stunning result for me, the team and also the Championship but I have to be realistic and I have still a long way to recover my collarbone. I made a huge effort to race at Assen and finally I could manage a really difficult weekend getting an astonishing fifth position. The situation is still that I need more time to fix the injury though. I won’t be at 100% in Germany but I’m pretty confident I can make a good weekend. At least I have had almost ten days to stay calm and improve a bit my physical condition. It will be difficult to compete another time but for sure I will push even harder than in Holland. The track is not one of my favourite tracks in the championship but at this level I don’t mind where we race. I have to give everything inside of me on each race.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n“I’m going to Sachsenring with a new spirit. I am very happy for the Holland race. Now I want to keep it going like that. We also want to confirm at Sachsenring the step we’ve made with the bike. We must continue to improve the bike, as we have done after testing at Aragon, because now we want to try to fight for important positions. We want to stay with the top guys every weekend. I really like Sachsenring and then there will be Laguna Seca. These will be two very important weekends.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“After the little drama at Assen finally Jorge got a terrific result, especially considering his physical condition after suffering a surgery to repair his broken collarbone then racing 38 hours later. Jorge made an incredible race at Assen, one of the most demanding tracks because of the layout. In Germany maybe it could be a little better for us. This circuit is not as fast as Assen and I think it is going to be easier for him to ride; it’s smoother with slow corners. The only problem is Jorge’s collarbone: it is still mending and he won’t be in a perfect shape. Anyway, for sure his physical condition will be better than in Holland and I guess he will be aiming to fight for the podium.”\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“In the last few years Sachsenring has not been one of our favourite circuits but we are arriving from three victories in a row so for sure we will start the weekend completely differently to the past. We are ready and hopefully Jorge’s shoulder will be in much better shape than last weekend. We go there with the intention to leave a mark.”\nAdvertisements",

The performance of this bike is on par with the Yamaha 135LC at 12.1ps/7500RPM which can be noticed by a more affordable version of of the liquid version 150cc engine used in the R15.

        "info \n\nHow Using Big Bore Cylinder helps to give More Power \n\n\nPosted on November 18, 2011November 18, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nAt first, I only thought that by using big bore block to your bike it can only increase the amount of fuel and air that gets into the combustion chamber. Since more fuel and air get burned inside the combustion chamber this will give more power for every power stroke. I thought that is the only way the power is affected. \nNow I know one more factor affecting the engine power by using big bore cylinder block that is about Compression Ratio. I have written about it here.\nBy using big bore block, you only increase the bore size, but the length of the stroke remain unchanged. When this happens, you actually increasing the compression ratio. Compression ratio is increased because you have bigger bore size with the same combustion chamber size between the TDC and the head. Higher compression ratio = higher power. That is why sometime we heard about conrod being broken when a rider upgrading their block to bigger bore size. This is due to the fact that high compression ratio will give higher stress to the engine parts especially the conrod. HISPEED from Thailand has a higher strength conrod for use with 135LC which have thicker rod construction for better handling of the stress of high compression ratio of the modified engine. IMO, if you upgrade your 135LC to 62mm cylinder block like the one from UMA Racing which is ceramic coated, the stress is still able to be endure by the stock conrod, but when you use bigger size bore like the 65mm X1R cylinder or the custom 71mm block, I think you need to use higher strength conrod. I also have heard about few 135LC riders use Modenas Jaguh 175cc conrod because of the strength of it.\nThis information is valid for all bike whether about Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki or any bikes. I only use 135LC as a reference.\nHope it helps you a bit!\nAdvertisements",

The low-setup cockpit position and adjustable backrest provide an enjoyable new riding feel. The instrument panel was designed to provide clear readability and the fun riding, as if the rider was experiencing part of a movie scene.\nLED lamps are used on the headlight of the powerful-looking front fairing, the tail lamp and the turn signals. In addition, the utility boxes are set up on the right and left sides of the front fairing for small articles.\nTwo NM4 types were unveiled at the motorcycle show; the simply-configured “NM4-01” which emphasizes its wide, dynamic rear tire and attractive low silhouette, and the “NM4-02” which emanates a unique presence and features a prominent rear design (containing utility boxes on each side of the rear body).\nThe NM4 will also be exhibited at the 41st Tokyo Motorcycle Show from Friday, March 28 to Sunday, March 30 at Tokyo Big Sight.  \nKey features of the NM4\n\n\n\n・Length×Width×Height (mm)\n2,380×810×1,170\n\n\n・Seat Height (mm)\n650\n\n\n・Engine Type\nLiquid-cooled 4-stroke OHC inline 2-cylinder engine\n\n\n・Displacement (cm3)\n745\n\n\n・Transmission\nDual Clutch Transmission (standard equipment)\n\n\n・Tires\nFront: 120/70ZR18M/C (59W)\nRear: 200/50ZR17M/C (75W)\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Following with him closely is the colourful guy we always know, Valentino Rossi, at 2.00.804, which differs at only 0.518. That is miliseconds, faster than the blink of the eye. \n\n\nRossi shows us his new AGV ‘double face’ helmet by Drudi Performance which shows the back of the helmet with design of his face inside the helmet. Creative and this could be the optical illusion for the riders at the back.\n\nNicky Hayden are now with Drive Aspar team handling the Honda machine. New sponsor and new ride, for a fresh start of year.\n\nAlso to be noticed is Yonny Hernandez from Colombia which is now sponsored by LS2 helmet with designs by SLGrafics. LS2 helmet user in Malaysia can feel proud too after this. The one Yonny use is the top-of-the-line CR1 FF396 Carbon.\n\nKarel Abraham here paces with the low ranking of lap times on Day 1, but I think, still win with the best helmet graphics for the test.\nGood luck guys!\nAdvertisements",

The body style choosen is the supersport styling to enables it to fully maximise the potential of its supercharged engine. In some blogs and magazines, they have been estimating the top speed of this bike is in excess of 250km/h. I think it can go more than that since Kawasaki has compare this bike to 1971 Ninja H2 that has been a media sensation and the highest top speed recorded at that time. So, if Kawasaki wanted the 2014 Ninja H2 to be as sensational as the 1971 Ninja H2, we can expect the power, the top speed to be phenomenal.\n\nNow, can Yamaha, Honda or even BMW brings the sensation back as much as we love what Kawasaki has done?

They compared the Michelin Pilot Street Radial against the stock tyre that is the IRC Roadwinner which is fitted to 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 250R. First, we tested the IRC Roadwinner for 15 minutes and switched to the Michelin Pilot Street Radial. On IRC Roadwinner the bike already feels good and easy to take the straights and corners at the track. Both of the bikes tested are using the recommended tyre pressure as on bike manufacturer suggests. After changing to Michelin Pilot Street Radial, the first thing that we notice that the bike have less vibrations and handle the straight nicely. Cornering is also good and the feedback from the steering is better without the jitter from the bumpy track.   \nThe tyre also has been demonstrated with wet grip test and the results in front eyes shown that the braking distance for dry and wet is almost the same. In fact, on 50km/h braking speed, the distance were only separated by 2-3 inches. That is very good performance for a tyre in this condition. Michelin achieved this by using a better tread pattern and addition of Silica to the tyre compounds that maximise the grip in wet condition.\nThe Pilot Street Radial are tested on two type motorcycle that is the Kawasaki Ninja 250R and the Honda CBR250R. Both of the bikes are tortured by the media and all of them are impressed with the performance and difference of the tyre as compared to the stock tyre.\nAnother test was the handling test as proposed for the Michelin Pilot Street tyre. Media are requested to finish the track exactly on 45.00s, no more no less. That was a challenging event at the day and the closest time was 44.75s and everyone was happy to see a rider almost achieving the target time.\nSome of the challenge were to balance on a plank of wood and not touching the feet to the ground. Before entering this plank of wood, many media has drop since there is the slow corner of obstacle that the rider needs to take.\n\nWe were also briefed about the Michelin Pilot Street before taking the handling track challenge to know how the tyre can benefit the rider in the city riding style.\nOther than that, we are also testing the Michelin Pilot Street on the track and happy to report that it works well. The cornering angle can be as low as it can before the bike hit the foot peg. The tyre grips well on the straight and take the corners nicely. If the foot peg is removed, the bike can be taken to lower lean angle.\nOne of the tester of the Michelin Pilot Street, Mr Norick is scraping the foot peg of the bike while taking corner on the track. As a conclusion, the Michelin Pilot Street and Pilot Street Radial performs very well. One of the most improved feature is the wet grip performance. It can now be the balanced tyre that can be taken on the road for high performance riding and at the same provide good grip also in the rainy days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

It was originally developed to overcome the long charging times associated with high inductance coils used in inductive ignition systems, making the ignition system more suitable for high engine speeds (for small engines, racing engines and rotary piston engines). Capacitor discharge ignition uses capacitor discharge current output to fire the spark plugs.\nHistory\nThe history of capacitor discharge ignition system can be traced back to the 1950s together with the development of other electronic ignition systems. The first commercial motorcycle using the CDI system was manufactured by Kawasaki.\nBy the end of 1960s, the US government made new laws enforcing strict emission standards. As a result, more and more electronic ignition systems were developed, and starting from 1970s all smaller engines installed CDI system to replace the contact point system, including Honda Cub which began to use AC-CDI system.\nThe basic principle\nMost ignition systems used in cars are inductive ignition systems, which are solely relying on the electric inductance at the coil to produce high-voltage electricity to the spark plugs as the magnetic field breaks down when the current to the primary coil winding is disconnected (disruptive discharge). In a CDI system, a charging circuit charges a high voltage capacitor, and during the ignition point the system stops charging the capacitor, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output to the ignition coil before reaching the spark plug.\nA typical CDI module consists of a small transformer, a charging circuit, a triggering circuit and a main capacitor. First, the system voltage is raised up to 400-600 V by a transformer inside the CDI module. Then, the electric current flows to the charging circuit and charges the capacitor. The rectifier inside the charging circuit prevents capacitor discharge before the ignition point. When the triggering circuit receives triggering signals, the triggering circuit stops the operation of the charging circuit, allowing the capacitor to discharge its output rapidly to the low inductance ignition coil, which increase the 400-600 V capacitor discharge to up to 40 kV at the secondary winding at the spark plug. When there’s no triggering signal, the charging circuit is re-connected to charge back the capacitor.\nThe amount of energy the CDI system can store for the generation of a spark is dependent on the voltage and capacitance of the capacitors used, but usually it’s around 50 mJ.\nMost CDI modules are generally of two types:\n\nAC-CDI – The AC-CDI module obtains its electricity source solely from the alternating current produced by the alternator. The AC-CDI system is the most basic CDI system which is widely used in small engines.\n\nNote that not all small engine ignition systems are CDI. Some older engines, and engines like older Briggs and Stratton use magneto ignition. The entire ignition system, coil and points, are under the magnetized flywheel.\nAnother sort of ignition system commonly used on small off-road motorcycles in the 1960s and 1970’s was called Energy Transfer. A coil under the flywheel generated a strong DC current pulse as the flywheel magnet moved over it. This DC current flowed through a wire to an ignition coil mounted outside of the engine. The points sometimes were under the flywheel for two-stroke engines, and commonly on the camshaft for four-stroke engines. This system worked like all Kettering (points/coil) ignition systems… the opening points trigger the collapse of the magnetic field in the ignition coil, producing a high voltage pulse which flows through the spark plug wire to the spark plug.\nIf the engine was rotated while examining the wave-form output of the coil with an oscilloscope, it would appear to be AC. But you must consider that since the charge-time of the coil corresponds to much less than a full revoltion of the crank, the coil really ‘sees’ only DC current for charging the external ignition coil.\nThere exist some electronic ignition systems that are not CDI. Some systems use a transistor to switch the charging current to the coil off and on at the appropriate times. This eliminated the problem of burned and worn points, and provided a hotter spark because of the faster voltage rise and collapse time in the ignition coil.\n\nDC-CDI – The DC-CDI module is powered by the battery, and therefore an additional DC/AC inverter circuit is included in the CDI module to raise the 12 V DC to 400-600 V DC, making the CDI module slightly larger. However, vehicles that use DC-CDI systems have more precise ignition timing and the engine can be started more easily when cold.\n\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of CDI\nA CDI system has a short charging time, a fast voltage rise (between 3 ~ 10 kV/μs) compared to typical inductive systems (300 ~ 500 V/μs) and a short spark duration limited to about 50-80 µs. The fast voltage rise makes CDI systems insensitive to shunt resistance, but the limited spark duration can for some applications be too short to provide reliable ignition. The insensitivity to shunt resistance and the ability to fire multiple sparks can provide improved cold starting ability.\nSince the CDI system only provides a short spark, it’s also possible to combine this ignition system with ionization measurement. This is done by connecting a low voltage (about 80 V) to the spark plug, except when fired. The current flow over the spark plug can then be used to calculate the temperature and pressure inside the cylinder.\n\nReferences\n\nBosch Automotive Handbook, 5th Edition\nhttp://www.mclarenelectronics.com/Products/All/App_Act_Ign.asp\nAn open-source CDI circuit based on 12V DC power supply\n\nThis article is quoted from Wikipedia.\nComing soon, how racing cdi unit can really boost up the performance of the engine.

A dramatic weekend dominated by complicated weather conditions meant the only dry set up time for today’s race was this morning in the final warm up session.\nLorenzo rose to the occasion, firing off the start line like a bullet in front of Yamaha’s home crowd to lead the race into the first laps. The Mallorcan was able to build a gap of nearly two seconds in the first three laps then saw it cut as championship rival Marc Marquez closed in. Marquez and Dani Pedrosa were able to get onto the heels of Lorenzo but unable to pass. The defending champion held on to the line to score his 51st Grand Prix victory, crossing the line just over three seconds clear of Marquez.\nTeammate Valentino Rossi made a great start to the race from the second row and tucked in behind Lorenzo in second position as the Japanese Grand prix got underway. Unfortunately a lack of braking power on turn 11 of the second lap caused him to run wide, allowing Marquez and Pedrosa past. He then got back on track but suffered the same issue the following lap, dropping down to 11th in the process. In typical Rossi fashion he then put his head down and made several passes as he fought back up the field to finish in sixth position.   \nThe stunning victory by Lorenzo brings him five points closer to Marquez. 13 points separate them now as they head to the final round in Valencia. Rossi increases his point score to 224 and remains in fourth place in the standings.\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – 1st / 42’34.291 / 24 laps\n“We chose the soft tyre and the others chose the hard tyre, we knew that at the end of the race we might have problems but finally I could push even more the lap times. The strategy could have been different but to take this win at the home of Honda makes me very happy.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – 6th / +24.637 / 24 laps\n“I made a great start but on the second lap when I arrived at turn 11 I had not enough power on the brakes and I went too deep and lost two positions. On the next lap it was the same. It was my mistake then because I should have remembered from the lap before that I didn’t have enough on the brakes. I couldn’t stay on the track and lost a lot of positions. After that I tried to do the maximum. My pace was quite good and think I could have been in fourth place but it wasn’t enough to get on the podium.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“A fantastic 200th victory for Yamaha. To do it here in Japan and with the state of the championship is great. The way the team worked together with jorge today with the tyre choice was great, it was risky but we went for it, and finally made the difference with it. It’s a big reward for a great season so far. We made two mistakes with the collarbone injuries but we are still alive in the championship standings so lets see what happens in Valencia.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“A perfect race in really difficult circumstances. We were able to capitalise on the best results even if the weekend started with much less track time and we knew we were in a place where our competitors were stronger than us. I think the team and Jorge did a fantastic job. We came here with the target to lead the practices and win the race and we were able to do that. It has been a really amazing weekend. To win in Motegi gives us double points! Unfortunately Vale made a couple of mistakes that compromised his race, he had a good start and could have finished much further in front. We are ready to fight in Valencia!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrutchlow prevails in exciting Tech 3 battle in Japan\n\nCal Crutchlow triumphed in an exciting duel with Monster Yamaha Tech 3 teammate Bradley Smith in today’s Japanese Grand Prix to claim a hard fought seventh position that secured the British rider the honour of finishing leading non-factory rider in 2013.\nWith only 45 minutes of dry track time available on a weather-hit weekend at the Twin Ring Motegi ahead of this afternoon’s 24-lap race, Crutchlow and Smith engaged in a thrilling battle in the first half of the race.\nIn easily the best conditions of the weekend, it was Smith who led the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 charge after he made another one of his super fast reactions off the line to rocket from 13th on the grid into the top six.\nSmith opted to race the extra soft compound Bridgestone rear tyre to boost his speed in the early laps and it was a strategy the paid off handsomely, as he hunted down Stefan Bradl for a place in the top five.\nA mistake by Valentino Rossi in the hard braking zone for Turn 11 on lap three elevated Smith into the top five and he then rode magnificently to keep hard charging Crutchlow at bay until lap nine.\nCrutchlow went for a different tyre selection strategy and the harder option rear tyre kept him firmly in contention for the top six until the final stages when he was unable to maintain a challenge to Rossi.\nCrutchlow’s seventh position moved him to 188-points in the Championship rankings and with just one race remaining, Alvaro Bautista can no longer catch him to claim the accolade of being the top non-factory rider this season.\nSmith’s brilliant ride to eighth saw him take a giant leap towards securing 10th in the overall World Championship standings, now he is 19-points clear of Aleix Espargaro.\nSmith’s impressive rookie season is certainly finishing strongly, with the 22-year-old claiming six top 10 finishes in the last seven races and he finished just over three seconds behind Crutchlow this afternoon.\nAfter a gruelling three-week world tour to Malaysia, Australia and Japan, the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team now heads back to Europe for a well-deserved rest ahead of the final race in Valencia on November 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow – 7th – 188 points\n“It was a very difficult race because from the first lap I realised I was having an issue with the front brake overheating and choosing the harder rear tyre was not the best choice. Bradley used the softer tyre and in the first few laps, the problem with the brake meant I was having to focus on not running into is the back. My tyre was good for the second half of the race and I could pass Bradley but when Valentino came through he was a bit faster. We were just missing a few things to be more competitive but even with the soft tyre like Lorenzo, I wasn’t going to be racing at his pace. He really did a great job. The positive is with today’s result assured the fifth position in the Championship, and my target before the first race was to finish best non-factory rider. Now we can go home and get some rest after a tough period before trying to end the season strongly in Valencia.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith – 8th – 107 points\n“I’m pleased with the eighth position. I knew it would be been a tricky race starting from 13th, but fortunately I made a good start and I was trying to push at my maximum right from the off so that I was able to follow Bradl during the first laps. We definitely made some improvements on a full fuel load during this weekend and it helped me a lot to find a good rhythm. I saw Valentino making a mistake at the beginning of the race, so I knew he might come back and I just tried to follow him when he passed me. Today was probably the smallest gap to the other satellite riders so far and that makes me happy, especially considering that we had just one dry session this morning to set the bike up. I’m pleased with the progress we made during the season and this 10th place seems to be safe and now I’m just looking forward to make a good race in Valencia to end the Championship on a high.”\n\n\n\n\nKatsuyuki Nakasuga Yamaha YSP Racing Team – 11th Time: +53.345 sec\n“My participation in the race this time was coupled with development responsibilities for the Yamaha YZR-M1 machine. Since my machine was fitted with test parts and I was able to finish the entire race successfully, I was able to provide the development team with a lot of good data. I believe that we have gotten a clear vision of things that need to be done and I think this is going to help next year’s YZR-M1 evolve into an even better machine. For the development team, this is our second time participating in a MotoGP race, following the one last year. I feel that this kind of experience helps build our motivation and contributes to making the machine even better. However, I must say that I was disappointed with my result in the race, I don’t think we were able to get the set-up as good as it should have been.”\nAdvertisements",

        "800cc\nf3\nF3 800\nmv agusta \n\n2013 MV Agusta F3 800 – bigger brethen of the F3 675 \n\n\nPosted on June 8, 2013June 8, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nMore power, more torque, more adrenaline. The result is a motorcycle with exceptional handling, an advanced electronics package and the new 800cc engine with 148 HP and 88 Nm of torque. Coupled with the incredibly low weight of 173 Kg, it offers a power to weight ratio that allows it to do battle directly with litre class Sportbikes.\nThe MV Agusta F3 675 redefined the concept of middleweight Supersport bikes with the perfect balance between engine and chassis. The engine is the epitome of Italian technology and the chassis offers class leading performance both on the road as well as at the track. The MV Agusta F3 800 pushes the boundaries of mid-range Supersport to Superbike replica level, revolutionising the sector with a bike that represents an undisputed technological and performance milestone.\nCHARACTERISTICS\n• Three-cylinder inline, 798 cc engine\n• Bore 79.0 mm, stroke 54.3 mm (+8.4 mm more than the F3 675)\n• Max. power 148 HP at 13,000 rpm (+20 HP more than the F3 675)\n• Max. torque 88Nm at 10,600 rpm\n• 13,500 rpm limiter\n• Slipper clutch\n• Dry weight: 173 kg (same as the F3 675)\n• Power-to-weight ratio: 1.17 kg/HP (-13.5% less than the F3 675, with a ratio of 1.35 kg/HP)\n• New front brake set up with Brembo monobloc calipers\n• Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsa Tyres  \n\nENGINE\nThe bore diameter remains unaltered at 79.0 mm; the stroke has been increased from 45.9 mm to 54.3 mm resulting in a displacement increase from 675cc to 798 cc. The power output increases an incredible value of 148 HP at 13,000 rpm coupled with a peak torque value of 88 Nm at 10,600 rpm. The rev limiter has been set to intervene at 13,500 rpm. The timing system is double overhead cam with four titanium valves per cylinder to benefit the high RPM performance. The fuel injectors are also new which guarantee a\nhigher flow rate and increased power compared to those of the F3 675.\nThe three-cylinder engine is the pinnacle of motorcycle engineering: it’s extremely light and compact (weighing just 52 kg) and uses a “closed-deck” shell mold cast crankcase with integrated cylinders. The water and oil circuits are integrated into the actual crankcase castings and their respective pumps are located inside the engine with obvious advantages in terms of styling as well as compactness. Among the innovations on this three-cylinder MV Agusta F3 800 is the counter-rotating crankshaft, a technical solution that prior to the F3 675 was only available on MotoGP motorcycles. The objective? To reduce the rotational inertia effect during quick directional changes and to improve the vehicle balance with the resulting ease of handling of the F3.\nThe considerably higher performance is reflected, for the same bike mass, in an increased power-to-weight ratio (1.17 kg/HP) compared to the F3 675. And that’s not all; the response to acceleration under all conditions as well as the smoothness of the power delivery at mid range rpm are remarkably improved. These two crucial factors immensely increase the pleasure of riding on the road and decreasing lap times on the track. The 148 HP power output translates into a top speed of around 269 km/h coupled with a modification to the final drive ratio which has been increased from 16/43 to 17/41. Lastly, the mechanical slipper clutch system designed and developed by MV Agusta allows the best performance to be achieved even under hard braking.\n\nELECTRONICS\nThe three-cylinder MV Agusta project has brought the most advanced electronics ever seen to the middleweight category. The MVICS (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) platform combines total electronic control of the throttle and throttle body with traction control. The Full Ride By Wire is to all intents and purposes the technological basis of the MVICS platform: the system makes it possible for the ideal throttle body aperture to be defined at any moment in time, so it is not dependent on the angular rotation of the twist grip. There are in fact no mechanical constraints between throttle and butterfly: the injection mapping and ignition are what defines the optimum fuel-air mix to give the best performance at all times and under all load conditions.\nThe MVICS offers a multimap approach, with three maps devised by MV Agusta technicians and one that can be fully customised by the rider, who mixes the parameters available to obtain the closest solution to his needs.\nTraction control is by now a vital pre-requisite: it uses the same operating criteria as the much admired system employed on the F3 675, with 8 different levels that are easily selected using the handlebar controls and the compact, fully digital, dashboard.\nCHASSIS\nThe excellent handling of the F3 675 are present on the MV Agusta F3 800. Beginning with the wheelbase of a mere 1,380 mm which is a record achievement that acts as the basis of the exceptional ease of handling of this revolutionary three-cylinder.\nThe frame is the result of a clever combination of a main structure in ALS tubular steel and a middle section comprised of a pair of cast aluminium side plates, as well as the extended swingarm (576.5 mm) which has been designed to provide maximum traction.\nThe sophisticated Marzocchi front forks with 43 mm diameter legs and 125 mm of stroke offers adjustable spring preload and both compression as well as rebound adjustment. The fork and shock valving is dedicated in order to take full advantage of the higher performance 800cc engine.\nThe Sachs mono-shock absorber with a travel of 123 mm has a separate piggyback nitrogen reservoir and is fully adjustable for spring preload, compression and rebound.

It comes in 3 variant that is CBR500R for sport concept, CB500F for naked concept and CB500X for crossover concept. I must say that one that interest me the most is the CB500F. This naked concept bike are made for daily use for road and some gravel action. Compared to the full-fairing sport concept CBR500R and all terrain CB500X, the CB500F is one of the most balanced.  \n2013 Honda CB500X\nI’m thinking to upgrade my trusted Yamaha 135LC to superbike and some of the models comes into my mind such as the popular Kawasaki Ninja 250R, the upcoming Z250 or Honda CBR250R, but why not upgrade to middleweight straight away? The middleweight are also one of the most battled segment in Malaysia. We can see the introduction of Yamaha XJ6 naked and Kawasaki ER6-n/f (to name a few). Honda Malaysia are said to bring this model too as some of the rumours I heard from forums and friends. This can be true since Boon Siew Honda are now very aggressive with their product placement. We just got PCX150, INTEGRA, NC700S, CRF250L and many more.\n2013 Honda CBR500R\nThe engine of this 500cc burner is made from the base CBR250R engine and modified for 500cc twin-cylinder engine. This engine should be a nice upgrade from the 250cc CBR250R engine since it is almost an all-new engine that modern enough to gives best performance and that same time follows the Euro IV emission standard. I’m hoping this could be a global model so that there can be lots of aftermarket parts to upgrade and enchance this 500cc trio.\nHonda CB500X\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonda CBR500R\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonda CB500F\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\n\n\nModel name\nCBR500R\nCB500F\nCB500X\n\n\nDimensions\n(L × W × H) (m)\n2.075 × 0.740 × 1.145\n2.075 × 0.780 × 1.060\n2.095 × 0.830 × 1.290\n\n\nWheelbase\n(m)\n1.410\n1.421\n\n\nGround clearance\n(m)\n0.140\n0.155\n0.170\n\n\nSeat height\n(m)\n0.790\n0.810\n\n\nCurb weight\n(kg)\n194\n192\n195\n\n\nEngine type\nLiquid-Cooled , parallel twin\n\n\nDisplacement\n(cm³)\n471\n\n\nBore × Stroke\n(mm)\n67 × 66.8\n\n\nCompression ratio\n10.7\n\n\nMaximum output\n(kW/rpm)\n35/8500\n\n\nMaximum torque\n(Nm/rpm)\n43/7000\n\n\nFuel consumption\n(km/l) (WMTC mode)\n27\n\n\nFuel supply system\nProgrammed fuel injection system (PGM-FI)\n\n\nStarter\nMotor\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n(l)\n15.7\n17.3\n\n\nClutch\nWet multi-plate type\n\n\nTransmission\n6-speed\n\n\nCaster angle/Trail\n(degree/mm)\n25.5°/101.9\n25.5°/102.6\n26.5°/108.0\n\n\nTire size\nFront\n120/70ZR17M/C\n\n\nRear\n160/60ZR17M/C\n\n\nBrakes\nFront\nSingle Wavy Disk, 320mm, 2 POT caliper\n\n\nRear\nSingle Wavy Disk, 240mm, 1 POT caliper\n\n\nSuspension\nFront\nTelescopic\n\n\nRear\nSwing arm (Pro-Link)\n\n\nFrame\nSteel, Diamond\n\n\n\nUPDATE: Already launched in Malaysia.

        "City Pro\nMichelin\nparts\ntyre \n\nMichelin City Pro motorcycle tyre at Motack, Penang – RM53-RM83 depends on sizes \n\n\nPosted on June 18, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nMICHELIN, the market leader in tyre technology has showcased its latest innovation in the\nAsian market with the new MICHELIN City Pro in a launch event on June 15 in Padang Kota\nLama in Penang, held in conjunction with the MOTACK 2014 and the Penang Bike Week\n2014.\nMICHELIN City Pro is the latest generation of Michelin motorcycle tyres especially designed\nfor intensive urban use and subjected to the most demanding of impacts and stresses. It is\nintended for small motorcycles of up to 150cc and big-wheeled scooters.\nWhether it is used by a city-dweller commuting to and from work, a courier or a delivery rider\nbattling through inner-city traffic jams on poor roads, the MICHELIN City Pro is perfectly\nadapted to the needs of its users.\nThe MICHELIN City Pro tyre offers three significant advances in comparison with its\npredecessor and rivals, namely unprecedented robustness to substantially reduce\npunctures, enhanced safety and longer life.  \nWith the combination of 3 reinforced protection plies in the tyre crown, Michelin’s tyre\ntechnologies has enable the MICHELIN City Pro to become a more robust tyre that is at\nleast 20% more puncture resistant compares to its closest competitor. Additionally, its\nspecifically developed rubber compound mixture ensures a 10 percent longer lifespan than\nrival tyres and its new tread pattern delivers enhanced grip on dry, wet and slippery\nsurfaces, ensuring safety.\nThe combination of these special features in the new MICHELIN City Pro, summed up as\ngreater strength, longer life and safety, is an achievement which embodies the MICHELIN\nTotal Performance design philosophy which seeks to maximize the multiple benefits in all\nthe areas of tyre performance simultaneously and uncompromisingly.\n\n“MICHELIN Overlap Technology (MOT) incorporates built-in protection in the form of three\nreinforced plies underneath the tread which is itself characterized by the thickness of the\nrubber used. This technology yields unprecedented results, since the MICHELIN City Pro\nimproves puncture-resistance by 20 percent compared to its best-performing rival.\nFurthermore, the new tyre MICHELIN City Pro has an outstanding mileage performance and\nthanks to its exceptional robustness, the tyre maintenance budget of your motorcycle will be\nreduced,” says Marketing Director for Two Wheels Asia, Varit Pakdeeyingyong.\n\n“This result was confirmed by an in-house test conducted by Michelin during a 444,000\nkilometer-long run in real world conditions with 48 motorcycles on the demanding streets of\nBangkok city: only one puncture recorded for every 100,000km covered and you can run to\nan outstanding average mileage of 20,000 kilometers with your tyre set,” Varit added.\nThe MICHELIN City Pro is the second new addition to Michelin’s motorcycle range in 2014\nafter the MICHELIN Pilot Road 4, and is available in no fewer than 21 sizes for wheels of\nbetween 14 and 18 inches and speed ratings ranging from ‘P’ (up to 150kph) to ‘S’ (up to\n180kph). The tyre is already available now at your neighborhood retail outlets.\nAdvertisements",
        "250cc\nKawasaki\nNinja 250 RR Mono \n\n2014 Kawasaki Ninja 250RR Mono single-cylinder engine based on KLX250? \n\n\nPosted on January 21, 2014January 21, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nKawasaki seems to be preparing a new 250cc bike for the year 2014 with a new configuration. Rumored as the Ninja 250 RR Mono, this bike will incorporated the single-cylinder 250cc engine based from the KLX250. The bore and stroke dimension of the KLX250 is 72.0 x 61.2mm which is more oversquare as compared to the CBR250R that is at 76.0 x 55mm. The longer stroke of the KLX250 will give a higher torque and this will reflect to a better town riding experience.  \nMy source in Malaysia tells me that this Ninja 250 RR Mono might come to Malaysia to replace the KRR-150ZX. My thinking is that there will be two 250cc from Kawasaki, if this single-cylinder makes its way here. The current price of the 2-cylinder Ninja 250 is RM22,589 (basic), so the single-cylinder Ninja 250 RR Mono should be priced around RM15-17k to differentiate itself. Kawasaki in Malaysia is already the bike of choice for 250cc segment with the presence of the Ninja 250 and also Z250.\nThe Ninja 250 RR Mono will be made in Indonesia and it is a good thing since we can have the CKD Asean tax import model which is much lower than the CBU tax. It is still rumors and we don’t actually know if this bike will be available in Malaysia.\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2014/01/10/info-gress-sinyalemen-kuat-mesin-ninja-250-rr-mono-ke-arah-mesin-klx-250/\nAdvertisements",

        "750cc\nBrutus 750\nCarbon E-Bike\nCaterham\nClassic E-Bike \n\nCaterham Group Launches Motorcycle Division \n\n\nPosted on November 25, 2013November 25, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nCaterham Brutus 750\nCaterham Group has launched its first ever motorcycle division – Caterham Bikes – at the International Motorcycle Exhibition (EICMA) in Milan.\nThree prototype products – the Brutus 750 (dubbed the ‘SUV of motorcycles’), Classic E-Bike (an all-electric, bike with retro styling) and the Carbon E-Bike (a premium electric bike inspired by F1 technology) – have been unveiled for launch throughout 2014 as part of the Group’s strategy of growth through intelligent partnerships.  \nCaterham Classic E-Bike\nThe arrival of Caterham Bikes is a natural extension to the expanding Caterham Group since the purchase of the historic Caterham Cars brand in April 2011 by Tony Fernandes and Dato’ Kamarudin Meranun.\nThe two-wheeled division joins Caterham F1 Team, Caterham Racing (GP2), Caterham Technology & Innovation, Caterham Composites and the latest arm, Caterham Moto Racing Team, in the rapidly growing Caterham family.\nCarrying Caterham’s DNA of British heritage, performance and intuitive handling characteristics, the new products will also adhere to the brand’s ethos of delivering ‘accessible fun’.\nThe iconic Caterham Seven sportscar is fondly referred to as the closest experience to motorcycle riding on four wheels so this move, the brand’s first foray into road bikes, is a natural step and follows the launch last month of the Caterham Moto2 race team.\nMirroring the business experience and strategy employed successfully by Tony Fernandes and Dato’ Kamarudin to make budget airline AirAsia the most profitable in the world, Caterham Bikes has allied itself with some of the brightest motorcycle entrepreneurs in Europe and Asia.\nThe new division will be spearheaded by Al-Ishsal Ishak as CEO. Ishsal comes to Caterham Bikes from his previous role with AirAsia as Group Head of Ancillary Income. The management team is made complete with Chief Designer Alessandro Tartarini, Chief Engineer Zeno Panarari, both known for their entrepreneurial spirit and product development prowess, along with businessman and ex-MotoGP racer, Andreas Leuthe who will head up the distribution and sales function.\nCaterham Carbon E-Bike\nProduction of the three launch bikes – all priced affordably – will begin as early as Spring 2014, with the Brutus 750 the first to be built, followed by the two electric bikes later in the year.\nThe Caterham Bikes business strategy caters for the growing global demand for environmentally-friendly and multi-purposed, two-wheeled vehicles. Beginning with the European, North and South American markets, the Group’s key growth market will be in Asia, reflecting the burgeoning demand for such vehicles across those territories.\nTony Fernandes, Co-Chairman of Caterham Group, said: “Our vision for Caterham Group has taken another step forward with the launch of Caterham Bikes. Expanding our interests into the two-wheeled market is another natural progression for us and is a good opportunity to showcase the breadth of knowledge, experience and creativity we have at our disposal across the Group, now in the two-wheeled world in addition to all of our other automotive, technology and innovation interests.”\nDato’ Kamarudin Meranun, Co-Chairman of Caterham Group, said: “Taking Caterham into the motorcycle business has been a key objective since day one of Caterham Group. We are establishing ourselves in markets where we can bring new thinking, innovative concepts and products that will be game-changers; Caterham Bikes does exactly that. Having launched our Moto2 team recently at the Malaysian Grand Prix, the launch of Caterham Bikes takes us from the track to the road – we have partnered with industry experts and we have long-terms plans for the business that are ambitious but achievable, the perfect mix for success.”\nIshak said: “We are realistic and honest enough to know that we’re not in the business of rivalling the establishment; we’re here to offer an alternative that befits the spirit of Caterham.\n“Just as the Caterham Seven is a motoring icon because of its unique design and engineering credibility, Caterham Bikes’ products will be aimed at a niche audience seeking exceptional quality, bespoke design flare and bikes easy enough for anyone to ride.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaterham Bikes’ three initial launch products, are as follows:\n–      Brutus 750 – described as the “SUV of motorcycles”, menacing in stance but surprisingly nimble to ride, the Brutus 750 can operate as a street bike, off-road machine or even a snowmobile (conversion in less than four hours). It is the first motorcycle with an automatic transmission and the first ever two-wheel SUV.\n–      Classic E-Bike – carrying uniquely retro styling for the rider with a penchant for a design harking back to the golden age of British motorcycling, this bike has a range of 40-80km and does not require the rider to have a licence in the EU\n–      Carbon E-Bike – a premium bike with modern styling inspired by F1 technology; a limited edition version featuring exclusive F1 input and materials is currently being explored\nAdvertisements",

Based on the response, MAA has projected that KLIMS13 will be a bigger show this year, with exhibitors taking up bigger space.\nKLIMS13 is revving up the automotive industry in Malaysia with the theme “Efficiency in Motion”. Elaborating on the theme, Aishah Ahmad said “The theme echoes the ethos of this era. Efficiency, whether in product designs or business operations, spurs the advancement of the auto industry. KLIMS13 aims to fuel the excitement for automobiles with showcases of cars which transcend boundaries where mobility meets efficiency, technology meets imagination, and design meets desire.”\nKLIMS is a prolific event which attracts massive attention in the country from a staunch following of car enthusiasts to the general public. The show is a conspectus of the car marques in Malaysia as well as a spectacle of concept cars and performance cars.

        "250cc\nKawasaki\nZ250 \n\n2013 Kawasaki Z250 unveiled in Malaysia – RM21,589 [UPDATED: Gallery, features and tech specs added] \n\n\nPosted on September 24, 2013October 5, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nIt is here finally and ready to make you think about it until you can’t sleep. The 2013 Kawasaki Z250 is definitely the bike we have been wanting for so long to be line up together with its sibling the Ninja 250R. The Z250 is the naked version of 250cc bike which should appeal riders who want to upgrade their kapcai for bigger capacity bike for daily commute.\n\nWhat’s great about naked bike is that the headlamp will follow the steering handle which should make it more ‘kapcai’-like feeling. Other than that, the fairingless bike shows it muscle rather than hidden enclosed in its sport type bike.  \nThe front end of the Z250 is unmistakebly Japanese style with a great influence of the Z800 which was launched earlier in Malaysia. This makes it being called ‘baby Z’ by some riders because of the resemblance. This kind of style might the next generation style of streetfighter in Kawasaki lineup.\n\nAt the rear, Kawasaki has finished the tail light really well that makes it looks minimalist but at the same time complements the overall look of the bike. It can be further enchanced by modifying the rear end to be fenderless.\nThe meter dashboard features a big half circle RPM meter to help you shifts gear at the optimum RPM range for torque delivery to the drive train. Speedometer are shown in the box on the right in big digital display to help you drive in on the proper speed when riding on the speed-limited public road.\nNow, let see on the inside. The 249cc engine block are sleeveless aluminium die-cast plating for better heat dissipation since there are no more ‘sleeve gap’ (or the area with minimum contact to the engine block). The piston are now anodized along with the larger oil pan from the new crank for better cooling of the engine. Sweet spot for the engine are from low-to-mid RPM. The improvements and increased torque on the low-to-mid RPM makes it worthy of the name Z.Fuel injection sytem of this Z250 uses dual throttle valve which is the same with Ninja 250. The benefit of this dual throttle valve is that it can precisely control the air intake to achieve natural linear response from all speed range that increase the combustion efficiency. Also, this increase fuel efficiency.Chassis are from high-tensile steel in the form of diamond shape to provide higher chassis stiffness. This will provide improved rigidity. Quality of the ride are also improved in term of smoothness with the application engine rubber mount to reduce the shock and vibration from the engine.\n2013 Kawasaki Z250 Malaysia Technical Specification:\n\nType of engine: 4 stroke, water cooled, twin parallel\nDisplacement: 249 cc\nBore x measures: 62.0 x 41.2 mm\nCompression ratio: 11.3:1\nValve system: DOHC, 8 valve\nFuel Supply: Fuel injection system with dual throttle valves\nIgnition: Digital\nStarter system: electric\nTransmission: 6-speed, return shift\nMaximum power: 23.5 kW (32 PS) / 11 000 rpm\nMaximum torque: 21.0 Nm / 10,000 rpm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013 Kawasaki Z250 price is RM21,589\nPicture of the launch credit to Nurhazah Ibrahim.\nAdvertisements",

When I get to see the suspension, I’m amused by the box which state ‘ Fat Shock Absorber”. Well, it really is. This Motor Star 2-spring is much ‘fatter’ than the stock Yamaha 115ZR gas suspension. It also got s that nice blue colour that really fits my Lagenda 115ZR.One of the good thing about this suspension is that it comes with 6-month warranty. That is the longest warranty I have ever seen for a moped bike suspension. I’m sure the manufacturer really trust the quality of it. I hope it really is.\n\nYou might want to know where this made, right? No worries. This suspension parts and material is sourced in Taiwan and final assembly is here in Malaysia. The price is at RM118 per pair which is good for a 6-month warranty parts. You should know that Motor Star is manufacturing the rear suspension here in Malaysia, which means that it is not being just import to be sold here. I’m now testing the Motor Star 2-spring suspension on my Lagenda 115ZR and will update you guys more about it soon.

I was thinking whether to include this bike or not on this blog because this blog is mostly about Yamaha cub bikes but I can’t resist the temptation given by Shogun 125 SP by Suzuki.\nWhen I was studying in secondary school, my father bought me a Suzuki Best 110. At that time, there were Yamaha SS 110 and RG Sports 110 as the contender to Best 110. So, I think it is also relevant to put it into this blog.\nThe wow element that I can find in this Shogun is on the installation of front and rear disc brake. Front and rear disc brake is very hard to find fitted on cub bikes. The bikes that I know have this kind of installation is Yamaha 125Z and Suzuki RGX 120 in Malaysia. In Thailand, it is a different story because they have a lot of cub bike fitted with front and rear disc brake like Honda Sonic, Honda Nova, Kawasaki Leostar, Yamaha X1R and many more.\nThe other good element in this Shogun is the availability of manual hand clutch which gives better acceleration and torque to the bike. The other bike that have manual hand clutch is Yamaha LC135ES only.\nThe sport rim is also my favourite because it features the Y-spoke. Y-spoke sport rims is used in many popular bike like Aprilia RS125 and Kawasaki Ninja ZX250R. Both which are also my favourite bike other than Yamaha.\nThe downside of this bike is the use of old style rear suspension which is still NOT monoshock. This make the overall looks of the bike look safe and nothing special. You can modified your LC135 to get front and rear disc brake, but it is much much harder to change the double shock system to monoshock system. One more thing is about the displacement(cc) of the Shogun. It is only 125cc where nowadays the buzzword is 135cc. I really think Suzuki need to do something about it.\nFor more information, head up to here.\nShogun 125 RR (Clutch auto) RM5,253.75\nShogun 125 SP (Clutch manual) RM5,400.25\n\n\nAdvertisements",

FIA-grade approved Buriram Circuit that held the penultimate round in 2014 will now stage the fourth and final round from the 27 to 30 August and second to sixth December respectively.\nMeanwhile the floodlit Losail Circuit in Doha, Qatar that held the grand finale for the past five seasons will now host the penultimate round (September 30 – October 3).  \nProvisional 2015 FIM Asia Road Racing Championship Race Calendar\nOfficial pre-season test – 1 to 3 April\nRound 1, Sepang, Malaysia – 16 to 19 April\nRound 2, Sentul, Indonesia – 4 to 7 June\nRound 3, Japan – 1 to 5 July\nRound 4, Buriram, Thailand  – 27-30 August\nRound 5, Losail, Qatar – 30 September to 3 October\nRound 6, Buriram, Thailand – 2 to 6 December\n \nAbout the FIM Asia Road Racing Championship\nBegun in 1996, the Asia Road Racing Championship has been bringing Asian motorcycle champions together onto the same platform for the past 20 seasons.\nYears of evolution have seen the Championship changing with the times. Today, the Asia Road Racing Championship races on a wide spectrum of production bikes ranging from the SuperSports 600cc, to the newly introduced 250cc open-make class, and the open-make Underbone 130cc bikes which is a unique heritage of South East Asian motorcycle racing. Added to the roster of open-make categories are two single-make developmental projects – Honda’s Asia Dream Cup that will be running into its fourth season in 2015 and the latest introduction to the ARRC format, the Suzuki Asia Challenge.\nThe objective of the Asia Road Racing Championship has remained constant in its 20-year history – to provide a stepping-stone for national champions to move up to the next level of racing.\nAlmost every rider in the Championship comes with an impressive resume of achievements and they come to measure their worth against that of their peers, all in the hopes of honing their skills in order to proceed to the world stage.\nAdvertisements",

The Monster family reaches a milestone 20 years of production in 2013 and what better way to mark the occasion than to celebrate it with the Ducati Monster Gatherings.\n\nThis gathering in Malaysia is the first of its kind.  A dedicated microsite has been launched recently on Ducati.com @ http://monstertales.ducati.com/en/monster-gathering. From Saturday 11th until 31st of May, participants of the Asia Ducati Monster Gathering are able to upload and share the picture of their fun ride as well as the funniest moments during the Penang gathering on the dedicated platform. The best shot will stand a chance to win two Ducati Tribune tickets for the upcoming MotoGP 2013 in Sepang. Meanwhile, the next Ducati gatherings are expected to be held this autumn in Europe.\n\n“Being an icon in the motorcycle world, means certainly evolution and loyalty to its original style at the same time: indeed the Monster has been renewed during the years, with new design and technologically advanced innovations and without losing its unique characteristics,” said Mr Pierfrancesco Scalzo, Commercial Director of Ducati Asia Pacific. \n\n“The most exciting addition to the Monster family is the Ducati Monster 795 ABS which launched in Malaysia this February by Ducati Corse Moto GP Team. It is engineered with high attention to safety-conscious detail ensuring the Monster’s cult status remains as authentic as ever. Until to-date, there have been more than 250,000 units of Ducati Monster sold worldwide,” he added.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "info\ntips\nwhy would bike smoke from exhaust \n\nKnowing Your 4-stroke Bike Engine Condition Through Exhaust Smoke \n\n\nPosted on December 17, 2008April 24, 2010 by eddy \n\n\nYamaha RX-Z Exhaust by YYPang\n1. Colourless or slightly blue smoke from exhaust\nThis means that your bike is very good condition. What you can assume is your fuel/air mixture is at the right composition and everything is well burnt is your combustion chamber.\n2. Yellow or brownish smoke from exhaust\nYour fuel/air mixture is too lean. Too lean means that there is low fuel but high air mixture in your combustion chamber.\nSolution: Adjust the fuel/air mixture at your carburetor (or ECU) accordingly.\n3. Black smoke from exhaust\nYour fuel/air mixture is too rich. High fuel but low air intake. This will reduce your fuel efficiency since the black smoke is your unburnt fuel.\nThe problem might be at this part:\ni. Your air filter is dirty or blocked from receiving air from surrounding.\nii.Your choke is closed\niii. Your carburetor is damaged\nSolution:\ni.Clean/replace air filter\nii.Open choke\niii.Repair/replace your carburetor.\n4. White smoke from exhaust\nThis happen when your engine oil gets into the combustion chamber.\nThe problem might be at this part:\ni. Piston ring is loose\nii. Piston is worn out\niii. Engine block is worn out/scratched\niv. Valve is worn out/damaged\nv. Valve line is worn out/scratched\nSolution:\ni. Replace piston ring\nii. Rebore block and replace piston\niii. same with no. ii\niv. Replace valve\nv. Rebore valve line and replace valve.\nSometimes white smoke can also occur in the morning or you start your bike after it is being left on the rain. The white smoke is the water vapour released from the condensation that happens inside your exhaust. Normally, this happens only for few minutes and then it will be back to colourless again. The difference from white water vapour smoke and white exhaust smoke is the smell. What I can say is, the smell from engine oil being burnt is your combustion chamber is bad and very busuk. Water vapour doesn’t have any smell.\nFor more information, you can search in Google.\nAdvertisements",

These bikes made Giacomo Agostini a motorcycling legend and have now re-emerged from the past thanks to the most faithful replica ever: the F3 800 AGO, packed with unsurpassed technology that provides jaw-dropping performance and unparalleled riding pleasure.\n\n\nElectronic engine and traction control play a pivotal role, ensuring the F3 800 AGO delivers tip-top performance at all times. Practical handlebar controls let the rider choose from among three different pre-set power delivery modes. And those hungry for more personalised performance will be delighted to hear that the F3 800 AGO allows configuration of the control parameters, including the traction control settings (8 levels, disengageable). \n\nThanks to the MVICS (Motor &Vehicle Integrated Control System), the rider has absolute control over the set-up process and can thus truly benefit from the exceptional versatility that brings out the technical qualities of the bike whatever the riding conditions, on the road and racetrack alike. Like a real racing bike, the F3 800 AGO even lets the rider choose – together with a host of other parameters – the ratio between throttle twist and throttle body opening.\n\nPerformance and safety go hand-in-hand even on the racetrack, which is why the F3 800 AGO features the sophisticated ABS Bosch 9MP with Race Mode and the RLM system, which prevents the rear wheel from lifting off the asphalt under hard braking. Awesome deceleration is ensured by a top-notch braking system, which features two 320 mm front discs, radially mounted Brembo monobloc 4-piston calipers and a 220 mm rear disc. The light, compact ABS system prevents any unwanted and potentially dangerous wheel lock while simultaneously ensuring the shortest possible braking distances under critical riding conditions (e.g. hard braking in the wet).\nPerfection is hidden in every detail: the alloy foot pegs, machined from solid aluminium, and other aluminium items make the F3 800 AGO a stunning example of function-focussed exclusivity. Every single component is carefully designed to make this MV Agusta even harder-hitting, faster and more sensational on road and track than ever.\nThe use of carbon fibre on the front and rear fenders gives the F3 800 AGO real racing panache, making the bike even lighter and enhancing the already excellent power-to-weight ratio. Another key contribution comes from the gorgeous forged rims, which save a full 2 kilograms compared to the standard version. A sports-style plate holder emphasises the flowing lines of the tail, underlining its thoroughbred racing pedigree.\nThe F3 800 AGO is unique in every detail. A silver plaque attached to the steering yoke shows a progressive number certifying that the F3 800 AGO is one of MV Agusta’s most exclusive creations. Only a limited edition of 300 such bikes will be manufactured and on each one the fuel tank will carry the personal autograph of 15-times world champion Giacomo Agostini. A tangible thrill, then, for MV Agusta devotees and fans of the world’s greatest-ever motorcyclist, to be experienced, quite literally, every time they sit astride the bike. Lastly, each of these incomparable bikes will be delivered together with a special certificate signed by Giacomo Agostini himself, providing additional proof of the uniqueness and originality of this latest MV Agusta legend.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord and text via: www.mvagusta.it\nAdvertisements",

Starting from second position on the grid the Yamaha Factory rider wasted no time in striking, diving up the inside of leader Dani Pedrosa through turn three and taking control of the race. The reigning World Champion kept Pedrosa and Marc Marquez close behind until the halfway point, then put the hammer down, delivering a series of untouchable laps to build a gap that had grown to nearly five and a half seconds as he crossed the finish line. The race win, Lorenzo’s 25th Premier Class victory, moves him to second position in the standings on 91 points, now just 12 behind Pedrosa in front and 14 ahead of Marquez in third.Home hero Valentino Rossi’s Mugello race proved to be the nightmare opposite of his teammate’s success story. The Italian nine-time World Champion came together with Alvaro Bautista between turns two and three on the first lap, coming off at high speed and into the air fences to the disappointment of the thousands of fans present. The resulting DNF leaves Rossi in sixth position in the Championship standings on 47 points.  \n\n \n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo, 1st\n“The conditions and the circumstances were good for us and I didn’t make a mistake, I made my best performance even if the conditions were much hotter than this morning. We are still struggling so much when the conditions get hotter. Anyway the key of the race was in the middle where I improved my riding, I was able to brake later with less fuel in the tank so I was able to improve the lap time by two tenths, from this moment Dani gave up a little pace and I could get away and win the race, more or less like last year. It’s very special; I won the last three years here so this track is magic for me and very positive for Yamaha. It also reminds us to keep working on the bike as at the tracks which are not so flowing like Mugello we will struggle. I’m very happy to give this win to Yamaha Motor Racing President Shigeto Kitagawa because this was his last race here in Grand Prix, as he will retire. He has done a great job for the team in the last years and it is a big loss for us. I hope he will enjoy the different life he will have. Our president Yanagi-san is also lucky for me, I won the 2010 Championship in Malaysia when he was there on the track and again today a victory with his presence.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi, DNF\n“Unfortunately in the start I had a problem with the clutch spinning and I lost two or three positions. Then I was attacking because we had a good pace and I was fast. On the second corner I was on the outside already in front of Bautista. For me, from the inside he opened the throttle to close the line so he doesn’t lose another position but I was already in front so he came to me and took me on the boot. I was lucky because it was a bad crash and I arrived at the wall but I’m ok. We will try next week in Barcelona, but it is a pity because firstly it is Mugello and secondly I think we could have done a good race and maybe arrived on the podium.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrutchlow storms to majestic Mugello podium\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 Team rider Cal Crutchlow stormed to a second successive podium in 2013 after a fantastic late attack in today’s Italian MotoGP race was rewarded with a richly deserved third position. The British rider quickly seized fourth position from former Monster Yamaha Tech 3 teammate Andrea Dovizioso on the second lap, but leading trio Jorge Lorenzo, Dani Pedrosa and Marc Marquez had already established a lead of over one second. Crutchlow showed tremendous fighting spirit and blistering speed in the second half of the 23-lap race to superbly cut into a big advantage held by Pedrosa and Marquez, who were locked in an exciting battle for second. The 27-year-old’s stunning charge paid off when Marquez was unfortunate to tumble out of second with just three laps remaining, just as Crutchlow was sizing up an attack on Pedrosa.With a brilliant third place secured to follow up his career best second in Le Mans last time out, Crutchlow called off his pursuit of Pedrosa to collect 16 priceless World Championship points that consolidated his fourth position in the rankings.\nAward for the bravest and most courageous ride of the day went to outstanding rookie Bradley Smith, who demonstrated amazing determination to bounce back from two heavy crashes ahead of the fifth round of the Championship. Nursing a nasty left hand injury after a heavy fall in Friday’s FP2, Smith suffered another bruising crash during this morning’s warm-up session. Way below his peak physical condition, it seems nothing can knock the 22-year-old’s confidence and he showed he has desire and determination to match his talent by riding his YZR-M1 machine to a heroic top 10.\nSmith, who will undergo skin graft surgery in San Marino to repair damage to his left little finger tomorrow (Monday), finished in ninth position and he will now begin a period of rest and recuperation to be in the best physical condition for the next race in Catalunya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow, 3rd\n“I am really happy to be back on the podium because Mugello is one of the blue riband races on the calendar and that makes it feel a bit more special. It is an awesome result and I have to pay a big tribute to my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew who did an incredible job this weekend. I’ve not felt comfortable on the bike but today they gave me a package that was really competitive. In the second half of the race I was really strong and consistent and I could see for the last 10 laps I had the pace that was bringing me closer to Dani and Marc. I was in a really fast and consistent rhythm but I hate to be gifted a podium like that. I’m sorry Marc crashed because he was doing an amazing job again but to be honest I felt I could have caught Dani and taken third anyway. When I saw Marc crash I slowed down to not risk losing a second podium in a row, which is a fantastic achievement for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team and me. I’m fourth in the Championship, top non-factory rider again, so it has been another great way to finish the weekend and continue our very strong start to the season.”\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith, 9th\n“To be honest ninth position was obviously a really good result considering the circumstances of today. This morning’s crash was the last thing I needed, so to be able to go the whole race distance with just one mistake was positive for me. I had a lot of problems with my left hand as well as with my wrist and it was magnified with Mugello being such physically demanding track. So I believe I did a really good job. It would have been good to beat (Aleix) Espargaro at the end but considering the whole weekend I should be satisfied with another top 10 result. After a very difficult weekend for my body I just need to rest as much as I can to put me in the best possible condition for Barcelona. We still learned a lot during these tough days, especially from the big crashes, but I suppose that’s all part of the game on my way to becoming a better MotoGP rider.”\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nYamaha and Valentino Rossi Set to Continue with Two-Year Contract Extension \n\n\nPosted on July 3, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Motor Co., Ltd is delighted to announce that it has signed a new two-year agreement with Valentino Rossi. The nine-time world champion will continue to race with Movistar Yamaha MotoGP for the 2015 and 2016 MotoGP World Championship seasons.\nThe announcement comes midway through an excellent season for the MotoGP veteran. Rossi currently sits in second in the standings having taken four second place finishes and a total of five podiums from eight races so far this year.\nLin Jarvis – Managing Director, Yamaha Motor Racing\n“I am very happy that we have concluded the agreement with Valentino for 2015 and 2016. Since his return to Yamaha in 2013 it’s been a very positive experience for everybody involved. After two difficult years ‘away from home’ Valentino returned last year, not only to us but also to his beloved YZR-M1. Fans of racing across the world were happy to see him rediscover his competitive performance and witness him take pleasure in riding and having fun again on two wheels. The “fun factor” is crucial to Valentino to get results – in fact when he first joined us in 2004 one of the most important motivations for his move to Yamaha was his desire to create an environment where he could enjoy racing. His enjoyment is obvious to all who meet him at the MotoGP events or who see him race on TV and is reflected in his excellent race results this year where he is currently in second position in the World Championship. We look forward to the next two and a half years together and it is our intention that Valentino will remain with Yamaha until the end of his sporting career and beyond.”\n\nValentino Rossi\n“I am very happy to announce that I have signed a new contract with Yamaha to continue together in MotoGP for the next two years. I am very proud of this announcement. It’s very important to me because I really enjoy working with my crew and all the guys from the team, both the Japanese and European members that have been with me almost my entire career. It’s great because this was my target; I wanted to continue, I am feeling good and I’m motivated to keep giving my best. I am very happy that I can keep riding my YZR-M1, that has been my love for so many years and will still be my love this year and the following two seasons. A big ‘Thank You’ to everybody, I will try to keep giving the maximum to arrive in front and make good races. Enjoy!”\n\nAdvertisements",

Crashed out in Lap 19\nChampionship Points: 31\nChampionship Standings: 11th\nMalaysian youngster, Hafizh Syahrin Abdullah failed to finish his Moto2 race for the first time this season at the Autodromo del Mugello in Italy when he crashed out with only 2 laps to go while sitting in 13th place. It was a very disappointing result for the PETRONAS Raceline Malaysia rider who had lost the precious championship points that could have lifted him to 9th overall in the rankings should he had completed the final two laps. With a tally of 31 points to his name, Hafizh dropped to 11th overall in the Moto2 world rankings.  \nRacing in front of a packed Italian crowd, Hafizh was unable to produce his lightning start and was pushed back to 20th position by the end of the first lap. However, the gutsy youngster fought back and continued to march on, taking several riders in front until he was in 11th position by the middle of the race. At this stage, the tyres were beginning to lose grip which forced Hafizh to ease off to salvage some points.\nUnfortunately, Hafizh struggled even further towards the end when he lost the front end and crashed out at Turn 4 on Lap 19. Luckily, the Malaysian rider is unhurt and the bike only suffered minor damages.\n“I am very disappointed with the results today. I struggled with tyre issues towards the end but I thought that I could still pass the two riders in front of me (Alex Rins and Alex Marquez). The front end suddenly bounced when I hit the brakes hard, forcing me to spend more time controlling the handle bars to settle the movements. Unfortunately, I was too hasty to catch the front boys – and that haste landed me in the gravel. I apologize to everyone as I had really wanted to do well. I hope that I can bounce back in two weeks time at Catalunya,” said Hafizh.\nThe race was won by Tito Rabat, Johann Zarco and Dominique Aegerter.\nMoto2 Race Results\n1.

        "700cc\nHonda\nNC700 \n\nHonda NC700 Series launch by Boon Siew Honda – NC700X DCT ABS – RM62,088, NC700S DCT ABS – RM58,088 \n\n\nPosted on January 16, 2013January 16, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nHonda NC700X in Malaysia\nKuala Lumpur, 16 January 2013 – Boon Siew Honda is leading the industry with a revolutionary way to ride through the introduction of the new NC700X and NC700S models.\nAccording to Mr Satoshi Okada, Managing Director and Chief Executive Offcer of Boon Siew Honda, the NC700 series, which consists of NC700X, NC700S and Integra (NC700D), reflect the company’s effort to introduce different categories of riding excitement to the local market, namely Naked Style, Fun-crossover and Mid Concept.\nNC700X\nA ‘New Concept Crossover’ designed for both city commute and off-road motoring\nNC700X offers the agile performance of an off-road bike with high standards of comfort, safety and convenience of a street bike. New beginners and experienced riders alike will find the NC700X fun yet practical. For new riders, the easy handling characteristics of NC700X make the crossover a joy to ride. The bike’s aspirated performance on the other hand promises a highly engaging experience for the seasoned riders.  \nSharing the same engineering platform with its NC700S counterpart, the NC700X is fitted with a liquid-cooled, in-line 2-cylinder 670cc engine. This purpose-built lightweight and compact powerplant offers excellent power delivery with strong levels of torque at low to medium rpm. To reduce fuel consumption, the engine was developed with PGM-FI fuel injection system and stoichiometric analysis, which delivers exact fuel/air ratio required for a complete combustion at all engine rpm. It meets the demands of today’s environmental concerns by being highly fuel-efficient (27.9 km/litre, tested in WMTC Mode) for a tank range of nearly 400km (tested in WMTC Mode) as well as low exhaust gas emissions that conforms to EURO 3 Standard.\nFor enhanced motoring enjoyment, the NC700X comes with an option of either a manual 6-speed transmission or Honda’s second generation Dual Clutch Transmission. The system offers both manual gear shifting and fully automatic functionality – Manual (MT) for inspiring control, Automatic (AT) with two settings: S for sporty riding and D for everyday use.\nIn terms of braking performance, the Combined Anti-lock Braking System (C-ABS) gets the job done with ease. It links the front and rear braking systems to optimise the pressure acting on each brake. The result is strong and safe deceleration. Additionally, C-ABS has full antilock functionality.\nWith its internal storage compartment, protective fairing and windscreen as well as commanding riding position, the NC700X is ready for anything, whether city or long distance riding.\nThe NC700X is available in Darkness Black Metallic, Digital Silver Metallic, Pearl Sunbeam White and Magna Red.\nHonda NC700S\nNC700S\n‘New Concept Fun Naked’ model for sophisticated thrill seekers\nNC700S is the product of a simple requirement: to deliver a motorcycle that is fun to ride and user-friendly at a reasonable price. It offers the practicality of a commuter together with the thrilling performance and distinctive style of a naked.\nAt the heart of NC700S is an all-new purpose-built engine. The liquid-cooled, in-line 2-cylinder 670cc engine is a space-saving unit with a low centre of gravity. It delivers excellent torque at low to medium engine rpm, combined with EURO 3 Standard compliant low gas emissions. The engine produces a peak power output of 35.0kW at 6,250rpm with excellent torque throughout the rev range peaking at 60.0 Nm at 4,750rpm. Fuel efficiency of 27.9km per litre (Dual Clutch Transmission type, tested in WMTC Mode) for a tank range of nearly 400km (tested in WMTC Mode) was achieved thanks to the utilization of PGM-FI fuel injection system and stoichiometric calculation. The power delivery is so linear and smooth that even riders new to mid-capacity engines can fully enjoy the strong level of performance.\nThe engine works with an optional second generation Dual Clutch Transmission, which provides the convenience of an automatic transmission with the option of a manual mode if desired. It uses two electronically controlled clutches to deliver fast and smooth transmission in three modes – Manual (MT), Automatic (AT) offers two settings: S for sportier riding and D for urban and highway use.\nLight in weight, dynamic performance with intuitive handling responses, the NC700S is a fun and easy to handle naked model for all levels of riding experience. All thanks to the combination of the steel diamond frame, cast aluminium 17″ wheels, and geometry setup. The low seat position adds to the accessibility of the machine, which puts riders of any physical size at ease since they can put a foot down whenever they need to.\nSuper braking performance is achieved through Combined ABS (C-ABS) with the extra reassurance of an Antilock Brake System (ABS). The C-ABS effectively balances front and rear braking control for smooth operation. At the same time, the ABS provides extra reassurance in unexpected or extreme situations.\nNC700S comes with an internal storage space large enough to hold a full-face helmet, digital multi-function instrument display, lightweight 17″ cast aluminium wheels and broad radial tyres (front 120/70, rear 160/60). The model is available in Seal Silver Metallic, Pearl Sunbeam White and Graphite Black.\nHonda NC700X Magna Red\nHonda NC700X Pearl Sunbeam White\nHonda NC700S Seal Silver Metallic\nHonda NC700X Digital Silver Metallic\nHonda NC700S Graphite Black\nHonda NC700X Darkness Black Metallic\nHonda NC700S Pearl Sunbeam White\n \nThe showroom price for NC700X (motorcycle only) is RM 53,988 (Standard edition) and RM62,088 (ABS with DCT version), while the NC700S is available for RM49,888 (Standard edition) and RM58,088 (ABS with DCT version).\nBoth NC700X and NC700S come with 2 years or 20,000km Manufacturing Warranty.\nFor more information, visit www.boonsiewhonda.com.my or call the Boon Siew Honda Toll-Free number at 1800-88-3993 (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm, except for public holidays).\nAdvertisements",

        "250cc\nHonda\nVTR Type LD\nVTR-F \n\n2014 Honda VTR Type LD 250 in Japan – the naked beauty Japs V-Twin machine – JPY598,320 (RM18,743.26) \n\n\nPosted on July 15, 2014July 15, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nHonda Japan released this beautiful naked machine based on the V-Twin VTR-F 250. The style of the fairingless VTR shows the beautiful red Trellis frame that is usually associated with the Italian bikes. Considering this is a high performance 250cc with liquid-cooled V-Twin engine, the naked setup here really looks interesting and different that the most bike chassis/engine setup that usually uses diamond frame with 1 or 2-cylinder parallel engine only.\nThere are very few details about the engine other than the 250cc V-Twin that we already know, but luckily we know the power generated by the engine. It is measured at 30ps (29hp) which is a healthy power from a 250cc engine. As a comparison, the CBR250R 1-cylinder engine can provide 27hp at its crank.\n\nThis one in red might confuses you with popular Italian model, the Ducati Monster M600. It got all that Italian flair that relates to V-Twin engine, short and stubby look and also the red Trellis frame. There are one great benefit from the Japanese machine as we always knows that is reliability, low-maintainance and cheaper that its Italian counterpart. Anyway, this Honda VTR Type LD have no competition from the Italian since there are no 250cc naked bike with this kind of style from there! \n\n\nThe meter cluster also has been totally redesigned to fit the Type LD naked street look with that dual round analog and digital meter. It is backlighted with red illumination with rev counter on the right and speedometer on the left. It is different that the VTR-F meter that features inverted triangle shape with big rev counter and digital speedo meter.\n\nSeat height also has been lowered to 740mm from 755mm for better ground footing. For a comparison, Ducati Hyperstrada seat height is 810mm, so this bike really sits very low. This can provide much more confident riding and easier to handle on heavy traffic condition.\n\nThe powertrain comes from this 250cc V-Twin liquid-cooled 4-stroke engine that is very unusual setup in this decade. So far, I think only Honda does this in 2014 for 250cc engine. Fuel delivery are taken care by the PGM-FI which ensures fuel efficiency and accurate fuel metering at any riding condition. The ECU also detects the crank angle position to provide smooth acceleration and agile throttle responses. The air intake and throttle body adopts the IACV (Intake Air Control Valve) to pursue the combustion efficiency by controlling the amount of the air intake to the cylinder. The manifold are configured in 2-to-1 setup and chamberless to produce a pleasant exhaust note. Also included is the catalytic converter and two O2 sensor to enchance the catalysation effect and provide precise air-fuel ratio. It is also for environmental consideration.\n\nThe frame choosen is the Trellis frame that separates the pivots point of the rear swing to the main frame. The rear swing now connected to the engine. Lightweight alloy are used to make sure the chassis are strong and at same time low in weight.\n\nThe front brake are equipped with dual-piston caliper with 296mm floating disc brake and the rear 220mm disc brake with 1-piston caliper. The wheel are nice with the 5-spoke Z-shaped cross section in lightweight alloy metal.\n\nStorage space are given a consideration here with ample space under the seat. Not much, but you can fit in glove, wallet and maybe your phone. There is also hook for you to hook up your travelling bag.\nOverall, this is a nice bike in terms of specs, design and uniqueness. Japanese riders must be happy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.honda.co.jp/VTR/performance/\n \nAdvertisements",

There are two parts of the Assist and Slipper clutch that is the Assist cam and Slipper cam. As you can see on the picture above, the Assist cam is in light green and the Slipper cam is in dark green.  Assist cam operates in normal operation to deliver the engine power to the transmission. The Assist cam have self-servo mechanism, so it will help the rider to feel lighter clutch operation.\nSlipper cam comes into action when the rear tyre is experiencing excessive braking or accidental gear drops that makes the tyre rotates faster than the clutch itself, so, the Slipper clutch will separates the clutch hub and operating plate apart. You’ll will feel less engine braking from the tyre since the rotation from the tyre is cut by the Slipper cam. For racing bikes with slipper clutch, there is a setting where you can set how much engine braking you want before the Slipper cam comes into action.\nvia: http://www.kawasaki-cp.khi.co.jp/technology/engine/tech_assist_n_slipper_clutch_e.html\nAdvertisements",

As for the teams and riders, they will need to work extra hard to get everything right in the first two practice sessions before the SuperPole,” he added.\nRiders competing in the Underbone 130cc welcomes the revised qualifying format, saying it brings about a new tactical element and increases the chances of upsets.\nAdvertisements",

The bike has amazing power but I’m slowly getting it under control.

It carries the tagline “Made of Champion” and features Marc Marquez with the Repsol edition CBR150R.\n \nThis is one of the interesting 150cc bike we can see to fight with R15 or the FZ150i. Featuring the Honda engineering prowess, the CBR150R comes equipped with PGM-FI 149.5cc 4-stroke DOHC 4-valve liquid-cooled engine. Paired with the engine is the sweet 6-speed transmission to give you better control to match the engine speed and the bike speed just in case you want to take for sportier riding or even getting it to the track attack.\nPersonally, I really hope Boon Siew Honda will brings this in for Malaysia market. We have been missing the 150cc supersports from Honda for so long.\n\nRear suspension are made to feature the Pro-Link system for better suspension on the road or even on the track. A welcome addition is the use of secure key shutter to make it harder for the one who wants it badly. For the Repsol edition, there is one thing that I can see on the brochure that is the Champion Accessories. This includes seater cowl, smoke visor, radiator cover, tank pad kit and also fuel lid pad. All are nicely design and should serve the purpose.\nPrice is estimated at IDR28.5million or RM7,686.\nVia: http://tmcblog.com/2014/09/07/brosur-all-new-cbr150r-silahkan-di-intip-sob/#more-67344\nAdvertisements",

        "115cc\nAddress\nsuzuki \n\n2015 Suzuki Address 115cc unveiled in Malaysia – RM4,788 (basic) \n\n\nPosted on May 7, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nSuzuki Address now available in Malaysia in the already great lineup of Suzuki automatic bikes. We have seen earlier the super simple automatic bike by Suzuki that is the Nex, which is a great fuel-efficient bike with powerful engine. The only thing that Nex riders are looking for is for more storage space as maybe a better fuel economy. All this has been addressed with Suzuki Address which comes with higher effiency fuel-injection system that manages to scale the bike to 53km/l. Suzuki also enlarges the fuel tank to massive 5.3 liter (this is massive in automatic bike category, Suzuki Nex is only 3.5 liter ooo). Based on the data from Suzuki ECER40 testing, this bike can go all the way to 276km just with one full tank.  \n\nUnderseat storage space is big enough so that you can fit a full face helmet with few riding gear inside it. When you are riding, the underseat storage is big enough to store your handphone, wallet and extra items so that it is protected from the water if there is raining condition.\n\nThe left front storage area can fit 600ml of capacity while the right side can fit 500ml capacity of storage. There is always a good thing for a scooter to have a big storage compartment.\n\nSuzuki Address comes with cast alloy wheel and fitted with a more durable tubeless tyre which is better as compared to the Suzuki Nex as the Nex only uses tube-type tyre.\n\nDifferent that the Suzuki Nex, the headlight are now attached to the more traditional setup that is on the handlebar, as opposed to the Suzuki Nex placement that is on the lower front fairing. Personally, I prefer this headlight handlebar position of this Suzuki Address.\n\nSuzuki Address comes with advanced fuel-injection system. This is what Suzuki says about it:\n\nSensors accurately detect throttle position, engine RPM, atmospheric pressure, intake pressure, engine temperature, muffler o2, and this data is aggregated in the ECU. SUZUKI’s ECU processes the data in real-time to calculate the optimal fuel suited for the riding condition.\nA narrower valve-angle and optimized air intake port create more vertical tumbling swirls that help combust fuel faster and more efficiently. Air-fuel mixture is further refined by increased number of injection holes and its design, which result in more precise fuel mixture.\n\n\nThe speedometer setup is simple and easy to read which always be a good thing. Anyway, I prefer to have a split signal indicator light not like the one in the meter above.\n\nYou can now lock the left brake (rear brake). This is a good thing especially when you have to park on a elevated and bumpy ground.\n\nSuzuki Address also comes in the red colour. This is the era for fuel injection bikes in Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015 Suzuki Address price is RM4,788 (basic and not including GST 6%).\nAdvertisements",

        "Moto3 \n\nSIC Racing Team first official test at Jerez Circuit \n\n\nPosted on November 14, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nIt was a historic day for the SIC Racing Team which took part in its first official test session at the Jerez Circuit yesterday. While wet conditions prevented a full blown test, the new Malaysian team’s riders, Zulfahmi Khairuddin and Jakub Kornfeil, managed to clock some valuable track time on Nov 13.  \nTeam manager, Johan Stiggefelt reported that due to the rain, the morning session was delayed until 11.30am. “We were on full wet tyres, as was everyone else. Fahmi was quite fast and did good laps in the wet. It was difficult to work on the long runs due to the wet, so we worked on the suspension settings and we found a good feeling for Fahmi,” said Stiggefelt.\nHe was pleased with Zulfahmi who was among the fastest Moto3 riders today when he posted a time of 2.00.5 before lunch on the KTM bike. The team then waited for the skies to clear up before heading out again. “We waited until 3.00pm to go out again so we could use the dry tyres. We went out on medium front and medium rear tyres.”\nStiggefelt explained that Fahmi stopped testing at 5.00pm to give way to Kornfeil. “The weather is not looking too good for the next and so we decided to rest Zulfahmi and give Jakup some time on the bike.”\nAt the end of the test, Zulfahmi’s best lap time was 1:49.5 while Czech Kornfeil was timed at 1:49.7. The fastest rider on Nov 13 was South African Brad Binder whose best was 1:47.8.\n“Overall it was a good test for us. We are learning the bike quite fast and I believe that at the end of three days of testing here, we will know what we need to know. We will be ready for the Sepang Test in February.”\nAdvertisements",

        "Honda\nmotogp \n\nRound 5: French MotoGP™ – Race Results: French victory makes it five in a row for Marquez \n\n\nPosted on May 19, 2014May 19, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Marc Marquez continued his relentless push for a second MotoGP™ World Championship as the Spaniard won his fifth race in a row with victory at the French Grand Prix at Le Mans.\nStarting from pole position, Marquez had a poor start and as the riders completed their first lap, found himself in tenth position. The reigning champion then increased his pace and made his way through the field, setting a new Circuit Record Lap time of 1’33.548 on lap eight, and then taking the race lead on lap twelve. Marquez’s constant pace led him to victory over Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi, who claimed his third second-place finish of the year. Taking third place was GO&FUN Honda Gresini’s Alvaro Bautista, who rode brilliantly to claim his first podium since the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix.\nThe track temperature today reached its highest level of the race weekend, with a figure of 46°C recorded in the final stages of the race. Race tyre choice amongst the riders was similar to that from yesterday’s Free Practice 4 session, with the soft compound front and rear slicks proving to be most popular. Only one rider selected the medium compound front slick for the race, the other twenty-one riders selected the soft compound front. Fourteen of the twenty-two starters opted for the soft compound rear slick, while eight riders selected the extra-soft rear that was available only to the Ducati and Open-class entrants. Despite the warmer than usual temperatures at Le Mans, tyre performance during race was excellent, with today’s French Grand Prix having the highest average speed ever recorded at this circuit.\nMarquez’s latest victory sees his lead in the championship over his teammate Dani Pedrosa increase to forty-three points. Rossi remains in third place in the rider standings, but now sits just two points behind Pedrosa after five rounds.\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“It’s been a while since we had a completely dry race weekend at Le Mans, and the constant fine weather gave riders plenty of time to find a setup to get the best performance out of the tyres. The pace this year was a big step forward from last year, but the riders also commented that the warm-up performance and safety of our tyres at Le Mans has also improved, so I am pleased with this result. New Circuit Best Lap, Race Lap and overall race time records were set this weekend at Le Mans. This is a very positive outcome for Bridgestone and shows that our revised tyre allocation for this circuit worked well for the riders.”\nMarc Marquez – Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“I enjoyed today quite a lot, particularly the early part of the race. Maybe I was too calm in the early laps, I knew my rhythm was good so maybe I had too much confidence. Then when Lorenzo overtook me, I started to go quick and overtaking many riders which I enjoyed. When I was in second place I saw Rossi in front so I pushed 100% and when I reached Valentino I thought it would be a fight to pass him, but he made a mistake which allowed me to get through. I’m really happy for my fifth victory in a row, and I want to enjoy this moment as even though it looked easy, it was difficult go get the win.”\nBridgestone slick compounds available: Front: Extra-Soft, Soft & Medium; Rear: Extra-soft, Soft & Medium (Asymmetric)\nBridgestone wet tyre compounds available: Soft (Main) & Hard (Alternative)\nWeather:  Dry.

        "1000cc\n1200cc\nBMW\nConcept Roadster \n\n2014 BMW “Concept Roadster” – BMW Roadster Revolution for the world to take notice \n\n\nPosted on May 27, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe aspirations of BMW Motorrad with regard to future generations of boxer-powered roadsters take concrete, emotionally charged shape at the Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este 2014 in the form of the BMW Concept Roadster. Last year BMW Motorrad presented the BMW Concept Ninety here – a modern interpretation of a classic BMW motorcycle with boxer engine that demonstrated just how emotional a retrospective on 90 years of BMW Motorrad can be. “By contrast, the contemporary emotional appeal of the BMW Concept Roadster shows that, as far as BMW is concerned, motorcycling is much more than just perfect function,” explains Edgar Heinrich, Head of BMW Motorrad Design.\n\nClassic values interpreted in modern style.\nThe BMW Concept Roadster is a typical BMW roadster with a powerful 2-cylinder boxer engine, single-sided swing arm with cardan drive and a light tubular space frame. It interprets these classic elements in the most state-of-the-art, dynamic form. “The BMW Concept Roadster is exciting to look and at least as exciting to ride,” says Ola Stenegard, Head of Vehicle Design BMW Motorrad, of the BMW Concept Roadster.  \n\nThe BMW boxer engine has always promised impressive performance and supreme power delivery across the entire engine speed range. In its latest generation it generates 92 kW (125 bhp) at 7,750 rpm from 1,170 cc with a maximum torque of 125 Nm at 6,500 rpm. The engine is also visually mid-point of the BMW Concept Roadster. The compact proportions with low front and high rear form a wedge-shaped silhouette around it which accelerates the bike even when stationary. The crouching posture with a powerful focus on the front wheel and the very short rear promise agile, light-footed handling. Split colouring makes for a visual separation of the dark engine area below and the light seating area above with the fuel tank and rear section. The dark bottom section moves the BMW Concept Roadster visually closer to the road surface, thereby emphasising a road-oriented riding experience. Meanwhile the lighter coloured upper section conveys lightness and a low visual centre of gravity.\n\nThe headlamp presents a modern, dynamic interpretation of the classic circular headlamp. Matted LED light banks in full LED technology shape the distinctive “face” of the BMW Concept Roadster, giving it an extremely technical look. What is more, the LED technology makes the headlamp mask flat and very light-looking from the side perspective. Behind it, a reduced instrument panel provides all the relevant information in exclusive, high-end style.\nEmotional surface configuration.\nThe interplay between the fuel tank, seat and radiator is modelled to perfection in flowing style. The experienced hands of the BMW modellers have given the surfaces an emotional quality that no computer would be capable of recreating. The surfaces provide a detailed reflection of the characteristics of the BMW Concept Roadster: the sculpturally designed fuel tank in Sparkling Light White expresses the forward-looking orientation and dynamic performance of the BMW Concept Roadster with its precise modelling. Its shape also provides an ergonomically perfect knee grip for optimum handling. A cover made of matted stainless steel adds a high-end yet robust accentuation at the centre of the fuel tank.\n\nLight and finely wrought – the aluminium rear.\nA striking highlight develops out of the fuel tank: the steep rear section made of gloss milled aluminium. The self-supporting rear structure is fashioned from a single piece, thereby enabling a very reduced and finely wrought rear element. The deliberately visible milling marks create a rough, almost industrial look which contrasts with the painted and anodised surfaces. The expressively modelled surfacing on the top and bottom of the rear element finely translates the emotional aspirations of the BMW Concept Roadster. The integrated single seat is borrowed visually from motor racing – a stylish interpretation of the bike’s dynamic ambitions. Meanwhile a Neon Yellow accent in the lower area of the seat cushion adds a bold dash of colour contrast underneath the perforated Alcantara leather. Additional colour accents in Neon Yellow are to be found on the valve covers and on the cooling ribs inside the air inlets of the side trim, further breaking up the overall view from the side. The tubular space frame provides a visual highlight as a load-bearing element in Sparkling Racing Blue, a highly expressive finish that lends a touch of modern sporty style to a traditional element of a boxer-powered BMW roadster. With the interplay of the typical BMW Motorrad white on the fuel tank along with the radiant blue, the tank and frame present a characteristic yet also contemporary interpretation of the traditional BMW Motorrad colours.\n\nPremium-quality milled aluminium parts.\nIn addition to the rear structure, there are other milled aluminium parts which underscore the technically sculptured look from the side perspective. The most prominent features here are the lateral air intakes. They are also made of gloss aluminium with milling marks and are shown to excellent effect against the black surfaces of the radiator. They trace a triangle open to the front which is formally based on the “gill” elements of the BMW supersports motorcycles. Performing the function of channelling air to the radiator, they also emphasise the dynamic gesture of the side. The cooling ribs in Neon Yellow inside them are only seen on closer inspection.\nOne particular detail is the valve covers made of milled aluminium: their three-dimensional shaping lends a forward orientation to the fuel tank surfaces, giving the BMW boxer engine a highly athletic look. In addition, a protection pad on the valve covers indicates that the BMW Concept Roadster can and should be taken round bends at an extreme banking angle. Inspired by the knee pads of a racing suit, it gives the BMW Concept Roadster a touch of motor racing flair. An accent in Neon Yellow further underscores this radical element.\n\nInnovation in form and function – the engine spoiler.\nForm and function are innovatively combined in the future-oriented engine spoiler. In the BMW Concept Roadster, it not only performs an aerodynamic function but also incorporates the entire front silencer. Along with the short, steep tailpipe of the exhaust system, the engine spoiler concentrates form and function around the engine. In doing so it emphasises the compact, dynamic statement of the side as well as the short rear. Over and above the high-end milled parts, the BMW Concept Roadster comprises nothing but the very best quality high-performance components. The fork tubes, rear shock absorber and brakes are elegantly set apart by their anodized colouring, giving the BMW Concept Roadster an exclusive touch of sporty flair.\nAdvertisements",

KTM website actually enables you to compare the specs of the bike you choose. In this case, I have check out the RC200 vs RC250 and added the Duke 250 just to see what else is different.\nOne of the most important thing that we want to see is how much the power differs and what is the bore x stroke comparison of the RC200 and RC250.\nWe can see that the KTM RC200 produces 25hp, while the RC250 comes with bigger output as expected at 31hp. That is 6hp increase which can provides better room for acceleration and enjoyment. The RC200 top speed is at 135km/h (as told by my RC200 rider friend), so, we can expect the RC250 to be topped at 150km/h maybe?  The RC200 and RC250 bore is the same at 72mm. It differs in the stroke length where RC200 is at 49mm and RC250 at 61.1mm. Is this the same engine and enlarged? No. The RC200 is based on RC125 engine and upsized to bigger displacement at 199.5cc. On the other hand, the RC250 is based on RC390 engine and downsized to 248.8cc. via: http://www.ktm.com/my/model-comparison/benefit//compare/Product.html\nAdvertisements",
        "motogp \n\nThe Aprilia RS-GP Project Makes Its Début at Sepang Test \n\n\nPosted on February 11, 2015 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe first three days of MotoGP 2015 testing have just come to an end at the Sepang circuit in Malaysia.\nEssential information was drawn from the “three days” of testing for the Aprilia Racing Team Gresini. The new RS-GP showed good potential which now needs to be completely refined. Compared to the previous version, which was developed on a base that the Aprilia Racing Department knew very well, the changes are such to require further checks.\nRomano Albesiano, Aprilia Racing Manager had this to say about the first tests at Sepang: “I can confirm what I said yesterday. The initial results are definitely positive, considering the fact that the new RS-GP is taking its first steps and that Aprilia’s return to MotoGP is a year ahead of schedule to fully develop the project during the course of the sport season. In order to grow we need to get into the mix with our rivals right away in race conditions, bearing in mind the difficulties that such a demanding new project will inevitably face.”\n\nThe Aprilia Racing Team Gresini is already looking toward the second round of tests, also scheduled at Sepang: “The next tests will certainly give us a clearer idea of our potential. These last few days we put the Aprilia bike on the track which will be the one we use this season and we collected an important amount of data that we will use to base our 2015 development on” added Romano Albesiano. “There were a lot of technical aspects to tackle, but that is quite normal considering the fact that this was the first shakedown. I’m sure we would feel less pressure if it were just us lapping on private tracks, but that wasn’t Aprilia’s intention.”\nFausto Gresini: “Considering the fact that the project is in its fledgling states and that right now we are obviously still not interested in lap times, I think that Bautista’s performance over these three days was positive. Keep in mind also that Sepang is also one of the most demanding and difficult tracks of the championship. After testing the new Aprilia RS-GP Alvaro decided to go back and focus on the 2014 version which is giving him a better feeling at the moment. Along with the mechanics he worked quite a lot on both fronts to gather a large amount of data which will be used by the Aprilia Racing engineers to develop the technical package. As for Melandri, we knew that it would not be easy for him to get used to a completely new technical situation. Marco needs to adapt his riding style to this type of tyre and we know that takes time. We have confidence in him. The important thing is that he stays focused and determined.”\nMarco Melandri and Alvaro Bautista, the riders who have the task of developing the new Aprilia MotoGP project, worked hard over the last three days, assessing new material and conducting comparison tests with the previous version of the bike. While the only change for Alvaro is the bike, Marco on the other hand had to adapt to a brand new environment with a very different technical package compared to the one he had last year.\nBautista stopped the clock with a best time of 2’01.924 out of a total of 157 laps, whereas Melandri took a total of 156 laps with his best one finishing at 2’03.641.\nAlvaro Bautista: “I’m quite pleased with these first three days of testing. The team worked well, giving me maximum support. On the first two days I conducted various comparisons between the bike used at the end of last year and the new RS-GP which, in any case, is still not giving me good sensations in terms of chassis performance. So on the last day I decided to focus on the 2014 version in order to gather as much data as possible and to allow the engineers to work in view of the next tests, scheduled at the end of the month. We worked a lot on the electronics and did various setup tests and I’m pleased with what we found. The important thing is that we know which areas need improvement. We gathered a lot of data so the result is positive. Aprilia is very committed. I’m confident for the next session.”\nMarco Melandri: “I admit that I was expecting a better début, but when we decided to take on this new adventure we knew that is would be a lot of hard work for us. I have to build a feeling with the bike completely from scratch. We need time and we need to think about what we found in these tests in order to improve as quickly as possible.”\nAdvertisements",

It has in five exciting colours to choose from. It can be a beautiful addition to your bike modification but what is more important is the function of it.\n\nMagnetic oil drain plug works differently than the normal oil drain plug since the normal one doesn’t have the magnetic features. Before I know about this Racing Boy magnetic drain plug, I have seen one for car use made by Skunk2 for Honda.\nHow do this magnetic oil drain plug can give benefit to your bike? It actually works by helping to attract all the metal debris that is contained inside the engine oil. The metal debris inside the engine oil can be contributed by the wear and tear of the piston, piston ring, bearing, crankshaft, connecting rod and anything inside the engine that is made from metal that moves. The metal debris are small and sometimes cannot be seen by naked eye. The effect of having metal debris inside your engine oil is like having sand paper in liquid form poured into your engine. It will further ‘sand’ out your engine parts and make the wear and tear become worse. By having the magnetic oil drain plug installed, hopefully all the metal debris will be attracted to the magnetic oil drain plug so it won’t harm your engine parts. Normal oil drain plug doesn’t do anything about the metal debris, so using magnetic oil drain plug can really benefit your bike’s engine.\nAfter you service your bike for oil change, you’ll also need to clean up the magnetic oil drain plug to remove the metal debris that has been stuck to it. This is to make sure the metal debris is removed from your engine oil and also to ensure the magnetic oil drain plug works at its optimum condition.\nKeeping your bike serviced on time and also by using this Racing Boy magnetic oil drain plug will help your bike in healthy condition for much more longer time.\nInterested to buy it.

        "helmet\nHonda\nparts\nX-Spirit II \n\n2014 SHOEI X-Spirit II Marquez Mt.Melo Full-face Helmet \n\n\nPosted on January 9, 2014January 9, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nSHOEI has comes out with 2014 Marquez Mt.Melo #93 in unusual light blue colour. Marc Marquez avatar is known as the ant, but in this helmet, I can’t see the ant anywhere in livery. The one helmet that Marquez always used is the one in red and white with the ant appear in the livery. Anyway, there is the #93 sign on the helmet that shows this road helmet gets the Marquez endorsement.\n\n\nLivery aside, the X-Spirit II is one of the best helmet available in terms of fit. This is due to the path that SHOEI choose to make it should fit to almost every rider head. Rather than making one outer shell size for XS-XXL, with differences only in padding for the fitment, what SHOEI did is to construct 4 outer shell to fit different sizes. The sizes are differentiated like this: 1) XS-S, 2) M, 3) L, 4) XL-XXL. So, what happens is that you’ll have a small outer shell when you choose XS, and you’ll get a bigger outer shell when you choose XXL. Usually, many manufacturers use only 1 size for the outer shell, and add the thickness of the padding to fit smaller head sizes. For bigger size, they minimise the thickness of the padding to fit the bigger head. The idea is to cut cost of manufacturing. SHOEI X-Spirit is a premium helmet, so they can use a much funds to make the perfect combination of the outer shell to fit different sizes.\nvia: http://www.shoei-europe.com/uk/products/X-SPIRIT-II/\nAdvertisements",
        "125cc\nYamaha\nYBR125 \n\n2014 Yamaha YBR125 in Europe – easy-going reliable performance bike \n\n\nPosted on December 10, 2013December 10, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Europe has bring in this beautiful machine of YBR125 which suits the easy-going rider who prefer simple bike with high reliability and low maintainance. It follows the naked style that adds the ease of maintainance since the engine is easily accessible without the fairing.\nThe engine is 125cc 4-stroke, air-cooled SOHC forward-inclined single cylinder engine with 2-valve. Bore and stroke is measured at 54.0 mm x 54.0 mm that makes this engine a square engine that can give a balance of speed and torque. Compression ratio is at 10.0:1. At 7.5kW (10.0PS) / 7,800RPM, this engine is moderately powered for the engine of its size, but this is due to the design that keeps the reliability high. Torque is at 9.6Nm / 6,000RPM.  \nEven the engine looks traditional in terms of specs, but it still comes with the fuel injection system to makes it compliant with the EURO gas emission. Transmission is handled by 5-speed gearbox that should adds more fun in riding this beauty.\nThe chassis is the usual diamond shaped frame that is always lightweight and rigid. Rear suspension is monoshock, so you’ll get a great and stable feel. For the brake system, the front uses 245mm disc plate gripped by single-piston caliper and the rear uses 130mm drum braking, which I think is good enough for this bike size and power.\nWhat’s more interesting about this bike is that it is equipped with large fuel tank that is 13 liter that should helps it to travel to a very long distance with fewer fuel station stops.\nFor Europe riders, all I can say is enjoy your ride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.yamaha-motor.eu/eu/products/motorcycles/roadster/ybr125.aspx?view=techspecs\nAdvertisements",

        "150cc\nvespa \n\n2015 Vespa Sprint launched in Malaysia – RM15,617.13 \n\n\nPosted on April 10, 2015March 11, 2016 by kesh \n\n\nNaza Premira launches new and sporty Vespa Sprint model at RM15,617.13. Malaysian distributor of Vespa scooters, Naza Premira Sdn Bhd, expanded its range for the local market this week following the launch of the new Vespa Sprint model.  \n\nPresent during the launch was Naza Two Wheels Division vice president Juan Chow Wee, Naza Premira Sdn Bhd’s Vice President II Farouk Faisal, and Piaggio Asia Pacific area sales manager Neri Miclaus. Also making a special appearance was local rap artist Altimet.\n\nThe Vespa Sprint is the spiritual successor to the Vespa S, with its arrival marking the return of the brand’s legendary ‘Vespino’ generation of sporty Vespas from the 60s and 70s era.\n\nThe Vespa Sprint differs from its siblings aesthetically as it features a sportier saddle design that is further accentuated by a black cover with a white line finish, and its unique retro square headlamp design as well. Refining its stance are modern touches such as the LED daytime running lights, its multi-function digital instrument panel, as well as a set of 12-inch aluminium alloy wheels.\n\nUnderneath, the Vespa Sprint features Vespa’s current generation of lightweight triple-valve (2 intake, 1 exhaust) 150cc SOHC single-cylinder four-stroke engine primed with fuel injection. The package is primed further with a free-wheel electric starter, followed by centrifugal clutch unit that optimises the mill’ fuel efficiency, granting the sprint the ability to travel up to 64km per litre of fuel at an average speed of 50km/h.\n\nAll this is encased in a redesigned frame, which now sees the battery moved into the central tunnel of the footrest instead. This has increased the under-seat compartment up to 16.6 litres, boosting the Vespa Sprint’s standard practicality features better.\n\nThe scooter’s structural engineering has also been improved without compromising on weight as the Vespa Sprint’s headstock rigidity and longitudinal bend have increased by 36% 154% respectively. This then grants the Vespa Sprint with enhanced safety and riding stability while maintaining its signature and familiar riding essence.\n\nAvailable in six paint schemes, the Vespa Sprint is priced at RM15,617.13 on-the-road inclusive of GST, road tax, and insurance costs. (Nett selling price with GST: RM15,028.68). In conjunction with the Vespa Sprint’s Malaysian launch, Naza Premira has also announced the start of a new Vespa Assist after-sales program.\n\nThe Vespa Assist programis supported by AAM bikers assists and will offer plenty of value-added services for all Vespa owners in Malaysia. These include 24-hour breakdown assistance, free-towing service (depending on zones), minor on-location repairs, as well as AAM Motor Insurance and Vehicle Inspection and Valuation Services. With the program, Vespa stands as the first brand in the local market to offer such for its customers.\nAs an added bonus, Naza Premira will reward customers who register their new Vespas starting April 1 this year with the Vespa Assist privileges for one year. The Vespa Assist service will commence in Malaysia starting April 10 and can be reached via its dedicated hotline number: 011-2203 1111.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nLorenzo Scores 50th Grand Prix Victory in Phillip Island Thriller \n\n\nPosted on October 20, 2013October 20, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nDefending world champion Jorge Lorenzo delivered a stunning ride today to win the Australian Grand Prix in a thrilling spectacle filled with drama. Teammate Valentino Rossi delivered another exciting performance, fighting to take third on the podium.\nFollowing concerns over the safety of the Bridgestone tyres to last full race distance the race was changed to incorporate a bike change at the ten-lap mark, with the total laps reduced to 19.\nThe start saw Lorenzo take the hole-shot from his pole position with riders Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa in hot pursuit. The reigning champion gave no quarter but was unable to pull away, the rivals staying within 0.5 of a second as they counted down to the pit stop. This itself turned into a bizarre event with potential consequences for the championship. Pedrosa pitted a lap early, Lorenzo pitted at the ten-lap mark and Marquez pitted a lap too late. As a result Marquez was given a black flag and disqualified and Pedrosa was forced to drop a position after crossing the white line on his pit lane exit.\nFurther disaster was also narrowly avoided when Marquez exited the pits just as Lorenzo passed down the straight at high speed, the two making contact into turn one. Luckily both were able to stay upright and continue. Lorenzo kept the pressure on and held the top spot for the remaining nine laps to claim the race win.\nRossi enjoyed yet another intense race long battle with rivals Cal Crutchlow and Alvaro Bautista. The three swapping positions in the fight for the last podium spot throughout the first ten laps and again in the following nine. Rossi completed a super fast pit stop, beating both out to gain two positions. As one of the most successful MotoGP riders of the modern era in Phillip Island it was never going to be easy for them to beat him, and they couldn’t. The Italian claimed third at the line to make it another double Yamaha podium.  \nThe result leaves Lorenzo now on 280 points, 18 behind Marquez as they head to Motegi for the final of the triple-headers. Rossi stays secure in fourth position on 214 points, 35 ahead of Crutchlow in fifth.\nJorge Lorenzo – 1st | 29’07.155 | 19 Laps\n“I’m really happy with this win, we’ve also been lucky because Marc made this mistake. Without that he would have been second or first because he was really fast today. So we’ve been lucky but we were unlucky in the middle of the championship so today is a balance. When I was entering the first corner Marc was exiting the pit at exactly the same time, the situation was almost impossible to avoid. I was braking a little later to open the line and I don’t think he was looking so much entering the corner so it was both our fault. Now we have options, if Marc keeps constant on the podium then it is impossible to win the championship but there are a lot of laps to go so anything could happen.\nIt’s unbelievable to have 50 Grand Prix victories at 26years old. It seems like only yesterday when I won in Brazil in 2003 but it’s been ten years. I’m very proud of it and hope to win some more in the future!”\nValentino Rossi – 3rd | +12.344 | 19 Laps\n“At the end the result was good, I’m so happy to be on the podium here at Phillip Island because it’s always a great pleasure and a great atmosphere. I tried to give the maximum, the race was very thrilling and I enjoyed it very much, especially because with the team we were able to do a very good job in the pit and gain two positions. I had a great battle with Cal, when I understood it was for the podium I tried to give the maximum. In the last half of the lap it started to rain which was very scary but at the end it was ok and a good result. We still need to work and improve to be faster for the next race.”\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“A perfect result, winning here is a dream for us after two tough races. With Marc making the mistake it opens the championship a little more as well. 18 points is a completely different story to nearly 40. We are very pleased with that.”\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“It has been an incredible race, Jorge didn’t make any mistakes and led from the first to the last lap, always pushing hard. It was also nice to have the flag to flag in dry conditions and we got a lot of points to close the gap. There is only 18 points between them now so the championship is more open. We are looking to Motegi now to keep going and close it more. Vale did another great race, another double podium which is a great result for Yamaha. We had some doubts before the start of the race on grip but we got a great result.”\nDouble top six for Crutchlow and Smith in Phillip Island thriller\nThe Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team celebrated a fantastic double top six finish for Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith in an action-packed and unique flag-to-flag MotoGP race at Phillip Island this afternoon.\nConcerns about excessive tyre wear on a new track surface meant the race was reduced to 19-laps on safety grounds, which included a mandatory pit stop for fresh Bridgestone rubber at the end of lap nine or 10. There was incredible drama and tension from start to finish and Crutchlow put up a tremendous fight to score his fifth rostrum of the campaign and second in succession at the super-fast Phillip Island track. The 27-year-old pulled into the pits to switch bikes at the end of the 10th lap and in a tense tussle with Valentino Rossi and Alvaro Bautista, the British rider fought for the podium right down to the final corner. As rain spots started to fall on the Phillip Island track on the final lap, Crutchlow missed out on his first podium since his second place in Germany by just over 0.1s, with Rossi claiming the final podium spot in front of a crowd of 31,500 enthralled fans.\nTeammate Bradley Smith stormed back into the top six for the first time since the German round after he made a sensational start to round 16. The 22-year-old got a stunning launch off the line and on the first lap he’d surged into fourth and was right on the back of leading Spanish trio Jorge Lorenzo, Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa. Smith gained precious experience after dicing it out with Rossi, Crutchlow and Bautista in the early stages and he employed a different strategy by opting to enter the pit lane at the end of lap nine. He was able to comfortably clinch a richly deserved top six finish and today’s performance gave a significant boost to his hopes of securing a top 10 World Championship finish, with his lead over Aleix Espargaro now 11-points with two races remaining.\nCrutchlow and Smith’s excellent display also moved the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team a step closer to clinching third in the Team World Championship standings.\nCal Crutchlow – 4th – 179 points\n“It was a bit of shame that I couldn’t finish on the podium today but to be honest I’d have only been there because of what happened to Marc. But I am happy because I rode really well. The problem once again was my start. I have got to work on that because once again today it wasn’t acceptable. The positive point is I had good consistency in the race and I was a lot faster than I expected to be given what had happened with the tyres over the weekend. It was good to race so close to Valentino on the factory Yamaha and I enjoyed it. It was a very hard but fair battle with him and Alvaro. I actually thought there was one more lap, but because I’d been so close to Valentino on the straight I’d not seen my pit board. I’d have liked to be on the podium but fourth is my best result for a few races and hopefully we can be strong in Japan next weekend.”\nBradley Smith – 6th – 99 points\n“Sixth position is a very good result and I got another really fast start. It was great to be right up there on the first lap and I could learn a lot in the early stages from the guys with much more experience. The setting we ran wasn’t ready to fight for the top six but I gave it my best shot. We damaged the rear tyre in the first run, so I tried to take it a bit steady in the second one. It has not been an easy weekend with a lot of drama and confusion surrounding the tyres, but my Monster Yamaha Tech 3 crew remained calm and concentrated throughout and it was good to pay them back with my first top six for a while.”\nvia: www.yamaha-racing.com\nAdvertisements",

What’s even better is that you can choose 4 sizes there from S(55cm), M(57cm), L(59cm) and XL(61cm) to really suit your head size. The M(57cm) is a good size for most riders in Malaysia where we usually got the size 60 for most of the helmet in the market right now. Some helmet in Malaysia have different feel in size even it is stated ‘SIZE 60’ on the label. For example, MS88 size 60 is much more smaller than Swan size 60. I’m not talking about the padding inside the helmet but the size of the helmet itself.  \nThe price for this helmet at RM1,288.00 is considered cheap compared to the one sold in Malaysia at RM2,500+. Anyway, you should be aware that this price is NOT including the shipping and the expensive tax for imported helmet.

        "250cc\n250R\n250RR Mono\n250SL\nKawasaki\nNinja RR Mono \n\nGallery: 2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono (250SL) launched in Indonesia – 250cc single-cylinder 28hp Ninja 150R successor – Rp. 39,9 million or MYR11,246.936 [UPDATED] \n\n\nPosted on February 15, 2014February 17, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nKawasaki Motor Indonesia finally have officially released Ninja RR Mono/250SL, the successor of their own 2-stroke Ninja 150R, as the world premiere of this global model. The name Ninja RR Mono or the Ninja 250SL is used in different market with different names but, carries no changes of the bike internals except for the minor changes of the livery graphics on the exterior. Ninja RR Mono will have its production in Indonesia for the global market.\n\nThe body comes with slim compact trellis chassis frame for strength and sportier handling of the bike but able to keep it low cost for the masses. Also seen there is the same wheel design which is used for the Ninja 250 2-cylinder that shows 10-spoke Y-shape wheel.\n\nHere is another view of the 10-spoke Y-shape wheel that is looking very nice.\n\nOverall design are made to be as sporty as its predecessor, Ninja 150R, which is based on super sports category. This mean it will have lower steering position for the rider to hug the tank and slips into the air bubble of the bike to avoid the wind.\n\n\nAs predicted, the engine comes from the KLX250 which is an engine from an expensive bike. This 1-cylinder 250cc engine are able to push out 28hp which is only less than 4hp compared to 250cc 2-cylinder engine of Ninja 250 at 32hp!\n\nThis could be a great engine that provide almost instant torque from low RPM and light enough to take it to the max RPM limit. Powerful, lightweight and torquey. But, what about its sound?\n\nKawasaki still adopts the hot air radiator deflector to deflect the heat away from the riders feet just like the way it is implemented on the Ninja 250 and the Z250.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of this bike is the used of Uni-Trak suspension that is identical to what racing bike uses. Honda have implemented the similar suspension setup with the name Prolink which is put on Honda CB150R Streetfire and CBR250R. Whether Unitrak or Prolink, this setup provide a better feel of the bike and improves the handling as the suspension can work nicely whether in low or high speed.\n\nKawasaki hasn’t left out the design of the meter to be modernised along with the modern looks of the bike. The meter cluster is luxurious and tasteful enough for modern rider. There is the big speed speedometer display. Above it is the rev counter. Clock, trip meter and fuel capacity indicator are also there too. On the sides there is battery fault, high beam, EFI fault, ABS and oil pressure indicator. It is a very informative meter cluster indeed. It can be further improved if they decide to put the gear indicator into it. The implementation of the gear indicator on the Suzuki GSX-R1000 is the best I have ever seen.\n\nModern bike needs modern technologies and this Ninja RR Mono comes with ABS brake system to aid the handling of the bike in difficult conditions. The brake comes with 2-piston caliper single disc brake system for the front and also 2-piston caliper disc brake system for the rear.\n\nKawasaki Motors Indonesia also prepared official optional parts like this windshield visor to keep the rider in the air bubble and avoid the wind easily.\n\nAlso optional, is this rear pillion seat cover to make the 250SL feels racier and sportier than the same bike on the side.\n\nOther than the usual plain colours, the Ninja RR Mono also comes in special livery graphics design, like the one above, in yellow with black and speed lines on the side fairing.\nAs of the title, Kawasaki Motors Indonesia replace the Ninja 150R 2-stroke with this bike Ninja RR Mono 4-stroke engine. In Malaysia, we heard rumors that Kawasaki Bajaj 200NS will replace the Ninja KRR-150ZX but tmcblog reports that this Ninja 250SL is a global model that will be exported to Thailand, Malaysia and the Asean market first before the rest of the world. If this Ninja 250SL and Bajaj Pulsar 200NS marketed in Malaysia at the same time, I’ll choose Ninja 250SL straightaway without thinking twice.\n2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono Non-ABS Pearl Shining Yellow with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono Non-ABS Pearl Stardust White with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono ABS Pearl Stardust White with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono Non-ABS Lime Green with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono ABS Passion Red with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono Non-ABS Passion Red with graphics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice of this Kawasaki Ninja RR Mono is at Indonesia Rp. 39,9 million or MYR11 246.936 Malaysian ringgits (the price is just conversion from Indonesia Rupiah, NOT the real price in Malaysia as this bike is still not available in Malaysia).

Not only is it the world’s fastest accelerating production motorcycle, but superb handling and balanced performance (care of advanced technology and numerous comfort features) ensure riders are equally at home carving up twisty roads in the hills, heading across the border to meet friends for lunch or deftly weaving through city traffic, as they are hurtling down the dragstrip. Offering customers an even greater premium experience, an Öhlins-equipped special edition model joins the line-up.\nThe Ninja ZX-14R proudly stands at the head of Kawasaki’s Ninja line-up, but its almighty performance makes it the King of All Sport Bikes.  \n\n\n\nAluminium monocoque frame\nKawasaki’s unique aluminium monocoque frame enables a slim overall package and offers a superb balance of rigidity and chassis flex. The new frame’s completely revised chassis rigidity was designed to harness the significantly greater output of the new engine.\n\n\n\n\nKawasaki’s most powerful mass-production motorcycle engine yet\nThe Ninja ZX-14R’s new 1,441 cm3 liquid-cooled, 4-stroke In-line Four engine boasts an increased displacement and thorough engine tuning to deliver heady levels of power and unrivalled acceleration.\nBore and Stroke are now 84 x 65 mm thanks to a 4 mm longer stroke.\n\nThe new engine offers more torque at all rpm, and substantially more power in the mid-high rpm range. Acceleration from 4,000 rpm and up is notably stronger.\n\n\n\n\nBack-torque limiter\nA first for this series, the easily adjustable back-torque limiting clutch facilitates smooth downshifts and helps prevent rear wheel hop, which becomes more likely with the engine’s increased torque.\n\n\n\n\nSlippery aerodynamics\nSculpted by the wind, the Ninja ZX-14R’s sophisticated bodywork offers high aerodynamic performance that reduces drag, and contributes to stability and wind protection at highway speeds.\n\nSportier handling\nElegant 10-spoke wheels offer significant weight savings over those of the predecessor. The front wheel is 360 g lighter and the rear wheel saves 1030 g, for a total reduction of 1.39 kg. The reduced rotational inertia and lower unsprung weight increase the bike’s flickability, contributing to sportier handling.\nStiffer springs for both the front fork and rear suspension deliver a firmer, sportier feel. Along with the new springs, damping settings were also revised to suit the significantly greater output. The result is improved absorption and road holding performance, contributing to both the bike’s sportier character as well as high-speed stability.\nRubber dampers added to the front fork contribute to firmer bottoming resistance.\n\n\n\n\nTriple petal disc brakes\n310 mm petal disc brakes, radial-mount front brake calipers and a radial-pump front brake master cylinder deliver impressive braking performance with superb feel.\nAluminium front disc inner rotors (200 mm) reduce unsprung weight while ensuring ideal rigidity.\nTechnical Specs:\n\n\nLiquid-cooled\n4-stroke In-Line Four\nDOHC 16-valve\nDigital Fuel Injection\n1,441 cm3\n6-speed\nKTRC\n265 kg / 268 kg (ABS model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: www.kawasaki-cp.khi.co.jp/mcy/street/14_zx1400ef_e.html\nAdvertisements",
        "info \n\nCompression Ratio: What is it and why you should know about it? \n\n\nPosted on October 12, 2011October 12, 2011 by eddy \n\n\nCompression Ratio Diagram\nI’m doing a little of research about the compression ratio since I have done a test drive for the Suzuki Axelo 125 for Kapcai magazine December issue. Suzuki Axelo 125 have higher compression ratio compared to most of other bike in the category of 125cc moped. So, what is compression ratio?\nI have a diagram above to show you what are the thing that you need to know before learning about the compression. Engine displacement or engine capacity (110cc or 125cc: this is engine capacity) are calculated from the bore and stroke that related to the TDC (Top Dead Center) and BDC (Bottom Dead Center). Above the TDC, there is small empty space between the piston and the engine head that contain the valve, that is being used for the combustion of the fuel and air.  \nLet say, the engine capacity is 100cc and the small empty space 10cc, so, you’ll get the ratio of the engine volume at 100cc:10cc. If we change the engine volume ratio to compression ratio, the bike actually have compression ratio of 10.0:1.0 or just 10:1.\nHigher compression ratio = more power because the more ‘kick’ the piston will give in every power stroke of the engine, but why don’t all the bike manufacturer make bikes with high compression ratio? For example, Suzuki Axelo 125 is at 9.6:1, Lagenda 115ZR is at 9.3:1 whereby Wave RS is only at 9.0:1. High compression ratio have its advantages and disadvantages. High compression ratio engine will definitely give more power, but at the same time it will exert more stress to the engine parts such as the piston, connecting rod, gear box and crankshaft. Most of racing engine do have high compression ratio. Have you ever heard the terms ‘skim head’? This mean the rider want to minimise the the space between the of the piston and the engine head. Sometime, valve pocket are made so that the piston does not hit the valve because the space between the piston at TDC are now closer to the valve. Skimming head really do increase the compression ratio but this need to be done carefully and with minimal increase like 1mm per skim work to avoid the damage if the piston hit the valve.\nEngines with low compression ratio are not all bad altogether. Low compression engine have its advantage in terms of engine reliability. There is low stress on the engine component, so you’ll have higher service mileage and longer lasting parts. Low compression are good for low maintainance cost. Most of Honda bikes have low compression ratio, but the Honda engineers has able to make low compression ratio engine to be on par with high compression engine of the same category. They have been using a lot of component with low friction like the introduction of roller rocker arm which is being used in Honda Wave Dash 110.\nI hope my writings can give a little insight to you about compression ratio, because I was once a dummy about this topic even I have great passion about bike and bike’s engine and that’s the reason why you should know about it.\nAdvertisements",

The design follows the princip of “modern stylish and masculine” that can be seen from the use of the big and macho fuel tank. Honda Verza 150 are said to be best choice for the entry-level sport bike because it provide great performance, fuel efficient dan affordably priced.\nThe power comes from 150cc 4-stroke SOHC single cylinder engine with PGM-FI and 5-speed transmission. That is already a great spec for this low price of the Verza. The engine are able to churn out 48km of riding for 1 liter of fuel based on the ECE R40 testing method. Top speed is only 110km/h but the beauty of the bike is this category is that we can easily modified the bike for bigger power when the performance parts starts flooding the market.\nThe rear suspension of this bike is using heavy duty twin suspension which are good enough to withstand the abuse of everyday riding activities. This suspension setup is choosen for durability and lower price compared to using the Pro-link suspension like the CB150R Streetfire. Other features includes magnetic key shutter, bank angle sensor which will cut off the engine when the bike is on the bank angle more than 60 degree. Also included is the sprocket chain stopper to keep the wheel from locking if the chain breaks.\nThe price for this Honda Verza 150 is Rp16,050,000.00 (RM5,021.37) for spoke wheel and Rp16,900,000.00 (RM5,287.60) for the alloy cast wheel. This is definitely cheaper than the 2013 Honda CB150R Streetfire that is at Rp22,350,000.00 (RM6992.78).\nvia: http://www.astra-honda.com/index.php/berita/view/473\nAdvertisements",

This model, YBR 125 is one of the model that I think Yamaha should bring to Malaysia. The styling is quite conservative and a little bit retro with round headlamp for the Greece model.\nI personally think that this bike can fill the gap between Yamaha RX-Z and Yamaha FZ-150i since RX-Z is a powerful 2-stroke lightweight bike and FZ is a heavy but fuel efficient 150cc 4-stroke bike. So, YBR-125 can balance this by having a lightweight bike, with the fuel efficiency of 4-stroke bike.\nAdvertisements",

        "Honda\nmotogp \n\nRound 5: French MotoGP™ – QP2 – Another outright lap record lands Marquez on pole in Le Mans \n\n\nPosted on May 17, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n2014 MotoGP World Championship, Round 5, Le Mans, 18th May 2014\nThere is no stopping Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez at the moment, as the Spanish star smashed the existing Le Mans outright circuit lap record by 0.605 seconds for his fifth pole position from the first five races of the season.\nWhile Marquez continued his stranglehold on the top qualifying position this year, starting second on the grid for tomorrow’s French Grand Prix will be Monster Yamaha Tech 3’s Pol Espargaro, with the MotoGP™ rookie claiming his first ever front-row start with a personal best lap time of 1’32.734. Andrea Dovizioso’s successful record at the Le Mans circuit continued today, as the Ducati rider was third in Qualifying Practice 2 with a time of 1’32.755.\nIn the time attack during Qualifying Practice 2, Marquez and Espargaro set their best time on the soft compound slicks front and rear, while Dovizioso used the soft compound front matched with the extra-soft rear slick.\nAs was the case yesterday, weather conditions today were warm and dry, with the peak track temperature of 45°C recorded during QP2. In the earlier Free Practice sessions, riders assessed a wide range of tyres to see which options were more suitable in the warmer than usual temperatures at Le Mans. During race simulations in FP4, almost every rider preferred the soft compound front slick, matched with their softer rear slick option; extra-soft for the Ducati and Open-class riders, soft for the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders. Coincidentally, as well as being more consistent over longer runs, this same tyre combination yielded the best performance over a single lap, hence it was used by most riders during their qualifying runs.\nThe twenty-eight lap French Grand Prix starts at 1400 local time tomorrow (GMT +1), with the next MotoGP™ session, the twenty-minute morning Warm Up commencing at 0940 local time.\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“Another day with perfect conditions gave the riders ample opportunity to try out all the slick tyre options and decide on their race tyre combinations. Although temperatures are warmer than we usually experience at Le Mans, this circuit isn’t demanding on tyres so most riders will opt for their softer rear slick option for the race. For the front tyre, the soft compound option seems to offer the best combination of cornering and braking performance, so I expect this to be widely used tomorrow. This year at Le Mans we’ve brought a new rear tyre allocation with a focus on improved warm-up and safety for the riders. However, it is plain to see that is also provided quite an improvement in performance which the riders, in particular Marc exploited to maximum effect. To beat the existing outright lap record by over half a second is an incredible achievement. Over longer runs, many riders are on a similar race pace so it should be a close contest tomorrow.”\nFrench MotoGP™ QP 2 times – Riders that qualified from QP1 shaded in gray\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nQP2 Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ\n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n1’32.042 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n1’32.734 \n\n\n0.692\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO \n\n\nDucati Team \n\n\n1’32.755 \n\n\n0.713\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nStefan BRADL \n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP \n\n\n1’32.846 \n\n\n0.804\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nValentino ROSSI \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n1’32.873 \n\n\n0.831\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nJorge LORENZO \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n1’32.899 \n\n\n0.857\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA \n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini \n\n\n1’33.006 \n\n\n0.964\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO \n\n\nNGM Forward Racing \n\n\n1’33.015 \n\n\n0.973\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nDani PEDROSA \n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n1’33.023 \n\n\n0.981\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nBradley SMITH \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n1’33.058 \n\n\n1.016\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE \n\n\nPramac Racing \n\n\n1’33.102 \n\n\n1.060\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW \n\n\nDucati Team \n\n\n1’33.315 \n\n\n1.273\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "Civic Type-R\nHonda \n\n2015 Honda Civic Type-R – turbocharged 2.0 liter i-VTEC engine with 280 PS \n\n\nPosted on October 3, 2014October 3, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n \n\nWith the automotive world about to descend on the 2014 Mondial de l’Automobile, Honda has released exciting new details about its eagerly anticipated Civic Type R.\nThe all-new hot hatch – due in European showrooms next year – will be the most extreme Type R yet, signaling the start of a new performance era for the brand.\nPower will come from a 2.0-liter i-VTEC engine from Honda’s Earth Dreams Technology series. Developing over 280 PS, it will deliver unmatched performance compared to any previous Type R car. That includes all generations of the Civic, plus the iconic performance-oriented versions of the Integra, Accord and even the NSX.  \n\nWhile complying with strict Euro 6 emissions regulations, this is a Honda Type R powerplant like no other. While its predecessors were naturally aspirated, the new unit benefits from a turbocharger, boosting low-end power delivery. Combined with the high-end performance that’s synonymous with Honda’s VTEC technology – and much-loved by enthusiastic Type R owners – they will deliver a sensational driving experience.\nSuehiro Hasshi, Large Project Leader for the Civic Type R at Honda R&D, commented: “Honda has had four Type R model derivatives – the Civic, Integra, Accord and NSX. The engine in this new Honda Civic Type R is unrivaled against all of them in terms of raw power, torque and engine response.”\n\nHasshi-san emphasized the car’s appeal will be far greater than a new high-performance engine under the bonnet. A number of engineering innovations and enhancements will make the new Civic Type R a true driver’s car, worthy of wearing the famous red ‘H’ badge.\nFor example, the Civic Type R will mark the debut of Honda’s new ‘+R’ button. Located to the side of the steering wheel, once pressed it activates ‘+R‘ mode for the most exhilarating driving experience. The engine response is heightened, with torque-mapping changed to a more aggressive and performance-focused setting. Steering becomes more responsive and, together with the new four-point Adaptive Damper System, delivers the ultimate handling experience.\nHasshi explained: “In default standard mode, the Civic Type R is exceptionally agile, an everyday sports  car with an enjoyable and fluid acceleration. The  ‘+R’ button brings out a more dynamic and athletic car for the driver, to set pulses racing. The difference in character is immense. The ‘+R’ mode is extreme; the car is ideal for track use and will be appreciated by the genuine sports-driving enthusiast.”\nAnother example of Honda’s innovative approach is the car’s ‘steer axis’. In order to deliver the power of the turbocharged 2.0-liter i-VTEC engine, the new Civic Type R’s front suspension system includes this additional mechanical system involving two supporting ‘kingpins’. They minimize torque steer and allows the driver to fully exploit the car’s exceptional driveability.\nFurthermore, a new four-point Adaptive Damper System has been developed specifically for the Civic Type R. It automatically adjusts the front and rear suspension damping force stiffness in a split second, based on driving conditions. This allows the new Civic Type R to provide a comfortable ride during cruising, yet become firm and agile when high-performance handling is required.\nThe new Civic Type R will follow in the footsteps of its predecessors with a six-speed manual transmission. The development team selected this option to maximize driving enjoyment.\nHasshi explained: “The manual transmission allows the drivers to select the gear they want, for example, down from fifth to third when approaching a corner. The concept of the new Civic Type R is to be the complete driver’s car so this was the best option.”\nThe all-new Civic Type R has been developed and engineered for European driving tastes. To be built at Honda’s state-of-the-art plant in Swindon, UK, it will arrive in dealerships during 2015.\nAll-new Honda Civic Type R: unrivaled against\nthe brand’s iconic performance flagship models\n\nUnmatched performance compared to all previous Type R cars, including Civic, Integra, Accord and NSX\nThrilling turbocharged 2.0 liter i-VTEC engine producing more than 280 PS, sets new standards on power, torque and engine response\nAll-new ‘+R’ mode for enhanced on-track driving thrills\nHigh-revving performance red-lining at 7,000 rpm, mated to slick-shifting six-speed manual transmission\nInnovative new four-point adaptive damper system delivers ultimate handling for enthusiastic driving\nAdditional ‘steer axis’ system minimizes torque steer for exceptional traction\nStriking luminous blue Type R Concept model shown on Honda stand\n\nvia: Official PR\nAdvertisements",

        "115cc\nNex 115\nsuzuki \n\nEdisi BM: Review Suzuki Nex 115 \n\n\nPosted on May 23, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\n‘Edisi BM’ is our new section that uses Malay language (or Bahasa Melayu hence the short: BM). Here is our first Edisi BM with the review of Suzuki Nex 115 which has appeared in Kapcai Magazine October 2012 bil. 123. I have requested from the editor, Ghani, for the permission to publish this review onto this blog. For international readers, you can use Google Translate to read it. Happy reading or Selamat Membaca!\nSuzuki Nex 115 – Keringkasan dalam kesempurnaan\nRingkas tetapi menghampiri kesempurnaan. Itulah ayat poyo gua bila bercerita mengenai skuter ini. Suzuki Nex merupakan skuter terbaru di pasaran yang pada mulanya gua tengok macam biasa-biasa saja. Tetapi setelah gua tengok iklan di majalah ni (Kapcai), blog di Indonesia dan Thailand, semua orang mengatakan bahawa skuter ini adalah antara yang terbaik dalam kelasnya. Bila gua periksa spesifikasi dan maklumat mengenai Nex ini, gua baru dapat tahu bahawa Nex ini mempunyai kuasa setinggi 6.9kW. Jumlah ini adalah besar berbanding dengan skuter lain malah lebih besar juga dibandingkan dengan moped lain yang mempunyai kapasiti enjin yang sama. Pada suatu masa dulu, gua masih ingat dengan kewujudan skuter yang popular dari Suzuki iaitu VS125 dan VR150 dimana pada masa itu skuter Suzuki cukup menguasai jalanraya kerana tidak ada skuter yang berkuasa setinggi itu di Malaysia. Kalau ada pun cuma Yamaha Pasola 50cc itu. Setelah beberapa dekad, penguasaan Suzuki semakin menurun kerana tiada model naik taraf skuter VS125 dan VR150 dalam jangkamasa yang lama. Kemudian, Suzuki terus cuba meneruskan lagenda skuter dengan pengenalan Skydrive dan Step 125. Namun begitu, pengenalan dua model tersebut akan diungguli oleh model Nex ini kerana gua mengagak bahawa Suzuki Nex ni akan jadi salah satu skuter terbaik Suzuki.  \n\nNex mempunyai ciri-ciri keseronokan yang kini sudah susah untuk dicari. Ia adalah sebuah skuter yang berkuasa tetapi amat menjimatkan. Perkara ini adalah cukup kontra bagi sebuah skuter malah gua tidak pernah percaya skuter boleh menjadi lagi jimat daripada moped. Ada sesetengah skuter yang hanya mampu bergerak sejauh 60-70km sahaja. Walaupun skuter biasanya mempunyai enjin sebesar 110cc, biasanya ia akan menggunakan minyak banyak daripada moped yang mempunyai cc yang sama sepertinya. Gua pun tak berapa pasti kenapa hal ini berlaku sebab pada mula gua kenal dunia skuter ni, gua ingat skuter ni memang jimat, rupanya tidak. Berdasarkan pemerhatian gua, gua ingat skuter ni kuat makan minyak sebab sistem gear automatiknya dan penggunaan tayar yang kecil yang menyebabkan tayar tersebut terpaksa berpusing dengan lebih banyak putaran untuk setiap kilometer. Tu anggapan gua jela.\n\nTapi halnya cukup berbeza dengan Suzuki Nex 115 ni. Suzuki Malaysia mengiklankan Nex ini mempunyai penjimatan petrol yang cukup bagus dalam kelasnya. Selepas gua baca iklan ni, gua agak musykil, tapi seperti yang gua beritahu tadi, blog di Indonesia dan Thailand memuji Suzuki Nex ini dari segi penjimatan minyaknya. Gua bernasib baik kerana dapat menguji skuter Nex ini setelah mendapat mesej daripada bro Ghani Arafatz. Suzuki Nex ini hadir dalam tiga warna iaitu Merah agak-agak pink, putih dan hijau. Semasa gua nak pergi ambil skuter ni, gua amatlah berharap bukan warna merah agak-agak pink tu yang Ghani nak bagi test. Sekali anggapan gua meleset kerana skuter tu memang warna merah agak-agak pink. Gua tak ada masalah dengan warna ni sebenarnya, cuma warna faveret gua adalah warna putih dan tambah-tambah plak dengan gua yang perasan macho, rasa macam pink ni terlalu sentimental Richard Clayderman gitu. Warna merah pink ni cantik jugak sebenarnya setelah gua amati lama-lama dan teramatlah sesuai bagi pemandu perempuan. Bukan hanya kerana warnanya sahaja tetapi juga disebabkan tempat duduknya yang lebih rendah daripada skuter-skuter yang lain. Ini akan memudahkan lu orang semua untuk naik dan turun daripada skuter ini dan amat senang semasa berhenti di lampu trafik. Kalau lu orang naik motokros macam Ghani tu, korang tau la apa perasaan terpaksa berjungkit untuk menahan motor lu orang daripada jatuh semasa berhenti di lampu trafik. Tambah-tambah kalau lampu trafik tu lambat nak hijau. Gua cuma nak buat perbandingan mengenai keselesaan Suzuki Nex yang mempunyai tempat duduk yang rendah dan motor yang mempunyai tempat duduk yang tinggi, lu orang jangan marah gua plak ye.\n\nSetelah gua redha menerima Suzuki Nex yang berwarna merah itu, gua pun memulakan ujian gua. Ujian yang paling gua nak tahu keputusannya adalah ujian penjimatan minyak. Odometer motor ni menunjukkan 420km semasa gua mula-mula ambil dan pengisian minyak seterusnya adalah pada odometer 519.7km. Namun begitu, setelah gua isi penuh tangki Nex ni, gua tengok baru 2.35liter yang diisi sedangkan kapasiti penuh tangki Nex ini adalah 3.5liter. Ini bermakna Suzuki Nex ini mampu bergerak dalam anggaran sejauh 120km dalam satu tangki penuh! Jumlah ini adalah salah satu jumlah cukup mengujakan gua sebagai penguji dan pemilik skuter sebelum ini. Hebat. Itu sebab gua cakap Suzuki Nex akan menggungguli Skydrive dan Step 125. Penjimatan petrolnya memang cukup hebat. Harus juga diberitahu kepada lu orang semua bahawa gua memang bawak skuter ni dengan keadaan ganas tanpa mempedulikan pemanduan gaya jimat tetapi masih lagi skuter ini mampu bergerak sejauh 100km lebih dengan satu tangki penuh.\n\nBagaimana dari segi kuasanya? Sebelum gua test skuter ni, ada 2 orang mekanik di tempat gua cakap yang Suzuki Nex ini antara skuter paling pikap yang pernah diorang bawak. Bila gua cakap macam ni, lu orang jangan ingat pikap motor ni macam motor Belang R150 pula sebab itu dah dalam kategori lain. Paling pikap disini bermaksud jika dibandingkan dengan skuter yang sekelas dengannya. Memang betul. Nex mempunyai kuasa sebesar 6.9kW yang sememangnya perlu dihormati dari enjin sekecil 115cc. Ada moped lain dengan 115cc cuma mempunyai 6.0kW. Apa yang lebih penting adalah kuasa ini memang dapat dirasai apabila anda menunggang Nex ini. Setelah Nex mula bergerak anda akan dapat rasa begitu senang untuk mencapai kelajuan sehingga 60-80km/j dan pada kelajuan ini enjin akan rasa begitu lembut dan deruan angin tidak begitu kuat. Gua memang suka bawa Nex dalam kelajuan ini sebab ia akan terasa begitu lincah dan senang nak mengambil selekoh. Kelajuan tertinggi bagi Nex ini juga adalah antara yang tertinggi bagi sebuah skuter iaitu 110km/j (untuk capai kelajuan ni, gua dah tunduk ala-ala cub prix). Gua juga ada mencuba untuk mendaki Bukit Jugra yang agak curam dengan Nex bersama anak gua dan hasilnya Nex ini cukup berkuasa untuk membawa gua naik ke puncak dengan tiada masalah. Malah, gua tak payah pun nak pulas minyak kuat-kuat. Masa gua test drive skuter ni di jalan raya, gua ada juga cuba potong 2 buah motor SS dan memang gua berjaya pun potong diorang. Memang cukup berkuasa Nex ni (tapi dalam hati gua, gua rasa penunggang SS tu bagi can kat gua je sebab nampak gua terdesak sangat nak potong diorang). Apa-apa pun, berhati-hati di jalanraya. Gua pun ingat orang tersayang semasa memandu uji Nex ni.\n\nSatu perkara lagi yang gua amat respek pada Nex ini adalah sistem suspensinya. Suspensi depan dan belakang Nex ini adalah disediakan oleh Showa seperti selalu yang dibuat oleh Suzuki. Gua percaya sistem suspensi yang dipasang pada Nex ini adalah yang terbaik pernah Suzuki buat untuk skuternya. Ia sempurna. Tidak terlalu keras dan tidak terlalu lembut. Cukup keras untuk lu orang ambil selekoh cecah tongkat motor dan cukup lembut untuk menyerap hentakan bonggol atau lubang atas jalanraya. Sebenarnya, gua rasa amat pelik dengan suspensi Showa ini sebab terlalu sempurna. Mungkin juga berat gua dalam 62kg sesuai dengan keadaan pelarasan suspensi ini menyebabkan gua dapat rasa kesempurnaannya. Gua juga ada cuba bawa ganas dengan melanggar bonggol dan membrek lambat untuk mengelak lubang, tetapi semuanya berjaya diserap dengan baik oleh suspensi Nex ini. Gua ucap terima kasih la pada Suzuki sebab menghasilkan pelarasan(setup) suspensi yang terbaik yang pernah gua rasa pada sebuah skuter.\n\nDulu gua pun ada skuter, suspensinya memang tak berapa sempurna sampai gua rasa nak patah je tulang belakang gua kalau terlanggar, jadi gua amat berpuas hati sistem suspensi Nex oleh Showa ni yang memberikan keselesaan yang terbaik dan pengendalian yang terbaik. Kalau lu orang tak percaya, test drive dulu motor ni. Sistem brek Nex juga amat baik walaupun cuma mempunyai sistem brek cakera 1-piston pada bahagian hadapan dan brek dram pada belakang. Salah satu faktor yang menyumbang kepada keberkesanan brek ini adalah disebabkan oleh berat Nex ini yang cukup ringan. Suzuki telah banyak berfikir untuk mengurangkan berat motor dan ini dapat dilihat dengan penggunaan rim 3 batang yang jarang digunakan oleh mana-mana skuter.\n\nMengenai rim ini, ia adalah buatan Enkei dengan tulisan D3, jadi rim ini pastinya ringan dan berketahanan tinggi. Gua dah banyak kali cuba untuk brek lambat, brek kecemasan dan brek biasa-biasa untuk mengujinya, dan hasilnya amat memuaskan hati. Kombinasi brek dan suspensi yang terbaik berjaya menghasilkan skuter yang dapat membrek dengan cemerlang dalam apa jua keadaan. Pada pendapat gua, brek yang cemerlang adalah amat penting sebab ini akan memberikan keyakinan kepada gua untuk menunggang skuter ini dalam kelajuan tinggi dengan pemikiran bahawa sistem breknya dapat berfungsi mengikut kehendak gua. Dari aspek pengendalian, Nex memang sudah menghampiri kesempurnaan bagi sebuah skuter. Seandainya Suzuki mengambil ciri-ciri terbaik Nex ini dan menghasilkan sebuah skuter 150cc, gua yakin era kegemilangan VR150 akan muncul kembali.\nApa yang gua tulis ni memang hadir tulus dari hati gua tanpa berselindung. Gua cuma amat berpuashati dengan skuter ni walaupun nampak ayat gua tu macam ayat salesman je. Lu orang test drive dulu Nex ni, pastu baru lu orang tahu apa yang gua tulis ni betul ke tidak.\n\nAda skuter laju, tapi tak jimat minyak. Ada yang jimat minyak, tapi tak berapa laju. Ada jugak yang tak laju tapi tak jimat minyak pun. Nex memberikan sedikit kelajuan dengan penjimatan minyak besar dan pada masa yang sama wujud dengan sistem suspensi yang terbaik yang gua rasa pernah ada pada skuter 115cc.\nNota tambahan:\nAda beberapa perkara yang perlu saya tambah dalam review ini. Perkara pertama adalah sifat ringkas Nex ini menyebabkan ia kekurangan ciri-ciri yang biasa ada pada skuter yang lain. Gua dapat lihat ketiadaan SSS (Side Stand Switch) yang ada pada Honda Icon dan Yamaha Ego. Ia juga tidak mempunyai ruang bawah tempat duduk (U-box) yang dapat menempatkan helmet seperti Honda Spacy. Bagaimanapun, Nex masih lagi merupakan satu skuter perlu diberi perhatian apabila anda mengutamakan prestasi, keselesaan dan penjimatan minyak terbaik.\nAdvertisements",

After doing research and referring to many sites, this is the REAL thing! One way to make sure that this is the REAL thing, KTM has released official studio images and information about the bike in its official website.\nThe presence of the KTM RC250 and Duke 250 is an interesting move since there has been a great competition in the category and KTM offering the 200cc bike seems a little bit strange. But, most the rider knows that KTM does not follow normal convention and they always do thing differently. This time they heard that you want the 250cc bike and now, it is.  \nWhat’s great about KTM is that they are able to make a powerful and great character single-cylinder engine. The engine excels in terms of power-to-weight ratio that improves handling and makes it better in cornering and acceleration after taking the corner. The 2015 KTM 250cc engine proves to be one of the great design by KTM. The engine weighs at 37.2kg and produces 31hp of maximum output @ 9,000RPM with 24Nm @ 7,250 RPM.\nCheck out the bikes at its official website here:\n2015 KTM RC250: http://www.ktm.com/my/supersport/rc-250/highlights.html#.VSoWMpOaFEG\n2015 KTM Duke 250: http://www.ktm.com/my/naked-bike/250duke/highlights.html#.VSoWSpOaFEE\nAdvertisements",

This time they have introduced new colour for the Ace 115 that is blue. Previously, Modenas Ace 115 comes in two colour choices that is Sand White and Fire Bricks(Red). After that they introduced a new colour that is the Ivory Green. That makes up 3 colour choices, now they are adding the blue that makes 4 colours to choose from. In my opinion, the livery design of this Ace 115 is one of the best Modenas has ever made. It has a great looking dynamic lines (lines that make the bikes look fast, even when standing still), simple and trendy.\n\n\nI personally like this bike and were thinking to get it sometime soon. The price at RM4,598 (not OTR) is very competitive for this kind of bike category with monoshock suspension and something that you must consider when you are in the market for it. The sport rims are also nicely thought and have that ‘fast and cool’ aura. Anyway, I have checked the quality of the welding of the bike rear swing arm and chassis and I’m not satisfied with it. I can only give 7/10 marks of their quality. When I say quality here, it is not about the the durability, but just about the quality of the finishing that is rough and looks like the it has been weld in a hurry. Durability is always good for Modenas, just that they need to up the quality of the finishing.\nThe set of pictures is sent by Ejuan Hunter. Thanks!\nAdvertisements",
        "motogp \n\nMotoGP Losail, Qatar Results: 1st Lorenzo, 2nd Rossi, 3rd Marquez \n\n\nPosted on April 8, 2013April 8, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha conquers the 1-2 podium with Lorenzo and Rossi separated by only half a second difference to place Rossi to 2nd place. The third position is held by Marquez who retains the competitiveness of Honda race machines. On other notes, Zulfahmi is on 6th position which is the improvement from his 7th position last year. I’m glad to see Yamaha and Honda still fighting for the MotoGP battle and also seeing Rossi getting his mojo back.  \nReigning MotoGP World Champion Jorge Lorenzo kicked off the defence of his title tonight in the best possible way, delivering a flawless ride under the floodlights of the Losail International Circuit to take a perfect victory in the Grand Prix of Qatar. Lorenzo put the hammer down from pole position, taking the hole-shot into turn one and never looking back. He remained untouchable throughout, dispatching the 22 laps in isolation with trademark efficiency to claim his first victory of the season and add 25 Championship points to his 2013 title bid.\nValentino Rossi proved he still hasn’t lost his magic in tonight’s race, thrilling fans with a sensational run to claim second on the podium, completing a Yamaha Factory Racing one-two finish with his teammate Lorenzo. Rossi made sure his first race back with Yamaha was one to be remembered, having started from seventh on the grid he quickly moved up to fourth only to mistime a pass on Andrea Dovizioso and drop back to seventh again. By lap eight he was charging back up the field, closing down a gap of over three seconds to catch the podium battle and join the fight for Qatar honours. The nine-time World Champion dispatched fellow Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow and Honda rival Dani Pedrosa before entering into a fantastic duel with MotoGP rookie Marc Marquez in the final laps for second place. Rossi emerged from the battle the victor, crossing the line in second position just under six seconds behind Lorenzo to take 20 Championship points.\nJorge Lorenzo 1st\n“Half an hour before the race I felt a little bit nervous so I had to really concentrate and relax on the grid. I knew it was going to be difficult to open a gap but I had to try, I made a good start and pushed more than 100%. In the beginning it was hard to open the gap as Pedrosa didn’t want to let me get away, he tried to stay with me but after six or seven laps I opened the gap which made me more confident to keep my pace. I’m very happy for Yamaha and happy for Valentino as he has now passed two difficult years.”\nValentino Rossi – 2nd\n“I’m more than happy, very happy indeed because it was my dream to come back with Yamaha. To arrive on the podium at the first race was my target from November and I put all my effort to arrive at the maximum here. It was a difficult weekend, especially yesterday in qualifying, but I know I had great pace so I tried to recover in the beginning but I made a mistake and I lost time. I had to do a great second part of the race and step by step I came close to my podium. In the end there was a great battle, especially with Marc for the second place. I’m so happy for me, for my team, for my friends and all my fans who stay with me through two difficult years and also for Yamaha, to start the season with first and second place is not so bad!”\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“What a terrific start to the season, we are of course very pleased with the result. There are 17 races to go and it looks like it will be a fantastic season. The first race is always quite important to get a little advantage and have a good feeling. To have your first win for Jorge and of course second.\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“I have to say that this weekend started very well and finished even better. We couldn’t expect anything more. We won the race with a big gap and we finished second with Vale after he made an incredible comeback. I think the team did a really great job since Sepang test one, making the bike better and better and I thin this result is the icing on the cake. Everyone put in a lot of effort so I have to make a big thank you to then all. This is the best way to start the season and we won’t give up to until the end.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2013 MotoGP Qatar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLosail Circuit 02/04/2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrace I\n\n\n1\nJorge Lorenzo\nYamaha\nESP\n42’39.802\n\n\n2\nValentino Rossi\nYamaha\nITA\n0’05.990\n\n\n3\nMarquez Marc\nHonda\nESP\n0’06.201\n\n\n4\nDaniel Pedrosa\nHonda\nESP\n0’09.473\n\n\n5\nCal Crutchlow\nYamaha\nGBR\n0’18.764\n\n\n6\nAlvaro Bautista\nHonda\nESP\n0’22.148\n\n\n7\nAndrea Dovizioso\nDucati\nITA\n0’24.355\n\n\n8\nNicky Hayden\nDucati\nUSA\n0’24.920\n\n\n9\nAndrea Iannone\nDucati\nITA\n0’37.124\n\n\n10\nBen Spies\nDucati\nUSA\n0’44.908\n\n\n11\nAleix Espargaro\nART\nESP\n0’49.809\n\n\n12\nRandy De Puniet\nART\nFRA\n0’56.495\n\n\n13\nHector Barbera\nFTR\nESP\n1’09.599\n\n\n14\nYonny Hernandez\nART\nCOL\n1’10.742\n\n\n15\nHiroshi Aoyama\nFTR\nJPN\n1’13.600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMotoGP World Standing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRider Standings\nAfter Race 1 of 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nJorge Lorenzo\nYamaha\nESP\n25\n\n\n2.\nValentino Rossi\nYamaha\nITA\n20\n\n\n3.\nMarquez Marc\nHonda\nESP\n16\n\n\n4.\nDaniel Pedrosa\nHonda\nESP\n13\n\n\n5.\nCal Crutchlow\nYamaha\nGBR\n11\n\n\n6.\nAlvaro Bautista\nHonda\nESP\n10\n\n\n7.\nAndrea Dovizioso\nDucati\nITA\n9\n\n\n8.\nNicky Hayden\nDucati\nUSA\n8\n\n\n9.\nAndrea Iannone\nDucati\nITA\n7\n\n\n10.\nBen Spies\nDucati\nUSA\n6\n\n\n11.\nAleix Espargaro\nART\nESP\n5\n\n\n12.\nRandy De Puniet\nART\nFRA\n4\n\n\n13.\nHector Barbera\nFTR\nESP\n3\n\n\n14.\nYonny Hernandez\nART\nCOL\n2\n\n\n15.\nHiroshi Aoyama\nFTR\nJPN\n1\n\n\n\nCircuit Length:\n5380\nLap Record:\n1’55.537\n(Casey Stoner, 1-1-2009)\nFastest Lap Ever:\n1’53.927\n(Jorge Lorenzo, 9-3-2008)\nLast Years Winner:\nJorge Lorenzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManufacturer Standings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/04/2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nYamaha\n25\n\n\n2\nHonda\n16\n\n\n3\nDucati\n9\n\n\n4\nART\n5\n\n\n5\nFTR\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Standings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n02/04/2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\nYamaha Factory Racing MotoGP Team\n45\n\n\n2.\nRepsol Honda Team\n29\n\n\n3.\nDucati Team\n17\n\n\n4.\nPramac Racing Team\n13\n\n\n5.\nMonster Yamaha Tech3\n11\n\n\n6.\nGo&Fun Honda Gresini\n10\n\n\n7.\nPower Electronics Aspar\n9\n\n\n8.\nAvintia Blusens\n3\n\n\n9.\nPaul Bird Motorsport\n2\n\n\n\nMore info at: http://www.motogp.com and http://www.yamaha-racing.com\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nYamaha Prepares to Open the 2013 MotoGP Season at The Commercial Bank Grand Prix of Qatar, Losail International Circuit \n\n\nPosted on April 3, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe long winter wait is over as Yamaha Factory Racing prepare this week for the first race of the 2013 MotoGP season, The Commercial Bank Grand Prix of Qatar under the floodlights of the Losail International Circuit. The unique night-time race schedule will mean that the first practice session of the weekend will happen in just one day’s time, on Thursday 04th April.\nReigning MotoGP World Champion Jorge Lorenzo arrives in Qatar as a strong favourite to take opening round honours having delivered several impressive simulations in winter testing at a race-winning pace. Lorenzo will be hoping to replicate the stunning win at the Losail Circuit in 2012 that kicked off the journey to his second premier class title last season. Losail is a good track for the champion, Lorenzo has always started from the front row and always finished on the podium. Last year’s victory was his first premier class win in Qatar.   \nValentino Rossi prepares for his first race reunited with Yamaha in confident mood having seen a marked return to form over winter testing. The nine-time MotoGP World Champion has been quick to answer his critics and find a highly competitive pace on the 1000cc YR-M1, putting himself firmly among the favourites alongside his team-mate for podium honours under the spotlights of the Losail Circuit. Rossi can claim three premier class victories in Qatar, the last being also his last outing at the track on the Yamaha M1.\nBuilt in the desert on the outskirts of Qatar’s capital city Doha, The Losail International Circuit has hosted a MotoGP round since 2004. The track celebrated the first ever night-time Grand Prix in 2008 and continues to be the only night race on the calendar. The 5.4km track is well suited to the YZR-M1 with a fast flowing nature. With a main straight over a kilometre in length and a combination of medium and high-speed corners the track is guaranteed to provide an exciting spectacle to start the season.\n \n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n“I am very excited to return to Qatar and begin the season. The testing has been good, we have good pace and we are quite happy with our performance. We still have some areas to improve but our situation is not so bad compared to our competitors and I think we can fight for the win. Jerez was a good point for us after testing in Austin; that was a new circuit where maybe we haven’t yet found a perfect feeling. In Jerez we were able to make a long run and all the Yamahas were on top; that gave us some extra motivation before travelling to Qatar. It also shows that every track is different and it’s going to be an exciting Championship. I want to keep the crown but it’s going to be hard. There are some great riders this year, I was surprised by Marquez’ pace and also with Valentino on his return to Yamaha. Dani is also so strong after the last part of the 2012 season. We will fight really hard from the first race, I believe we are in good shape for that. Losail is a track where we usually find a difficult track surface, plenty of sand and because of that it is always very tough with the tyres. We will see how we can perform there. I am feeling very fit and ready so I want to start!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n“I’m very happy with the work done in Jerez and over the winter. I was fast and everything worked fine and we have a competitive bike to fight for the podium. I believe that in Qatar will not be so easy; it is a track that is a little difficult for me, but I think I can defend myself and get a good result. I would like to get on the podium: that’s my goal. After the testing I know I can be competitive in some tracks but also that I will have some problems in other tracks. The most important thing is that now I have a good feeling when I ride my M1 and this will help me at all tracks, including Qatar. Every year you get a little bit nervous at the beginning of the season. It’s normal to feel like that; it’s crucial to get some good points and not to make mistakes. I can’t wait to start this 2013 season.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“We are pretty satisfied with all the work we’ve done during the winter tests, especially at Jerez, where we were able to find a good pace and we could prove the new materials. I think more or less the work is done and Jorge is ready for Qatar. He is in good shape and we have a lot of good information for the first race in Losail. As we saw at Jerez, Jorge seems to be quite consistent in a long-run, despite some little problems we found with the setting because of the wet conditions in Jerez. We are looking forward to starting the new season, it’s going to be a very tough year with good rivals like Dani, but also Valentino returning to Yamaha and Márquez who has been impressive on his first tests. I guess the key for us is going to be keeping calm from the beginning, trying not to make mistakes and going race by race. I can say that Jorge has been training very hard and is very fit, he has a competitive package to ride with the M1 and is ready to fight and defend our title.”\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“We arrive in Qatar with good confidence. Our performance over the winter testing has been very good and we are very competitive. We have two very strong riders, both with a good record at Qatar. Jorge has completed some race simulations and I think he’s very physically prepared. Valentino has improved his feeling with the bike at each test. It’s normal that it has taken him more time because for two years he has had another bike, but at Jerez he definitely proved he had the right feeling. The bike will continue to improve over the season but as it stands now it is a very competitive machine and we know it can achieve good results. The track is very suited to the characteristics of the M1, there is only one place which is difficult, the last corner is a very slow turn, first or second gear so we suffer a little there. We believe we can have the best start to the season here.”\nAdvertisements",
        "115cc\nSmash Fi\nsuzuki \n\n2015 Suzuki Smash Fi – first 115cc moped with Fuel Injection by Suzuki Assemblers Malaysia \n\n\nPosted on November 15, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nWinning the heart of Malaysian riders is not easy as they want the latest and greatest. This include the latest technology in motorcycle under 150cc that is Fuel Injection system. Now, Suzuki Assemblers has taken a good step to win the Malaysian riders heart by introducing Smash FI, a 2015 model that is equipped with Fuel Injection System 115cc engine. The engine is air-cooled and this actually can give a lower maintenance since the are fewer parts to handle or repair. On Belang R150, Suzuki engineer are clever enough to use oil-cooling rather than water-cooling since the oil is already inside the engine.  \nThe meter is nice as it shows the gear indicator nicely on the lower portion of the meter.

Click the dyno chart picture to view it in full resolution. Thanks Haen! The dyno chart is after the jump.\nAs the dyno chart shows, we can see that by using 62mm engine block, the 135LC produces 21.7hp at 9329RPM. Compared to standard engine horsepower that is 11.33hp at 8500RPM, that is about two fold increase of engine power! This number exceeds the horsepower provided by standard Yamaha RX-Z 135 2-stroke that is at 21hp.\nThen, what will the number be if Haen do this dyno test to 65mm engine block?\nAdvertisements",

Uma Racing carburetor can give better performance than standard carburetor due to its oversize air intake diameter.This carburetor is available in many sizes that is 24mm, 28mm, 30mm, 32mm and 34mm.The bigger the diameter of the air intake, the more fuel and air mixture can be burnt and this also means it consumes more fuel than standard carburetor.Usually, modification of carburetor is done with the modification of exhaust to get a good performance from both parts.For more info, surf to here.\n\n\nAdvertisements",

YZF-R15 has been talked about for a very long time in Asean especially in Malaysia and Indonesia due to the resemblances of the engine and chassis, but differs in the fairing type of the Yamaha FZ150i or the Vixion in Indonesia. Many riders of FZ150i in Malaysia and Vixion riders in Indonesia are asking why the YZF-R15 are not marketed here since the engine and chassis are the same which should be no problem in terms of maintenance and parts availability. This dream has come true to Indonesian riders as they are getting the YZF-R15 soon, but not yet to Malaysian riders. Arrghhh!!! Yeah, I feel you.\n2014 Yamaha YZF R15 Indonesia version\nYZF-R15 has been released earlier in India and known as the R15 Version 2.0, which means that this bike is already on its 2nd version in production. The Indian have included the sariguard (the rear tyre cover to prevent womens’ sari stuck to the rear tyre) but this one in Indonesia doesn’t include that item.\n\n2014 Yamaha YZF R15 Racing Blue in India (see the rear tyre cover, the sariguard)\nIf you observe the two identical image above, you can see that the Indian R15 have the sariguard and there is no sariguard on the Indonesian R15. The rear swing arm are now banana type made from aluminium. Other than that, everything is else is identical. It got the same engine and chassis. \nThere are 3 colours offered by Yamaha Indonesia that is the Racing Blue, Raring Red and Invincible Black. The one looks the best is the one in the Racing Blue that follows the livery of the Yamaha Factory Team, but, Yamaha Indonesia also has come up with the another variant that includes the 2014 Movistar Yamaha Team livery.\n\nThis Movistar Yamaha YZF-R15 is the true representation of the livery as it includes the ENEOS, Bridgestone Battlax, Monster, Yamalube and of course, the Movistar brand on the fairing. The unit is limited and already sold out. All of the Yamaha YZF-R15 for the Indonesian market are made in Indonesia by YIMM.\n\nThe engine is the liquid-cooled 149.8cc 4-stroke 4-valve SOHC that provides 17PS at 8,500RPM with 15Nm at 7,500RPM. The engine is overstroke type where it measures at 57 x 58.7mm which provides great low-to-mid range torque. Fuel injection remains the system of choice for this YZF-R15 but not the new YMJET_FI system as used in the Lagenda 115Z, Ego S and Ego LC. Even though the engine of this bike is identical to FZ150i and Vixion, you should know that the YZF-R15 use 6-speed gearbox as opposed to only 5-speed gearbox of FZ150i and Vixion.\n\nDeltabox frame is used for this YZF-R15 as it can provide great strength and at the same time is lightweight. Deltabox frame also makes it easy to access the engine for tune-ups and maintenance. The swingarm receives the monoshock suspension as fitted to the FZ150i and Vixion too but in different style. The rear swing arm are now banana type aluminium swing arm which is lighter and looks sportier. \n\nThe meter is one of the interesting features of this R15 as it is completely different than the FZ150i and Vixion. It got that digital+analog combo that is always a good thing. There is the big analog rev counter and on the left there is the digital speedometer and information display that shows the fuel capacity, trip and odometer. Other than that, the key system is now fitted with the key-shutter that can prevent theft. At least, it can make the thief to takes longer time to steal it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price for the 2014 Yamaha YZF-R15 in Indonesia is Rp 18,000,000.00 which translates to RM7,952 (direct conversion, not including the import tax)\n2014 Yamaha YZF-R15 Technical Specification:\nEngine\n\n\n\nEngine type\nLiquid-cooled, 4-stroke, SOHC, 4-valve\n\n\nCylinder arrangement\nSingle cylinder\n\n\nDisplacement\n149.8cc\n\n\nBore & Stroke\n57 × 58.7mm\n\n\nCompression ratio\n10.4:1\n\n\nMaximum power\n17PS/ 8,500rpm\n\n\nMaximum torque\n15N.m / 7,500rpmm\n\n\nStarting system\nElectric start\n\n\nLubrication\nwet sump\n\n\nFuel tank capacity\n12 liters\n\n\nFuel supply system\nFuel Injection\n\n\nIgnition system\nT.C.I\n\n\nPrimary / Secondary reduction ratio\n3.042 / 3.133\n\n\nClutch type\nWet Multiple-disc\n\n\nTransmission type\nReturn type 6-speed\n\n\nGear ratios\n1st=2.833, 2nd＝1.875, 3rd=1.364,4th=1.143, 5th=0.957, 6th=0.84\n\n\n\nChassis\n\n\n\nFrame type\nDelta box\n\n\nCaster / Trail\n26° / 98mm\n\n\nTire size (Front / Rear)\n90/80-17 / 130/70-R17\n\n\nBrake type (Front / Rear)\nHydraulic, single disc (Front / Rear)\n\n\nSuspension type (Front / Rear)\nTelescopic / Linked type Monocross\n\n\nHeadlight\nLo beam12V/35W X1, Hi beam12V/35W X2\n\n\nBattery\n12V, 3.5Ah (10H)\n\n\n\nDimension\n\n\n\nOverall length x width x height\n1,970mm x 670mm × 1,070mm\n\n\nSeat height\n800mm\n\n\nWheelbase\n1,345mm\n\n\nMinimum ground clearance\n160mm\n\n\nKerb weight\n136Kg\n\n\n\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2014/04/18/foto-foto-studio-detail-yamaha-r15/\nAdvertisements",

Setting a new benchmark in the motorcycle industry with their ground-breaking and innovative new Superbike, the Italian manufacturer’s incredible line-up of dream motorcycles are now set to be exhibited from 10-13 November at EICMA 2011, the 69th edition of the Milan International Motorcycle Show.  \nThe impressive theatre presentation of Ducati’s 2012 models also gave Gabriele Del Torchio, President of Ducati Motor Holding, the opportunity to announce the positive business performance of the Bologna-based company. In a market challenged by economy difficulties, Ducati has continued to increase its market share, production volumes and global sales, confirming their solid position and underlining the efficient and well organised business structure that will now serve the company in the coming years.\n“It is the hard work of all the men and women at Ducati that has resulted in the positive results that I present today and it validates the strategy we followed during the period 2007-2011,” said Gabriele Del Torchio during the conference. “Thanks to our focus on product development, increased investment and our work to maintain the desirability of our brand around the world, I take great satisfaction in announcing that 2011 has been the most successful year in the history of Ducati.\n“Sales of approximately 42,000 motorcycles have generated revenues of €480m, a 20% increase over the previous year and just reward for our highly innovative products. It gives us the confidence to believe in the pillars of our strategy and to continue on our ‘mission’ to be specialist leaders of the sportbike segment by further developing innovative and class-leading motorcycles.\n“All of this has enabled us to present the incredible new 1199 Panigale, the new benchmark in the sportbike arena. Without doubt, this has been the most ambitious project in Ducati’s history and underlines our engineering excellence and ‘product emotion’, an aspect of our brand which, in such a competitive market place, has become more important than ever. This motorcycle represents pure Italian style, the reference point for performance and a safety-enhanced, confidence-inspiring experience for our customers on road and track.\n“We are particularly proud to have created a special ‘Tricolore’ version of this new motorcycle, in the red, white and green of Italy. What better occasion to celebrate the 150th anniversary of our national flag and underline our role and responsibility as ambassadors of the title ‘made in Italy’, than with a product of such style and technical excellence.”\nFollowing Mr.Del Torchio’s announcement, Ducati Motor Holding General Manager, Claudio Domenicali, proceeded to release the details of the 2012 models with particular focus on the 1199 Panigale.\n“Throughout our long and successful twin-cylinder history of racing, Ducati has never built a sportbike as advanced as the 1199 Panigale,” said Claudio Domenicali during his presentation. “We are moving into a new generation with a ‘revolution’ of the species that establishes new limits for the category. Its Desmodromic heart, the new Superquadro engine, is the most powerful twin-cylinder ever produced and represents the base of a new concept of frame and engine integration. This concept enables the 1199 Panigale a dry weight of just 164kg and gives it a riding sensation that is closer than ever to a full race bike. With revised ergonomics, full Ride-by-Wire engine management and enhanced systems of ABS and traction control, we have controlled the beast within the 1199 Panigale so that the full emotion of this motorcycle can be enjoyed easily and safely.”\nIndeed, the 2012 Ducati Superbike family marks the official introduction of the ground-breaking 1199 Panigale, 1199 Panigale S and flagship 1199 Panigale S Tricolore and opens a new chapter in the company’s iconic Superbike history. Available early in 2012, Ducati’s new generation Superbike, goes beyond the barriers of motorcycle design and engineering to set the most extreme benchmark ever and the direction for future sport bikes. Developed in the red-hot environment of racing and designed to raise the performance bar to its highest, the 1199 Panigale uses innovative Ducati Corse-derived solutions to make World Championship level technology available to everyone.\nThe most high tech, most powerful twin-cylinder production engine on the planet is now an integral part of an innovative monocoque chassis that combine to deliver an astonishing 195hp from 164kg (361.5lb) of futuristic Italian thoroughbred. The highest production motorcycle power-to-weight and torque-to-weight ratios in the world are fitting trophies for the incredible results that Ducati have achieved. Bred for the track and trained for the road, the new 1199 Panigale is a true revolution of the species destined to influence the entire sportsbike environment.\nWith the click of a button, Ducati’s Riding Mode concept delivers performance with enhanced rider confidence by combining seven class-leading technologies. The latest-generation sports ABS system, Ducati Traction Control (DTC), Ducati Electronic Suspension (DES), Ducati Quick-Shift (DQS), Ducati’s new race-derived Engine Brake Control (EBC) and Ride-by-Wire (RbW) are now all programmed into seamless, electronic rider assistance. Even the full colour Thin Film Transistor (TFT) display changes to suit the rider’s environment.\nState-of-the-art from the ground-up and melding latest technologies with exciting new family features, the 1199 Panigale is totally “Ducati” in every respect. Its no-compromise approach to sport design and stylish attention to incredibly fine detail presents authentic Italian performance at its purist. The highly successful 848EVO and new for 2012, 848EVO Corse Special Edition with enhanced electronics, suspension and stunning Ducati Corse livery, complete an incredible 2012 Ducati Superbike range.\n2012 sees the excellent new Streetfighter 848 take its place alongside the awesome firepower of the Streetfighter S to broaden the stylish and exciting, high-performance naked family. The new 848 fighter is dressed in red with a red frame for Ducati traditionalists, while yellow makes a comeback and the stunning dark stealth scheme underlines the Streetfighter’s aggressive image. The Streetfighter S comes to the fight in Ducati red and the brand new for 2012 “race titanium matte”, both schemes with red frames and black wheels.\nThe innovative Ducati Diavel introduces a new Cromo model for 2012, in addition to the Diavel AMG Special Edition, recently unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show. First introduced to an excited public at the 2010 Milan International Motorcycle Show, the Ducati Diavel went on to amaze motorcyclists the world over, collecting awards along the way and becoming one of Ducati’s top selling models. For 2012, the groundbreaking Ducati is available in four exciting versions. The standard Diavel, and the Diavel Carbon – with a character-forming mix of aesthetic and performance components – now stand alongside the brand new and stunning Diavel Cromo and the exclusive Diavel AMG Special Edition.\nThe press conference for Ducati’s 2012 model range also presented an opportunity for the company to celebrate the winning of the Riders’ and Manufacturer’s titles in the 2011 World Superbike Championship with Carlos Checa and Riders’ and Manufacturers’ titles in the 2011 Superstock 1000 FIM Cup with Davide Giugliano. Both riders rode Team Althea Racing Ducati 1198s to their respective victories and both bikes will be proudly shown on the Ducati stand at EICMA 2011.\nThe entire 2012 Ducati motorcycle range in addition to new accessory and apparel collections will be on show at EICMA 2011 in Milan on stand G64 of hall 18 from 10-13 November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

The old marking system denoted the softer option tyre at each race with a white stripe, regardless of the compound specification of that tyre. The new system means that each of the four slick tyre compounds – Extra-soft, Soft, Medium and Hard – will have its own particular colour for the whole race season. \n\nThis change will make it easier for fans to distinguish between the Factory and Open-class tyre allocation, and also distinguish the different front and rear tyre combinations available to riders over a race weekend. \n\nThe colour scheme for the 2014 Bridgestone MotoGP slick tyres is as follows:\n\nExtra-soft compound: Green\nSoft compound: White\nMedium compound: Black (no stripe)\nHard compound: Red\n\n\nAs only two options of wet tyre will be offered for each MotoGP round; wet tyres will still adopt the previous marking system with the plain, black tyre denoting the harder option, while the softer option will be marked with a white stripe. \n\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“The new tyre marking scheme is designed to make it easier for fans to see which tyre compound each rider is using on the front and rear of the bike. Before last year when the whole grid was on the same tyre compounds, our old marking system worked perfectly. Since the introduction of the CRT class, and now the grid being split between the Factory and Open-class machines, we’ve decided to change the marking system to suit. Last year, when our marking system used the white stripe to denote the softer option for each class, the audience needed to know if a rider was a Factory or CRT bike to know which compound was being used.

        "1000cc\nWSBK \n\nWSBK Aprilia Racing Team takes on Sepang Circuit for the first time – Sylvain Guintoli and Marco Melandri \n\n\nPosted on June 5, 2014June 7, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nWorld Superbike is headed for its début on the Malaysian Sepang circuit, a new stop on the 2014 calendar. The setting for many world championships, the circuit just a few kilometres from the capital Kuala Lumpur is a rather recent one, opened in 1999. Quite long, more than 5.5 km, the Malaysian track should make for a good show thanks to the combination of long straight stretches, violent braking sections and fast turns.\nThe Aprilia team riders are very familiar with the tricky new track, having already ridden on it during their respective careers. Both of them see it as a favourable circuit for the characteristics of the Aprilia RSV4, the reigning Manufacturer World Champion bike. Sylvain Guintoli prepared for this round, characterised by a rather extreme climate, with a week of intense training in Borneo.\nRace conditions therefore do not concern the French rider: “Finally a track where we will be able to use the raw power of the RSV4. Sepang is a great track, wide, fast and I know it very well from my GP days. I have just completed 7 days of training in Borneo with similar heat and humidity so the very hot and tropical conditions won’t be a problem. Can’t wait”.\nMarco Melandri, who has also been working hard to be in top condition for this round, also expressed his appreciation of the Malaysian track. The rider from Ravenna and the Aprilia racing division are focusing on finding continuity and finally aiming for an important result.\nMarco Melandri: “It’s nice to be back at Sepang, an incredible track where all the horses of a powerful SBK like the RSV4 are put to use. The races will be very hard given the temperatures and high humidity, but I’ve been working hard and I want to get back in the thick of things to battle for the positions that count. I’m confident in Aprilia’s enormous commitment to put me at ease”.\n \nAdvertisements",

After reading the comments on the Racing Boy FB page, then I know that is the parts to be fitted to the wheel with tubeless type tyre. This air valve stem is also known as tubeless head, ‘kepala tubeless’, tubeless valve and some people just call it tubeless here in Malaysia.\n\n\nNormal air valve stem is straight type, whereby this Racing Boy air valve stem is L-shape. This will give you easy access to pump in the air to your tyre. We have always encounter many problem when pumping in the air to the tyre. I had once hit the hot exhaust pipe with my hand while getting air to the tyre at petrol station. Not a nice experience. I’m hoping this L-shape Racing Boy air valve can prevent that to happen and at the same time, add style to the the bike.\nThe material used by this Racing Boy air valve is also in good quality compared to the cheap air valve stem. The cheap one use steel that is easily rust after few month of using it. Rust can damage the style of your bike and also it can deteriorate up to a point it cannot keep the pressure inside the tyre.\nI personally like the features and construction of this Racing Boy air valve stem. Hoping to install it soon!\nAdvertisements",

        "chain lube\ntips\nuniversal \n\nY-Teq Chain Lube \n\n\nPosted on August 20, 2011August 20, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nChain lube are much better than the normal engine oil that we usually use to lubricate the chain and sprocket of our bike. It is much better because chain lube have the all important ‘anti-fling’ properties. Anti-fling means that the lubricant oil applied to the chain will not fly or splatter to the surrounding. If not, you’ll get a lot mess at the wheel and to the swing arm.\n\nY-Teq chain lube works by providing a thin anti-fling film after you spray it to the chain. The application is easy as the long spray nozzle is provided. After that, you need to wait about 30 minutes before you can start riding. This is to ensure the chain lube adheres properly to the chain.\nThis one I bought at RM10 for 200ml at the time of promotion. I also seen one chain lube with the brand of Repsol at RM55.\nAdvertisements",

This effort is to enable Zulfahmi fans who have bought the limited edition helmet to meet and greet with him and also the designer, Zaki Ismail. Zulfahmi Khairudin is the KTM-Ajo-AirAsia rider in Moto3 bearing the number 63. Zaki Ismail is the one who owns the Zaki Designs that designs the graphics for Zulfahmi helmet.  \n\nDato Razlan from Sepang International Circuit (SIC) was there too to tell a little bit about Zulfahmi involvement in Moto3 race series and the effort of SIC to bring Malaysian rider to be the world class rider in word class championship. One of the effort that proof to be beneficial is the introduction of Spanish CEV race series to Malaysian talents, where the competition is tough but a little lower cost compared to MotoGP. Spain has produced many talented rider and this makes the Spanish CEV championship to be the proving ground Malaysian riders. On other notes, he added that WSBK might be coming soon to Sepang if everything is okay and the confirmation will be released by the end of the month (January 2014).\n\nMr Lee of Sinar Puncak tell us that there are actually 300 units of this helmets but only 280 are being sold to the customer. So, where is the another 20 units? Well, it is saved for Zulfahmi. Sinar Puncak is pushing SHOEI brand to be premium helmet of choice in Malaysia soon and by the look of it when 280 units of the limited edition is being sold quickly, this might be true soon enough.\n\nMr Ishigawa and Makito of SHOEI Japan are also here to shows us their support and commitment to be the number one premium helmet of choice in Malaysia. The collaboration of SHOEI Japan with Zaki Ismail designs for Zulfahmi Khairudin limited edition replica is the first for Asian rider other than for the riders in Japan. This is the first step to introduce the premium helmet in Malaysia and Mr Ishigawa are hoping to be the number one in the country.\n\nAlso at the event was the designer himself, Zaki Ismail, to present us the graphics design theme. The graphics design is based on the Malaysian flag as seen on the top of the helmet where you can see the crescent moon and star in yellow colour. The tiger as related to Zulfahmi number as TI63R, is based from the theme Harimau Malaya.\n\nFor 2014, Zulfahmi Khairuddin will be with Ongetta AirAsia Honda team for the Moto3 race series. There are only 6 riders in Moto3 using the Honda machine and Zulfahmi is one of them. Joining Zulfahmi for the Moto3 for full season is Hafiq Azmi who will be using the KTM machine. There will be just few more weeks before the MotoGP season starts on 23th March 2014 at Commercial Bank Grand Prix of Qatar, Losail circuit.\n\nAnyone who were invited are able to mingle with Zulfahmi, Zaki and the SHOEI representative and the time given is very sufficient where you can talk and ask many questions.\n\nZulfahmi are also good in entertaining the fans where he really appreciates his fans and not reluctant to sign many boxes and helmets there. Now, the box can also be collectors item. What if Zulfahmi wins the Moto3 this year? Yeah, the limited edition helmet might increase in price.\n\nIncluded in the box is this keychain as a proof you are having the limited edition helmet. This particular keychain is number 011/280 that belongs to Muhammad Hazrin which is a good looking gold colour.\n\nThe label on the helmet clearly labeled it as J-Cruise ZULFAHMI making it a proud thing for us to have this kind of recognition from SHOEI who are willing to make a special livery for Malaysian rider. Video below is the 360 view of the 2013 SHOEI J-Cruise Zulfahmi Limited Edition open face helmet. Price is at RM1,588 but already sold out.\n\n\nFinal words, a great thanks to Sinar Puncak Sdn Bhd for bringing us the premium helmet from SHOEI with special livery for us in Malaysia to appreciate it. Keep up the good job!\nAdvertisements",

He\nadded, “Despite the vast variety of Honda’s specialty bikes, every unit that carries the Honda emblem is a\ntestament of proven quality, durability and reliability synonymous with the brand.”  \n2013 Honda CBR250R Mugen Motorsport Edition\n\nCBR250R New Colour Edition\nThe street-smart Sport Quarter now comes with 4 new sporty makeovers\nEvery aspect of this modern-era CBR250R such as its displacement, frame size, road handling stability and\nriding position have been optimized for an enjoyable ride. Making it a fun, lightweight and affordable machine\nfor beginners and experienced riders alike.\nThe CBR250R is equipped with a newly-developed liquid-cooled 250cc 4-stroke 4-valve single-cylinder\nDOHC enginethat delivers promises impressive performance not just at low rpm but also in the high rpm\nrange while retaining the characteristics of CBR’s sporty maneuverability. It works with an advanced PGM-FI\nfuel injection systemthat ensures the ideal combustion through accurate fuel supply in order to improve on\nfuel economy.\n2013 Honda CBR250R Tri-color Racing Edition\n\nFor the valve system, a roller rocker armwas adopted by a DOHC engine motorcycle for the first time in the\nworld to improve combustion efficiency. For emission measures, an O² sensor is combined with the built-in\nair induction (AI) systemand a catalyzer is fitted inside the exhaust pipe to comply with Euro 3 emission\nregulation.\nThe CBR250R is also fitted with an optional Combined ABS, a world’s first for 250cc-class motorcycles, that\nworks together with the large front 296mm and rear 220mm disc brakesfor greater braking performance.\nAnother plus point is the Pro-Link suspension, which was previously only available on bigger capacity bikes\nto maximize riding stability. A twin-par frame with truss structureand mass centralization designfurther\nenhance the bike’s rigidity and agile handling.\n\nThe New Integra\nThe best of motorcycle performance with easy handling of scooter\nFor those who seek the best of both worlds, Integra offers a full suite of innovation and practicality in a bold\ndesign statement that will make heads turn.\nThe key to a thrilling, fun riding experience of Integra is the newliquid-cooled high-torque 670cc in-line\ntwo-cylinder engine, developed to offer superb fuel efficiency(27.9km/ltested in WMTC Mode) together\nwith excellent torque particularly at low and medium engine rpm and low exhaust gas emissions.\nThe engine works with the second generation Dual Clutch Transmission, which provides the convenience\nof an automatic transmission with the option of a manual mode if desired. It uses two electronically controlled\nclutches to deliver fast and smooth transmission in three modes – Manual (MT), Automatic (AT)offers two\nsettings: S for sportier ridingand D for urban and highway use.\n\nKeywords like ‘fun’, ‘easy’, ‘comfort’ and ‘safety’ helped defined the design and engineering of Integra. Hence\nHonda has equipped the Integra with high-specification suspension, which comprises 41mm telescopic\nforks and Honda Multi-Action System (HMAS)monoshock damper that works together with an advanced\nPro-Link configurationto deliver full control and stability on even the roughest roads.\n\nEnhanced safety comes in the form of Combined ABS (C-ABS)with the extra reassurance of an Antilock\nBrake System (ABS).

        "motogp\nYamaha \n\nRossi Wraps Up Second Sepang Two Day Three Test on Top \n\n\nPosted on March 3, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha Factory Racing’s Valentino Rossi has completed the second official test of the 2014 MotoGP season as the fastest rider. Rossi wrapped up the three days of riding at the Sepang International circuit in Malaysia with a fastest time of 1’59.999, one of only two riders to drop under the two minute mark after an impressive fastest lap today.\nWhilst still struggling to find a perfect solution to the new Bridgestone tyres, Jorge Lorenzo was able to find a change to make some improvement to set up today. The Mallorcan was still less than satisfied overall with the grip levels on offer from the 2014 rubber. Lorenzo was able to step a little closer to the front than yesterday, wrapping up in seventh, just over 0.6 of a second from his teammate in first.\nThe Team now move directly to Phillip Island in Australia for a further test before the season kicks off under the floodlights of Qatar on the 23rd March.\nMonster Yamaha Tech3’s Bradley Smith and Pol Espargaro completed the final day of testing with many positives to conclude, for the beginning of the MotoGP season at the end of March.\nBoth Monster Yamaha Tech3 riders experimented with various aspects of their Yamaha YZR-M1 MotoGP bikes in order to find the most suitable set ups which would suit their riding styles.\nBritish rider Bradley Smith ended the test with an overall feeling of satisfaction regarding his performances over the past three days, as he prepares for his second season in MotoGP. Having spent a large quantity of time on refining the front and rear sections of the Yamaha YZR-M1, as well as accustoming himself to the seamless shift gearbox and the new Bridgestone tyres, Smith was content with the developments made. He completed a full race simulation today, which was successfully undertaken and confirmed that all of the changes made during this test were in the right direction. Undertaking a colossal 185 laps over all three days, the young British rider finished the second Sepang test with a best time of 2:00.804 in 9th place.  \nYoung Spanish rider Pol Espargaro finished the session feeling pleased, having spent the past three days learning and mastering his new MotoGP bike. The 2013 Moto2 World Champion, completed over 158 laps around the 5.543 kilometre track, over the three days. He optimised the available time and tested ceaselessly to continue to gain as much knowledge of his new Yamaha YZR-M1 and Monster Yamaha Tech3 Team as possible. The learning curve was steep and despite a small crash yesterday, Espargaro leaves the Sepang test feeling positive. Having gelled seamlessly with the new gearbox, the young Spaniard set the 3rd fastest time on the opening day, before finishing in 10th overall, with an ultimate lap time of 2:00.999.\nThe next testing session will commence at the Losail Circuit, Qatar on the 7th of March for Satellite MotoGP riders, and Open Class MotoGP riders only.\nThe second 2014 MotoGP pre-season test session ended today with very positive results for the NGM Mobile Forward Racing Team.\nAleix Espargaró was very consistent along the three days of testing, scoring the 4th best time in the combined lap times classification with a top time of 2’00.101. After having worked on the bike set up in the first two days, this morning he made a long run to check the bike behaviour on the race distance, showing a good pace.\nColin Edwards continued working on the bike set up. He also tested some new solutions in preparation of the race distance. In total he completed 23 laps, Aleix 43.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nValentino Rossi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1st / 1’59.999 / 41 laps\n\n\n\n“First of all I am very happy because I am in first position and I did a good lap. I was one of the only ones in the 1’59s which is positive, especially because with the 2014 tyres in the first test we tried a time attack and I was more than one second slower than today. This test we have always been at the top and fighting for the first position so it’s positive. We still have some problems when it’s very hot over long distance with the new tyres, so we still have to work, but we made a good step from the first test. The next test in Philip Island will be very important to understand if also there we improved a lot like here because I am more than one second faster than the second test of last year so we have been working well.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7th / 2’00.619 / 70 laps\n\n\n\n“We found a better solution today to improve our situation and adapt these tyres at this track. The tyres are much harder in the sidewalls. At this track, with this tarmac that is very slippery, it’s not the same as Phillip Island or Mugello for example, it’s impossible for us to be competitive. This tyre is much worse for Yamaha and better for Honda. Our bike is competitive, at a similar level to the competitors but with the tyre we have problems. We tried a simulation today and it was worse and worse every lap. In the edge there is a problem with no grip but also when you pick up the bike it spins. You can improve the feeling a little to get more grip but when the tyre starts to drop the problems get worse and worse.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“It’s been a difficult test and really we are not very happy with the result. For the last day Jorge has found some confidence back in the bike. Of course it’s not how we want it but at least he could do a decent long run and be quite consistent. It was very hot today and we got a lot of new information with the new tyres. We are very curious to see how we get on in two days in Phillip Island.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“We finished this three day test with some good improvements and were able to make the bike better every day. At the end Valentino was able to make the fastest lap of the day. Jorge continued to have some difficulties, especially because of his riding style. It looks like the new tyre doesn’t work very well on our bike, especially at this track. Here at Sepang the problem was increased because of the lack of grip on the tarmac and also the high temperatures. We made some improvements but we are not satisfied 100% and we have to improve over race distance. We look forward to the Phillip Island test now to see what Bridgestone has prepared to solve the issues we had last year and then we are ready for Qatar.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBradley Smith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9th / 2’00.804 / 71 laps\n\n\n\n“We tried a lot of different solutions today, especially with the rear of the bike and tried to work the new Bridgestone tyres as much as possible. I found a setting that I was much happier with, which made the bike smoother, and let me ride the Yamaha how it should be. We definitely made the step with rear tyre performance, which allowed me to be much more consistent, compared to the last Sepang test and last year’s race. I did a race simulation, and am pleased as it was during a really hot part of the day, so not perfect in terms of track conditions. At the end of the day, after 70 laps I also did my best time. There are many positives, and I come away from here quite happy. It appears as though the track was slower this time than the previous test, but we are close to my lap time from then. All in all, it has been a somewhat difficult three days, but I am really pleased with the final result. “\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPol Espargaro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10th / 2’00.999 / 54 laps\n\n\n\n“It has not been an easy day today. Probably the most difficult one we have had so far. I didn’t feel too well, on one hand maybe because of the crash from yesterday, or on the other hand because it’s really demanding doing several days and so many laps in such hot and humid conditions. However, even if I’m not too enthusiastic about my performance today, I am still just one second from the top of the timesheets which makes me feel much better. Again, we tried different setup solutions, as I still have many things to learn about this bike. I’m really looking forward to trying the bike on a different circuit, in Qatar next week. This will extend my knowledge further, and will permit us to be able to evaluate the information which we collected during this test in a better way. But honestly, all these comments are not as important when you get news like we received today from our Moto2 rider, who is in hospital in France. My thoughts are with him and I hope he recovers quickly.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAleix Espargaro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4th / 2’00.101 / 43 laps\n\n\n\n“I’m very happy with how we progressed in these three days of testing. We started where we left here in Sepang 1 and I could work on the second bike and on the race distance. I’m very satisfied with the data gathered during the long run. We were competitive and now I look forward to confirm my feeling in Qatar, where we will do another test session before the opening race of the season”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nColin Edwards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14th / 2’01.748 / 35 laps\n\n\n\n“We continued working on the bike set up to improve the feeling with the bike in the corners. We tried several solutions but I still don’t have the right confidence to push as I am used to. We also worked on the electronics with positive results and we focused on the tank to check the fuel consumption as we would like to take advantage of the possibility to use all the 24 liters that the Open class has at disposal. We gathered important data and I’d like to thank my team for the work done during these three days”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSepang Test Two, Day Three: Final Times\n\n\n\n1.

Here is what I found out: \n\n1. Most bank accept for the loan of this superbike. They are willing to give maximum 80% loan at 4% interest rate for 5 years.\n2. You still need to pay in cash the remaining 20%. In this Monster 795 case, you need to pay RM11,999.80 cash for the down payment.\n3. The monthly installment that you need to pay for each month for the 5-year loan is RM799.99 RM960. Sorry. Forgot to add the 4% per year interest to the loan amount.\nThat is the estimation price based of my calculation only. The real number might be higher since the price of the bike will be higher when you choose to pay it via loan. I mean that the price might be increased about few more thousand than the original price at RM59,999.00. It might be at RM62,000.00 or less, or more.\nUPDATE: MM reader, Hasni Fitri, has sent me the image of the real Ducati Monster 795 price OTR in Malaysia.

Not because of the bike is heavily modded, but due to this bike that is parked inside the house! I’ve done the same thing too when I got my Yamaha RX-Z.\nWell executed and attention to details make this X1R stands outs from the sea of 135LC in the road in Malaysia.\nWith pro-Arm fitted from Honda NSR150SP, this bike surely looks intimidating. Some people says that, using pro-Arm will make the bike handling much better (but depends on the mechanic expertise to fit it) because it will lowers the gravity center of the bike and also, the pro-Arm will add length to the wheel base dimension that provides better cornering.\nThanks to Rizan for the permission to use the pictures.\n9 more pictures after the jump\nAdvertisements",
        "600cc\nCBR600RR\nHonda \n\n2013 Honda CBR600RR launched in Malaysia – from RM80,588 – RM95,388 \n\n\nPosted on June 26, 2013July 4, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nBoon Siew Honda is leading the industry with a revolutionary way to ride through the introduction of the new CBR600RR series.\nAccording to Mr. Satoshi Okada, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Boon Siew Honda, the CBR600RR series, which consists of CBR600RR and CBR600RR C-ABS, reflect the company’s continued effort to introduce new riding excitement to the local market.\nCBR600RR\nCBR600RR represents a big step forward for the 600cc Supersport class when it was initially launched in 2003. Thanks to the input from the MotoGP race bike of the time, the RC211V, the CBR600RR not only redefined performance parameters on the road with its flexible, yet high-revving engine and pin-sharp handling, it also went on to win FIM World Supersports Championship from splendor 2003 to 2008, six years in a row.\nIn 2010 Honda also became the official engine supplier for the ultra-competitive Moto2 class, supplying a power unit based on that of the CBR600RR, testament to the engine’s potential and reliability. Constant development over the last decade has seen the CBR600RR evolve into one of the most polished packages ever produced in the Supersports arena.\nFocus was placed upon the chassis, with the goal being creation of a bike that offered control and handling far beyond its class. The CBR600RR’s new inverted Showa 41mm Big Piston Forks deliver an incredibly smooth ride on the road, while offering great connection to the front tyre when on the limit at the racetrack. Lightweight, 12-spoke cast aluminium wheels – similar to those on the CBR1000RR Fireblade – are also used, for greater feedback.\nThe CBR600RR’s extremely compact 599cc, liquid cooled DOHC 16-valve inline four-cylinder power plant makes a great contribution to the bike’s superb handling. Featuring a compression ratio of 12.2:1, it produces 88kW @ 13,500rpm, with torque of 66Nm @ 11,250rpm. Its 599cc four-cylinder engine’s sophisticated PGM-DSFI fuel injection system – fed a large volume of air by the Direct Air Induction System – and its ECU have been re-mapped for improved throttle response and feel throughout the rev-range. The Intake Air Control Valve also now operates through all rpm ranges. These improvements make the bike easier to ride at ‘normal’ speed, with increased performance under sports or racetrack conditions.\nThe CBR600RR’s Unit Pro-Link rear suspension uses no shock top mount on the frame, and is a system unique to Honda. The shock mounts to the upper part of the swingarm and the lower link, effectively operating independently of swingarm movement. This stabilises behaviour under hard cornering and delivers superb traction and turning ability, plus improved shock absorption and much more consistent damping.\nThree CBR600RR colour options will be available: Tricolour (red, white and blue), Graphite Black and Repsol Colour.  \nCBR600RR C-ABS\nTwo key factors drove development of the new CBR600RR C-ABS: improved racetrack performance, combined with the ability to be ridden and genuinely enjoyed on a twisty road or city street by riders of all experience levels.\nThe new inverted Showa 41mm Big Piston Forks deliver an incredibly smooth ride on the road, while offering great connection to the front tyre when on the limit at the racetrack.

The shock mounts to the upper part of the swingarm and the lower link, effectively operating independently of swingarm movement. This stabilises behaviour under hard cornering and delivers superb traction and turning ability, plus improved shock absorption and much more consistent damping.\nReceiving constant input from Honda’s race programme, the CBR600RR’s frame is constructed from twin tubes of diecast aluminium. A mass-centralisation process for the new model has resulted in the sections that are furthest away from the bike’s centre of gravity being made lighter. This has made for more agile handling and sharper responsiveness and has taken turning ability and cornering speed up to the next level. Rake is set at 23° with trail of 96.3mm; wheelbase is 1,375mm and kerb weight is 196kg (with electronic Combined ABS).\nIn June 2008, Honda announced the world’s first “electronic Combined ABS” for production motorcycles. This new system was made available as an option for both the CBR600RR and CBR1000RR Fireblade in 2009. The system works as follows: input from the brake lever is recognized by a series of pressure sensors which are connected to an ECU. The ECU assesses front and rear wheel speed and, using this information, translates the lever pressure to power units which operate the front and rear brakes. Hydraulic pressure is then applied by these power units to the brake calipers, delivering the optimal braking force for every situation without locking.\nAll the expected ABS and CBS functions are provided — the prevention of wheel lock and the distribution of braking force between front and rear brakes – but the ultra-fine precise control of the “brake-by-wire” system means that vehicle vibration and pitching are minimized, so that the bike remains in a normal, neutral position under braking. Brake “pulse” is also eliminated, and, overall, sport riding performance is uninterrupted – cornering feel remains the same and controllability is enhanced.\nThree CBR600RR C-ABS colour options will be available: Tricolour (red, white and blue), Graphite Black and Repsol Colour.\nThe showroom prices (motorcycle only) are available as below:\n\n\n\n\nCBR600RR\nCBR600RR C-ABS\n\n\nGraphite Black\nRM80,588\nRM94,388\n\n\nTricolour\nRM81,088\nRM94,888\n\n\nRepsol\nRM82,088\nRM95,388\n\n\n\nBoth CBR600RR and CBR600RR C-ABS come with 2 years or 20,000km Manufacturing Warranty.\nFor more information, visit www.boonsiewhonda.com.my or call the Boon Siew Honda Toll-Free number at 1800-88-3993 (Monday to Friday, 9am – 5pm, except for public holidays).\nFinally, Honda Malaysia has brought this beautiful CBR600RR for all of us rider to savour the taste of it. Estimated price is at RM80k. As a comparison Kawasaki ZX6R 636 is priced at RM70k.\nThis CBR600RR lines up along with the superbikes likes the Honda INTEGRA 700cc, NC700X and CBR1000RR which officially brought in Honda Malaysia.\nAdvertisements",

I asked for permission to use these images on my blog since the suspension offered by D2 Racing Sport is very different than what we see normally. Usually, we just see one nitrogen canister at the suspension, but D2 has create 2 nitrogen canister for their suspension to provide better setting and wide tuning ability for the suspension dampening from softest to hardest. It is able to be adjusted up to 36 different hardness(softness?) dampening level. It features the ‘Golden Included Angle‘  which lead to better critical point for the suspension design. I have emailed Emily and asked whether this suspension is available for Yamaha Lagenda 115ZR, and now I’m waiting for her reply. The technical features and specification are here:Quoted from D2 Racing Sport website:\n1.      This product comes with two pieces of nitrogen reservoirs, both of them can adjust nitrogen sideway knob and adjust rebound dampening knob. Two nitrogen reservoirs includes high compression nitrogen and low compression nitrogen. On the sideway knob can adjust high and low compression reservoir according to vehicle owner decide dampening and nitrogen (sideway) pressure. The most important is the high and low pressure bottles. The motorcycle owners may look for the best value of pressure value. In generally, One nitrogen reservoir can inflate one pressure. The motorcycle owners can choose adjustment which decided the pressure by suspension manufacturer. It’s tunable to change the value of pressure is the biggest shortcoming. If there is one nitrogen reservoir only, then the pressure will be the one only, even adding on 10 pieces adjust sideway knob is also only the pattern, will not have any function. With the damping measured that the testing may demonstrate completely adjusts knob to change the value. Therefore this is the D2 specialized team studies the double nitrogen cylinder (high pressure, low pressure) the reason.\n2.      This product is especially for amateurs or professional rider and custom made. Because of the Hi-low nitrogen reservoir, it is able to use in the street or the mountain road as well as the circuit. You may fill in the tuning program of your vehicle, the vehicle weight or each kind of different racecourse’s condition. We will customize for you without charging extra fee.\n3.     36-way dampening adjustment from hardest to softest, sideway knob 18×18 –way.\n4.     This product is tested, researched and developed actually by many international riders. Our company engineer based on the racecourse result, the curve pastes the nature and then decided the final setting value.\n5.     Each suspension kit’s strut must be tested repeatedly by machine for 300,000 times. In additional, the products have to monitor temperature variation value strictly then after test on dnyo machine, we will enclose the Shock Dyno report and stamp QC seal conforming ISO 9001:2008 certification.\n6.     The product is covered by two-year limited warranty and three –year limited extended warranty.\nFor more info, head on to: http://www.d2-moto.com\nAdvertisements",

The assembly of the motorcycles will be carried out by NAZA Bikes Sdn Bhd whilst the distribution will be managed by NAZA Premira.\nNAZA Premira is optimistic of the market response towards the Aprilia Shiver 750 CKD Edition and estimated to sell at least 600 units in 2015. In fact, the facility in Shah Alam is capable of producing 1,200 units in the initial year of operation.  NAZA Premira is looking to expand the production capacity in between 3,000 to 5,000 units in the long run if it needs to cater to the ASEAN region.  \nTo date, NAZA Premira has been importing completely built Aprilia motorcycles from the Company’s final assembly plant in Italy. At the start of the New Year, NAZA will begin assembly operations for the Shiver 750 CKD edition whilst other models will continue to be imported as completely built motorcycles for now.\nA total of RM5 million is being invested in the development of the Shiver 750 CKD assembly operations and a further RM1 million is being devoted to parts inventory.\n“We are proud and greatly honored to be the first and only company chosen to begin CKD assembly for Aprilia outside Italy and hope to become the centrum for export around the ASEAN region in the coming months. This is a momentous occasion for us and proves our commitment to successfully representing this global brand. It is also a mark of the effort we make towards developing high performance motorcycle manufacturing and assembly operations, whilst simultaneously training local Malaysians and promoting foreign direct investment” said Datuk Wira Haji SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, Group Executive Chairman & Group CEO, NAZA World Group of Companies.\nMr. Simone Niccolai, Managing Director of Piaggio Asia Pacific Ltd., said, “The initiative announced today is an important new step in the Piaggio Group strategy to continue expanding its operations in Asia and in the ASEAN area in particular, where we are already successful players with the Vespa and Piaggio scooters. As we prepare for greater growth throughout ASEAN with the introduction of the Group’s motorcycles, we are looking at setting up a regional hub for the Aprilia brand in Malaysia. In doing so, we are working closely with NAZA and the Malaysian government.

        "125z\nlc 135\nYamaha\nyamaha 125z \n\nWhy LC135 have only 4-speed gear and 125Z have 6-speed gear? \n\n\nPosted on June 29, 2009February 25, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nLC135 is 4-speed and 125Z have 6-speed: Why?\nHave you ever wonder about this? Why is it the marvelous and lovable Yamaha LC135 only have 4-speed gear and Yamaha 125Z having additional 2 speed gear? Is Yamaha neglected the important aspect of speeds and thrills? Well, I have been thinking about this for a while and tried to find out why. Here is what I’ve found out…\n\nThe reason why Yamaha 125Z needed to have 6-speed gear is due to narrow powerband that is natural for 2-stroke engine. 2-stroke engine needs RPM more than 5000 (depends to the engine bore x stroke) to deliver its optimum torque, whereby 4-stroke engine can deliver the optimum torque from as low as 1500 RPM. So, because of this, 2-stroke engine needs to have a lot more gear than 4-stroke engine to make sure the torque can be spreads out all along the speed (km/h) starting from low speed to very high speed.\nFor example, LC135 can run on 4th gear as low as 20km/h and from there you can also speeds up to 140km/h without hesitation from the engine. Try this on your 125Z, and tell me how does it feels. It is an advantage of 4-stroke engine to have a wider powerband than the 2-stroke engine. One of the most known bike to have a very wide powerband 4-stroke engine is the Honda EX5. You can drive it slow and suddenly accelerate it without hesitation.\nAs you can see, having only 4-speed gear on LC135 is not a disadvantage, it is the nature of 4-stroke engine that have wide powerband. But, I think it is also not a wrong decision if Yamaha engineers decides to make LC135 being 6-speeder! More gear change, more fun!\nDrive safely!\nFor more info about 2-stroke engine, click here.\nAdvertisements",
        "Moto3 \n\nStiggy Factor Set To Transform Fahmi 2015 Season \n\n\nPosted on January 9, 2015 by eddy \n\n\nMalaysia’s Moto3 rider, Muhammad Zulfahmi Khairuddin, with the guidance and support of SIC Racing’s experienced team manager, Johan Stigefelt, is looking good to regain his glory days when the new season begins.\nRiding for the all-new and exciting SIC Racing Team, Zulfahmi, whose exploits included a sensational podium finish in 2012, has been working closely with his new manager and team.\n“They are working very well together and Zulfahmi is already showing very positive signs. The Stiggy factor next season is the boost Zulfahmi needs to get back on track,” said SIC Chief Executive Officer Datuk Razlan Razali.  \n“As a former top rider himself with experience competing at the highest level, Johan has the skills and knowledge to help Fahmi rebuild his confidence and come out a much stronger rider in the new season.”\nFondly known as Stiggy, the Swedish rider has 20 years of racing experience and as a team manager has a record of 37 podium finishes with his riders since 2006. He began motorcycle racing at the age of 17 and was twice winner of the Swedish 125cc Championship. In 1998, he started his first\nfull year in Grand Prix, riding in both the 250cc and 500cc World Championships.\nA natural progression saw Johan form his own motorcycle race team in 2005, which competed successfully in the World Supersport and Superbike Championship for five years. In 2010, he became team manager for RW Racing, competing in the Moto3 Championship. He finished runner-up in 2012 with Luis Salom.\nRazlan added: “Stiggy has shown his capability with the Caterham Moto2 Team. It is not easy for a new team to make its mark but Stiggy managed to do it with Caterham in the 2014 season.”\n“Just look at Zarco’s performance. Zarco was always there among the leading riders at all of the races.” For the record, Johann Zarco scored four podium finishes in the 2014 season to finish sixth overall with 146 points.\n“I am confident Stiggy will create a similar impact on Zulfahmi and Jakub Kornfeil this season. I just can’t wait for when our very own SIC Racing Team makes its debut in Qatar,” added Razlan.\nRunning for 18 rounds again, the 2015 season-opening Qatar Grand Prix starts with two days of free practice on March 26 and 27. Qualifying is the following day on March 28, while the race will take place in the evening of March 29.\nSepang will host the penultimate leg and Round 17 from Oct 23 to 25 as the Silver Jubilee celebrations and the 25th edition of the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix. As in previous years, the season concludes with the Valencia Grand Prix in Spain on Nov 8.\nTwelfth overall last year and seventh in the preceding 2012 season, Zulfahmi dropped to 20th in the 2014 Moto3 Championship as he struggled with his Honda and a shoulder injury sustained during pre-season testing.\nMeanwhile, Kornfeil finished 12th overall when he collected a total of 97 points in 2014. The Moto3 Championship was topped by Spain’s Alex Marquez, who earned 278 points, edging Australian Jack Miller by two points.\n“Apart from having a full-time team to assist him and Kornfeil, Fahmi will be boosted with the confidence of returning to a KTM machine. I’m sure he will also be driven to success by the fact that he will be riding for a Malaysian team.”\nThe newly formed Moto3 team has the support and backing from Tourism Malaysia, as well as local auto conglomerate, Mutiara Motors Sdn Bhd via its Drive M7 energy drinks brand.\nAdvertisements",
        "1000cc\nf4\nf4 rr\nmv agusta \n\n2012 MV Agusta F4 RR Corsacorta Official Details and Photos \n\n\nPosted on May 11, 2011May 11, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n2012 MV Agusta F4 RR Corsacorta (Matt Pearl White)\nThe Corsacorta 50.9mm short stroke with oversquare bore at 79.0mm engine has pushed the power to 200hp (real conversion from 147.7kW is actually 198hp) up from 180hp of the original F4 version. This F4 RR Corsacorta comes with new colour that is matt pearl white which is in my humble opinion, the perfect colour for this 200hp machine.\nRead the official release below:\nRR, the magical acronym that immediately brings to mind the world of competition. The bike for special individuals who demand the most exhilarating riding experience. Created using the most exotic materials, ultra-sophisticated suspension and the new 1000cc short-stroke engine make the MV Agusta F4 RR the most advanced and powerful superbike in the world.\nWhen the most sophisticated chassis design is joined with the new MV short stroke engine, the result can only be an extraordinary machine. The MV Agusta F4 RR is the perfect tool for riders who demand the utmost performance. Evolved, exotic, and even further refined, the F4 RR is currently the best that technology can offer to the motorcycling world. To already refined MV Agusta F4, you add even more exotic materials, reduced weight, and, above all, a 201 hp four-cylinder engine  which makes the F4 RR the most powerful superbike ever built. All “packaged” with the advanced design that makes the MV Agusta F4 RR unique and unmistakable.\nA project for  those who demand the ultimate riding experience.\nIn detail, the highlights of the new MV Agusta F4 RR:  \n• New short-stroke radial valve engine 201 hp at 13,400 rpm\n• New increased bore diameter\n• New primary drive\n• New cylinder head\n• New large-diameter titanium intake and exhaust valves\n• New lightweight forged pistons in “aerospace RR alloy”\n• New exhaust 4-2-1-4\n• Close ratio gearbox\n• Variable length intake runners\n• Öhlins multi-adjustable 43 mm fork\n• Öhlins TTX 36 rear shock\n• Öhlins steering damper\n• Forged aluminum wheels\nENGINE: 201 Hp, PURE POWER\nThe new 4-cylinder short stroke engine with radial valve is the soul of the MV Agusta F4 RR. The engine is completely new and is inspired by MV Agusta’s experience in competition. Apart from the engine case castings, the arrangement of cylinders and a few other elements the 4 cylinder RR engine shares little with that of the previous F4. It has been completely redesigned with a single goal in mind: maximum performance. All new thermodynamics, a new crankshaft that has a reduced value of inertia and new bore and stroke dimensions with an extremely over-square relationship that can reach rpm’s worthy of a true racing motorcycle. The piston diameter has been increased from 76 to 79 mm while the stroke is reduced from 55 mm to 50.9 mm. With these dimensions the rpm limit has been raised to a stratospheric 13,700 rpm while at the same time reducing the linear velocity of the piston (from 24.7 m/s to 22.9 m/s) and thus also improving reliability.\nTo reach the stratospheric level of 201 hp at 13,400 rpm with a completely homologated engine including an exhaust system complete with the catalytic converter, extreme attention has been given to every detail. The thermodynamic efficiency has been optimized to guarantee a record level of performance. For this reason, the head of the F4 RR is completely new including new intake and exhaust tracts as well as large diameter intake and exhaust valves. For the first time on an MV mass production engine,  all the valves are made of titanium and this has made it possible to reduce the mass while at the same time significantly increasing the diameter (30 to 31.8 mm for the inlet and from 25 to 26 mm for the exhaust). The tuning of the engine has been optimized thanks to the use of a completely new 4-2-1-4 exhaust system with large diameter tapered headers. In addition to ensuring the optimized performance of the engine, this new exhaust system has a unique sound and is even more intoxicating.\nThe intake is controlled by four 49 mm throttle bodies with the unique TSS system of variable length intake tracts.\nThe new engine of the F4 RR has been designed according to the criterion of low friction. A new primary drive gear has drastically reduced the speed of the generator and water pump in effect limiting the parasitic power consumption of these components. As with previous F4’s, this new engine features a rapidly removable cassette gearbox and the clutch employs a mechanical slipper system to assure proper control even under the most extreme braking conditions. The electronic engine management has been further refined compared to that of the previous F4. The traction control follows new operating modes as well as two maps for the engine, and everything is now easily managed through the new controls that have been placed on the left handlebar.\nCHASSIS: LIGHT AND PRECISE\nThe frame and swingarm are common with those of the already excellent F4, but the desire on the part of MV Agusta to offer a four-cylinder superbike has also led to the employment of some unique solutions. To optimize performance and adapt the F4 RR to all race tracks and conditions, the MV Agusta F4 RR allows a virtually infinite combination of adjustments. Multi-adjustable suspension, essential for a racing motorcycle, has been combined with the adjustable steering head angle (with interchangeable eccentrics) and the height of the swing arm pivot and rear axle by means of calibrated inserts.\nSUSPENSION: THE BEST OF THE BEST\nThe Öhlins NIX upside-down front fork has 43 mm diameter inner tube and a titanium nitride coating to improve the smoothness and precision. This particular fork dimension has been designed to achieve the perfect balance of agility without sacrificing  the legendary stability of an MV.\nAs the most sophisticated motorcycles, the front wheel axle carriers are machined from billet aluminum and the front forks offer precise external adjustment of spring preload as well as compression and rebound damping.  Also, the fork of the MV Agusta F4 RR provides separate adjustments for the hydraulic damping (left leg compression, right leg extension), a solution that enables the accuracy of the hydraulic independence as varying the compression does not have an influence on the rebound.\nThe Öhlins Racing TTX 36 rear shock is simply the best in the world. Born from experience in competition, it is externally adjustable in spring preload, compression, rebound and length allowing you to vary the ride height of the rear of the bike to match the different driving styles and different circuits. In addition, the MV Agusta F4 RR also offers the possibility of adjusting the height of the swing arm pivot point by means of calibrated inserts.\nRIMS\nThe quest for lighter weight and the best possible handling led to the creation of lightweight forged aluminum wheels that minimize un-sprung weight and reduced inertia with the advantage in the increased reactivity of the bike. The new wheels on the MV Agusta F4 RR allow a weight saving of 1 kg compared to the standard F4 cast versions.\nBRAKES\nThe F4, the current reference in high performance braking, has only been exceeded by the new F4 RR. The Brembo monobloc calipers are the state of the art high performance brake calipers for motorcycles, and now, paired with Brembo radial master cylinders, the braking performance is on par with that of the top superbikes. The clutch master cylinder is the mirror image of the radial brake caliper which offers increased feel and modulation. Numerous other exclusive details, such as the levers and handlebars which are dedicated specifically to the MV F4 RR and subject to countless hours of testing and development all lead to the best possible ergonomics available on a production motorcycle.\nCOMPONENTS\nA true superbike is not only defined by its potential performance, but also by the attention to detail with which it is made. F4 RR, the details speak for themselves. Never before has a race-ready superbike been built with such a high level of attention to detail. The design features are not only created to be visually pleasing, but, as form follows function and the F4RR has been designed to perform. For this reason, every detail has been considered to increase performance and functionality, reduce weight and increase the product quality fit and finish. The F4 RR debuts new adjustable light weight rear sets to match the ergonomics of the bike to the needs of the pilot. The remote control of the dashboard functions (including traction control) is just one of the details that the MV engineers have put into this new superbike. In addition, a new aerodynamic flap has been added under the lower triple clap to convey additional air to the radiator optimizing the aerodynamics and cooling of the engine’s record power.\nMV SPECIAL PARTS TO PERSONALIZE YOUR MASTERPIECE\nExclusive technology and design has been imprinted into the DNA of the new F4 RR. It is the world’s most powerful superbike.  But, the evolution never ends. You can make your F4 RR even more unique with the original MV special parts that have been developed to provide you with additional performance using the very latest technical advancements in materials and design.\nMV special parts are an absolute guarantee of quality for the customer as they have been subject to the same high standards of quality that have been applied to the original masterpiece using the most advanced materials such as aerospace alloy, titanium and carbon fiber. Special exhausts systems and racing engine ECU’s have also been developed that can increase even further the record power level of the 4 cylinder engine.\nAccessories, such as MV Agusta clothing, can be viewed at www.mvagusta.it and a number of items may be purchased directly online.\nCOLORS\nThe two new colors, pastel red/white and matt pearl white, together with the new graphics make the F4 RR even more unique.\n“Plus … it’s a MV Agusta”\nENGINE Technical Specification\nTYPE\nFour cylinder, 4 stroke, 16 valve\nTIMING SYSTEM\n“D.O.H.C”, radial valve\nTOTAL DISPLACEMENT\n998 cm3 (60.9 cu. in.)\nCOMPRESSION RATIO\n13.4 : 1\nSTARTING\nElectric\nBORE X STROKE\n79 mm x 50.9 mm (3.1 in. x 2.0 in.)\nMAX.

Now, they have introduced a racing block for Yamaha Ego.\n\nThey are two sizes available for the bore size that is 58.5mm and 61mm. Even a slight increase of displacement can affect greatly in the combustion chamber size.

        "135cc\n135LC 5-speed\ntips\nY135LC Extreme Spirit\nYamaha\nYamaha 135LC \n\nYamaha 135LC 5-speed: Is It A Good Buy? \n\n\nPosted on July 24, 2011July 28, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nMost of underbone riders in Malaysia are excited to know that HLYM has introduced the 2011 Yamaha 135LC Extreme Spirit with 5-speed. The features fitted to it are way beyond the ‘normal’ criteria of an underbone bike for it class. The brakes are upgraded to fully disc brake setup with the front equipped with 297mm disc plate with 2-piston caliper and the rear with 190mm disc plate with 1-piston Nissin caliper. At first, I thought the rear brake caliper is the same model with the Y125Z rear brake caliper which is 2-piston equipped. In Thailand, the another version of Y135LC ES that is the X1R has been equipped with rear disc brake setup long time ago and has been followed by 135LC riders here to have their bike equipped with rear disc brake too. What the fuss actually about fitting the rear disc brake? It is about three thing;\n\n1. It absolutely more powerful than a drum brake setup, 2. Disc brake are easy to maintain. One of my friend never changed the rear brake disc pad for almost 10 years and it still works (this depends on how you drive, my friend is absolutely not a racer, but if you never use the rear brake at all, the pad can last a lifetime) and last one, 3. It looks so damn nice on the bike! I have been waiting for a bike under 150cc with rear disc brake setup for years, but only to see Yamaha 125Z, Suzuki Shogun and now the Y135LC ES to have this configuration. Having a full disc brake setup can help a lot in terms of safety, you can absolutely brake faster and more confident when there is a need arises. Anyway, some racer of Y125Z and RX-Z, they like to have their rear brake removed and depend only on the front disc brake. Well, it is up to you. For me, I like rear disc brake setup.\nAnother features that is great about this Y135LC ES is the use of wider wheel from Enkei. This wheel set are made in Vietnam, but since the name carries the word Enkei, I think the factory there need to adhere to the quality and specification stated by Enkei company in Japan. The wheels are available only in black colour with red lining along the lips of the wheel. The red lining are not stickers, it is painted to the wheel so there is no risk of it being peeled off after some soaking in the rain or when it is being wash. Mind you, never send your bike to a car wash! Wash it yourself or never wash it at all. What the benefit of having wide wheels? I can think of two thing; 1. A wider wheel can withstand heavier load, so this means that having a heavy and fat pillion rider will not affect the tyre in terms of stability, 2. Cornering with this wider wheel should be more interesting and more confident (in fact, it is. I have tried it!). All of the bikes in Malaysian Cub Prix series uses a special race model wheel (which you can buy) that is in the size of 1.85 front and 2.50 rear. The added width provides better contact from the tyre to the asphalt which means added grip. Yamaha are known to always comes out with bikes with great cornering character. Wider wheels also have some added weight which deficits it fuel efficiency. I think that is a good compromise to sacrifice the fuel for better handling. This actually will make the modders happy since there is no need to upgrade for aftermarket wheel to get the wider setup after the modders already upped the performance of their Y135LC ES. The early ES circa 2006-2010 has been able to extract 19hp from its engine with medium heavy modification. The stock output is just at 12hp, so 19hp is almost double the engine performance. For comparison, Yamaha RX-Z 2-stroke output is at 21hp and 2011 Honda CBR250R is at 26hp. So, few more extreme modification can bring this bike to close the gap of power output. Wider wheel sent more power to asphalt with added grip and at the same time eliminate excessive wheel spin.\nThe introduction of 5-speed gearbox to this King of Moped has made it more exclusive than ever. But this doesn’t relate to higher top speed as I thought. Ghani has test drive this bike for 700km trip from KL-Kuantan-KL and found out that the top speed for the bike is only at 120km/h. I also heard a lot about this top speed issue from other Y135LC ES rider, salesmen at GTMax and also from my friend who owns this bike. What I can say about this 5-speed gearbox is that, the rider will have better control of the RPM for the wheel traction with additional one more gear at disposal. One more thing that I notice with this gearbox is that engine will be sounding very silent while you are on the top gear. The top gear are also overdrive, which means that the 5th gear is rotating much faster that the crankshaft revolution. This, in theory, can mean higher top speed and much better fuel efficiency. Again, you already know the top speed of this bike is only at 120km/h. I think, the bike must have some kind of RPM or ignition cut-off (my theory only) from its CDI that limits the power output. But, I also heard from another rider that has changed his CDI to LHK brand but still no change at top speed. Still at 120km/h. Maybe we should wait for the BRT PowerMax version(or is it already available?). I always think that a bike should achieve at least 140km/h in stock condition. In 1990-2001, this statement is true with the presence Yamaha SS/SS II, 125Z/ZR, Suzuki RG/RGV/RGX, Kawasaki K1 and Honda Hurricane. All of these bike easily reach 140km/h and beyond since they are all 2-stroke bikes! Top speed are still important when discussing about small bikes since we want to know how fast can we go with that small and limited features of the engine.\nWith all these important features available to the Y135LC ES, it has also become a poison for itself. This is because this bike will become a prized item for a thief! This also relate to a higher insurance for any bike which carries the Yamaha name on it. Last week, my friend tells me that he has lost his Y125ZR which he just bought few months ago. Terrible!\nThis writing are based on my experience with the bike and with my limited knowledge of the biking scene. You can have different opinion than me and I respect your different views about it. So, in the end, is it a good buy? I don’t know! It is up you.\nAdvertisements",

He had been attending in the Moto2 class from the 13th to the 18th round of the Road Racing World Championship before arriving at Losail International Circuit in Qatar to participate in this important race, the final round of the Asia Road Racing Championship. People are interested in the Azlan’s performance because he had raced in the different circumstances, working with different team and riding the different machine. Besides Azlan, Makoto Tamada also came back from the injury suffering at Suzuka 8-hours and would participate in the final round, although he was far from the perfect condition yet.\nAzlan showed his pace and broke the record of Ryuichi Kiyonari, the defending champion and was Azlan’s team mate in the practice session. But Azlan was not satisfied with his riding, because he thought he could not change the style of Moto2 completely. In the qualifying session, Zamri Baba (Yamaha), Broc John Parkes (Yamaha) of wild card who had raced in the World Superbike Championship, Katsuaki Fujiwara (Kawasaki) and Azlan were competed and Azlan took the 4th pole position in the season.  \nIn Race 1, Azlan demonstrated his pace again and went forward actively to lead the race. He started to run away from the pack and came home with enough advantage. Azlan increased the gap to Fujiwara who came second, so the title would be given to him if he got 0.5 more points in Race 2. Tomoyoshi Koyama (NTS JAPAN T.Pro. Innovation) was 8th, his team mate Satoru Iwata was 9th, Ryuta Kobayashi (MuSASHi Boon Siew Honda Racing Malaysia) came 11th and Tamada finished the race in 20th place.\nRace 2 was held with 13 laps, because it was reduced after the crash in the warm up laps. However only needed the 0.5 points, Azlan pushed hard and joined the top battle between Parkes, Fujiwara and Baba. The top 4 changed positions at corners several times from the early stages. Parkes added momentum and pushed hard Azlan in the end of the race, but Azlan managed to keep him behind and crossed the line to take the winning. The gap only 0.180 seconds between him. Followed was Fujiwara and Baba. Koyama came 8th, Kobayashi 9th, Iwata 15th and Tamada came 19th.\nAzlan took the 12 podiums consecutively and took the title for the first time for Malasian in 12 years. Asia Road Racing rookie, Koyama and Kobayashi got 5th and 6th in the championship. Tamada was 8th, Iwata finished the season in 13th place.\nAdvertisements",

I have tested this AGVSPORT Armour 3D riding jacket and absolutely satisfied with it. Even more satisfied to know that it is only priced at RM208!\nThe first time I ride with this jacket is when I take back the Z250SL to my home for the test ride. It was at night and when riding with this Armour 3D jacket, I feel so hot and I thought maybe this is due to the night that is hot. It turns out that I fully zipped the jacket and the jacket polyester works effectively to prevent the cold at night. Then, I open the jacket a bit and ride on. The night was actually cold as I always remembers it and this Armour just works to prevent the cold getting inside.\nI think, if this is how it works, then what happens if I ride at day? It turns out great too. On an average speed of 100km/h, you can open up the jacket a bit to let a little air in, but on my testing, it does not feel anyway uncomfortable to have it fully zipped.\nMy advise for you is to choose the jacket size properly so it can fit very well to you. For my size, I’m using M, but that is a little on the large side, but S is too small. So, choose your AGVSPORT Armour 3D jacket well and with its price of RM208, I think it will well worth your money.\nContact Mr Amir: [email protected] for more details about the AGVSPORT.\nOr www.qbee.com.my\nAdvertisements",

        "1000cc\nducati\nPanigale 1199 \n\n2013 Ducati 1199 Panigale R \n\n\nPosted on October 6, 2013October 8, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe pursuit of perfection\nThe 2013 Ducati Superbike family now presents the highly-anticipated 1199 Panigale R, the absolute flagship of the range and the machine specially developed with enhanced technical specification by Ducati Corse for World Superbike homologation. Its design includes a number of specially developed components intended for connoisseurs of performance and, as part of an ongoing initiative of reacting immediately to owner feed-back, its arrival introduces a series of enhancements throughout the 1199 range. These enhancements include improved heat protection for the rider and latest generation engine management mapping and Ride-by-Wire calibration.  \nThe “R” takes everything the formidable “S” model iscurrently equipped with, including top-of-the-range Öhlins electronic suspension, and applies a list of enhancements that enable the model to achieve even greater targets. While the chassis now sports an adjustable swingarm pivot position and numerous\nweight-saving components in carbon fibre, the engine adopts titanium con-rods, which save an overall 0.63kg (1.38lb), a 0.7kg (1.54lb) lighter crankshaft flywheel and DLC-coated rocker-arms. These engine modifications now enhance the Superquadro crank acceleration and allow it to rev 500rpm higher to a new 12,000rpm limit, an incredible engineering achievementfor 112mm pistons. The higher limit has also enabled the model’s final drive to use a 41 tooth rear sprocket (39 on the standard and “S” version), effectively delivery more torque to the rear wheel without compromising top-end speed. The famous “R” race kit components consist of high-penetration racing screen, fairing mirror caps in machined alloy and a full Termignoni exhaust system with dedicated ECU mapping (for track use only). The system provides an impressive power increase of 3% at the top of the rev-range and 15% in the mid-range. The race-oriented “R” model also features a 4-point adjustable swingarm pivot, designed to enable riders a personalised and precise set-up of varying levels of pro or anti-squat to optimise traction on corner exit. The settings are dialled-in using two user-friendly eccentric adjusters that offer pivot positions at +2mm higher, -2mm lower and -4mm lower than the standard position, each positively and accurately locked and located. The clearly marked, easy-to-use system provides optimum adjustability for competition use. Additional enhancements to the machine include lightweight carbon fibre rear hugger, rear suspension\nguard, heels guards, ignition switch surround and top fairing inner panels and carbon fibre protectors for the single-sided swingarm and clutch cover. These lightweight chassis and engine components enable the “R” version a dry weight of just 165kg (363.7lb), even with an ABS braking system fitted as standard equipment.\nThis top-of-the-range model is also fitted with a special race-style seat fabric for added “feel” and equipped\nwith the GPS-enhanced Ducati Data Acquisition system, for automatic lap times and circuit map-linked data.\nThe 1199 Panigale R is dressed in Ducati red with defining white race features and sporting a mix of red and\nbrushed aluminium on the fuel tank. “Ducati Corse” graphics in white proudly decorate the fairing side\npanels with Ducati Corse logos mounted also on fuel tank top and front fender.\nExtreme benchmark\nDucati’s latest generation Superbike, the 1199 Panigale, goes beyond the barriers of motorcycle design and\nengineering to set the most extreme benchmark ever and the direction for future sport bikes. Developed in\nthe red-hot environment of racing and designed to raise the performance bar to its highest, the 1199\nPanigale uses innovative Ducati Corse-derived solutions to make World Championship level technology\navailable to everyone.\nThe most high tech, most powerful twin-cylinder production engine on the planet is now an integral part of\nan innovative monocoque chassis that combine to deliver an astonishing 195hp from 165kg* (363.7lb) of\nfuturistic Italian thoroughbred. The highest production motorcycle power-to-weight and torque-to-weight\nratios in the world are fitting trophies for the incredible results that Ducati have achieved.\nWith the click of a button, Ducati’s Riding Mode concept delivers performance with enhanced rider\nconfidence by combining seven class-leading technologies. The latest-generation sports ABS system,\nDucati Traction Control (DTC), Ducati Electronic Suspension (DES), Ducati Quick-Shift (DQS), Ducati’s\nrace-derived Engine Brake Control (EBC) and Ride-by-Wire (RbW) are now all programmed into seamless,\nelectronic rider assistance. Even the full colour Thin Film Transistor (TFT) display changes to suit the rider’s\nenvironment.\nState-of-the-art from the ground-up and melding latest technologies with the latest family features, the 1199\nPanigale is totally “Ducati” in every respect. Its no-compromise approach to sport design and stylish\nattention to incredibly fine detail presents authentic Italian performance at its purist.\nRacing is the platform on which Ducati has always challenged and measured itself. It is a discipline for\ndesigners and engineers and the bedrock of motivation for a company in which the constant desire for\nvictory has become a way of life. With over 300 World Superbike race wins and more World Championship\ntitles than all other manufacturers together, Ducati’s focus on sportbikes is stronger than ever.\nDucati combined the innovative “monocoque” frame solution and the extraordinary “Superquadro”\nL-twin engine design, with race-derived electronics toproduce the champion of all Superbikes. Bred for the\ntrack and trained for the road, the 1199 Panigale is a true revolution of the species destined to influence the\nentire sportsbike environment.\n* R version dry weight\nRevolution of the species\nDesigners and engineers of the latest generation Superbike were given a “blank canvas” to reach the\napparently impossible 1199 Panigale targets of 10kg less weight and 25hp more power. Every detail, every\ndimension and every design decision was driven entirely by a zero-compromise brief to create the highest\nperformance Ducati Superbike of all time. The 1199 Panigale set the most extreme benchmark ever and its\narrival represented one of the most historic moments in Ducati’s long Superbike history.\nPronounced “Pan-ee-gah-lee”, the model broke with Ducati’s Superbike tradition by adding a name to its\n1199 engine designation and making a significant association to its historic roots in the Borgo Panigale area\nof Bologna. In an Italian territory known as “Motor Valley” and where high performance and racing runs\nthrough the veins of its passionate people, Ducati have underlined their pride in being world ambassadors\nfor the “Made in Italy” title by immortalizing their birthplace in the name of the new Superbike.\nUnmistakably Ducati\nEvery last detail of the 1199 Panigale pays tribute to the rich heritage of racing on which Ducati is built.\nComponents that are not only functionally efficient, but also minimalist, essential and beautifully engineered\ninto pieces of automotive art.\nClimb aboard the 1199 Panigale and take hold of the bars and the feeling of pure racing is everywhere. The\nfinely formed top-clamp with weight-saving hollows and recesses immediately communicates Italian\nengineering at its very best.\nRadial brake and clutch pumps, Ducati’s precise switchgear and full Ride-by-Wire twistgrip give a\nrace-driven sense of minimalism further enhanced with the monocoque-integral steering head flowing into the\nmagnesium front sub-frame and Ducati Corse-style instrumentation. Even the lightweight, 17 litre (4.5 gal\nUS) aluminium fuel tank is sculpted perfectly to the rider.\nThe horizontal twin headlamps are integrated with the frontal intake ducts, creating a true “race face” for the\nSuperbike proudly illuminated by motorcycling’s first ever full LED positioning and main light solutions.\nTwin rear lights are moulded perfectly around the recessed seat air ducts and illuminate with an attractive\nlight-guide surround effect, enhanced with LED brake lights. Front LED indicators are integrated into the\nmirror bodies and rear indicators, which are also LED*, are styled with clear lenses.\nThe majority of the frontal air ducts feed the main airbox, while a small splitter also diverts air into the fairing\nbodywork to ensure efficient cooling for the onboard electronics. The carefully executed shape at the rear of\nthe fairing enables a highly efficient exit from the radiator area, protecting the Superquadro’s power output\nand further reducing aerodynamic resistance.\nThe sleek shape of the seat and tail-piece is accentuated by the under-engine location of the exhaust\nsystem, further enhancing the aggressive stance of a true Ducati Superbike.\n*Country specific\nMonocoque technology\nThe 1199 Panigale’s chassis represents Ducati’s innovative and courageous step forward in motorcycle\ndesign, merging multiple parts into one compact and lightweight component. Developed in the super-competitive\nracing environment, the extremely compact monocoque construction integrates the airbox to\nbecome one of the key elements in reducing the Superbike’s overall dry weight by an incredible 10kg (22lb)\nto a benchmark 165kg* (363.7lb).\nUsing the Superquadro engine as a stressed member of the chassis, the short and strong aluminium\nmonocoque is made in die-cast aluminium and is responsible for 5kg (11lb) of the overall weight saving of\nthe design. The monocoque attaches to the cylinder heads of the specially designed engine, protruding\nforward to house the steering head bearings and forming the airbox along the way, which is capped-off and\nsealed when the, 17 litre (4.5 gal US) aluminium fuel tank is attached, again using one component to the\nfulfil the roles of two.\nWhile the cylinders remain true to Ducati’s signature 90° L-twin configuration, the engine design effectively\nrotated the top-end backwards around the crankshaft a further 6° compared to the 1198, giving more\nclearance on the front wheel and enabling engineers to modify the front and rear weight bias. This also\nenables a front-end geometry of 24.5° of rake and 100mm (3.94in) of trail. Attaching directly to the rear of\nthe engine, the fully die-cast aluminium, single-sided swingarm with adjustable pivot point enables a\nwheelbase of 1,437mm (56.6in) and helps set the weight distribution of the 1199 Panigale at 52% front and\n48% rear with average-size rider onboard.\nWith the exhaust system located below the engine, the die-cast aluminium rear sub-frame is considerably\nlighter and also attaches directly to the Superquadro engine, while the super lightweight, magnesium front\nsub-frame attaches directly to the monocoque frame, providing secure support for the headlamp,\ninstrumentation and fairing. This combination of weight saving and centralisation of mass around these high\nfront and rear sub-frame areas substantially contributes to overall vehicle agility.\n* R version dry weight\nInnovative suspension\nIncorporating Ducati’s Riding Mode technology, the 1199 Panigale R is fully equipped with front and rear\nDucati Electronic Suspension (DES) system by Öhlins. The 43mm Öhlins NIX30 forks are adjustable\nelectronically in compression and rebound damping, while spring pre-load is manual. The 1199 Panigale\nfork leg centres are set to World Superbike-style widths, enabling uncompromised air-flow to the brake discs\nfor optimum cooling and an adjustable steering damper completes the full Öhlins package.\nThe Öhlins TTX36 rear unit features twin tube technology for totally separate damping adjustment in\ncompression and rebound and to minimise the risk of cavitation under extreme conditions. The unit is fully\nadjustable electronically in compression and rebound damping, while spring pre-load is manual.\nThe electronic suspension adjustment can be made either by using the pre-set Riding Modes, which have\nbeen developed by Ducati test riders and racers, or in independent mode, which allows riders to use their\nown personal and saveable settings. Digital damping adjustments send signals that execute the mechanical\nadjustment via electronic actuators mounted in the suspension units.\nThe rear suspension of the Panigale features a stylish and practical side-mounting, enabling increased\nspace for the rear cylinder head, which has been rotated backwards around the new generation engine. The\nunique positioning renders the unit totally accessible for spring pre-load and rider-height adjustment, and is\ndesigned to provide a fast and easy linkage adjustment by simply changing the pushrod fixing-point from\n“progressive rate” for road use with a passenger to “flat rate” for track use.\nThe race-oriented “R” model features a 4-point adjustable swingarm pivot, designed to enable riders a\npersonalised and precise set-up of varying levels of pro or anti-squat to optimise traction on corner exit. The\nsettings are dialled-in using two user-friendly eccentric adjusters that offer\npivot positions at +2mm higher, -2mm lower and -4mm lower than the standard position, each positively and accurately locked and located.\nThe clearly marked, easy-to-use system provides optimum adjustability for competition use.\nLatest generation brakes\nThe 1199 Panigale generation of Superbikes use the latest generation of Brembo Monobloc M50 callipers,\npresenting a super-compact design that reduced their total unsprung weight by 0.5kg.\nMachined from a single piece of alloy, the callipers achieve a higher rigidity and resistance to distortion\nduring extreme braking. The resulting increase in hydraulic efficiency not only delivers incredible braking\npower, but also provides an enhanced and precise “feel” at the brake lever. The twin Monobloc M50\ncallipers each have four 30mm pistons that grip 330mm discs to achieve spectacular braking performance.\nSport-oriented ABS\nThe 1199 Panigale R uses the very latest in sport-oriented ABS technology to enable full integration with\nDucati’s three pre-programmed Riding Modes. Operating with the latest generation 9ME Bosch processor,\nthe system enables full ABS on the front only, when in Race mode, allowing the rider initial braking drift on\nthe rear during race track corner entry. The system then activates full front and rear ABS, front-to-rear\ncombined braking (CBS) and “rear lift-up” detection when in Sport and Wet Riding Modes.\nRemaining almost undetectable at the lever, these advanced features enable shorter braking distances by\noptimising brake force distribution for superior vehicle stability. The advanced ABS, can also be deactivated\nvia the instrumentation control panel.\nPanigale wheels and tyres\nThe 1199 Panigale R rolls on super lightweight, triple 3-spoke, forged and machined wheels by Marchesini,\nin 3.5in front rim width and 6.00in rear, enabling a fast change of direction and enhanced acceleration and\nbraking performances. Finished in black, the wheels are mounted with Pirelli Diablo Supercorsa SP tyres,\nroad-going race replicas of the official World Superstock 1000 fitment. While the front uses a 120/70 ZR17,\nthe 200/55 x ZR17 represents the widest rear tyre ever fitted to a production Ducati Superbike.\nDesigned for precise line-holding and corner trajectory, the rear 200/55 x ZR17 effectively increases the\ncontact patch area and speed of lean by combining the 200mm width with a higher profile. Pirelli and Ducati\nengineers worked together to create this ideal “match” between front and rear profiles and the results\ngenerate incredible “feel” and directional agility from the new monocoque chassis technology during corner-entry.\nThe structures and compounds are derived directly from Pirelli’s experience in World Superbike competition.\nThey present a complex carcass designed for stiffness under heavy braking and shoulder areas that\nmaximise contact patch, further enhanced with a bi-compound tread laced with new polymers to generate\nrapid warm-up and constant grip.\nElectronic technology\nThe 1199 Panigale R is equipped with many of the latest innovative electronics developed by Ducati on the\nrace track, and they are combined, managed and displayed on full TFT technology instrumentation. First\nintroduced to the motorcycle industry on the Ducati Diavel, the TFT display is super-enhanced on the 1199\nPanigale range.\nThe state-of-the-art electronics package features an enhanced version of the Ducati Data Analyser (DDA+),\nand Ducati Riding Modes, with fully integrated ABS, Ducati Electronic Suspension (DES), Ducati Traction\nControl (DTC), Ducati Quick Shift (DQS), Engine Brake Control (EBC), full Ride-by-Wire (RbW) and the Thin\nFilm Transistor instrumentation (TFT).\nThe 1199 Panigale R uses a compact Ducati Quick Shift (DQS), and increases its formidable fire power with\na sport-intended, adjustable ABS system and Ducati’s Engine Brake Control system (EBC), designed to\nenhance stability during de-acceleration.\nDucati Riding Modes\nFirst introduced  in 2010, Ducati’s industry-changing Riding Modes effectively offer the perfect set-up\nappropriate to rider and environment by selecting from a choice of three pre-set modes. Each Riding Mode\nis pre-programmed to instantly change engine character and suspension set-up in addition to ABS, DTC and\nEBC levels – even while riding. The modes are made possible by combining a number of class-leading\ntechnologies.\nAn electronic Ride-by-Wire (RbW) system – withenhanced calibration for 2013 – administers different\nmappings to regulate power delivery, while  Ducati Electronic Suspension (DES), by Öhlins, instantly\nconfigures the suspension set-up with electronic adjustment. The Ducati Traction Control system (DTC)\nuses eight levels of system interaction to enhance control by reducing wheel-spin and the latest generation\nof ABS processor provides ideal anti-lock levels. EBC monitors crankshaft de-acceleration under heavy\nbraking and administers RbW throttle opening to maintain optimum grip.\nRace Riding Mode\nThe Race Riding Mode provides the track rider with an unrestricted 195hp with direct RbW throttle response\nand an instant track-oriented suspension set-up. Racemode also reduces the DTC system intervention,\nprovides a race-oriented EBC and front-only ABS with reduced anti-rear-lift-up and instantly reconfigures the\ninstrumentation layout with a track-oriented display.\nSport Riding Mode\nThe Sport Riding Mode provides the road or track rider with 195hp, delivered with a “smooth” RbW throttle\nresponse and  a sport-oriented suspension set-up. Sport mode slightly increases the DTC system\nintervention, provides a sport-oriented EBC and front and rear ABS with increased anti-rear-lift-up.\nWet Riding Mode\nThe Wet Riding Mode provides the road or track rider with 120hp, delivered with a “smooth” RbW throttle\nresponse, increased DTC system intervention, environment-appropriate EBC, DQS off and fully enhanced\nABS and a suspension set-up optimised for low grip conditions.\nThin Film Transistor instrumentation (TFT)\nThe 1199 Panigale’s instrumentation uses Ducati’s industry-leading Thin Film Transistor (TFT) screen unit\nthat embraces the very latest information display technology. The full colour display automatically changes\nits layout according to the Riding Mode selected in  order to provide optimum clarity of information\nappropriate to the motorcycle’s environment, even reversing its character and\nbackground colours in low-light conditions. For the 1199 Panigale R a number of display changes have been programmed to manage\nthe higher rev-limit.\nThe high-definition instrumentation displays RPM from 1000-12,500 in a scale that curves through 90°\naround the left and upper edge of the main screen, incrementally adding bars of light around the display as\nthe engine speed increases, while enlarging each of the main 1-12 numbers in the scale as each value is\nreached. During the first 1000km running-in period, the “orange section” of the rev-range automatically\nmoves down from its normal 10,500 lower level to 6,000rpm. When the running-in period is completed, the\norange section automatically returns to its 11,000-12,000rpm range, although during each engine warm-up,\nit is programmed to start from 8,000rpm, increasing to 9,000 and finally to its normal 11,000rpm position\nwhen the engine reaches normal working temperature. Along the bottom of the screen from left to right, is\nthe current status and/or setting of Riding Mode, ABS, DTC, DQS and EBC and on the right of the screen,\nan easy-to-read gear indicator displaying from N to 6 with the top left corner of the screen displaying the\ntime.\nIn “Road” and “Wet” Riding Modes the vehicle speed takes precedence in the centre of the display with\nlarge numerals, while two framed “additional information” panels, situated below, present total mileage by\ndefault on the left and engine coolant temperature on the right. Both left and right readings are scrollable\nwhile riding to read trip 1, trip 2 and fuel reserve trip on the left info frame with the scroll-up button on the\nswitchgear. Actual and average fuel consumption, average speed, journey time and air temperature appear\non the right info frame with the scroll-down button.\nIn “Race” Riding Mode, the display automatically reconfigures by re-scaling the RPM read-out, moving the\nlesser important vehicle speed to the lower left info frame and making way for the latest lap time to be\ndisplayed large in the centre of the screen. When actuated, the lap time facility is triggered manually by\nusing the flasher button on the switchgear or automatically with the GPS equipped DDA+.\nWhen the 1199 Panigale R is stationary, the instrumentation is also used as a user-friendly control panel to\npersonalise ABS, EBC, DES, DTC, DQS, and RbW settings within each Riding Mode before saving. In\naddition to listing the last 30 recorded lap times, each time also shows the lap number and the maximum\nspeed and maximum rpm recorded during that lap.\nFixed icons on the left of the main screen from top to bottom show warnings for left turn signal, main beam,\nABS-off and neutral, while from top to bottom on the right of the display are turn signal right, oil pressure,\nfuel reserve and engine electronics. Countdown icons are programmed to appear on the screen to advise of\nupcoming scheduled maintenance. A strip of red lights rising on the right and left outer edges and across the\ntop of the instrumentation illuminate incrementally upwards to warn of over-rev. The first 25% at 11,000rpm,\n50% at 11,200rpm, 75% at 11,400rpm and 100% as both strips meet and the top centre bar starts to flash.\nBelow the top, centre over-rev bar is a second bar that illuminates in orange during DTC interaction.\nDucati Data Analyser+ (DDA+)\nThe Ducati Data Analyser (DDA) consists of a software download and a USB-ready data retrieval card and\nevaluates the performances of the motorcycle and its rider by graphically presenting specific channels of\ninformation.\nDDA+ is the latest generation of the system and introduces a GPS function that automatically\nrecords lap-times every time the 1199 Panigale R crosses a circuit start/finish line. As the rider crosses the start and\nfinish line and presses the lights flasher button, the innovative system logs the coordinates of that position\nand then automatically logs each lap time as the motorcycle completes subsequent laps.\nAn essential piece of equipment for the circuit, DDA records numerous channels of data including throttle\nopening, vehicle speed, engine rpm, gear selected, engine temperature, distance travelled, laps and lap\ntimes. An additional channel of information is also dedicated to recording the DTC index which can then be\nviewed as a graphic trace indicating the amount of DTC interaction during wheel-spin. At the end of a ride or\ntrack session, data can be downloaded ready to compare, analyse and get an inside view of the\nperformance of the rider and motorcycle.\nDucati Electronic Suspension (DES)\nThe 1199 Panigale R is equipped with Öhlins suspension and features the innovative Ducati Electronic\nSuspension (DES). The technology enables front and rear rebound and compression damping adjustments\nto be controlled automatically by using the pre-set Riding Modes or in independent mode, allowing riders to\nuse their own personal and saveable settings. Digital damping adjustments made via the instrumentation\nsend signals that execute the mechanical adjustment via electronic actuators mounted inside the\nsuspension units.\nDucati Traction Control (DTC)\nDucati’s highly successful DTC system has been refined for the 1199 Panigale range and fully integrated\ninto the electronics package of all versions. It uses the same software logic developed and used by Ducati\nCorse for their MotoGP and World Superbike motorcycles and offers a choice of eight settings developed by\na team of professional test riders and racers.\nAccessible from the left-hand switchgear and displayed on the TFT instrumentation, the system offers a\nchoice of eight profiles, each one programmed with a wheel-spin tolerance graded from one to eight. While\nlevel eight administers a confidence-building, high level of interaction from the system by activating upon the\nslightest detection of wheel-spin, level one offers a much higher tolerance and so reduced intervention for\nhighly competent riders. The DTC system status and level is constantly displayed on the instrumentation,\nreminding the rider of the current interaction level if the Riding Modes is changed.\nWhen the level that best suits the combination of road or track conditions and riding style has been selected\nand the DTC system activated, front and rear wheel sensors compare speed differential to sense when rear\ntraction is being broken (wheel-spin). DTC then decides the best combination of two different types of\ninstant electronic adjustment, calculated with data supplied from multiple sources. The first ‘soft’ stage of\nsystem interaction is executed by high speed software that makes instant electronic adjustment to the\nignition timing, administering varying amounts of ignition retardation to reduce the engine’s torque. If the\nDTC software detects that the first ‘soft’ stage of system interaction is inadequate to control the wheel-spin,\nit continues to administer ignition retardation and, in addition, instructs the engine ECU to initiate a pattern of\nconstantly increasing injection cuts until, if necessary, full injection cut.\nDuring both stages of system interaction, an orange warning light, which is visible in the rider’s peripheral\nvision and situated across the top of the instrumentation, illuminates to signify that DTC is being used. As\nsoon as the system recognises the gradual return of equal wheel speeds, it incrementally re-establishes\nnormal power delivery. This seamless interaction iskey to the super-smooth operation of the system.\nDucati Quick Shift (DQS)\nThe Ducati Quick Shift (DQS) system, allows the rider to keep the throttle open when changing-up through\nthe gearbox, helping to save vital fractions of a second in the pursuit of faster lap-times. The system not only\nsaves time when changing gear, but also enables the possibility of uninterrupted air flow through the throttle\nbodies throughout the upward gear-changing process.\nThe system consists of a micro-switch built into the linkage of the gear change lever, which when actuated\nin the direction of selecting a higher gear, sends a signal to the main ECU. The ECU instantly understands\nwhich gear the motorcycle is in by calculating the rpm and vehicle speed and then reads the amount of\nthrottle opening before applying a pre-programmed cut in fuel injection and ignition measured in\nmilliseconds. This spilt-second electronic interruption in drive is programmed precisely to allow the next gear\nto be selected without having to actuate the clutch or close the throttle. As the system only functions for a\nmatter of milliseconds, the 1199 Panigale can still be ridden using a normal gear-changing style.\nEngine Brake Control (EBC)\nThe “Engine Brake Control” (EBC) system was developed by Ducati Corse to help riders optimise vehicle\nstability under extreme corner-entry racing conditions by equalising the positive and negative forces of\ntorque subjected to the rear tyre under severe engine-braking conditions. EBC monitors throttle position,\ngear selected and crankshaft de-acceleration rate under heavy braking and administers precise RbW\nthrottle openings to balance the torque forces acting on the tyre. EBC has a three level operating system\naccessible from the instrumentation and is integrated automatically into its three Riding Modes to provide an\nadditional and highly effective rider aid.\nThe “Superquadro” power house\nDucati’s no-compromise approach to design has set the most extreme twin-cylinder benchmark ever and the\nSuperquadro represents the latest milestone in Ducati’s long and iconic history of Superbike engines.\nThe innovative Superquadro engine, so called because of its massively over-square bore and stroke ratio,\nincreased power to an absolute production twin-cylinder milestone of 195hp and torque to 98.1 lb-ft\n(13.5kgm) with user-friendly Riding Modes that deliver power appropriate to the rider’s style and\nenvironment. Its construction has enabled a radical reduction in overall vehicle weight and, further\nidentifying Ducati’s constant pursuit of performance perfection, major services have been extended to\n24,000km (15,000 miles).\nEngine architecture\nWith the engine designed to be a fully stressed member of the chassis, its architecture has been completely\nre-calculated to provide the best possible vehicle construction for layout, weight distribution and strength.\nThe cylinders, which remain at 90° to each other, were effectively rotated backwards around the crankcases\nby 6°, until the front cylinder were 21° from horizontal. This enabled the engine to be positioned 32mm\nfurther forwards for improved front / rear weight distribution in addition to perfectly positioning the cylinder\nhead attachment points for the Panigale’s monocoque frame.\nThe crankcases, which are vacuum die-cast using Vacural® technology to ensure optimal weight saving,\nconsistent wall thickness and increased strength, also incorporate the outer water-jacket of the “cylinder”,\neliminating the jointing face that used to exist at the base of the cylinders. Instead, the Superquadro has\nseparate nikasil-coated aluminium “wet-liners” inserted into the tops of the crankcase apertures. This design\nenables secure fixing of the cylinder head directly to the crankcase, improved sealing and enhanced heat\ndissipation from the thin cylinder-liners directly into the surrounding coolant.\nThe primary-drive casing, clutch casing and outer cover, sump and cam covers are all cast in magnesium\nalloy, ensuring a lightweight engine despite its increased strength as an integral part of the chassis.\nThe crankcases use shell main bearings for the crankshaft, enabling an increase in diameter of the crank\njournals for enhanced rigidity and an increase of the crankcase section around the main bearing area for\nimproved strength in line with the Superquadro’s extreme power output. For 2013, the new 1199 Panigale R\ngoes one step further with the introduction of titanium con-rods, which save 0.63kg (1.38lb) and a new,\nlightweight crankshaft flywheel, saving a further 0.7kg (1.54lb). This reduction in weight and increase in\nstrength now enables a 500rpm higher rev-limit to 12,000rpm. The shell bearings are force-fed oil from\ninternal drillings within the main bearing pillars to keep the crankshaft well lubricated and is quickly\nscavenged back into the sump with the introduction of a highly efficient GP-style vacuum pump.\nThe pump is driven by the main oil pump shaft and effectively maintains constant vacuum in the crankcase\narea below the pistons, reducing atmospheric resistance during the down-stroke of the piston and controlling\nthe internal “breathing” of the engine.\nExtreme dimensions\nIn calculating the optimum configuration for the big step forward in power output for the L-twin engine,\nDucati and Ducati Corse engineers increased engine speed and enhanced breathability with the incredible\nbore and stroke of 112mm x 60.8mm (4.40×2.39in). The intense study of power and ridability resulted in an\noutput of 195hp @ 10,750rpm and 98.1 lb-ft (13.5kgm) @ 9,000rpm. The bore and stroke ratio of 1.84:1\neffectively increases rpm with the ultra-short stroke of the crankshaft and increases the cylinder area to\nenable valves diameters of 46.8mm (1.71-1.84in)for inlets and 38.2mm (1.35-1.5in) exhaust.\nWith such large inlet valves operating at higher rpm, the intense inertial forces have been controlled by\nusing titanium instead of steel. The valves are actuated by, ‘super-finished’ rocker arms for reduced friction\nand fatigue and then coated in and diamond-like carbon (DLC) on the new 1199 Panigale R.\nThe race-derived Superquadro pistons have a distinctive double-ribbed undercrown to achieve high strength\nand reduced friction by using minimal piston wall surface area. Using technology developed by Ducati\nCorse, the design enables reliable operation of the 112mm diameter pistons when performing at high rpm.\nThe improved volumetric efficiency of the increased inlet valve diameters is further capitalised on by\nincreasing the oval throttle body dimensions from an equivalent diameter of 63.9 to a massive and\nhigh-flowing 67.5mm (2.66in). The Ride-by-Wire throttle bodies feed air across twin injectors per cylinder, one\npositioned below the butterfly for enhanced flexibility and one above for outright power.\nClean power\nWith such enhanced “breathing”, the challenge for the Superquadro’s design engineers was to program\nperformance-optimised fuel mapping for a smoother cycle-to-cycle engine operation, without compromising\nemissions. To achieve this, Ducati introduced a secondaryair system that completes the oxidisation of\nunburned hydrocarbons and effectively reduces HC and CO levels. The system is activated when the\nengine ECU recognises specific conditions in the engine’s operation via the lambda and throttle opening\nsensors. It then opens a valve enabling a flow of clean air from the main airbox to a reed valve situated in\neach cylinder head, which enables one-way flow into an air gallery exiting into the exhaust port close to the\nexhaust valve. Entering the hottest point of the exhaust gasses, the fresh charge of air enhances the burn\nenvironment, eliminating any unburned fuel that escapes during the exhaust cycle under certain conditions.\nDesmo dependent\nNever before has Ducati’s unique Desmodromic system been so vitally important. With the high engine\nspeeds at which the Superquadro operates combined with such large valves, it would be impossible for the\nvalve’s rocker-arm to follow the steep closure profile of the cam lobe using normal valve closure springs.\nThe Desmo system actuates valve closure mechanically with the same method and accuracy as it opens,\nenabling steep cam profiles, radical cam timings, large valves and high operating speeds. This system is\nused on every single Ducati motorcycle and is constantly proven on Ducati Corse’s World Superbikes and\nDesmosedici GP bikes.\nThe power of precision\nThe large valves and precise Desmodromic systemare driven by a combined chain and gear-drive\narrangement. The conventional bush-type chain runs from the crankshaft to the cylinder head where a\nsingle sprocket positioned between inlet and exhaust camshafts, is attached back-to-back to a gear wheel\nmounted on its own short, dedicated shaft. The attached gear meshes directly with gears on the ends of\nboth the inlet and exhaust camshafts, which are also designed with +/- position adjustment for ultra-precise\ncam-calibration. The cam chain, therefore, provides highly efficient point-to-point drive route and, tensioned\nautomatically, provides continuous reliability, further reducing the cost of routine maintenance.\nOn the end of each exhaust cam drive gear is a centrifugal flyweight which retracts at speeds below tick-over to rotate a “protrusion” from the concentric section of the cam, thus creating sufficient valve lift to act as\na de-compressor. This ingenious device enables the Superquadro engine to be started easily without using\na larger battery and starter motor, which helped reduce overall vehicle weight by approximately 3.3kg\n(7.3lb). When the engine starts and the camshafts begin to rotate at tick-over speed, the centrifugal\nflyweight flicks out, retracting the “protrusion” back into the cam and allowing complete valve closure for full\ncompression. This innovative feature further underlines the lengths to which designers and engineers have\nworked together in the single-minded pursuit of weight-saving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransmission\nThe Panigale is the first top-of-the-range Ducati Superbike to use a “wet”, oil-bath clutch. Based very closely\non the design of the Multistrada and Diavel components, the clutch assembly features a “slipper” function\nand a progressive self-servo mechanism that compresses the friction plates when under drive from the\nengine. While enhancing frictional efficiency, this also results in a rider-friendly light clutch lever “feel” at the\nhandlebar. Conversely, when the drive force is reversed (over-run), the mechanism reduces pressure on the\nfriction plates, enabling a true racing “slipper” action, reducing the destabilizing effect of the rear-end under\naggressive down-shifting.\nR extras\n1199 Panigale R\n•As “S” version with:\noDucati red with white racing features colour scheme\noLightweight titanium con-rods\noLightweight crankshaft flywheel\noDLC-coated rocker-arms\noIncreased rev-limit (12,000rpm)\no15/41 Final drive\no4-point adjustable swingarm pivot\noCarbon fibre:\nSingle-sided swingarm protector\nClutch cover protector\nRear hugger\nRear suspension guard\nFootrest heel guards\nIgnition switch surround\nTop fairing inner panels\noRace kit:\nFull Termignoni exhaust system\nUp-map key with dedicated ECU mapping\nHigh-penetration racing screen\nFairing mirror-caps\nAdvertisements",

The opening was celebrated by the key-handover to the first owner of a pre-owned ‘Harley’ at a press conference held today.\nThe Pre-owned Motorcycle Centre, located behind the Harley-Davidson main showroom in Petaling Jaya, was announced at a press conference by Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, Joint Group Executive Chairman of NAZA Group of Companies. Also present at the press conference were En Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, Vice President of NAZA Two Wheel Division; En Azian Ramli, Dealer Principle Harley-Davidson of Kuala Lumpur; Mr Raj Thangavelu, the first owner of pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycle and members of the Harley Owners Group (HOG) Malaysia.  \nThe target sales volume of Harley-Davidson motorcycle for 2013 would be 600 units whereas pre-owned Harley-Davidson motorcycle will contributes 100 units to the total sales volume.\nThe Harley-Davidson Pre-owned Motorcycle Centre is a value-added platform that facilitates motorcycle trade-in to H-DKL by existing customers and their subsequent upgrades to newer or different models. The Harleys that are ‘temporary residents at the centre awaiting a new home’ are checked and regulated by a professional team of Harley-Davidson trained technicians.\n“The centre provides an alternative for Harley enthusiasts looking to own a Harley-Davidson bike – one that is attractively priced, has seen a fair few adventures and is primed for many more. Harley enthusiasts will look at these bikes, knowing that they have been pre-loved, rather than just pre-owned,” said Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin.\nAll pre-owned units are genuine local units (acclimatised to suit local conditions) and come with high specifications (upgraded exhaust system, wind shield, saddle bags etc.), low mileage, factory warranty (where applicable) and free service maintenance (where applicable). The pre-owned units consist of trade-in bikes, demo units as well as pre-registered units used for promotional events.

The changes mostly on the exterior where we can see the superbike-style exhaust muffler which is big. The ‘big’ appearance is due to the use of the muffler protector which protects the pillions’ feet/leg from touching the hot exhaust pipe. The headlight now looks like it is being inspired from the Z250SL headlight style.  The engine is still the 4-stroke single-cylinder engine which can produce 9.9PS @ 8,000RPM and 8.6 NM @ 6,000RPM. Handling the rear tyre is the monocross setup that is angled in a more open angle than the previous Athlete model.\nOnly available in Indonesia.\nvia: https://www.facebook.com/KawasakiIndonesia/photos/pcb.802632069832066/802631999832073/?type=1&theater\nAdvertisements",

As part of the collaboration, YME will stimulate TOYOTA Racing’s team mobility by providing Yamaha EC-03 electric (2-wheeler) units for the rounds of Silverstone, Spa and Le Mans.\nYME began providing TOYOTA Racing with EC-03 electric vehicles at the start of the team’s participation in the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2012. The season resulted in an impressive three wins from six races, TOYOTA Racing receiving the Team Rookie of the Year Award from the FIA, and ultimately being named as the best new WEC team of 2012. The 2013 season also featured several highlights. TOYOTA Racing scored multiple podiums and ended the season on a high with a victory at the final round in Bahrain.\nThe EC-03 is Yamaha’s solution to pollution, noise, and high costs in petrol, making the vehicle ideal for short-distance, urban travel. The pure electric vehicle has zero emissions and can charge from any common wall socket through the use of a cable that can be found underneath the seat. The EC-03 is also equipped with a silent operation feature, but this does not mean it suffers in power: this environmentally friendly vehicle comes with a switch that allows riders to enhance the performance capabilities by changing from the Standard mode to the Power mode all with the press of a button on the digital screen.\nFor 2014 TOYOTA Racing has revealed the technologically-advanced TS040 HYBRID car that will compete in the championship. The four-wheel drive vehicle includes the new TOYOTA HYBRID System – Racing, specially developed in response to the revised WEC technical regulations that require a 25% reduction in fuel usage compared to 2013, with savings achieved through powertrain, aerodynamics and driving style efficiencies.  \nEric de Seynes – Operational Director, Yamaha Motor Europe\n“We are delighted to continue working together with TOYOTA Racing through 2014,” commented Eric de Seynes, Operational Director, Yamaha Motor Europe. “The arrival of the TS040 HYBRID racing car takes another step in establishing hybrid technology on the race track, whilst we continue to pioneer electric vehicles for the street, contributing to a cleaner, low carbon society. The synergy between the two initiatives makes our EC03 electric vehicle a natural choice for TOYOTA Racing. As two of Japan’s most respected automotive manufacturers with amazing histories and current exploits at the highest levels of international racing we continue to take pleasure in our partnership of today and our eyes on the future together.”\n \n\n\n\n\nYoshiaki Kinoshita – TOYOTA Racing Team President\n“We are very much looking forward to continuing our partnership with Yamaha as we enter our third season in the FIA World Endurance Championship. We will fight to achieve our dream of winning Le Mans and the World Championship. As well as challenging new regulations which make endurance racing the most road-relevant discipline in top-level motorsport, we also have a new competitor. We are looking forward to competing with Porsche, as well as our more familiar rivals Audi. As a team we learnt a lot in our first two seasons in WEC and all this know-how has gone into our new TS040 HYBRID, which is the most technologically-advanced TOYOTA ever to compete on the track. We consider it very important that our racing program contributes to TOYOTA’s wider activities and I am very proud that data, knowledge and technology pass regularly from our racing program to our R and D colleagues, who are working to make great road cars of the future.”\n\n\n\n\n2014 FIA World Endurance Calendar\n20/04/2014 6 Hours of Silverstone\n03/05/2014 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps\n14/06/2014 24 Heures du Mans\n20/09/2014 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas\n12/10/2014 6 Hours of Fuji\n02/11/2014 6 Hours of Shanghai\n15/11/2014 6 Hours of Bahrain\n30/11/2014 6 Hours of Sao Paulo\nAdvertisements",

        "800cc\nmv agusta\nTurismo Veloce Lusso 800 \n\n2014 MV Agusta Turismo Veloce Lusso 800 – Luxury Fast Tourer \n\n\nPosted on February 1, 2014February 1, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nThe pure emotions involved in traveling, the feeling of the open road beneath you, the limits that get pushed further every day. MV Agusta Turismo Veloce 800. A name that dates back to the early days of Meccanica Verghera, the company founded on the intuition of Count Domenico Agusta and that is now at the very pinnacle of motorcycling thanks to 75 World Championship titles and an incredible history blended with both mystique and performance.\nWith the Turismo Veloce (literally Fast Tourer), MV Agusta has reinterpreted the tourer concept in the name of exclusivity, agility, ease of riding and performance. Unlike all of the heavier and oversized models offered by the competition, MV Agusta has chosen to utilize a compact and powerful 800cc engine. Turismo Veloce brings back the essence of Granturismo. It does so with its unmistakable lines and styling solutions which provide the practicality that no Grand Tourer can do without. It reiterates the same ideal with an approach to riding which makes the new MV Agusta the ground breaker for a new way of travelling.  \n The Turismo Veloce celebrates the unique pleasure of Grand Tourismo with two models of MV Agusta: the first for traveling through time and space with the feeling of agility that only a complete but essential motorcycle can provide.\nThe second is the Turismo Veloce Lusso whose very name suggests things that seem to have been forgotten in time. Lusso stands for an extraordinary level of accessories and technical solutions which include the innovative MVCSC system (MV Agusta Chassis Stability Control) electronic stability control through the use of semi-active suspension, less bulky saddle bags which nevertheless can carry an astounding 60 litres and the new generation MVICS 2.0 (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) inertial platform which includes the up&down EAS 2.0 electronic gear change system as well as the Anti Wheelie System. These features have never before been offered to a Touring bike.\nThe standard equipment also includes an immobiliser, heated handle grips, Bluetooth connection and integrated GPS.\n\nDESIGN\nTurismo Veloce captures the essence touring and transmits the emotions directly to the rider. It means mile after mile of sweeping through curves and bends, hours of riding in complete peace with a single aim: to arrive at your destination in the most enjoyable way possible. Turismo Veloce is the first real tourer that truly provokes new emotions.\nDesigned for medium to long range touring, the Turismo Veloce was developed with an in-line three-cylinder 800cc engine. A milestone which further increases the wide range of machines.\nThe design reflects the compact size of the engine, and the overall form of the bike is beautifully balanced. The saddle bags, which are critical components on any Tourer, simply flow seamlessly into the overall motorcycle design.\nOn the Turismo Veloce the complete integration of aesthetics and function is a reality and the unique design a lesson of innovation. With the saddle bags removed, the Turismo Veloce becomes a true Sports bike as befits its MV Agusta name. With the saddle bags on, the Turismo Veloce remains slender, sleek and exclusive. The tail and headlight units use Full LED technology and add to the marked three-dimensionality of the bike while emphasizing the new layout of the three exit exhaust pipes.\n\nFRAME AND SUSPENSION\nThe frame is unmistakeably MV Agusta – steel tubing at the front set off by aluminium alloy side plates – redesigned to meet the specific requirements of the Turismo Veloce. As a result, it is wider in the middle section and features special plates designed to act as an anchor for the centre stand. The Turismo Veloce makes good use of the rider and passenger saddle support and does likewise with the saddle bags thanks to a lightweight aluminium alloy support system. The suspension system has been developed to ensure maximum comfort when touring and dynamic performance in sports use. On the Turismo Veloce Lusso, the MVCSC 2.0 system, employing Sachs front forks and rear shock absorber, features a sophisticated electronic control system which, through continuous interventions to the hydraulic settings, provides the best possible response to all specific riding conditions. The ECU includes the inertial platform which supplies vital parameter readings which are key to the continuous suspension setting changes and employs the Skyhook algorithm. This algorithm has been was specially developed by MV Agusta. The system acts on the hydraulic compression and rebound readings when the bike is in motion.\n\nENGINE AND ELECTRONICS\nThe perfect blend of agility and performance. The Turismo Veloce is a perfect example of this: its three-cylinder 800cc engine is a new interpretation of the advanced engine on which MV Agusta has based the expansion of its model range. Its size would lead you to believe it’s a smaller engine thanks to the layout, and the three cylinders ensure excellent power output from low and medium revs then all the way up to the top of the rev range. This three-cylinder engine has many characteristics which make it a milestone for MV in terms of the technology applied to a standard production bike. The oil and water cooling systems have been integrated into the casting of the engine and this particular feature of the three-cylinder engine that gives it such an exceptional aesthetic impact and which allows it to blend in perfectly with the flowing lines of the Turismo Veloce. Under the cast and forged aluminium surfaces lies a counterrotating crankshaft derived directly from MotoGP. This was introduced as standard on the F3 675 and characterises the MV Agusta three-cylinder engine, not to mention the considerable impact it has on riding dynamics by significantly deceasing the effects of inertia when the bike changes direction. The precise application of fluid dynamic and thermodynamic principles, along with evolved electronic engine management systems have permitted specific fuel mapping settings to be designed to ideally suit both Tourismo and Sport riding modes on the new Turismo Veloce.\nThe reference platform is the new second generation MVICS 2.0 (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) which permits customizing the mapping with versatility being its strongest point. There are three preset mapping options. The Tourismo option offers fuel mapping specifically designed for touring and limits power output to 100 CV. The Sport setting increases power to the maximum output of 125 CV whereas the Rain option is for riding safely when there is little road grip and the Traction Control is automatically set to the maximum level. The fourth option, Custom, is also available whereby the rider individually selects various parameters to create the best possible set-up for the riders personal desires. Among the above mentioned customizing parameters are the engine torque curve in-line with power output (two levels), rev limiter cut in point (Hard or Soft), throttle sensitivity (three levels), engine braking (two levels), engine response (two levels) and, naturally, traction control (eight levels). The MVICS 2.0 system also includes the Anti Wheelie system offered for the first time on a Touring motorcycle. The evolved electronics system also features cruise control which lets the rider set and maintain a constant speed. The EAS 2.0 (Electronically Assisted Shift) system is also present for the first time with clutch-less down-shifting and lets the rider select a higher or lower gear without having to use the clutch. The Turismo Veloce and Turismo Veloce Lusso will only be available with ABS. Access to the many parameters by which the rider can personalize the motorcycle is via new controls on the handlebars with an improved intuitive system that lets the rider make adjustments on the move without being distracted. Access to the menu is via dedicated buttons that make implementing changes to the management system parameters even quicker. The instrument panel on the Turismo Veloce displays the most important information and was designed specifically for this model. The panel features a 5″ TFT colour display which provides access to the numerous electronically controlled parameters. On the Lusso there is also an evolved GPS system to enhance its Touring character. The GPS displays route information, fuel consumption and engine use. Thanks to the TFT panel being perfectly positioned, the rider never loses sight of the road and can travel in the safest way possible. Bluetooth communication as standard on the Turismo Veloce puts the rider, passenger and bike in constant communication and allows the experience to be shared with others using dedicated apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENGINE\nType Three cylinder, 4 stroke, 12 valve\nTiming system “D.O.H.C”\nTotal displacement 798 cc (48.7 cu. in.)\nCompression ratio 13.3:1\nStarting Electric\nBore x stroke 79 mm x 54.3 mm (3.1 in. x 2.1 in.)\nMax. power – r.p.m. (at the crankshaft)** 92 kW (125 hp) at 11.600 r.p.m.\nMax. torque – r.p.m. 84 Nm (8.6 kgm) at 8.600 r.p.m.\nCooling system    Cooling with separated liquid and oil radiators\nEngine management system\nIntegrated ignition – injection system\nMVICS 2.0 (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) with three injectors.\nEngine control unit Eldor EM2.0, throttle body full drive by wire Mikuni, pencil-coil\nwith ion-sensing technology, control of detonation and misfire Torque control\nwith four maps, Traction Control with eight levels of intervention\nElectronic quick shift MV EAS 2.0 (Electronically Assisted Shift)\nClutch\nWet, multi-disc\nTransmission\nCassette style; six speed, constant mesh\nPrimary drive 19/36\nGear ratio\nFirst gear: 13/37\nSecond gear:  16/34\nThird gear: 18/32\nFourth gear: 19/30\nFifth gear:        21/30\nSixth gear: 22/29\nFinal drive ratio 16/41\nELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT\nVoltage 12 V\nAlternator 450 W at 5000 r.p.m.\nBattery 12 V – 11 Ah\nDIMENSIONS AND WEIGHT\nWheelbase 1420 mm (55,80 in.)\nOverall length 2080 mm (81.84 in.)\nOverall width 900 mm (35,41 in.)\nSaddle height 870 mm (34.23 in.)\nMin. ground clearance 140 mm (5.51 in.)\nTrail 108 mm (4.25 in.)\nDry weight  207 kg (456.3 lbs.)\nFuel tank capacity 20 l (5.28 U.S. gal.)\nPERFORMANCE\nMaximum speed* 240 km/h (149.1 mph)\nFRAME\nType ALS Steel tubular trellis (MAG welded)\nRear swing arm pivot plates material Aluminium alloy\nFRONT SUSPENSION\nType Sachs “UPSIDE DOWN” semi-active\ntelescopic hydraulic fork MVCSC\n(MV Agusta Chassis Stability Control)\nFork dia. 43 mm (1.69 in.)\nFork travel 160 mm (6.30 in.)\nREAR SUSPENSION\nType      Progressive Sachs, semi-active single\nshock absorber with hydraulic spring\npreload adjustment MVCSC (MV Agusta\nChassis Stability Control)\nSingle sided swing arm material Aluminium alloy\nWheel travel 160 mm (6.30 in.)\nBRAKES\nFront brake Double floating disc with Ø 320 mm\n(Ø 12.6 in.) diameter, with steel braking\ndisc and flange\nFront brake caliper Brembo radial-type, with 4 pistons\nØ 32 mm (Ø 1.26 in.)\nRear brake Single steel disc with Ø 220 mm (Ø 8.66 in\nRear brake caliper Brembo with 2 pistons – Ø 34 mm (Ø 1.34\nABS System Bosch 9 Plus with RLM (Rear wheel Lift-up\nMitigation)\nWHEELS\nFront: Material/size Aluminium alloy 3.50” x 17”\nRear: Material/size Aluminium alloy 5.50” x 17”\nTYRES\nFront 120/70 – ZR 17 M/C (58 W)\nRear 190/55 – ZR 17 M/C (75 W)\nFAIRING\nMaterial Thermoplastic\nORIGINAL EQUIPMENT\nIncluded accessories Immobilizer – Heated Grips – Bluetooth\nIntegrated GPS\nText and images: http://www.mvagusta.it/en/turismo-veloce/turismo-veloce-lusso-800\nAdvertisements",

This K3 iTrack is designed in Seoul and made in Jinju, Korea. You can show your support of K-pop by using this tyre. In fact, I’m listening to Big Bang – Monster while writing this article. Hehe.\nPreviously, it is very hard to find tyres for our much loved Yamaha 135LC 5-speed which comes with an almost rare tyre size that is 100/70-17. Many had to revert to use the stock IRC tyre if it is available or use different size, maybe at 110/70 or even 130/70. But now, Shinko K3 iTrack comes with all that sizes that is 100/70-17, 110/70-17 and 130/70-17. The choice is now yours.\nWe have previously tried the previous generation of Shinko tyre that is the SR877 Evo, which we really liked. The performance on dry are great but at the same times gives a good grip under wet condition. It is made with a medium-soft compound which I think is easy to be worn, but actually it is quite durable, but not as durable as a very hard compound tyre.\nThis Shinko K3 iTrack is the upgrade of the SR877 Evo, so, we can expect better performance on it. How would we know unless we try it? No worries, we will receive the tyre for review next week. For men, getting a brand new good tyre really makes me happy inside.\nBTW, here is the price, not cheap though (RRP from QBEE Motor):\n100/70-17       MYR 192.31\n110/70-17       MYR 215.39\n130/70-17       MYR 238.46\nAdvertisements",

        "Bridgestone\nmotogp \n\nMotoGP Round 2 – Circuit of The Americas Results: Marquez makes it back-to-back victories, Dani Pedrosa on 2nd and Dovizioso first podium for Ducati since September 2012 \n\n\nPosted on April 14, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Marc Marquez capped off a perfect weekend at Circuit of The Americas by winning his second successive Americas Grand Prix ahead of teammate Dani Pedrosa. \n\nThe race started in dramatic fashion after Movistar Yamaha MotoGP rider Jorge Lorenzo jumped the start and as a result had to relinquish his race lead and enter the pits to serve a ride-through penalty. This gifted the race lead to Marquez who was able to consistently lap in the 2’03 time bracket to quickly build a gap over the rest of the field. At the chequered flag Marquez crossed the finish line 4.124 seconds of Pedrosa in second place, while Andrea Dovizioso finished in an impressive third place to score his first podium with Ducati.\n\nIntermittent rain fell earlier in the day but track conditions were dry for the race, although track temperatures were considerably lower than yesterday. The peak track temperature during the race was 33°C, ten degrees cooler than yesterday afternoon. The medium compound rear slick was the preferred race option, with sixteen of the twenty-three riders on the grid selecting this option, while six Open-class riders selected the soft compound rear slick. In similar fashion to the season-opener in Qatar, only race winner Marquez selected the hard compound rear slick. All riders selected the medium compound front slick for the race. The improved track conditions compared to last year resulted in quicker race pace this year, with Marquez setting a new Circuit Record Lap time of 2’03.575 on lap three, while the overall race time was nine seconds quicker than last year.\n\nMarquez’s two wins from two races sees him lead the championship standings over teammate Pedrosa by fourteen points, while Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi is a further eight points behind and third overall in the championship points table.  \n\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Division\n“Congratulations to Marc for another victory at Circuit of the Americas and to Repsol Honda for achieving another double podium at this venue. It was also pleasing to see Ducati return to the podium, so well done to Andrea and the team for their fantastic result today. I was sorry to see Cal crash and injure himself during the race and I want to wish him a full and speedy recovery. I hope that the exciting start to the season continues when we visit the Autódromo Termas de Río Hondo in a couple of weeks’ time, and I look forward to returning to the United States for the Indianapolis Grand Prix in August.”\n\nMasao Azuma – Chief Engineer, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Division\n“Conditions were much cooler today for the race but track conditions were good, which resulted in the race being run at a very quick pace. Only Marquez selected the harder rear slick for the race and it worked well for him, and all three rear slick options were utilised in the race. As expected the whole of the grid selected the medium compound option, yet during the race some riders experienced higher levels of front tyre abrasion than was seen during practice and qualifying. We will now analyse the tyres to work out what were the contributing factors that resulted in the high levels of wear that occurred during the race.”\n\nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“I’m really happy with this victory, it was a different kind of race for me as I’ve never led a MotoGP race from start to finish, so it was a bit strange and it was hard to keep my concentration. It was great to get the twenty-five points today, but I know the next races will be more challenging as this is one of my favourite circuits and today was one of my easier victories.”\n\nAmericas MotoGP™ Top Ten Race Classification \n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec\n\n\nRear spec\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nMarc MARQUEZ \n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n43’33.430 \n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nDani PEDROSA \n\n\nRepsol Honda Team \n\n\n43’37.554\n\n\n4.124\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO \n\n\nDucati Team \n\n\n43’54.406 \n\n\n20.976\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nStefan BRADL \n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP \n\n\n43’56.220 \n\n\n22.790\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nBradley SMITH \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n43’56.393 \n\n\n22.963\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO \n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3 \n\n\n43’59.997 \n\n\n26.567\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAndrea IANNONE \n\n\nPramac Racing \n\n\n44’01.687 \n\n\n28.257\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nValentino ROSSI \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n44’18.949 \n\n\n45.519\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO \n\n\nNGM Forward Racing \n\n\n44’21.035 \n\n\n47.605\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nJorge LORENZO \n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP \n\n\n44’22.541 \n\n\n49.111\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRossi Leads The Yamahas as Le Mans Begins at Position 3 \n\n\nPosted on May 18, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nValentino Rossi wrapped up the first day of action at the Monster Energy Grand Prix de France as the fastest Yamaha rider and third overall behind rival Dani Pedrosa. The Italian spent the day’s two free practice sessions working to set up his YZR-M1 for the Le Mans circuit, focusing on a soft front and hard rear tyre combination. Rossi opted for the 2012 M1 chassis for the Le Mans weekend whilst the team continues to evaluate the difference between the old and new. The final session saw the nine-time World Champion improve to climb from seventh to second, dropping to third at the end just 0.138 seconds from first. Rossi was also the fastest rider through the second sector of the Le Mans circuit.\nTeammate Jorge Lorenzo was as usual quick from the start of the first session, contesting with the fastest riders and wrapping up the morning in second place. The afternoon saw more of the same fast consistency from the reigning World Champion, taking the session lead with a 1’34.2 second lap with 17mins remaining. A flurry of fast laps in the final minutes dropped him to fourth however he was just 0.166 from first. Lorenzo remained fourth in the combined times. The Spaniard also focused on a hard front, soft rear tyre option but opted for the 2013 chassis to evaluate the Le Mans circuit.  \n \n\n\n\n\nValentino Rossi – 3rd, Time – 1’34.173\n“Today we were good in braking because we modified the settings and we tried two different settings to understand which way to follow to improve the braking, that was the main problem. This morning was not too bad and this afternoon especially I made the comparison one more time. I took the setting I preferred with some small modifications and the last run was very good. I could brake hard, which was the main problem in Austin and also in Jerez so it’s a good day. We try to modify also the rear for to not stress the rear tyre so much; that helped me a lot; I did my best laps with a used tyre that had more than 30 laps on. The practice this afternoon was good so I’m happy. We are already quite good with the setting of the bike so now we wait for the weather tomorrow. In case of rain we are more or less ready and if dry we can try something else, some small details to modify. We are very close to those in front so its not so bad.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJorge Lorenzo – 4th, Time -1’34.201\n“We are changing the bike to improve the feeling because at the moment we have a lot of margin for improvement. I think we can make a big step to improve the constant pace for the race. I think if it rains tomorrow things will change completely and it will be a different story. We will have to be as always more careful and have more concentration in the wet.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilco Zeelenberg – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Manager\n“The first day at Le Mans and a dry day too! Overall everything is very close and tight. After FP2 we are in fourth but just two tenths away and our lap times are very close to Dani. We are not satisfied as we have some small details to solve. We are not ready for race day yet but hopefully tomorrow we will have another dry session so we can make the next step.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMassimo Meregalli – Yamaha Factory Racing Team Director\n“A promising first day. I think the Monday test in Jerez gave us a good result because we were satisfied with it and also its effects here. The pace is good; the tyre life issue seems to be solved as well, maybe due to the temperature but also due to our testing in Jerez. Lets see what the weather brings tomorrow as it may be wet. Anyway I think we are ready for all circumstances.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive start for Crutchlow and Smith in France\nhe biggest race of the MotoGP World Championship campaign for the Monster Yamaha Tech 3 Team started in positive fashion for British duo Cal Crutchlow and Bradley Smith at the historic Le Mans track today. This weekend’s race is not only the all-important home encounter for the French-based Tech 3 squad, but the popular Le Mans event is sponsored once again by Monster Energy, the high profile American energy drinks company that is the title backer of Crutchlow and Smith’s MotoGP effort. In extremely cool conditions this morning, Crutchlow was sixth fastest in a closely fought FP1 that saw the top nine covered by less than a second. In higher temperatures this afternoon, Crutchlow remained in sixth position, despite improving his pace by well over 0.5s. A best lap of 1.34.512 was only 0.477s off the best time, the second session proving to be another close affair with the top nine split by just over 0.7s.\nSmith was 15th this morning, the British rider getting to grips with the world renowned Bugatti track while also working on the set-up of an updated YZR-M1 chassis which he tested with such positive results in Jerez recently. He was able to improve by almost 1.5s in FP2 and he rocketed up into 11th place on the rankings with a best time of 1.35.362 that gave the 22-year-old a huge confidence boost ahead of Sunday’s 28-lap race. Smith’s vast improvement was reflected in the gap to Jerez winner Dani Pedrosa, who led the way in FP1 and FP2. Smith was over two seconds behind Pedrosa this morning but he ended the second session just 1.327s off the quickest pace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCal Crutchlow, 6th, Time – 1’34.512\n“We did not have our best day today and I’m not really happy with how things started this weekend. We experimented quite a lot with the bike and made it shorter and longer but we did not find an ideal setting yet. We have a lot of chatter and not too much grip, so clearly we are struggling quite a bit at the moment because the other guys seem to improve while I feel the same as on the first lap out there this morning. So we still have a lot of work to do tonight and we have to improve in several areas. I’m having an issue with the brakes but we are still confident for tomorrow and I am sure we can improve to put on a good show in such a big race for Tech 3 and Monster Energy.”\n\n\n\n\nBradley Smith 11th, Time – 1’35.362\n“Today was a good first day in Le Mans. I started to feel a lot more confident this afternoon compared to this morning because there was extra grip on track thanks to the higher track temperature. We found almost 1.5s and that’s really positive. I like this circuit a lot, especially with a MotoGP bike and the differences compared to a smaller bike seem to be not that big compared to the other tracks I have experienced so far. I just have to understand the different braking points like in the first corner where I’ve already made three mistakes so far. But now I think I understood where the limit is. But it was a good day and we are closer than usual to the top after day one and I really feel confident with the new chassis, especially on new tyres, so we will work hard tonight and hopefully go straight into the second qualifying session tomorrow.”\nAdvertisements",

Made with MotoGP in mind, the NSF100 features some of the design cues taken from the racer RC211V. This kind of small is great for a newbie to learn the handling of the bike in the track before going for bigger capacity and more powerful bike. If you can’t handle the small capacity bike, probably you can’t handle bigger capacity bikes too. \n\nThe engine is small at only 100cc but it can produces 8.4PS which is higher than other production bikes with similar engine capacity. For example, the 2013 Honda EX5 Dream can produce 5.64kW or 7.67PS from the 110cc engine. So, this NSF100 engine is much more powerful with smaller engine capacity.\n\nThe design cues from the RC211V is very prominent here with the use of the underseat exhaust to make look more racing and this can also make the rider can lean the bike in much lower angle without hitting the exhaust piping from the manifold to the muffler.\n\nEven with the blank white FRP panel, the NSF100 front cover looks very nice. It got that RC211V flair. Imagine if this bike is coloured with the HRC three colour scheme. That would be awesome!\n\nThe tachometer is using the electric-type to read the engine revolution which has been used earlier in RS125R and 250R. The handle bar are also angled inwards for the race style handling.\nPrice for the bike is JPY410,000 or RM12,370 and only being sold to racing team that fits the HRC requirements.\nHonda NSF100 Technical Specifications:\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\n Model name\n NSF100\n\n\n Model\n HR01\n\n\n Length × Width × Height\n 1,556mm × 595mm × 911mm\n\n\n Wheelbase\n 1,074mm\n\n\n Minimum ground clearance\n 123mm\n\n\n Seat height\n 681mm\n\n\n Caster\n 23 ° 36 ‘degrees\n\n\n Dry weight\n 73.6kg\n\n\n Engine type\n Air-cooled, 4-cycle, single cylinder\n\n\n Total emission\n 99.2cc (cm3)\n\n\n Bore × Stroke\n 53mm × 45mm\n\n\n Maximum output\n 6.2kw / 9,500rpm, 8.4ps / 9,500rpm\n\n\n Maximum torque\n 7.4N · m / 7,000rpm, 0.75kgf · m / 7,000rpm\n\n\n Carburetor\n 22mm\n\n\n Starting method\n Push\n\n\n\n Ignition system\n CDI\n\n\n Transmission\n Five\n\n\n Brake\nFront: a single disk\n\n\nRear: single disc\n\n\n Tire size\n 100 / 90-1248J front\n\n\n\n 120 / 80-1254J after\n\n\n Suspension\nFront: telescopic\n\n\n Rear swing arm type\n\n\n\nvia: http://www.honda.co.jp/HRC/products/machine/nsf100/data/\nAdvertisements",

        "700cc\nYamaha \n\n2014 Yamaha MT-07 – Masters of Torque 689cc 2-cylinder engine – Rise Up Your Darkness \n\n\nPosted on November 16, 2013November 16, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nALL-NEW YAMAHA MT-07\nThe MT story continues for 2014 as Yamaha announce the launch of the all-new MT-07, an agile roadster with exciting torque levels that reinforces Yamaha’s expanding MT line-up. Its overall style, emotional engine character and engaging qualities fit perfectly into the ‘Dark Side of Japan’ MT family.\nFeaturing an all-new 689cc inline 2-cylinder engine producing strong torque, and equipped with a light and compact backbone-type tubular frame, the MT-07 is a sporty motorcycle that is clearly aimed at inspiring many riders throughout Europe by bringing fun, passion and excitement back to motorcycling at an affordable level.\nYamaha’s new MT-07 is one motorcycle that cannot be defined or classified by its specification figures alone. For the record, the figures for this new model that everybody wants to look at straightaway are 74.8PS, [email protected],500 RPM, and 179kg wet weight (Dry weight 164kg).  \nBut in reality, these figures only tell a very small part of the MT story, because the MT-07 has not been designed only to be the fastest, most powerful, quickest or most sophisticated. Simply put, this new motorcycle has been created to offer the mid-class category a new kind of riding excitement that is generated by the MT-07’s exciting torque output, and its chassis design’s ability to accentuate the passion that first attracted each one of us to motorcycling.\nThe MT-07 is designed to bring a new passion to the mid-class segment. With its high levels of excitement and easy handling nature, this is an incredible package offering exceptional value for money, making it an attractive proposition from many different points of view.\nThe new Yamaha MT-07 is aimed at anyone who is looking for an alternative approach to biking. Newer riders who are entering the two-wheeled world and are looking for a different kind of sports bike will discover that the MT-07 looks good, feels good and is easy to use and fun to ride.\nYamaha also believe that those more experienced bikers who are looking for fun will also find that the MT-07 is a machine that’s built to exceed their expectations.\nENGINE\nNew 689cc in-line 2 cylinder engine\nWhen designing the basic architecture of the new engine, our engineers’ aim was to build a responsive and exciting powerplant that would accentuate the emotions experienced by the rider in a variety of situations. This machine is all about highlighting and focusing the pure enjoyment that comes with everyday riding.\nSo rather than simply focusing on achieving maximum power and maximum torque figures, we set out to create an engine which would deliver strong emotion while being very easy and intuitive to ride.\nThe crucial ingredient that makes the new inline 2-cylinder MT-07 engine stand out is the fact that it has been developed using Yamaha “Crossplane philosophy”. This is an engineering concept that seeks to enhance power output characteristics, thus providing more predictable and instantaneous engine response, making this compact and lightweight sports bike more accessible and more enjoyable for a wider range of riders.\nPowerful and compact inline 2 cylinder with a wide usable powerband\nThe all-new 689cc liquid-cooled 4-stroke inline 2-cylinder DOHC engine features a 270-degree crank layout and includes an exceptionally compact single-axis balancer. The engine has been designed to deliver a power output of 55kw/75 PS, while being very compact and lightweight at the same time. So in terms of performance and specifications the engine positions itself at the top of its class.\nOn the other hand, with its focus on low and mid rpm torque, its offers a very wide range of usability from exciting sports riding through to casual cruising and efficient commuting.\n“Crossplane philosophy” for enhanced torque output characteristics\nThe MT-07’s new inline 2-cylinder engine has been designed to deliver class leading performance while also having a strong focus on delivering exceptional but easy to control torque output in the low and mid rpm range.\nThe target of ‘easy to control torque’ is mainly achieved by implementing the Yamaha “Crossplane Philosophy” layout. It is all about the best harmonization of the engine’s internal forces – the combustion torque (created by the igniting fuel) and the inertial torque (created by the rotating crank and the up and down movement of the pistons). Once these two torque forces are aligned well (called ‘clean torque’), the rider gets a more clear feedback on the power delivery and therefore can control the power output and the rear wheel traction in a more precise and intuitive way.\nFor inline 2-cylinder engines the most efficient layout to achieve ‘clean torque’ is to use a 270-degree crank with uneven firing intervals. While the 270-degree crank layout has proven its great rideability already in the TDM900 and the XT1200Z 2-cylinder engines, the MT-07 twin adds a lot of excitement by combining its easy to control power delivery with great riding dynamics – such as its class leading power output and low weight – and a great twin cylinder engine character including ‘good vibes’ and a unique deep sound.\nLightweight single-axis balancer\nYamaha’s design team have gone to great lengths towards minimizing the MT-07’s overall weight by significantly reducing the weight of every component. For example, the compact single-axis balancer is one of the lightest of its kind in the market. By reducing the distance between the crank and balancer axis, this new design helps to keep engine dimensions low. Together with the use of rubber engine mounts, the single-axis balancer reduces vibrations for a more enjoyable experience.\nOffset cylinder design for increased fuel efficiency\nAt the press launch of the MT-09 in September, many participants commented on the impressive fuel economy of this flagship MT model. Increasing overall engine efficiency is crucially important for environmental, economic and practical reasons, and Yamaha’s designers have been successful in achieving outstanding levels of fuel efficiency with the new MT-07.\nOne of the key factors in being able to attain good fuel economy is the reduction in frictional loss within the engine. Compared to a conventional design in which the con rod is slanted when combustion occurs, the offset cylinder design reduces frictional losses between the piston and cylinder, and transmits power more efficiently.\nHarmonized transmission and engine design\nStrong and impressive torque is a key feature on all MT models, and the MT-07 has been designed in such a way that riders can accelerate and decelerate with minimal gear changing, especially in the middle to high gears (4th to 6th). Eliminating the need for frequent gear changes makes for a more enjoyable, rewarding and relaxing ride, and it may come as something of a pleasant surprise for riders of mid-capacity inline 4-cylinder motorcycles.\nIn order to optimize the potential of the MT-07’s linear torque, features such as the 6-speed transmission’s gear ratios, as well as the fuel injection settings and the mass of the crank have been developed in harmony to create an exciting engine which is very easy to control.\nEfficient fuel injection system\nA new fuel injection system with a compact fuel pump design makes a significant contribution towards shaping the overall character and rideability of the MT-07. As well as delivering strong all-round performance, this highly efficient design also gives high fuel efficiency for reduced running costs.\nOther significant features that contribute towards increased fuel efficiency include lightweight forged pistons and lens shaped combustion chambers, as well as the offset cylinder design.\nLightweight and compact 2-into1 exhaust\nThe MT-07’s one-piece exhaust system takes its cue from the design seen on the MT-09, and features a stubby muffler fed by gracefully curving offset pipes that merge with the short upswept muffler beneath the engine. The sculpted pipes give a feeling of dynamism from every angle, and the compact muffler features a 3-way honeycomb catalyser. The system also features an oxygen feedback control that achieves environmental standards and exceeds EU3 requirements.\nThe compact exhaust system is true to the MT-series theme of mass centralization which enhances the light and neutral handling character.\nIdeal for A2 licence riders\nThe MT-07 is the perfect starting point for European riders with an A2 licence, and a 35kW version will be available at Yamaha dealers across Europe.\nEngine Technical Highlights\n\nAll-new liquid-cooled 689cc in-line 2-cylinder DOHC 4-stroke\nLightweight and compact engine\n74.8PS, [email protected],500 RPM\nExciting torque at low & mid rpm range\n270-degree crank\n“Crossplane philosophy” based on 270-degree crank\nAlso available in 35kW A2 licence version\nOutstanding fuel efficiency\nNewly designed 6-speed transmission\n4-valve design with forged pistons and direct plated cylinders\nOffset cylinder design for increased fuel efficiency\nDesigned to deliver optimum riding enjoyment\nCompact clutch design\nHighly efficient and compact fuel injection system\nLightweight single axis balancer\nLightweight and compact 2-into1 exhaust\n3-way catalyser with oxygen feedback control\n\nCHASSIS\nLight and slim backbone-type frame\nFor outstanding ride quality together with easy manoeuvrability and remarkable agility, the new MT-07 runs with a light and slim steel backbone-type chassis which utilizes the new engine as a stressed member.\nThe new frame is constructed using high tensile steel tubing, and in order to achieve a precise balance of rigidity, the tubing has different wall thicknesses and different tensile strengths in strategically located positions. The frame’s relatively simple design together with the use of thinner tubes also contributes towards the frame’s low weight.\nThis new lightweight tubular chassis perfectly complements the smooth and torque-rich character of the new engine, and gives light and agile handling together with confidence-inspiring controllability.\nOptimum dimensions for easy controllability and riding excitement\n‘Character’ is a key theme running throughout the new MT-07, and a great deal of development work has been put into achieving a chassis that delivers high levels of riding excitement.\nClose attention has been paid to a wide variety of chassis features including wheelbase, weight distribution, trail, and suspension characteristics, and as a result the MT-07 rider can expect a uniquely rewarding, involving and fulfilling riding experience that brings out the very essence of motorcycling. For example, at only 530mm long, the relatively short swinging arm on the MT-07 is responsible for giving the rider a very enjoyable feeling of the engine’s driving force and acceleration.\nAsymmetrical swinging arm with link-type Monocross rear suspension\nOne of the focal points of the new MT-07 is an asymmetrical swinging arm, whose stylish design emphasizes the uncompromising looks of this naked all-rounder, and underlines its class-leading specification.\nThe swinging arm operates a link-type Monocross suspension system which features a horizontally mounted adjustable, preload shock absorber that is mounted directly to the engine’s crankcase. As well as being a compact design, this layout contributes to achieving a desirable balance of rigidity in the frame.\n41mm front forks\nIn keeping with the easy-handling nature of the chassis, the MT-07 runs with telescopic front forks that deliver sporty suspension characteristics, and are designed to handle difficult road conditions such as cobbles and uneven surfaces.\nThe forks are equipped with 41mm tubes and give a total of 130mm wheel movement for comfortable suspension performance together with neutral and natural feeling steering. These forks have a relatively narrow pitch of 190mm, and this feature gives an optimum balance to the steering feeling.\n17-inch 10-spoke cast aluminium wheels/180 rear tyre\nThe high specification wheels underline the cutting edge design of the MT-07, and are the same as those used on the MT-09. The sophisticated and lightweight 10-spoke design is the most advanced in the mid-class, and as well as being the best looking in the category, these cast aluminium wheels reduce unsprung weight to give responsive front and rear suspension action.\nThe wide 180/55-ZR17 radial rear tyre is unique in the mid-class, and reinforces the machine’s strong and powerful image – while also delivering plenty of traction as well as class-leading agility. At the front end there is a 120/70-ZR17 that gives high levels of grip together with confident cornering performance.\nSculpted body design with multi-reflector headlight and LED tail light\nThis all-new 2-cylinder MT has a character all of its own that is sure to stand out in any crowd.\nThe sculpted body design gives this naked roadster a slim and athletic appearance, while the seat gives a compact riding position and yet offers the possibility of adopting a range of riding positions to suit different situations, from urban through to highway use. A significant feature on the new MT-07 is its low and slim seat, which as just 805 high gives good ground access.\nThe slimline fuel tank allows the rider to grip it with their knees, and a tank pad accentuates the compact and sporty looks of the bike. Lightweight tank-mounted scoops enhance the bike’s sporty image, and an aluminium side cover on the chassis adds to the MT-07’s overall image of strength and durability.\nThe multi-reflector headlight and LED tail light emphasize the ultra-modern design of this competitively priced machine, and add to its impressive specification.\nFloating front discs / front and rear wave discs\nThe new MT-07 is designed to continue with the policy of offering a high overall specification at the right price, and features such as the dual 282mm floating front discs and high end monocoque 4-piston front calipers clearly demonstrate that this new all-rounder offers vibrant design combined a class-leading specification. Wave type discs are used at both the front and rear, and this state-of-the-art braking system gives powerful and controllable stopping performance.\nHandlebar-mounted digital instruments\nMT-07 riders will be able to see clearly displayed information at a glance, thanks to the compact new digital instrument panel. In addition to the speedometer and tachometer, the full LED display includes a gear position indicator and fuel gauge. The instruments are mounted directly on top of the handlebars, and this location gives a clear and uncluttered view ahead for the rider.\nCharacteristic MT-family design features\nMT bikes are known for their unique look and special engine and riding character. With its own unique appearance, distinctive feel and strong character, this agile new kind of naked bike fits perfectly into the growing MT line up. In particular the mass-forward body and upright riding position accentuate its strong MT family image, as does the ‘Z-shape’ formed by the air inlet-type scoops and the short exhaust downpipes – confirming its strong MT heritage.\nChassis Technical Highlights\n\n179kg wet weight (164kg dry weight)\nSlim frame with 805mm seat height\nSlim and compact chassis dimensions for easy agility andmanoeuvrability\nCompact and upright riding style with freedom to adopt differentpositions\nClass-leading 180 wide rear tyre\nWave discs front and rear\nNewly designed backbone-type lightweight tubular frame\nChassis geometry, weight distribution and dimensions designed foroptimal riding excitement and controllability\nBest in class, high end asymmetrical swinging arm\nLink-type Monocross rear suspension with horizontal adjustableshock mounted directly to the crankcase\n41mm front forks with 130mm of stroke and narrow 190mm pitch\n17-inch radial tyres and best in class lightweight 10-spoke castaluminium wheels\nDual 282mm wave front discs with monocoque 4-pot opposedpiston calipers\nCharacteristic MT-series style Z-shape exhaust/air inlet-type scoops\nHandlebar-mounted digital instruments with full LED display\nSculpted body design with slim fuel tank for easy knee grip\nMulti-reflector headlight with LED tail light\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages from: http://www.yamaha-motor.eu/eu/products/motorcycles/mt/mt-07.aspx?view=explore\nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 14: Aragon MotoGP™ – Lorenzo excels in wet and dry conditions to take victory at Aragon \n\n\nPosted on September 29, 2014 by eddy \n\n\nIn an eventful flag-to-flag race at MotorLand Aragon, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Jorge Lorenzo showed superb pace in both wet and dry conditions to take his first victory of the 2014 MotoGP™ season.\nStarting from the third row of the grid, Lorenzo got an excellent start and was engaged in a three way battle for the race lead with the Repsol Honda’s of Marc Marquez and Dani Pedrosa. In the middle phase of the race, light rain started to fall which then intensified, changing the track conditions from dry to fully wet in a matter of a few laps. Lorenzo made the decision to pit earlier than his closest rivals and swap to his spare bike fitted with wet tyres. He then proceeded to lap at a strong pace in the wet conditions, just as both Marquez and Pedrosa came unstuck in the wet as they persevered on slicks. Lorenzo then streaked away to take victory by 10.295 seconds from NGM Forward Racing’s Aleix Espargaro who claimed his first ever MotoGP podium finish after a brilliant ride to second place. In third place was Ducati Team’s Cal Crutchlow, who despite a valiant battle with Espargaro for second place, ultimately crossed the finish line just 0.017 seconds behind the Spanish rider to claim the final podium position.  \nConditions at the start of the twenty-three lap Aragon Grand Prix were completely dry, with all riders initially selecting slick tyres. Although conditions were considerably cooler than yesterday – the peak track temperature was only 23°C – only seven of the twenty-three riders selected the soft compound front slick, with the remaining sixteen riders choosing the medium compound front. For the rear tyre, both Repsol Honda riders and LCR Honda’s Stefan Bradl opted for the hard compound rear slick, with the remaining Factory Ducati, Honda and Yamaha riders selecting the medium compound rear. For the Open-class riders, half the riders opted for the medium compound rear slick, the other half for the soft compound rear at the start of the race. Both the hard and soft compound wet tyres were used by riders in the final stages of the race after they changed bikes, with the hard compound wet tyre being used by two-thirds of the field, including the three riders on the podium.\n \nAlthough he finished in thirteenth place at Aragon, Marc Marquez extends his championship lead over teammate Pedrosa to seventy-five points with four rounds remaining, while Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi remains third in the championship standings and three points behind Pedrosa.\n \nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“Congratulations to Jorge and Yamaha on an impressive victory today, Jorge rode very well to manage the challenging conditions perfectly, and showed excellent pace in the wet and dry. Today’s race created every possible track condition for the riders, so it was important that our tyres provided good warm-up performance and predictability. Despite today’s cool temperatures, all three rear slick tyres, including the hard compound, were chosen by riders, as well as the soft and medium front slicks which proves the wide operating temperature our current generation of MotoGP tyres have. The general feedback from the riders this weekend was that our tyre allocation at Aragon was well-matched to the weather and track conditions, so this is a positive outcome for Bridgestone.”\n \nJorge Lorenzo, Movistar Yamaha MotoGP – Race Winner\n“Today I had one of the best starts in my career, and I was impressed with my pace and feeling in the bike in dry conditions. It was a pity that it started to rain as I felt I could fight for the victory in the dry, but then I saw that Marc and Dani stayed out on track on slicks, so I thought I’d take a risk and pit earlier than them for wet tyres. I then found myself in first position after my first lap on wet tyres, so I just had to keep focused so I wouldn’t crash. This was my first victory in a long time, so I’m very proud and very happy.”\n\nAragon MotoGP™ Top 10 Race Classification\n\n\n\n\nPos\n\n\nRider\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nRace Time\n\n\nGap\n\n\nFront spec*\n\n\nRear spec*\n\n\nTyres\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nJorge LORENZO\n\n\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n\n\n44’20.406\n\n\n\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nAleix ESPARGARO\n\n\nNGM Forward Racing\n\n\n44’30.701\n\n\n10.295\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nCal CRUTCHLOW\n\n\nDucati Team\n\n\n44’30.718\n\n\n10.312\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nStefan BRADL\n\n\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n\n\n44’32.124\n\n\n11.718\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nHard\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nBradley SMITH\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n44’49.889\n\n\n29.483\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nPol ESPARGARO\n\n\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n\n\n44’50.092\n\n\n29.686\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAlvaro BAUTISTA\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n44’50.169\n\n\n29.763\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nHiroshi AOYAMA\n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar\n\n\n44’58.247\n\n\n37.841\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nNicky HAYDEN\n\n\nDrive M7 Aspar\n\n\n45’03.363\n\n\n42.957\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nScott REDDING\n\n\nGO&FUN Honda Gresini\n\n\n45’14.343\n\n\n53.937\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nSoft\n\n\nBridgestone\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

Now, it features dual headlight which I can’t keep away from comparing it with the headlight of the ZX6R 636 and also the Ninja 250.\nVersys 650 comes with the 649cc parallel twin liquid-cooled engine that mated with 6-speed transmission. The front brakes got the dual disc setup with 300mm petal-style rotors with two-piston calipers and ABS.\n\nVersys 1000 is equipped with the more powerful 1,043cc liquid-cooled DOHC engine also mated to 6-speed transmission. The front suspension is from KYB with 43mm which is big upside down fork type. The braking also got more powerful as it is equipped with the bigger 310mm dual disc brake setup for the front and single 250mm disc brake at the rear.  \nOne more defining difference of these two bikes is the chassis. As you can see from the picture of the Versys 650 above, it is using Trellis frame almost like the ER6.

The lead pack was comprised of the bulk of the top performing Japanese riders – Ayumu Sasaki, Kazuki Masaki, Takuma Kunimine and Ai Ogura – plus Adam who started from fifth position in Row 2.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith just two laps to go, Adam and Sasaki were able to pull a manoeuvre on the final corner to overtake a few riders in the lead pack. From then on, it was a straight battle between the Malaysian and Japanese riders, with Adam even holding the race lead for a brief moment. However, Sasaki had the upper hand, and was able to clear the final corner with a big a enough gap to secure the race win – his first race win of the season in fact.\nAdam, on the other hand, settled for second place just 0.220 seconds behind Sasaki. Joining Sasaki and Adam on the podium was third place finisher Kazuki Masaki who crossed the line 0.265 behind race winner Sasaki. Yes, the finish was indeed close, with Adam becoming the best of the seven Malaysians lining up the grid.\nAs for the rest, things did not fare out too well, but results are indeed promising. Fakhrusy Rostam, who started from fourth, crossed the line in seventh whilst Shafiq Rasol, who had high promise after qualifying third, dropped down the order and finished in tenth. Despite his injury, Helmi Azman managed to finish the race in 13th place just ahead of Azroy Anuar in 14th.\nMalaysian wildcards Ahmad Idham Khairuddin and Luth Harith Erwan also brought out respectable performances. Both riders finished the race in 19th and 20th respectively.\n“I am extremely happy with my performance today. I know the chance to win was there, and I will try my best tomorrow for Race 2,”said 17-year-old Adam when we spoke to him after the race. This comes as sweet vindication for him since his last appearance in Sepang for the Asia Talent Cup’s season finale last year where he was penalised.\nWith Race 1 completed, Sasaki leads the championship standings still with 101 points in total, and he looks poised to claim the title this year. Adam, on the other hand, has elevated in the standings from 12th up to up to eighth thanks to today’s podium finish.\nRace 2 will commence tomorrow at 12:00pm (noon) before the day’s scheduled WSBK and WSSP races.

Originally broadcast on ITV4 in the UK and to be shown on Fox Australia, the documentary follows a team of legendary motorcycle racers as they tackle some of the world’s toughest races, including the Isle of Man TT. The first episode will be available on the HondaProRacing YouTube channel from 15th January 2014. A teaser is available now.\nGaucho Productions was granted exclusive access to the Honda TT Legends team throughout an epic season.  From Japan to Germany and from Le Mans to the Isle of Man, the documentary follows these ordinary men doing extraordinary things.\nJohn McGuinness, nicknamed the ‘The Morecambe Missile’, is an ex-bricklayer and mussel picker from the north of England who has won the legendary Isle of Man TT twenty times.  He is joined in the TT Legends team by Cameron Donald and Simon Andrews. Donald is Australia’s fastest plumber and a two-time winner of the Isle of man TT. Andrews is a fearless young gun who was the fastest newcomer at the TT in 2011. Together they are the TT Legends.\nThe documentary goes ‘behind the screens’ as the team competes in the World Endurance Championship. The season kicks off with the famous Bol d’Or, a twenty-four hour race at the Magny Cours circuit in France. Then they’re off to Doha, Germany and even Japan for the famous Suzuka 8-Hour before they return to France for the Le Mans 24-hour. Each race brings its own, distinct challenge for the team. In Suzuka, for example, we’ll join McGuinness in an ice bath, a welcome antidote to the searing heat.\nThese circuit races are accompanied by legendary road races in Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. McGuinness is the man to beat on the roads with Donald and Andrews among his toughest rivals. Gaucho Productions were there to witness the contrast, as these friends and teammates now push each other to the limit and beyond.  \n\n\nAway from the races, the series will show the team as they relax away from the pressures of racing, learning what makes them tick and why these men are willing to risk everything to race on bumpy public roads at over 200mph. And you’ll meet the families and friends who must cope with the stress of watching them race. Over eight, half-hour episodes, witness all the tears, tantrums and triumphs as this fascinating team enjoys an epic season.\nSpeaking about the series, Gaucho Production’s Executive Producer, Alistair Weaver, said: “We had a terrific response to the TT Legends series when it debuted on ITV4, where it attracted an exceptionally broad audience. It’s an extraordinary tale of human will and endeavour played out at 200mph and we’re delighted to be bringing it to a YouTube audience for the first time.”\nRobert Watherston, Head of Motorsport, Honda Motor Europe said: “Gaucho’s crew were given unprecedented access to the Honda TT Legends team and the result is an intimate and fascinating portrait of just what it takes to compete in these incredibly challenging racing disciplines. We’re thrilled to be able to offer the series to a global audience via the HondaProRacing YouTube channel.”\nThe eight episodes will be uploaded weekly onto the HondaProRacing YouTube channel from 15th January.  A teaser for the series is available now.\n\nAdvertisements",

Elevation changes, the longest straight in MotoGP™, and a combination of slow and fast corners makes the circuit a real challenge for the riders and tyres. The fast, sweeping corners require high levels of edge grip, while drive grip from the centre section of the tyre is also important as there are many hard acceleration zones at this track. The riders approach a top speed of almost 350 km/h down the 1200 metre-long back straight, so excellent front tyre stability is required for the hard braking zone into turn twelve.\n\nOverall, the layout of the Circuit of The Americas places similar loads on both shoulders of the rear tyres, yet the presence of high speed right-hand corners at turns sixteen to eighteen and turn six, means the temperature of the right shoulder of the rear tyre reaches a higher level than the left side, even though there are more left-hand turns. Consequently, asymmetric rear slicks with slightly harder rubber on the right shoulders are offered for this circuit. \n\nOpen class and Ducati riders will be offered the soft and medium compound asymmetric rear slicks, while the Factory Honda and Yamaha riders can utilise the medium and hard compound rear. With front-end feel important through the faster sections of the track, the front slick options for this circuit – the soft and medium compounds – are selected for the best combination of grip and stability.  \n\n\nHiroshi Yamada – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Department\n“Last year’s inaugural MotoGP round at Circuit of The Americas was a resounding success, both on and off the track so I am very happy to be returning to Austin. North America is one of our most important markets so being able to support MotoGP as Official Tyre Supplier at such a fantastic venue is of great value to Bridgestone. The season opener at Qatar was incredibly close in terms of the competitiveness amongst the riders, and I hope that this weekend’s action proves to be just as thrilling for the fans. This circuit has a real mix of corners and presents some good overtaking opportunities and now that all the teams have last year’s data to build upon, I expect to see the riders pushing hard from the first practice session.”\n\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Division\n“This year will be our second visit to Austin’s Circuit of the Americas and the impressive layout of this track presents quite a challenge for tyre development. COTA is run in a counter-clockwise direction and the track is technical with a mix of tight, slower corners and faster, more open sections. These features combine to place a great importance on front-end feel, as maintaining good corner speed is important here. Therefore our front tyres need to provide good grip characteristics with plenty of stability. The rear tyres must also provide good drive out of the slower corners. The fast right-hand corners are quite severe on tyres, so at this circuit we provide asymmetric rear slicks with slightly harder rubber on the right shoulder.”\nAdvertisements",

        "Bridgestone\nmotogp \n\nMarquez masters tricky conditions to lead Argentina practice \n\n\nPosted on April 26, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nRepsol Honda’s Marc Marquez got to grips with the challenging track surface at Autódromo Termas de Río Hondo, posting a lap time of 1’39.313 to finish quickest in Friday practice at the Argentina Grand Prix.\nMarquez’s quickest lap was set using the medium compound front and hard compound rear slicks, the same combination his teammate Dani Pedrosa used to achieve the second-quickest time of 1’40.396. Third quickest today was NGM Forward Racing’s Aleix Espargaro, who set a personal best time of 1’40.566.\nTrack conditions were poor on the first day of the race weekend, with heavy deposits of sand and a lack of rubber on the asphalt combining to reduce grip levels and increasing tyre wear. The dirty track and low track temperatures in FP1 resulted in very high abrasion levels for the rear tyre, but conditions marginally improved for FP2 which helped return grip and tyre wear to a more reasonable level. Today’s peak track temperature of 34°C was recorded at the end of FP2.  With grip hard to come by on the dusty track surface, the soft compound front slick was the preferred option in FP1, while the medium compound front slick was more popular in the warmer FP2 session. All three rear slick compound options were evaluated by riders today, with all specifications providing good performance around the fast Termas de Río Hondo track. With conditions set to improve again tomorrow, riders will use Saturday to determine their preferred tyre choice.\nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorsport Tyre Development Department\n“Conditions were as we expected today, with the sandy track surface causing high rear tyre wear and low grip levels. This problem was compounded by low track temperatures in the morning which resulted in some tyre graining, but we knew that conditions here would get better session-by-session. For FP2 the track showed signs of improvement and this resulted in better tyre wear and greater grip which helped the riders significantly improve their lap times. All rear slick options were used today, as well as the soft and medium compound front slicks, and our allocation for this weekend seems to be well suited to what is quite a challenging track for tyres.”\nArgentina MotoGP: Top ten combined Free Practice 1 & 2 times\n\n\n\nPos\nRider\nTeam\nCombined FP1&2 Time\nGap\n\n\n1\nMarc MARQUEZ\nRepsol Honda Team\n1’39.313 (FP2)\n \n\n\n2\nDani PEDROSA\nRepsol Honda Team\n1’40.396 (FP2)\n1.083\n\n\n3\nAleix ESPARGARO\nNGM Forward Racing\n1’40.566 (FP2)\n1.253\n\n\n4\nStefan BRADL\nLCR Honda MotoGP\n1’40.891 (FP2)\n1.578\n\n\n5\nAndrea DOVIZIOSO\nDucati Team\n1’41.042 (FP2)\n1.729\n\n\n6\nBradley SMITH\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n1’41.303 (FP2)\n1.990\n\n\n7\nPol ESPARGARO\nMonster Yamaha Tech 3\n1’41.368 (FP2)\n2.055\n\n\n8\nValentino ROSSI\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n1’41.395 (FP2)\n2.082\n\n\n9\nJorge LORENZO\nMovistar Yamaha MotoGP\n1’41.533 (FP2)\n2.220\n\n\n10\nAndrea IANNONE\nPramac Racing\n1’41.924 (FP2)\n2.611\n\n\n\n \nAdvertisements",

This time it is about riding in the rain.\nI picked up my Lagenda 115ZR after test riding the Axelo for Kapcai magazine. At that time, there is a little drizzle and I was thinking whether to take my bike on the road or not. Then, I think, this is a good time to test the Shinko SR877 on wet condition. So, I did. I ride it in the rain.  \nMy first priority is about safety, so, I didn’t test the grip in full speed in the public road. I managed to get 80km/h with this tyre on heavy rain. Mind you that the rain has no more little drizzle but heavy down pour. I have prepared myself with rainsuit and that helps much to overcome the cold of the night. At first, I tried to ride it slowly, and after a while I gain confidence with and able to achieve the speed of 80km/h. I think you can go more than that, but in heavy rain like, I think it is not worth the risk. The tyre provide enough feedback and gives me confidence of the bike handling at that speed. I usually didn’t ride in the rain, I just stopped at the bus stop or any place that I can have shelter on and wait for the rain to stop, so I have few experience with wet condition. Anyway, wet condition riding with Shinko SR877 is a nice experience. I was asking myself, what makes SR877 a good tyre? I found an answer that fits me, that is, its technology comes from Yokohama in Japan that has been transferred to Korea. Yokohama is a well known tyre for car and I know their tyre price is not cheap. Other than that, I got to know that Shinko also has made OEM go-kart tyre for Yokohama. That’s a good news.\nAdvertisements",

        "250cc\n250SL\nKawasaki\nZ250SL \n\n2014 Kawasaki Z250SL launched in Malaysia – RM15,739 (basic price) \n\n\nPosted on July 21, 2014July 22, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n \n2014 Kawasaki Z250SL just launched today at eCity Hotel, Subang Jaya. The most important details that you all should know that the price is RM15,739 (basic price). That is lower than what we expect at RM16,700. Kawasaki Motors Malaysia really listens to you guys. So, get the bike before Hari Raya.\nMore news will be coming up soon and will update you guys about. UPDATED! Read below:\n\nZ250SL comes with the same chassis as the Ninja 250SL which is the beautiful Trellis-like frame (in the tech specs it is called diamond type, but I’ll call it Trellis anyway). Compared to the supersports Ninja 250SL, the frame are now much more visible to the eyes as the bike is naked type that shows the muscle and the chassis under it. At 148 kg (Non-ABS model), the Z250SL is almost 20 kg lighter than the Z250. The light weight is a significant factor in the bike’s nimble handling.  Compared to the Ninja 250SL, this Z250SL is even lighter with 3kg difference.  \n\nThe exposure of the Trellis frame gives it a little bit of Italian kind of feel since this kind of frame is favourite for Italian manufacturers especially Ducati. The frame are exposed nicely with the metal grey colour that separates it from the black engine casing.\n\nThe 4-stroke engine as we already know from the Ninja 250SL introduction, comes from KLX250. The engine provides 28hp maximum power at 9,700RPM with 22.6Nm from 8,200RPM.\n\nCompared to the 2-cylinder Ninja 250, this Z250SL engine is only 4hp less than the 32hp engine of the Ninja. Z250SL got the usual DOHC 4-valve liquid-cooled engine for that performance needs.\n\nRear suspension are handled with the monoshock Uni-Trak suspension for better handling of the bike in slow or fast riding condition. Similar technology are also used by Honda with the name Pro-Link.\n\nAll-digital instrument panel gives the cockpit a modern, sporty look. Its easy-to-read features include a digital bar-graph tachometer, digital speedometer, odometer, dual trip meters, clock, and fuel gauge. Amber backlighting contributes to the Z image and facilitates instrument visibility at night.\n\nThe handlebar are flat and wide for that nimble handling. You can flick it easily in traffic to change direction. The handlebar are also easy to manage for everyday riding if compared to the supersports 250SL.\n\nLike other models in the Z Series, the Z250SL’s aggressive styling hints at its sporty potential. Following a “slim and sexy” design theme, the contrast between its flared and waisted sections gives the bike a dynamic, hourglass figure. Its parts were all designed to be as compact as possible, and are mounted as closely as possible to the frame to further reinforce the bike’s slim design as well as adding to high quality looks.\n\nFront and rear disc brakes offer impressive stopping performance. Petal disc design adds to the sporty Kawasaki looks.\n\nKawasaki Z250SL is one fierce contender in naked 250cc category as it got that slim body and chassis, good looks, great 1-cylinder engine from KLX250 and lower price than the Z250, Ninja 250 and even the Ninja 250SL.\nIn Malaysia, we only get the Black/Red and Red/Grey colour. The green colour is to show about the features of the Z250SL.\n2014 Kawasaki Z250SL price is RM15,739 (basic price). We think this is a good price coming from Kawasaki. If we look at the competitors; 2014 Honda CBR250R is priced at RM19,999, 2013 KTM Duke 200 at RM15,888 or even the Ninja 250SL itself at RM17,689; we can see that this Z250SL really killing its competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  2014 Kawasaki Z250SL Tech Specs\n\n\nEngine type:      Liquid-cooled, 4-stroke 1 Cylinder DOHC\n\n\nDisplacement :    249 cm³\n\n\nBore x stroke :    72.0 x 61.2 mm\n\n\nCompression ratio:     11.3:1\n\n\nValve/Induction system:    DOHC, 4 valves\n\n\nFuel system     Fuel injection: ø38 mm x 1\n\n\nIgnition :  Keihin, Transistorized Ignition\n\n\nElectric: Starting\n\n\nLubrication : Forced lubrication, wet sump\n\n\nMaximum power 20.6 kW / 9,700 rpm\n\n\nMaximum torque 22,6 N·m { kgf·m} / 8,200 rpm\nSS 400m : 15,5 s\n\n\nSS 200m : 9,7 s\n\n\nMax Speed : 153 km/h\n\n\nTransmission 6-speed, return\n\n\nFinal Drive Sealed chain\n\n\nPrimary reduction ratio 2.800 (84/30)\n\n\nGear ratios: 1st 3.000 (393/11)\n\n\nGear ratios: 2nd 1.933 (29/159)\n\n\nGear ratios: 3rd 1.444 (31/22)\n\n\nGear ratios: 4th 1.217 (28/23)\n\n\nGear ratios: 5th 1.045 (23/22)\n\n\nGear ratios: 6th 0.923 (24/26)\n\n\nFinal reduction ratio 3.000 (42/14)\n\n\nClutch : Wet multi-disc, manual\n\n\nFrame type Tube diamond\n\n\nRake/Trail 24° / 90 mm\n\n\nWheel travel, front 110 mm\n\n\nWheel travel, rear 116 mm\n\n\nTyre, front 100/80-17 M/C (52S)\n\n\nTyre, rear 130/70-17 M/C (62S)\n\n\nSteering angle, left / right 36° / 36°\n\n\nSuspension, front  telescopic fork\n\n\nSuspension, rear Bottom-Link Uni-Trak swing arm\n\n\nBrakes, front Single 263 mm petal disc.

        "800cc\nmv agusta \n\n2014 MV Agusta Rivale 800 – RM94,500 \n\n\nPosted on December 10, 2013December 12, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nMV Agusta widens their bikes lineup with this Rivale 800 which will come soon to Malaysia with the price tag of RM94,500 basic price (that means without roadtax and insurance). This bike is presented as the most versatile roadster that offers ergonomics that specifically developed to ensure comfort and full control under every conditions.\nIt is powered by 798cc inline three-cylinder engine that provides 125bhp at 12,000RPM which is a little bit lower than the three-cylinder engine that is fitted to the F3 800 supersports machine at 148bhp. Torque is 84Nm at 8,600RPM. The size for the cylinder is oversquare that measures 79.0 mm bore with 54.3 mm stroke that ensures that this engine revs high.  \n\nIt also comes with the usual Full Ride by Wire technology to enable the bike to have multiple control which can set by the rider to intervene it on a wide range of customisation and safety parameters. The revs is limited to 13,000RPM. The ride control here is named MVICS that refers to Motor & Vehicle Intergrated Control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about the Rivale 800 with the words officially from MV Agusta below:\nRIVALE 800 redefines the concept of two-wheel exclusivity, which is part of the design, enclosed in the technology that went into engine and electronics that, combined, make this motorcycle an emotionally rewarding experience.\nThe revolutionary in-line three-cylinder engine is the heart of this model, one that becomes the most versatile roadster, member of an ever wider MV AGUSTA range thanks to its ergonomics that have been specifically developed to ensure comfort and full control under every condition.\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\n• Engine in-line three-cylinder, 798 cc\n• Bore 79.0 mm, stroke 54.3 mm\n• Maximum power: 125 bhp (92 kW) at 12,000 rpm\n• Maximum torque: 84 Nm at 8,600 rpm\n• Rev limiter at 13,000 rpm\n• Dry weight: 178 kg\n• Power to weight ratio: 1.42 kg/hp\n• Tyres: Pirelli Diablo Rosso II 120/70 – ZR 17 (front) and 180/55 – ZR 17 (rear)\nTHE ENGINE\nThe in-line three-cylinder engine, designed and manufactured entirely by MV Agusta, is becoming an authentic classic due to its excellent performance and efficiency. Other three-cylinder engine solutions are currently being introduced on the market: none of them however can boast the extraordinary compactness that characterizes this engine and has been achieved by implementing technical solutions without compromise. The closed-deck engine block has been manufactured by chill-casting and has integral liners; the liquid cooling and lubrification circuits are integrated into the engine block casting in order to significantly reduce the overall engine size while at the same time offering a superior appearance and design, qualities found in every MV Agusta. The technological excellence of this engine is recognizable by its weight (only 52 kg) and its counter-rotating crankshaft, a racing solution, widely used in MotoGP: introduced for the first time by MV Agusta on a production series model, reducing inertia when changing direction and enhancing handling. Double overhead camshaft valve train layout with four valves per cylinder; intake and exhaust have been designed specifically for Rivale on the basis of the model’s performance. The six-speed gearbox is extractable, another example of the engineering excellence of this model, and is fitted with an Electronically Assisted Shift (EAS) system, i.e. the electronic gearbox, providing quick gear shifts; the bike is equipped with a multi-disc wet clutch and an effortless clutch control. Power and torque figures have been specifically defined to enhance Rivale’s dynamics, thus creating a motorbike that is a purely thrilling experience. The exceptional versatility of this in-line three cylinder engine – capable of producing 148 BHP on the supersports MV Agusta F3 800 – ensures consistent and exhilarating performance 125 BHP @ 12,000 rpm, a maximum torque of 84 Nm @ 8,600 rpm, Rivale ensures consistent performance at all revs, as well as a lightning response to the Full Ride By Wire throttle.\nELECTRONICS\nThe MVICS (Motor & Vehicle Integrated Control System) platform was designed to become a landmark in the development of MV Agusta’s three-cylinder project. By means of consistent integrated management, all electronic control parameters of the motorbike can be managed and coordinated both effortlessly and efficiently, thus enhancing performance and optimizing thermodynamic efficiency under all conditions. The Full Ride By Wire throttle and the comprehensive control panel represent the interface between the rider and the MVICS platform, handlebar controls allow the rider to readily intervene on a wide range of customization and safety parameters. Customization and safety are the operational objectives of the MVICS platform that allows the rider to choose from four engine maps: the first three are pre-defined performance levels: sports, normal road usage and wet or slippery road conditions; the fourth allows each parameter to be customized by the rider, ensuring perfect performance both for his preferences and the specific conditions. Many parameters such as: engine response, rev limiter, engine torque response, throttle and engine brake sensitivity can be customized via the MVICS platform, that also includes 8 levels of advanced traction control that have been carefully defined to ensure the best results in terms of delivering power to the road, even when road conditions are critical.\nDYNAMICS\nALS tubing and aluminium alloy plates: this is the chosen solution for this frame, another fundamental characteristic of the three-cylinder project. In particular, the front section has been manufactured with steel tubes ensuring a sufficiently flexible design that has led to the production of Rivale’s dynamics. Aluminium alloy plates complete the frame’s rear structure that is subject to heavy torsional loads due to the long swingarm. The swingarm is one of the project’s strategic choices: it is very long if compared with the motorbike’s extremely compact wheelbase (only 1,410 mm) and provides the necessary traction and maximum yield under every condition. Specific characteristics of Rivale, have led to the development of an “ad hoc” chassis: rake has been increased by 0.5° compared with the F3 675 and 800 and by 0.5° compared with Brutale 675 and 800. The increase in suspension travel is another key characteristic of this model: the inverted forks ensure 150 mm travel, thus allowing weight distribution to be redefined. In order to achieve greater dynamic performance, kinematics of the rear suspension have been adjusted so that the wheel now has 130 mm travel. The riding position leads to efficient dynamics without compromising comfort i.e. the handlebars are up close to the rider, an ideal configuration ensuring full control of the bike and transferring the load to the front, thus enhancing precision and cornering. The braking system consists of a set of twin 320mm Brembo floating discs with four 32mm piston callipers; on the rear the bike is equipped with a 220mm steel disc and a double 34mm piston calliper.\nRIDER INTERFACE\nThe new dashboard has been designed and produced for Rivale: it is entirely digital, and offers an ample reading surface, in which instant speed and rev indicators are located. The versatility of the instrument cluster allows the rider to choose the information to be displayed, however the engine response map and currently selected gear are always clearly visible as well as the traction control level and coolant temperature. Readability is ensured under every illumination condition thanks to the technology used for the display. Handlebar controls have been designed according to principles of rationality and ergonomics, every button and switch is easily reachable and the brake levers are well-shaped and their distance from the handlebar can be adjusted. Foot controls are made from aluminium alloys, are lightweight and robust, and have been designed specifically for Rivale. Footrests have been fitted with a rubber top to reduce vibrations while ensuring a good grip with motorcycle boots or casual footwear. The gearbox reverse lever is protected with an elegant aluminium shield.\nvia: http://www.mvagusta.it/en/rivale/rivale-800\nAdvertisements",

It is equipped with 125cc engine. As the name suggest, the great and most welcomed feature of this bike is the big underseat box (or U-box) that is big enough to fit in full-face helmet.   \nMostly everything about this bike is big including the use of big fuel tank at 5.6L. That is big guys. Before this, only Modenas CT110 has big capacity fuel that is at 5.5L for a bike below 125cc 4-stroke. Now, the crown goes go this Honda Future Helmet-In. Having big fuel tank is a big advantage since you can ride longer and further with fewer fuel stops. Honda claims that this bike can go up to 338km with single full tank of petrol. That is almost a 3 quarter of a journey to Kelantan from Shah Alam. Honda also a good to include a wider seat so that long distance ride will be much more comfortable.\n\nOne more surprise from Honda is the use of the front and rear brake disc system. Usually, Honda likes to use the rear drum brake to reduce the weight and of course, to reduce the price of their bike. This rear brake disc system is also a welcomed addition to the bike. Thank you Honda for finally listening to us.\nPrice? Will be updated…\nUPDATE: The price rear disc brake/ electric starter/ cast alloy wheel model is RM5,743.40 (NOT OTR).\nvia: Boon Siew Honda\nAdvertisements",

The ride took place on Saturday and was organised especially by the Austrian brand’s Kedah-based local assembly arm together with the KTM CKD Owners Club.\nUp to 120 bikes took part in the mass convoy ride, comprised mostly of the Austrian brand’s two most popular CKD models – the Duke nakeds and RC supersport series. The firm had previously hosted plenty of group rides over the last few years, with this latest one to Port Dickson being its third for this year. Also present in this ride were the KTM Dukers club and its various chapters hailing from all parts of peninsula.  \nKTM Malaysia CKD’s customer care unit representative and KTM CKD Owners Club head, Nurul Fazura Binti Ahmad\nAfter speaking with KTM Malaysia CKD’s customer care unit representative and KTM CKD Owners Club head, Nurul Fazura Binti Ahmad, she stated that these special activities were organised as part of its lifestyle experience offer for its customers. Notably, this recent group ride to Port Dickson was also the first time the firm’s saw high number of its new RC200 and RC390 models and their owners participating, signalling the entry-level supersport’s popularity in numbers as their Duke 200 and Duke 390 counterparts.\nFirst stop at Cycle Advance Sdn Bhd, Kajang\nThe ride on Saturday began with a flag-off in the ride starting point, which happens to be the newly opened KTM Malaysia CKD Kota Damansara Lifestyle Showroom. Part of the ride included stops and visits to some of the brand’s authorised dealers. These included stops in Kajang (Cycle Advance Sdn Bhd), Port Dickson itself (P.D. Ban Hin Motor Sdn Bhd), as well as Nilai (Sendayan Motor Sdn Bhd).\nSecond dealer stop P.D. Ban Hin Motor Sdn Bhd, PD\n \nKTM Malaysia CKD also took the initiative to ensure everyone’s safety during this ride. In fact, the firm deployed a high number of its staff, tasking them as group marshals, whilst several others were assigned into a support truck that provided participants with the necessary assistance along the way. What is really noteworthy here is their prompt and efficient management of the group safely through traffic and highways without an official Police escort, constantly reminding participants to be as safe as possible as well.\nEven the owners and club members themselves deserved some credit with their display of safe and disciplined riding through the searing heat and heavy downpour. Despite their high numbers, we are glad to report that this ride was free of incidents and foul ups – a feat that should be taken as example by other groups and convoys.\nLast stop at Sendayan Motor Sdn Bhd, Nilai\nThough the ride concluded on Sautrday evening, KTM Malaysia CKD’s Fazura also shared a few more group rides are being planned by the for the coming months.

This is powerful due the engine that is 2-stroker. It is liquid-cooled with 59.0mm x 54.0mm bore and stroke setup, that make that this engine is oversquare so that it can revs higher. The carburetor is 30mm from Mikuni 30SS for the engine to burn the fuel with 6.0:1 compression ratio. Enough to propel this bike up to 208km/h.\nYamaha TZR 250 SPR\nAlso equipped is the controversial YPVS mechanical electric valve control that can makes this engine delivers power more linear so that it is easier to control the bike’s output. Controversial because this valve needs to be change frequently and adds up to its maintenance cost.  \nComes with front and rear disc brake for that optimum braking. Monoshock rear swing arm adds the stability to take corners with confidence.\nReminds me the good old days of powerful bikes roaming in Malaysia with that superb design and livery to melts your heart as a rider.\nvia: http://dwinugros.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/yamaha-tzm-150-motor-eksotis-yang-hingga-kini-belum-tergantikan-oleh-produk-ymki-lainnya/\nhttp://bikesevolution.com/yamaha/yamaha-tzr-250%2C-1989/photos.html#gp\nAdvertisements",

        "1300cc\nXVS1300\nYamaha \n\n2014 Yamaha XVS1300 – cruiser chopper style \n\n\nPosted on November 26, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nRadically styled 1304cc V-twin\nThe handsome new Yamaha XVS1300 Custom is a new breed of cruiser that combines a classic raked-out ‘chopper’ style chassis with a gutsy liquid-cooled V-twin engine to create something very special. Attention to detail on the XVS1300 Custom is outstanding, with features such as the steel fenders, 21-inch front wheel and cooling fins accentuating its timeless good looks and reinforcing its authentic appeal.\nENGINE\nHigh-torque V-twin engine\nAt the heart of this beautifully crafted new cruiser there’s a 1304cc liquid-cooled 60-degree SOHC V-twin engine that blends classic cruiser looks with modern technology. Big V-twins are all about torque, and the XVS1300 Custom excels in this area. With 4 valves per cylinder combined with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and performance-oriented camshaft designs, this 1304cc engine pushes out a pulsating wave of torque for thrilling acceleration and easy cruising.\nPerformance design and technology\nThe XVS1300 Custom’s V-twin engine may be a classic looking design, but behind the black and silver exterior this high-torque engine is packed with high-tech design features that optimize its performance and strength. The massive 100mm diameter pistons run in ceramic composite cylinder sleeves, and the rocker arms are equipped with roller bearings for reduced frictional losses.\nFor that charismatic V-twin sound and feel the XVS1300 Custom runs with a single crankpin, while forged con rods ensure high levels of durability. Rider comfort is assured thanks to the fitment of dual counterbalancers, and for stable and efficient engine running performance over a wide range of temperatures and altitudes, the 1304cc engine is fed by a sophisticated fuel injection system.  \nLiquid-cooled efficiency with air-cooled looks\nWith its large ‘air-cooling design’ fins, unobtrusive radiator and lack of visible external coolant pipes, this mighty liquid-cooled V-twin engine possesses the classic good looks of a traditional air-cooled design. This has been achieved by running the coolant through hidden hoses and internal engine passages, giving the new XVS1300 Custom a truly timeless image, combined with the performance advantages associated with liquid cooling.\nTo optimize overall engine performance this new cruiser is fitted with a striking large-diameter 2-into-2 exhaust system with slash cut tailpipes that emit a gutsy burble.\nBelt drive\nThe smooth shifting 5-speed gearbox transmits the big V-twin engine pulses to the road via an efficient belt drive. As well as being clean and quiet running, the durable belt drive also requires minimal maintenance, making it ideally suited to the XVS1300 Custom.\nEngine Technical Highlights\n\nHigh torque 1304cc liquid-cooled SOHC 60 degree V-twin\nFuel injection for stable performance and fuel efficiency\n4 valves per cylinder (36mm inlet, 32mm exhaust)\nForged con rids and ceramic composite cylinders for durability\n‘Air-cooling design’ fins with hidden liquid cooling system\n9.5:1 compression ratio\nSlash-cut 2-into-2 exhaust system\nQuiet and efficient belt drive\nSingle crankpin and high-performance camshafts\nDual counterbalancers for smooth running\n\nCHASSIS\nRaked out front end for classic ‘chopper’ style\nOne of the most striking features on the new chassis is the radically raked out front end which gives this new V-twin cruiser a classic ‘chopper’ image. The use of specially designed triple clamps give a fork rake of 40 degrees for a more aggressive and striking ‘long and low’ image.\nEasy steering and lightweight handling\nThe raked-out front end delivers superb straight-line chassis handling characteristics, yet at the same time the XVS1300 Custom’s frame geometry and triple clamp configuration have also been designed to give light and agile handling at lower speeds, for great all round performance in the city and on the highway.\nUltra low seat height\nIn true custom tradition the XVS1300 Custom is equipped with an ultra low seat that perfectly complements the bike’s overall style. At only 670mm high, the stepped dual seat allows the rider to get both feet on the ground when stationary for added comfort and confidence.\nRelaxed riding position\nThe raised pull-back handlebars together with a low seat and forward-mounted footrests give a relaxed riding position that allows the rider to sit back and enjoy the easy handling and big torque pulses from the 1304cc V-twin engine.\nAuthentic sculpted steel fenders\nGood news for those customers that want to modify their bike is that the XVS1300 Custom is equipped with steel front and rear fenders. Many of today’s riders want to create their own individual machine, and the steel fenders allow owners to cut and modify the fenders to suit their own requirements.\n21-inch front wheel and 210 wide rear tyre\nTo accentuate its bold and muscular image the XVS1300 Custom is equipped with beautifully styled 5-spoke aluminium wheels which are fitted with low profile tyres. At the rear there’s a wide 210/40-18 tyre, while the large diameter front wheel runs on a 120/70-21 tyre, giving excellent traction with easy steering.\nThe lightweight wheels are fitted with large diameter disc brakes, with a 320mm diameter front disc and a 310mm rear disc giving smooth and effective braking performance.\nChassis Technical Highlights\n\nRadical ‘chopper-style’ front end with 40 degrees of fork rake\nSolid straight-line performance with easy low-speed handling\nUltra-low seat height of 670mm\nSteel front and rear fenders for increased customizing potential\n5-spoke cast aluminium wheels: 21-inch front, 18-inch rear\nLow profile tyres: 120/70-21 front, 210/40-18 rear\nLarge discs: 320mm single front, 310mm rear\nRelaxed riding position\nSculpted fenders and bodywork\n\nAdvertisements",

The one in green is similar to the green that we usually in the army colours on the their clothes and vehicles. This adds more ‘serious’ offroader style to this scooter. Other than the army green colour, this TTX X-Force also comes with black/grey colour if you don’t like the green. TTX X-Force is included with the YMJET FI system which are good in terms of fuel economy and in this case, it can go for 55.75km/l. Even if that number is not met, if you got at least 50km/l, that should be considered fuel saving enough. Compared to a car (Honda Insight 1.3L), real number mileage is only at maximum 20km/l.  \n\nTTX X-Force has been installed with the ProTaper handle bar which is popular in motocross arena. This kind of handle bar usually can withstand higher force and shock given to them. The meter cluster here is different since it features big speedometer with side box to show the fuel capacity. The side mirror is using the current style of Yamaha that is sharp square. Overall, this Yamaha TTX 115i X-Force Edition is awesome!\nvia: http://tmcblog.com/2012/11/22/yamaha-ttx-varian-x-force-macho-euuy/ and http://www.yamaha-motor.co.th/Product/Product.aspx?ProductID=116\nAdvertisements",

        "135cc\n2-stroke\ninfo\nrx-z\nrxz\nYamaha\nyamaha rxz \n\nYamaha RX-Z: End of Production, Beginning of A Legend \n\n\nPosted on July 28, 2011July 29, 2011 by eddy \n\n\n\nYamaha RX-Z is one of the most popular bike in Malaysia. It represent the perfect bike for anyone who like to have power, speed, style and freedom in the world of biking. Yamaha RX-Z have all the formula for an exciting biking experience and the same time maintains the price to be affordable for almost everyone. At RM8500, it is considered accessible to all rider with the availability of loan by the bike shop or by Aeon Credit Service. Even though it is accessible, the rider must at least have a job, I say this because many rider like to own this bike, but they are still studying and of course, have no money to plonk for Yamaha RX-Z yet. So, they are thinking to buy this bike when they finish their study and have a job. I know this because I’m one of them. Now, the production of Yamaha RX-Z has already stopped, it leave us with only the secondhand Yamaha RX-Z to grab. Slowly, I can see Yamaha RX-Z price increased whether for new one that might still available in very limited unit and also for the secondhand one that are available at shops and Mudah.my. \nThere are 3 general version of Yamaha RX-Z. It is the 5-speed model with straight exhaust, The Boss with 6-speed model and 6-speed Catalyzer model. If you consider the model number, eg. 5PV1, there are many more version actually. The most popular model, I must say is the Catalyzer model. Why? This is because many The Boss owner convert their coverset to Catalyzer version, but I didn’t see yet Catalyzer owner convert their coverset to The Boss version. At least not in my knowledge if there is available. In my humble opinion, Catalyzer version works because it already solved the problem most of The Boss have. The perfect example is the introduction of integrated signal lamp to the front cowl. This is perfect! The Boss have separated signal lamp which doesn’t look nice and easily broken into two pieces and is not easy to repair yourself. I have this problem. One of the solution is to remove the signal lamp altogether but this will render your bike not legal on the road and confirmed to get the ticket from JPJ or PDRM Traffic. One more great thing is the usage of rear tail light that is taken from the Y125Z design which looks modern and timeless. In my opinion, this tail light is the most beautiful tail light ever designed for any bike. It defies the normal design which is whether square or triangle shape with all new design at that time that have curves on the right places and at the correct degree of design.\nThe fuel efficiency are not good for any 2-stroke bikes but with Yamaha RX-Z, it doesn’t feel that way. The fuel tank are large and can be fueled up to 13 liter. The tank also one of the beautiful design in world of under 150cc 2-stroke bike. The shape are slim with enough space for your leg to feel comfortable. It is just perfect size for this legendary bike. Yamaha RX-Z fuel tank are also known as one of the expensive parts if bought original from Hong Leong Yamaha. It is at RM400+ if I’m not mistaken. The local version of the tank is only at RM70+. That is a very huge price difference.\nYamaha RX-Z comes with a wide range of decals sticker design. I think Yamaha RX-Z have the most decals sticker ever made for an under 150cc bike. Usually HLYM updates the decals sticker every two year, since the Yamaha RX-Z already in production for 20 years, this mean that it is already 10 kind of decals sticker. But, everytime HLYM update the sticker, it usually comes with at least two colour choices. So, this means that Yamaha RX-Z decals sticker is more than 20 choices to be picked when you are restoring your Yamaha RX-Z. My favourite decals sticker is the black and white version for the first model Catalyzer.\nThe greatest part for Yamaha RX-Z is its engine. In my opinion, Yamaha RX-Z have the most reliable and lowest maintainance engine for a 2-stroke bike. Compared to Yamaha TZM 150 which is fitted with YPVS (Yamaha Power Valve System) that needs to be replaced regularly every 1000km, Yamaha RX-Z only is only fitted with YCLS which doesn’t contain valve and therefore no need maintainance like the TZM. TZM is a great 150cc small ‘superbike’ that conquers the road of Malaysia some time ago, but all the maintainance that has rised sharply after years of owning it, makes it a bike for enthusiasts only. One part of the engine that is easily and mostly modified/replaced is the exhaust pipe. Usually, Catalyzer owner will remove the stock exhaust pipe and replaced it with the one from the Millenium version. It is said that Millenium exhaust pipe are less restricted compared to the Catalyzer since the the Catalyzer contain three catalyzer pipe inside it for enviromental purposes.\nThe conclusion that I can say is that Yamaha RX-Z is the best bike that has ever land in Malaysia.\nAdvertisements",

The wheel used is the 17″ with 15-spokes (ten silver spokes and 5 gray spokes) and have the 86 logo on it.\nGT 86 logo\nLooks closely to the metal emblem on the car and you can see it is flat-boxer piston with 86 number which makes up the logo on the center. Excellent design!\nThe headlamp is equipped with High Intensity Discharge (HID) setup with daytime running light.\nThe low ground clearance is one of the lowest we can find in Toyota production. It features the ultra-low center of gravity at 475mm. The driver position are also taken care of by taking seat as far back possible along with low hip point for maximum driver control.\nLight weight overall design weighing just 1180 kg. Lighter weight means better acceleration, better stopping and better handling.\nRear view looks good with the double exhaust setup with the black rear diffuser. The tail lamp will be some sight you are going to see after this on the road.\n6 speed manual or automatic transmission featuring paddle shift. This one in the picture is the 6 speed manual and left hand drive since it is for UK release. The 365mm steering is the smallest in Toyota lineup for now. Air-con console features digital display. It is also good to see if this machine features the navigation system as standard.\nCheck out the windows frame. There isn’t any! I love to see this kind of frameless window. It reminds me of old Subaru Impreza.\nIt looks good in any angle you see it. The small rear spoiler is a nice touch, but I think it should be bigger!\nFront engine, rear wheel drive with almost perfect 50:50 weight distribution. The real distribution is 53:47.\nComes with 200HP 2.0 litre 4 cylinder boxer engine. The engine is horizontally opposed piston setup with 1,998cc displacement. The bore and stroke is at 86mm and that make this engine to deliver linear horsepower and torque. The same bore and stroke is being used by Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X.\nOfficial Toyota GT 86 from Toyota UK\n \n\nThe price for the Toyota GT 86 is £28,000 (or USD43,233 or MYR137,718.924)\nOfficial press release from Toyota UK below:\n\nThe anticipation is over: the new Toyota GT 86 sports car makes its world debut at the 2011 Tokyo motor show. The compact 2+2 model, one of the most keenly awaited new cars of the coming year, will go on sale in the UK in June 2012.\nThe Toyota GT 86 has been conceived as an entirely driver-focused machine, designed to deliver the core qualities of the classic sports car experience. That means precise, instant response to the smallest throttle and steering inputs and the kind of performance that appeals to those for whom driving is a passion, not a necessity.\nThe Toyota GT 86 is built on a new platform, with a highly aerodynamic bodyshell stretched tight over the car’s mechanical elements. Rather than fitting a heavy, large capacity powertrain, Toyota has opted instead to go back to its sporting roots, installing a compact, front-mounted, free-revving petrol engine that drives the rear wheels.\nThis four-cylinder “boxer” unit generates 197bhp at 7,000rpm and maximum torque of 205Nm at 6,600rpm, giving the Toyota GT 86 brisk, engaging performance.\nThe powertrain is matched to the world’s most compact four-seat design to create a car that benefits from light weight, low inertia and a low centre of gravity to achieve the best possible power-to-weight ratio. For the driver that means lively, accessible performance and dynamic character with minimal intrusion from electronic systems.\nPackaging\nThe Toyota GT 86 measures 4,240mm long, 1,285mm high and 2,570mm wide, dimensions which make it the most compact four-seater sports car available today.\nBoth the powertrain and the driving position have been set as low and as far back as possible to achieve the best balance: the car has a near-perfect 53:47 front-to-rear weight distribution. The flat-four engine format and the driver’s hip point – the lowest of any current Toyota production model – together give the Toyota GT 86 an ultra-low centre of gravity, at just 475mm.\nThe Toyota GT 86 makes the most of a light kerb weight, making it easy for drivers to exploit its nimble handling and cornering poise. The suspension features MacPherson struts at the front and double wishbones at the rear. The car rides on 17-inch wheels and is fitted with ventilated disc brakes fore and aft.\nWorld’s first horizontally opposed engine with D-4S\nThe Toyota GT 86′s engine is the result of a joint Toyota and Subaru development programme that brings together their technical know-how and mutual passion for sports cars.\nToyota has added its D-4S injection technology to Subaru’s new, horizontally opposed, naturally aspirated 1,998cc four-cylinder boxer engine. This system features separate twin injectors for both direct and port injection, and a high 12.5:1 compression ratio, increasing power and torque across a wide range of engine speeds without sacrificing fuel efficiency and environmental performance.\nThe flat-four engine has equal bore and stroke of 86.0mm and drives through either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission. The manual offers quick, precise shifts using a tactile, short-throw lever; the automatic transmission can be controlled using paddle shifts mounted on the steering wheel.\nPower is distributed to the rear wheels via a limited slip differential to give the best possible grip in all driving conditions. The ABS and switchable vehicle stability control systems have been tuned specifically to deliver dynamic stability at the limit of the car’s performance envelope with minimal electronic intervention to help preserve the purity of the driving experience.\nDesign\nThe design of the Toyota GT 86 successfully works within the technical constraints of achieving the most compact dimensions possible, a low centre of gravity and aerodynamic performance inspired by motorsport technology, while also displaying evocative, sweeping styling that recalls Toyota’s sports car heritage.\nToyota’s new design language informs the styling, as in the way attention is focused on the lower part of the car with the large lower grille. Elsewhere the “keen” approach can be witnessed in the clear, expressive lines.\nThe lower grille’s “scorpion” look gives the Toyota GT 86 a more powerful appearance, with further sporting details including the model-specific 17-inch alloy wheels, rear spoiler, twin exhausts and the “86″ piston logo that denotes the car’s special powertrain configuration.\nOn board, the ergonomics and function of every element the driver interacts with have been scrutinised to make driving the car as natural, instinctive and rewarding as possible. For example, the steering wheel has a 365mm diameter, making it the smallest ever fitted to a Toyota, and it is trimmed in buckskin, developed from exhaustive feedback from test drivers on how to achieve the best steering performance and grip.\nThe three-meter instrument cluster is arranged around a large tachometer, its design benefiting from close attention to the positioning of the displays, markings and typeface. The result is the best possible visibility and readability. The driver-focus of the cockpit is further reinforced by the carbon-effect trim, all-black roof lining, red stitching on the upholstery, aviation-style rocker switches and lightweight, aluminium pedals.\nToyota’s 50-year sports car heritage\nThe Toyota GT 86 may be launched as the world’s only current sports car to feature a front-mounted, horizontally opposed engine and rear-wheel drive, but it cannot claim to be the first. That honour is held by Toyota’s two-cylinder boxer-engined Sports 800, which the company began developing in 1962. Since then, Toyota has established a long history of producing exciting, driver-focused sports cars with a front-engine, rear-wheel drive format that have proved as popular with the public as they have been successful in competition.\nThe beautiful 2000 GT, a coupe powered by a 2.0-litre straight-six engine, was first displayed at the 1965 Tokyo motor show and helped establish Toyota’s global reputation as a sports car manufacturer.\nLaunched in 1971, the first Celica models featured rear-wheel drive powertrains and were praised by enthusiasts for their agility. All four Supra generations came with straight-six engines and rear-wheel drive, while from 1984 the MR2 won recognition as one of the best handling sports cars in motoring history.\nThe inspiration for the Toyota GT 86, however, is the Corolla GT (or Levin) AE86, a car with an enduring reputation for delivering sheer excitement and capturing the fundamental joy of driving. Its front-engine, rear-wheel drive package, compact dimensions, light weight, impeccable balance and superior power-to-weight ratio made it a must-have choice for rallying and circuit driving throughout its production life, from 1983 to 1987. Here in the UK the GT claimed two British Touring Car Championship titles and a series of top-level rally victories.\nThe Toyota GT 86 is a genuinely lightweight machine that offers the intimacy and involvement of a car that can be driven as though an extension of the driver’s body. In this way, it perfectly recaptures the exhilarating spirit of the last of the AE86. And, with numerous customisable parts, its shares its predecessor’s aim to be an affordable car that will evolve with its owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia: JONSIBAL: http://jonsibal.com/blog/2011/11/2013-toyota-gt-86/ source: Toyota UK\nAdvertisements",

See picture below.\nConventional rocker arm (no roller equipped)\nSo, what is the advantage of the roller rocker arm?  \nThe most obvious advantage of using roller rocker arm is that it can minimise the mechanical lost from the crankshaft to the cam to the valve. Roller provides better movement of the cam to the rocker arm and at the same time minimise the friction between that two part (cam and rocker arm).\nWhen mechanical lost is minimised, we can get more power transferred to the wheel. So, in theory, you can get more torque and horsepower by installing this roller rocker arm.\nBuy it online from: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150166475878431&set=a.10150089339638431.281142.320505998430&type=1&theater\n \nAdvertisements",

The tyre that I have choose is from Magnum. Magnum is the cheapest tyre that I can find in my place. Being the cheapest, I also think this one will not last long. Maybe just for 6 month.\nChoosing a tyre is not easy since there are a lot of consideration before buying it. Maybe you can say, just buy the most expensive one. You are wrong. This is because some expensive tyre is made to grip well in dry road only. Also the compound made for it is meant for short term only since it can grip hard, so it can wears fast too.\nWhile thinking for which tyre I need to use next, I found a good article about motorcycle tyre at here. This is based on the writer’s experience using different brands of tyre. So, it might differ with yours. Anyway, you can take the advice just for consideration before choosing a good tyre for your usage.\nFour brands of tyre has been reviewed by the writer that is; Dunlop T900, Michelin M45, Farelli F1800 and FKR Epsilon HT200. Duro has not been reviewed since it is still being used by the writer. Read it here.\nAdvertisements",

Tungsten is good for normal use of the bike since it can’t withstand high temperature for a long time. For racing use or heavy duty use, it is advisable to use Iridium electrode spark plug. Also, by using Iridium, the contact area can be reduced to make a larger spark than normal spark plug. If you look closely in the picture, you will see what I mean. So, the Umi Iridium Power Spark Plug here should be a consideration next time you want to have your spark plug changed. What is expected from the usage of this Iridium spark plug is; better fuel economy, better long distance engine performance and better pickup.\n\nBecause of its scarcity and high cost, applications of iridium are severely limited. Although iridium metal and many of its complex compounds are good catalysts, no large-scale commercial application for these has been developed. In general, other platinum metals have superior catalytic properties. The high degree of thermal stability of elemental iridium and the stability it imparts to its alloys does give rise to those applications where it has found success. Particularly relevant are its high melting point (2443°C or 4429°F), its oxidation resistance, and the fact that it is the only metal with good mechanical properties that survives atmospheric exposure above 1600°C (2910°F). Iridium is alloyed with platinum to increase tensile strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. However, the workability of these alloys is decreased. These alloys find use as electrodes for anodic oxidation, for containing and manipulating corrosive chemicals, for electrical contacts that are exposed to corrosive chemicals, and as primary standards for weight and length. Platinum-iridium alloys are used for electrodes in spark plugs that are unusually resistant to fouling by antiknock lead additives. Sourced from Wikipedia.\n\nAdvertisements",

        "750cc\n796cc\n800cc\nducati\nMonster 796 \n\nDucati Malaysia introduces Monster 796 Corse Stripe – RM63,888 (basic) \n\n\nPosted on February 20, 2014February 20, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nDucati Malaysia (Next Bike Sdn Bhd) told the tale of a new Monster as it launched the 796 Corse Stripe at Ducati Centre Petaling Jaya today.\nThe latest incarnation of the Monster series combines the user-friendliness of the 696 with the sporty nature of the 1100 and brings the magic of the mid-range back to the Monster family.\n“Still a roaring success more than 20 years after its sensational debut at the Cologne Motorcycle Show back in 1992, the Monster range continues to captivate motorcyclists across the globe with its subtle evolution. The 796 is a refined and sophisticated machine which boasts the unmistakable Monster style and has become the new ‘urban icon’ of hand built Italian naked motorcycles,“ said Datuk Wira SM Faisal Tan Sri SM Nasimuddin, NAZA Group of Companies Joint Group Executive Chairman.\nPresent at the event were En Nik Danial Nik Mahmood, Vice President of NAZA Two Wheels Division and Mr. CW Juan, General Manager of Next Bike Sdn Bhd.\n“This mid-sized Monster is bound to become a new favourite amongst Malaysian riders and we estimate that this model will contribute 35% of Ducati’s sales for 2014. Available to the local market as Completely Knocked Down (CKD) units from Thailand, the Monster 796 Corse Stripe offers exceptional value for the price of RM63,888 (net selling price),” stated Datuk Wira SM Faisal.  \n \n\nDUCATI MONSTER 796 CORSE STRIPE\nOVERVIEW\nThe emotion of performance\nBy skilfully combining increased power, a new sports design and maximum riding enjoyment, the Monster 796 offers incredible performance and thrilling emotion. Standard ABS and the special Corse Stripe livery further emphasise Ducati’s sporting spirit.\nCONCEPT\nLess is Monster\nThe ‘less-is-more’ philosophy behind all Monsters underlines Ducati’s never-ending pursuit of genuinely compact, high performance motorcycles, but these new models have succeeded in being even more ‘pared down’ than their predecessors.\nEvery single component has been redesigned and redeveloped so now more than ever, form follows function. With any details detracting from the Monster concept being eliminated, ‘less-is-more’ also means ‘less-is-Monster’. Less weight plus more torque equals fun-filled riding.\n\nMonster Story\nIn 1992 Ducati unveiled a new prototype that was to become an icon. Ducati’s creation awed the crowds and the world’s media of that year’s Cologne International Motorcycle show. The 900 Monster was a motorcycle that created a truly new niche – dramatically styled, minimalist in stature yet bristling with innovative engineering solutions. The Monster’s radical styling has also provided the inspiration for an entire after-market sector specialising in hot-rod parts for this legendary machine. For this reason, rarely do you see two Monsters the same. This radical and refreshing design departure also influenced other manufacturers but, as the old adage states: imitation is the highest form of flattery… The Monster is characterised by a long and successful history, by its introduction during the years of numerous cylinders and uncountable colour options, but above all by a constant technological evolution that this year brings us to the birth of the last version: the Monster 1100EVO, “The Ultimate Monster”.\nUrban Icon\nThe Monster family introduces the 796, an exciting addition to the line-up that combines the user-friendliness of the 696 with the sports character of the 1100. Delivering 87hp (64kW), a dry weight of just 167kg (368lb) and optional ABS, the stylish new Monster 796 returns the magic of mid-range to the Monster family.\nWith the brand new Desmodue 796 engine at the heart of the machine, a single-sided swingarm and revised ergonomics, the Monster 796 perfectly balances lifestyle performance with everyday functionality to enhance the original Monster spirit.\n\nDressed in Ducati red, arctic white silk or diamond black silk with a bright red Trellis frame, the Monster 796 can be further personalised with an additional 10 colour schemes available in ‘Logomania’ the innovative Monster Art program.\nThe Monster 796 opens a new road to the world of Ducati Monster and becomes the ‘urban icon’ of hand-built Italian naked motorcycles.\nMonster Tales\nA memory, an emotion, an image, a sound. One common element: Ducati Monster.\nWhether you’re a motorcyclist, a would-be motorcyclist or a passenger, whether Monster has been your travelling companion on a thousand adventures or whether it’s a dream that’s still to come true, whether it’s parked in your garage or is just an image firmly stamped in your mind….whatever your story, tell us the tale and celebrate the 20th anniversary of Monster together with us!\nRegister online and share your tales about the world’s best naked bike! You can upload a photo, a video, a written text or even just a sound to be a part of the Monster hall of fame!\n\nMONSTER SPEC\nWith a seat height of 800mm (31.5in) and the combination of seat shape and raised handlebars, posture is optimized and comfort enhanced. The low weight and ABS as standard equipment inspire confidence and make life simpler in the city for the mid-range Monster.\nSuspension up front is handled by user-friendly 43mm Kayaba forks, while the sporty Ducati single-sided rear swingarm is controlled by a single rear Sachs unit with adjustable spring preload and return damping for passenger load optimisation.\nTwin 320mm semi-floating discs are gripped by radially mounted 4-piston Brembo callipers to provide powerful and progressive front-end braking with rider-friendly ‘feeling’, while the rear is equipped with a 245mm disc and 2-piston calliper, also by Brembo.\nThe 17” wheels are in the five ‘Y-shape’ spoked style and produced in lightweight aluminium to keep the unsprung weight low and handling, braking and acceleration performances high. To differentiate the 796, the wheels sport a stylish pin-stripe for 60° of the circumference of the rim which creates a full circle of red when in motion. They sport 180/55 rear and 120/70 front Pirelli Diablo Rosso II tyres.\n\nENGINE\n796 Desmodue\nThe 796 engine is a completely brand new, lightweight Desmodue power unit designed to provide the torquey, smooth and enjoyable character famous of all Desmodromic L-Twins.\nMaintaining the smooth and enjoyable character, famous of all Desmodromic L-Twins, the 796 Desmodue power unit has a 66mm stroke crankshaft, instead of the 696’s 57.2mm, and a lightweight flywheel that helps to maximise power to an impressive 87hp (64kW) @ 8250rpm and torque to 58lb-ft (78Nm) @ 6250rpm. An oil cooler is fitted to protect power delivery by maintaining optimum efficiency.\nThe 803cc swept volume is compressed to a ratio of 11:1, compared to the 696’s 10.7:1, then injected and ignited by Siemens controlled electronics. The 2-1-2 catalytic exhaust system uses twin lambda probes and regulating valve to provide finer fuel mapping and Euro 3 conformity. The system’s lightweight and compact design is achieved by using 1mm thick tubing and terminates in twin lateral mufflers.\n\nAPTC clutch\nThe APTC ‘wet’ clutch gives a ‘slipper’ type action that prevents destabilizing of the rear-end under aggressive down-shifting and also gives the extra benefit of a super-light feel at the lever, a great benefit in stop-start city traffic or during longer journeys. The 21-plate oil-bath clutch (11 friction and 10 steel) represents a power-enhancing weight reduction over the ‘dry’ system as well as having a quieter operation and requiring less maintenance.\nLightweight crankcases\nThe new crankcases hug the gearbox internals much closer to create a smaller and more compact outer profile and achieve considerable weight savings over previous cases.\nPower & torque curves\nThe Monster 796 produces 84hp (64kW)@ 8250rpm of power and a torque to 58lb-ft (78Nm) @ 6250rpm.\nCrankshaft\nThe crankshaft assembly uses a lightweight 848-type flywheel and has a 66mm stroke instead of the 696’s 57.2mm.\nExhaust system\nProviding a deep and rich exhaust tone within current noise and emissions regulations is no mean feat, but the Monster definitely provides the L-Twin\nsound famous of Ducati. Its bold, high-level twin mufflers also make a striking style statement.\nThe exhaust system on Monster 796 has one Lambda probe dedicated to each cylinder, enabling precise fuelling for a smoother power delivery as well as complying with current emission regulations.\n\nCHASSIS\nMonster Trellis\nAn immensely strong but light tubular steel Trellis frame with aluminium rear sub-frame is the visual and structural backbone of the Monster. Delivering unparalleled rigidity with minimal mass, the chassis design is pure Ducati in its ingenuity and simplicity. A separate, all aluminium sub-frame saves weight and adds a pleasing continuity with the aluminium footrest hangers and matte finished swingarm.\nLightweight construction\nEvery carefully selected component of the Monster 696 has a net benefit to the overall light weight of the machine. The dry weight of 161kgs (355lb) has dramatic effects on not just manoeuvrability and ease of use, but also by contributing directly to increased performance, braking and acceleration.\nLightweight 5-spoke wheels\nThe extremely lightweight aluminium alloy Y-shaped, 5-spoke wheels reduce unsprung weight and improve agility. The 3.50×17 front wheel is fitted with a 120/70ZR tyre while the rear 5.50×17 wheel has a 180/55ZR. The result is lightweight, precise steering that is extremely responsive at all speeds while giving the vehicle exceptional stability.\nSingle-sided swingarm\nThe beautifully shaped single-sided swingarm gives the Monster a ‘tough’ look while ensuring higher rigidity, reduced weight and enhanced road holding.\nThe swingarm is chill-cast using aluminium in its most noble form. Gravity cast and heat treated, the component achieves the best mechanical characteristics as well as reduced final weight for improved handling.\nEQUIPMENT\nHeadlight\nThe triple-parabola headlight on the Monster utilises the latest optical technology and advanced construction techniques to provide an incredibly compact lighting package. In spite of its compact size, the headlight throws a broad and deep beam to provide excellent visibility and make night riding safer. Viewed from the side, its discrete silhouette mimics the radical shape of the fuel tank.\nLED taillight\nA LED rear light unit satisfies the minimalist, weight-saving design ethos found throughout the Monster 796. The specially designed strip of LEDs are enhanced by a special diffuser lens to deliver outstanding light clarity and incredible longevity.\nMonster Style\nRefined and sophisticated, the Monster 796 is proud to show its unmistakable style as the ‘Italian ambassador’ in the world of motorcycling.\nThe large diameter tube construction flows into the cast aluminium rear sub-frame which matches the matte black rear swingarm and footrest hangers.\nThe 17″ wheels in the five ‘Y-shape’ mount a stylish pin-stripe for 60° of the circumference of the rim which creates a full circle of red when in motion.\nThe bright white illuminated display, the stylish red stitching of the new seat, the italian flag and the new Ducati logo on the front mudguard complete the clean and minimalist style of this new urban icon.\nEmpowering Controls\nThe Monster 796 has enhanced comfort and control with 20mm higher bar-risers gripping sturdy tapered section aluminium handlebars.\nIntegral type Brembo master cylinders are used for both the clutch and brake systems and maintain a clean handlebar arrangement for the rider. They are fitted with user-friendly 4-point adjustable levers that provide easy-to-reach control for all hand sizes and the APTC clutch offers a super-light lever action ideal for use in the city.\nStopwatch\nThe digital display is programmed with a stopwatch function that, when enabled, can be triggered by using the high-beam flash button and each recorded time stored in a memory. After your journey or track session, the times or lap times can be recalled from the memory and scrolled through by using the instrumentation buttons on the left-hand switchgear.\nM796 ABS\nThe Ducati Monster 796 is available with ABS (anti-lock braking system).\nUnlike the majority of motorcycle ABS set-ups, this system has the advantage of ensuring a more natural braking ‘feel’ for the rider.\nThe Monster 796 ABS is equipped with ABS, the single seat cover and the neat micro-bikini fairing.\n796 colours and style\nThe Monster 796 comes in traditional Ducati red or diamond black silk with both colours against a red Trellis frame and black wheels, which feature a red flash around 60° of the rim side, creating a red stripe at speed. The Monster 796 can be further personalised with an additional 10 colour schemes available in ‘Logomania’ the innovative Monster Art program.\nAdditional features include footrest hangers finished in matte black to match the rear sub-frame and single-sided swingarm, the Ducati logo on the front mudguard and the Tricolore displayed proudly on the single-seat cover and fuel tank.\nThe Monster 796 is fitted with the micro-bikini fairing and single seat cover as standard and features a comfort-enhancing seat shape, further accentuated with stylish red stitching.\nAdvertisements",
        "BMW \n\nBMW M Safety Car “Official Car of MotoGP™” \n\n\nPosted on March 25, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nLast weekend, the 2014 season of the MotoGP World Championship went underway and long-term partner BMW M GmbH is once again on board. BMW M’s 16th season as “Official Car of MotoGP” began with the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha. BMW has been involved in MotoGP since 1999 and provides the fleet of official cars.\nBMW M GmbH presented its first highlight of the year at the season-opener at the “Losail International Circuit”: the new BMW M4 Coupé made its debut as a safety car. The latest high-performance coupé from BMW M GmbH spearheads the safety car fleet in the 2014 MotoGP season. The new BMW M4 Coupé combines motorsport genes with unlimited road capability in a highly-emotional overall concept. The six-cylinder inline engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology, which was developed from scratch, and high-rev concept offer a maximum torque of 550 Newton metres over a wide range of speeds, whilst generating a top output of 431 hp. The BMW M4 Coupé accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.1 seconds. This car was designed for the ultimate driving dynamics and to be used on the racetracks of this world. Proof of this comes in the innovative cooling system and reduced weight of the car, which is made possible by the consistent use of lightweight materials. As with all safety cars, the BMW M4 Coupé was further optimised in the BMW M factory, in order to ensure it is ideally suited to leading a field of racing motorcycles. To achieve this, the technicians at the BMW M factory dismantled the rear seat and fitted RECARO racing seats, including Schroth belts. In addition, BMW M Performance Parts are used extensively this season, including the titanium BMW M Performance exhaust system with carbon finishers, which is used for the first time. Further components, such as a BMW M Performance front splitter, a BMW M Performance rear diffusor and a BMW M Performance rear spoiler made of carbon optimise the aerodynamic properties of the BMW M4 Coupé Safety Car. LED lights on the front skirt, LED lights on the roof and the exclusive livery ensure that this high-performance car is clearly a safety car.\nThe new BMW M3 Sedan also makes its debut as a safety car in the 2014 season. In total, this year’s fleet of official MotoGP cars comprises five BMW M and M Performance models. The BMW M4 Coupé, BMW M3 and BMW M5 act as safety cars. The safety officer takes to the track in a BMW M6 Coupé, while two BMW M550d xDrive Tourings are used as medical cars. Furthermore, BMW Motorrad is also providing two new BMW HP4s as safety bikes. This year, a medical car will also be in action at overseas races, in order to guarantee even more safety for the MotoGP riders. You can find more information on the 2014 safety car fleet online at: www.bmw-m-safetycar.com\n“BMW M is proud to be part of the MotoGP success story for the 16th season running,” said Thomas Schemera, Director of Sales and Marketing BMW M GmbH. “We are delighted that the BMW M4 Coupé experienced its baptism of fire as a safety car out on the racetrack. Four generations of the BMW M3 have combined motorsport genes and unlimited suitability for daily use into one highly emotional overall concept. The BMW M4 Coupé is a natural progression of these fundamental ideas. We are certain that this model will set new standards with regard to the overall concept, precision and agility. This year sees the introduction of a medical car for overseas races, increasing the level of protection offered to the riders. This is another important stepping stone in our continuously expanding commitment to MotoGP.”\nProviding the BMW M fleet remains the focal point of the partnership with Dorna Sports, but there are many other important aspects to BMW M GmbH’s involvement at Grands Prix. These include the BMW M Award, which will be presented for the twelfth time in 2014. At the end of each MotoGP season, this award is presented to the rider with the best qualifying results. The winner receives an exclusive BMW M car for his efforts. Last year, Spanish MotoGP rookie Marc Márquez became the youngest winner in the history of the BMW M Award. At the season finale in Valencia (ESP), he was presented with a BMW M6 Coupé in an exclusive “Frozen Black Metallic” livery in recognition of his success. This season’s top qualifier can once again look forward to a genuine highlight – however, exactly which BMW M model is up for grabs will not be revealed until the start of the European MotoGP season in Jerez (ESP).\nAdvertisements",

Ducati will also re-establish its collaboration with Feel Racing, the logistical and organisational structure based in Crespellano, in the province of Bologna, a relationship that was interrupted in 2010, the last year in which the Bologna-based manufacturer participated in the production-derived series as a factory team.  \nDavies 7 and Giugliano 34\n\n On stage to present the season’s plans and technical innovations were Claudio Domenicali (CEO Ducati Motor Holding), Luigi Dall’Igna (General Manager Ducati Corse), Paolo Ciabatti (Sporting Director Ducati Corse), Ernesto Marinelli (SBK Project Director) and Team Manager Serafino Foti. A clear and tangible sign of how important it is for Ducati to have its red machines return as frontrunners in the World Superbike championship.\n\nNext to take to the stage were the two Ducati Superbike factory riders, 26-year old Welshman Chaz Davies and 24-year old Italian Davide Giugliano, on hand to unveil the 2014 version of the 1199 Panigale with its new racing livery that includes the team’s main sponsors TIM, Fiamm, Valsir and Diadora.\n\nThe event was broadcast live on the web thanks to avant-garde filming and encoding technology, the fruit of innovation from Telecom Italia  – team sponsor with the TIM brand – and the new TIM 4G mobile network. Fans from across the world connected to the live streaming via www.ducati.com, www.liveonlte.tim.it and various social media sites. The public also had the chance to interact directly with members of the Ducati Superbike Team, by sending a series of questions that contributed to the success of the event with interaction between the web users and protagonists on the stage.\n\n\nClaudio Domenicali – CEO Ducati Motor Holding\n“It is with great satisfaction that I open the new 2014 racing season with the presentation of the Ducati Superbike team. Using a movie analogy, this is our ‘Back to the Future’, where Ducati starts from its origins and essential values, looking forward decisively towards new challenges and new goals. As it always has been, Superbike is an important element for Ducati, its fans and enthusiasts and we take great interest in it. Its proximity to the product, the fact that Ducati made its name in the modern era thanks to the many victories of its twin-cylinder machines in this championship for production-derived bikes, the chance to develop solutions and kits to offer to our clients and fans, all of this makes Superbike a strategic championship for us. Ducati and its fans look forward to seeing the Panigale fighting for the top step of the rostrum, and Luigi Dall’Igna certainly has the experience and competence with which to take the team in that direction. I wish them all the best of luck, especially our two new riders Chaz and Davide who, I am sure, will do everything they can to put the smile back on the faces of the Ducatisti.”\n\nLuigi Dall’Igna – General Manager Ducati Corse\n“The results of the latest tests are encouraging. Both riders were able to record important lap times but more important is the fact that their comments regarding the bike have been positive. This is a key factor, especially in view of the experience they have accumulated in recent seasons and the fact that both were riding bikes of reference until just a few months ago. They are together providing us with the feedback needed in order to develop the 1199 Panigale in the best possible way. There is of course a lot of work still to do but I am confident and optimistic and believe that over the course of this coming championship we will get the bike back to where it deserves to be.”\n\nPaolo Ciabatti – Sporting Director Ducati Corse \n“2014 gets off to a good start. We have taken the decision to run the Superbike team directly once more, in conjunction with Feel Racing. We have won many titles with the Feel Racing team in the past and seeing as they are based in Crespellano, close to Bologna, it is as if they are an offshoot of Ducati Corse. We have two new riders, Chaz and Davide who, as well as being young, are also very ambitious and competitive, and with them we hope that we will soon get back to achieving the kind of results we expect. To win against the four-cylinders will not be easy but we think that we can achieve good results this year and finally bring satisfaction to our fans with the 1199 Panigale.”\n\nErnesto Marinelli – SBK Project Director\n“The 2014 version of the Panigale has undergone various evolutions since last year. I would say the main one regards the electronics system that has been completely modified, generating not only an advantage in terms of functionality but also a lower overall weight. With regard to the chassis, the biggest change involves the new Ӧhlins suspension, which this season has a price cap imposed by the regulations. The braking system has also changed, with new 328mm Brembo front discs, and the engine has undergone evolution in order to achieve greater performance. We believe that we have a good bike/rider package with which to bring Ducati back to the positions that count.”\n\nSerafino Foti – Team Manager\n“I think that Chaz and Davide have a characteristic in common, in that neither of them has yet reached the apex of his career, so this gives them both great motivation. We will learn more about our level of competitiveness in about a month’s time in Australia but the important thing is to have faith in the bikes and to know that we have given our all throughout this first phase. Another important thing is not to lose focus during the season, as this will undoubtedly be a very difficult championship of the highest level. The goal is to give the Ducati fans the kind of excitement that they experienced in the past – we will give it our all!”\n\nChaz Davies – Ducati Superbike Team #7\n“I haven’t been riding the Panigale for very long yet but I feel that my bike has a lot of potential still to explore and evaluate. It’s important to continue to work hard and to stay focused on improving each component of the bike but this is a challenge that I’m very much looking forward to. I think that the bike has the potential to win races; we just need to keep working in the same direction and make the most of every opportunity that presents itself during race weekends. I think Davide and I will develop a strong working relationship and this will allow us to support and spur each other on to achieve positive results on the track.”\n\nDavide Giugliano – Ducati Superbike Team #34\n“My new Panigale is something amazing, a bike that immediately feels like mine and with which I’m immediately in tune. I’m very pleased with how the bike is developing and so this is already very positive. Chaz is undoubtedly a great rider, a great talent and this season he will surely be one of my toughest rivals but I know that we’ll work together and will encourage each other to always do our best. We also owe it to the fans of course, as we want everybody who has always followed and supported Ducati to have fun and enjoy the results! I’m more than ready to get going and can’t wait to start the championship.”\n\nEditor’s Note: WSBK is coming to Sepang, Malaysia on 8 June 2014.

Malaysia is first country in Asia to have the Kawasaki Ninja H2 and H2 R (not including Japan). I’m thinking this is due to Malaysia that have the proper place to have the power of this bike to be unleashed, that is the Sepang Circuit. As we know, the Ninja H2 R are track only bike and you can never have it registered to make it road legal, so, it is logic that Malaysia to have it available. For the road use, you can still obtain the Ninja H2 which is road legal hyperbike that can maxes out 300km/h, but on the road, you should limit the speed to only 110km/h.\nKawasaki Vulcan S is also an interesting bike to have here in Malaysia. It is a cruiser which suits the condition in Malaysia since we have nice coastal beach street that we can enjoy riding it. Previously, Malaysia have already have the Kawasaki Vulcan VN500 that proves to be popular sometimes ago. Priced below RM30,000, this is one bike that offer excellent value-for-money. You’ll get 650cc bike with a muscular look from Kawasaki that proves to be reliable. Revival of the cruiser as said by Kawasaki Malaysia. I guessing this Vulcan S will be hugely popular once again in Malaysia. It just ticks all the box correctly. Great engine? Check. Nice design? Check. Cheap price? Check!\nAvailable only sometime next year.  Price is after the jump:  \nPrice of Kawasaki Ninja H2\n\nH2R\n\nVulcan S\n\nAdvertisements",

H2O is a volatile compound means that it can vapourise well at any temperature above its boiling point. This property of volatility makes it dry when wash our car. But if we are using normal tap water, we can see spot and streak on our car after the water have dried out. The spot and streak are actually minerals and contaminant that is normally existed in the normal tap water such as calcium, magnesium, silica, iron etc.So, using reverse osmosis water to clean our car and bike really make sense since it does not contain anything else other than H2O only.Perfect clean car, spotless and streak-free surface is also good for waxing and polishing since it does not contain any metals from the water to make the paint surface to be scratched.In fact, reverse osmosis water is used in luxury auto detailing company since they are looking for nothing other perfection.If you have reverse osmosis water filter and like to have perfect clarity spotless clean bike, this is the time to use it!\nAdvertisements",

Thais has enjoyed FI bikes for a long time and this FI fitment to this bike is no surprise. One of the most interesting thing about FI system is about the fuel-efficiency that is better than the carburettor system.  Honda Super Cub 110 Pro which is a modern retro bike in Japan that is equipped with PGM-FI system can achieve 66.2 km/l which is already a great feat, but this Yamaha Spark 115i can go up to 84.15km/l as tested by journalist. Even if the data in too big to believe, having the fuel efficiency rating at 70km/l is already good enough to beat the Honda Super Cub Pro! You should be noted that the journalist really wanted to test the fuel-efficiency, so he rides the bike at 40-60km/h only. \n\nIf you are a relax kind of type rider, this bike can surely gives you the big fuel-efficiency returns. When discussing about FI system, we like to relate that to the cost of the FI parts compared to the more common carburetor parts. As noted by the press release by Yamaha Thailand, they said ‘The price for the parts that are right for you“. In my opinion, I think Yamaha has able to develop a low cost FI system and more fuel efficient compared to its own YMJET FI system previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also think that Yamaha has segmented this YEC_FI system for fuel-efficient bike and YMJET FI system for performance bikes.

This CBR250R will have the largest engine displacement of any vehicle produced by Thai Honda Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Thai Honda), Honda’s motorcycle production company in Thailand, and will be its first full-fledged road sports model. Following in the footsteps of last year’s PCX 125cc scooter produced and sold by Thai Honda, the CBR250R will be launched as a global model for export to a wide range of countries such as the ASEAN countries, Japan, Europe, North America, and Australia. In Japan, the CBR250R is scheduled to begin sales in the spring of 2011. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR&D for the CBR250R was advanced in both Japan and Thailand starting with the development phase. To satisfy a wide variety of customer tastes from around the world, Honda set up the phrase the “Sport Quarter for One World, CBR250R” as the development concept with the aim in mind of creating a model that allows riders of all kinds, from beginners to experienced riders, to feel the fun of maneuvering a motorcycle.\nThai Honda, the production base for this model, began motorcycle production in 1967 and first started to export to Japan in 1988 with the Cub 100EX. It has produced over 18 million motorcycles to date (as of the end of June 2010) and has exported motorcycles to numerous regions such as Europe as well as its natural base in Asia. Using production engineering and know-how contributed by Kumamoto Factory, the lead plant for motorcycle production, Thai Honda is striving further to enhance its structure for the supply of high-quality products.\nHonda Motorcycle and Scooter India (Pvt.) Ltd. will also start production of the CBR250R next spring and extend sales from India to South America. Honda will also offer the CBR250R at a more affordable price in the diversified Indian motorcycle market by effectively carrying out global procurement of parts and materials in the same way as Thai Honda.\nThe CBR250R is equipped with a newly-developed liquid-cooled 250cc 4-stroke 4-valve single-cylinder DOHC engine that is easy to handle. High environmental performance that meets Euro 3 emission standards and Thailand’s sixth emission standards was realized by adopting an electronically controlled fuel injection system (PGM-FI*1) as well as an O2 sensor and taking advantage of the combined effect with a catalyzer fitted inside the exhaust pipe.\nThe full-cowl body presents a highly advanced design full of functional beauty. The light and compact frame, made of a highly-rigid diamond shape in a truss structure, offers agile handling and steady maneuverability as a sports model, while the cowl design enables optimal control of the wind toward the engine or the rider.\nIn the area of safety technology, the CBR250R’s specifications incorporate Combined ABS, a world first*2 for a 250cc-class road sports model into a designated type.

        "rxz \n\nHistory of Yamaha RX-Z 135 \n\n\nPosted on July 10, 2008 by eddy \n\n\nRX-Z 100S\n\nRX-Z started its production in 1980’s. At that time there are two version of RX-Z, namely RX-Z 100 and RX-Z 135. RX-Z 100 was specifically designed to fit the market in Mexico only, therefore we didn’t have it here in Malaysia. RX-S 100 and RX-S 115 was the common bike that we see before the introduction of the legendary RX-Z 135.\nRX-Z 135 was introduced at that time with 5-speed transmission, box speedometer and straight exhaust pipe without the resonance chamber. Even though the design is created almost 27 years back, but it still relevant in today’s motorcycle environment. The design is still fresh and amazing. Given the power of 135 cc with 2-stroke class engine makes it a very intimidating bike. In year 1985, people who buys the RX-Z 135 is said to have a fun lifestyles, macho and having daring personality. RX-Z 135 design also is very futuristic compared to the bike such as Honda Raider, Suzuki Katana, X7 and Kawasaki GTO. RX-Z 135 is known for their awesome power can be harnessed easily just by a little modification. The most popular and cheapest modification with great performance boost is done by changing the exhaust pipe to a racing exhaust pipe. A good racing pipe can add up to 3 ps. This can be achieved if the exhaust pipe have a good resonance chamber that can works likes a mini turbo without the turbine. But, even in standard condition, the bike can go up to 150 km/h and that is higher than the highway speed limit here in Malaysia (110 km/h). Most of the RX-Z 135 owner here have modified their bike to go up to 200++ km/h and they used it for daily commute and mind you, it is not for racing. Speed is one of the reason why RX-Z 135 is very popular because we need it to overtake big lorries and heavy trucks during the commute using highway or specifically in PLUS highway here in Malaysia.\nIn 1990, Yamaha makes a little upgrade to the bike by adding one more gear to the transmission that makes the bike 6-speeder. The design of the exhaust pipe has been updated by equipping it with a new design that have resonance chamber and muffler. This design have increased the power of the bike to 21 ps. Still at this period of time, there are no bike manufactured by other company that beat RX-Z. In fact, there IS no bike by other manufacturer that has been build to be in the same category as RX-Z 135. Most manufacturer like to focus their bike to 150 cc segment. This is true when we look at Suzuki Gamma 150 cc, Honda NSR 150RR and Kawasaki KIPS 150, but here Yamaha also its own weapon that is TZM 150.\n2000 has been the year RX-Z get a new cloth. RX-Z has been refreshed with new head and tail design. The new head gets a new smaller headlight. The turn signal has been integrated to the cowling, thus making the bike looks cleaner and more meaner. Tail light has been borrowed from 125Z, but it is okay since the tail light is also nice and clean. But. I prefer for Yamaha to make an original tail light design specifically for RX-Z 135. Clutch has also been upgraded by Yamaha making it is easier to switch gears and better handling for low speed travelling.\nEven with lots of reason to be popular, RX-Z is not a bike without flaw. The greatest flaw that I can think of is, the position of the carburetor and the way it is assembled. Since the carburetor is only hold up by 2 connecting rubber, it is very easy to take the carburetor off. And this give way to thief to take it easily. Even if the thief won’t take the carburetor off, they can still steal the petrol from the RX-Z tank since the fuel line is exposed at the left side of the carburetor. I have heard a lot of complain about this from my friends and also from other RX-Z owners.\n2008 is a year we all wait for Yamaha to unveil new RX-Z 135 design or at least stripe change.\nHere’s the year and code name model change that RX-Z 135 have gone through:\n1st model:1985/87 – 2UX\n2nd model:1989 – 3UK1\n3rd model:1993 – 3UK3\n4th model:1995 – 3RSA\n5th model:1996/97 – 3RSB\n6th model:2000 – 3XL3\n7th model:2002 – 5PV1\n8th model:2005 – 5PV2\n9th model:2008- ??? (not yet introduced)What is expected in 2008/09 RX-Z model:Rear mono-shock suspensionRear disc brakeInverted front telescopic forkDouble piston front brake caliperNew stripe and designNew & original sports rim equipped\nbut, you should know that Malaysia already have stopped the introduction of new 2-stroke bike starting the year 2006. So, there are no more new RX-Z model. We will only stick to 5PV2 for the rest of the time.\nLong Live RX-Z!\nAdvertisements",

        "2-stroke\n250cc\nrgv250\nsuzuki\nVJ21 \n\n1988 Suzuki RGV250 – the closest thing you could get to a GP bike on the road in 80’s \n\n\nPosted on December 9, 2013December 9, 2013 by eddy \n\n\n\nSuzuki RGV250 is one of the most popular 250cc 2-stroke bike in the world. It is staged with other interesting machines like the Honda NSR250R and Yamaha TZR250SPR. This particular bike is RGV250K-L VJ21 that gives out 58PS at 11,000RPM. Made from the 1988 and all the way to 1990. It comes in iconic Suzuki blue and white colour that sets it apart from the competing bikes.\n\nThe engine fitted to this bike is a 2-cylinder 90-degree V-configuration in 2-stroke mode cycle. It is forward inclined at 20-degree for lower center of gravity. The crankshaft is 180-degree and made to be strong and compact. To reduce the friction from the piston to the wall of the cylinder block, SBC cylinder plating is applied to replace the conventional cast iron sleeves. SBC stands for Suzuki Boron Composite that plates the aluminium cylinder inner walls with a special alloy plating that consists of nickel and phosphor alloy carrying boron bromide. This reduces the friction and increases the durability of the piston rings.  \n\nThe chassis is DC-ALBOX frame that refers to dual-cell design that have an inner rib that gives rigidity but at the same time is lightweight. In the world of superbikes, Suzuki are known to make lightweight and strong chassis. This DC-ALBOX also contributes to a low seating position that is only at 755mm.\n\nBrake system used is called DPBS that works out to be Deca Piston Brake System. After thinking for a while, Deca there actually means 10. So, it means 10 piston brake system. Yes, 10 piston in total. The front brake uses double 290mm diameter disc plate and each one is accompanied with 4-piston Tokico caliper. That is 8. Another 2 more piston are used at the rear that attached to the grip the 210mm diameter disc plate. The technology does not stop there as the front 4-piston caliper comes in 4-pod staggered diameter configuration. The piston in front of the disc is 34mm and the piston located behind the disc is 30mm. This configuration gives a more uniform braking power and stable damping power. That is a massive braking power for this powerful bike.\nOne more thing that cannot be left without mentions is about the transmission. It got the 6-speed transmission that we all expect, but what great is that this transmission is straight from the GP technology that uses cassette-type gearbox. This is a one-piece configuration that is designed for easy replacement and maintanance, but this thing doesn’t comes cheap.\nLooking back at the history, here are the models that has been made:\n\n\n\nModel\nProduction\nPower\n\n\nVJ21\n1988-1990\n58hp\n\n\nVJ22\n1991-1996\n62hp\n\n\nVJ23\n1997-1998\n70hp\n\n\n\n1988 Suzuki RGV250 Technical Specs\n\nAdvertisements",

So you can expect to see more models and customisation products coming up for the Scrambler.\n\nThe introduction took place in Ducati Sungai Buloh, or better known amongst the biking fraternity as Welly Sungai Buloh. Coordinates are available on Waze.\nClick here to read why the Scrambler Ducati is a good entry level bike.\n\nA contemporary interpretation of the original 1970’s icon, the Scrambler Ducati 2015 is an easy to handle, entry level sport bike that is comfortable, accessible and every bit as fashionable as its predecessor. Whilst it certainly exhibits a retro flair, the Scrambler was not designed to indulge in the nostalgic but rather was ‘intended to be just how the legendary Bologna-built motorcycle would be today if Ducati had never stopped building it.’\n\nWith the aim of reviving a legend and enhancing it with the technical specifications of a present day bike, Ducati’s designers incorporated several defining characteristics such as the fuel tank that is shaped in a way that remains true to the original teardrop design of the 1970’s model, an inscription on the filler cap that says ‘born in 1962’ and the distinctive round head lamp.\nClick here to read why the Scrambler should be your first Ducati.\n\nBack in the day, the Scrambler was a 250cc single-cylinder bike and now it runs on a fuel-injected oil and air cooled 800cc L-Twin engine that produces up to 75 horsepower.\nThe new Scrambler includes various modern features and fittings such as the two-channel ABS braking, LED powered headlights, and a USB charging port under the seat.\nShould you buy the Scrambler? Click here to find out.\n\nThe new Scrambler is highly customisable and is offered in four versions – red or yellow Icon, black-framed Classic, wild green Urban Endure and the black Full Throttle racer with yellow accents.\nThe Icon\nCharacterised by its comfortable riding position and steel teardrop tank with interchangeable aluminium side panels. Stand out features include the wide handlebar, the headlight with glass lens and LED guide-light, and the Dual Sports wheels. An aluminium finish for belt covers; the head guard and the interchangeable surround of the characteristic LCD instrument panel all enrich the style of the bike. Available in two colours: 62 Yellow and Ducati Red.\nPrice: RM57,333\n\nThe Urban Enduro (Wild Green)\nComes with a brown seat with a ribber design, lined with technical fabrics, offers first-class ergonomic comfort. The fork protectors, engine sump guard and the headlight grille protect the key parts of the bike on off-road sections, while the cross bar stiffens the wide handlebar. Additional reference to the off-road world include the high mudguard in plastic finer and the spoke wheels.\nPrice: RM64,888\n\nThe Full Throttle (Deep Black)\nInspired by the flat track world and makes clear references to the bikes that race around dirt ovals. It is equipped with a Termignoni racing exhaust homologated for road use, a seat designed for racing and black side panels with dedicated graphics. The low tapered handlebar and the short front mudguard add to the distinctive features of the Scrambler Full Throttle, destined for those who want a bike perfect for every-day use but without compromising on racing style.\nPrice: RM64,888\n\nThe Classic Version (Orange Sunshine)\nAimed at those who appreciate attention to detail and the 1970s style, but do not want to compromise on riding pleasure and the functionality of a modern bike. It is characterised by unique, refined details such as the aluminium front and rear mudguards, the spoke wheels and the brown seat with diamond-shaped inserts.\nPrice: RM64,888\n\nOur brothers at Bikes Republic have ridden the new Scrambler in Thailand, read about it here. \nMore information at Facebook.com/DucatiMY or Facebook.com/ScramblerDucatiMalaysia.

        "motogp\nYamaha\nYZ450F\nyzf-m1 \n\nEvolution of the Species – Yamaha YZF-M1 and YZ450F \n\n\nPosted on August 22, 2013 by eddy \n\n\nThe Yamaha YZ450F and YZR-M1 motorcycles are the pinnacle of Yamaha’s engineering development in the quest for victory on and off road in the global Grand Prix Championships. Whilst the current machines are both developed under the same design philosophy it is rare to ever see them together. Yamaha Racing took this unique opportunity to photograph the thoroughbreds side by side.\nThe machines are testimony to Yamaha’s ‘family’ approach to motorcycle development with shared principles and philosophy in design producing very different machines from a single source. Cutting edge technical partners are also shared between the two motorcycle development paths, Akrapovic for example has proved to be the best possible performance partner in developing exhaust systems for both the YZR-M1 and the YZ450F.  \n\nWhilst the dirt and the tarmac require very different machines to be competitive Yamaha retains the same philosophy of development in both areas, exemplifying the company’s spirit of development in the quest to create not only Championship dominating machines but also innovation for the customers of the future.\nThe 2013 YZR-M1, the M1 standing for ‘Mission One’, is the latest incarnation of an incredible machine that first broke cover in 2002 as MotoGP made the move from 500cc bikes.\nYamaha’s design philosophy has continued to move forward and evolve at the cutting edge of design off-road, most notably with some serious ‘forward’ thinking. When the current engine design development reached its limits Yamaha stepped outside the box and made a bold move. A revolutionary design change saw rearward and backward facing cylinders move the mass centralization, bringing the heaviest part of the bike closer to the middle for flickability.\n\nThe development doesn’t stop in Japan; Yamaha is very flexible in its approach to the advancement of the YZ off-road machines. A partnership with Michele Rinaldi in Italy started in 1992 has earned numerous victories and consistently class leading bikes. In 1995 the Yamaha Rinaldi Research and Development program (YRRD) was founded, developing race-winning parts for the then two-stroke machines. Working to maximise the regulations in the racing class that opened up different possibilities for development, Rinaldi were able to develop a completely new crankcase for the YZ450F, gaining valuable performance benefits at the track during the 2001 season.\nThe collaboration to develop race-winning machines delivered Yamaha the first ever four-stroke world title in 1999 with Andrea Bartolini and is further exemplified by Stefan Everts total domination over six seasons from 2001 to 2006, including four back to back YZ450FM titles. Everts has since been joined by David Philippaerts who stormed to Championship victory in 2008 on the YZ450F.\n\nYamaha’s cutting edge design philosophy in racing remains very much focused on benefit not just on track but for future customers on the road. The OWP3 M1 engine developed for the 2004 MotoGP season featured the crossplane crankshaft for the first time. Valentino Rossi won the opening race with the bike at Welkom in South Africa, going on to win the title with a further eight victories. The MotoGP legend would cement the M1’s place in history with a further three premier class world titles. Current world champion Jorge Lorenzo would then add another two titles to this, giving Yamaha six MotoGP titles in the last ten years. Between them they helped Yamaha make history, taking the triple crown of rider, team and manufacturer titles for three consecutive years from 2008 to 2010.\nThe YZR-M1’s technology has filtered to Yamaha’s production machines and the YZF-R1 appeared in 2009 with the crossplane crankshaft technology. American rider Ben Spies took Yamaha’s first World Superbike Championship victory with the new R1 in the same year, crowning the development journey from MotoGP prototype in 2004 to production dominance in 2009.\nAdvertisements",

        "Race \n\nMSS Champion Assist Aspiring Riders Of “PADU” An Initiative By Ministry Of Youth And Sports Malaysia \n\n\nPosted on December 19, 2014December 19, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\n\nSubang Jaya, 18 December 2014 – It was the fifth day of the motorsports development program by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Malaysia (KBS) alongside PB2R Racing, Pitrides and Malaysian Riders under the flagship of PADU (Program Angkat dan Upaya); which was an initiative by none other than Yang Berhormat Tuan Haji Khairy Jamaluddin. The program which was created with the focus of bringing out the potential of some selected “high risk” youths is now coming to the end of it’s stage following from the program launch in November this year.\n\n\n\nUnder the automotive segment of PADU program, some five young participants were given a chance to experience a short course on motorsports following from their interest towards the subject and their real life activity on the road mainly on motorcycles. The youths involved in the program already completed some specific activities that sees them executing a professional fitness training, communication skills and the all important advance riding program. With the five selected teenagers around 16 year of age currently work their understanding towards a proper motorcycle riding aspects; they were given an opportunity to spend an evening of training with a Malaysian Super Series 2014 champion from the category of supersports (600cc motorcycles). The 24 years old Bike Art Racing Team rider; Md. Muzakkir Mohamed who clinched the championship in MSS 2014 made his appearance during the motorcycle training to share some of his experience and insight with the program participants on how to prepare themselves in the motorsports industry.\n\n\n\nMuzakkir then proceed to assist them on how to properly ride a racing bike on a race track while overlooking at each of the participants ability to ride from the trackside. The 22-year old assistance towards the program was aimed at giving the participating “high risk” youths a better connection and relation between their own life and the MSS champion’s past life prior to his racing career. This gives the boys an opportunity to re-think of their future and their goals with hope that it can inflict a wave of change to themselves. In a short interview with Md. Muzakkir during the training session, he spoken of how these boys were lucky to be given such opportunity and how the PADU program may be a way to act as an extra catalyst towards creating a better motorsports culture here in Malaysia. “I surely hope that the program shall continue further in the upcoming years to come, because changes is hard to conceive and it is a long process especially when it comes to these boys lifestyle and surroundings” says Md. Muzakkir on his personal reflection towards the current social situation among the Malaysian youths.\n\n\n\nThe motorsports development program under the flagship of PADU will continue it’s progress for the five selected participants with the final round of the training which will be held at the Elite Speedway Circuit of USJ on the 22nd of December 2014.\n\n\nAdvertisements",

        "150cc\nCB150R StreetFire\nHonda \n\n2013 All new Honda CB150R StreetFire – Trellis frame beautiful machine \n\n\nPosted on November 1, 2012August 2, 2015 by eddy \n\n\nHonda CB150R StreetFire\nFinally, the Trellis frame Honda has come out after about a year of rumors and denial about it in the webspace. It is named Honda CB150R StreetFire and has just recently unveiled in JMCS (Jakarta Motorcycle Show). This trellis frame for a Honda with 150cc engine is quite rare since Honda prefer to use the diamond type chassis (or Deltabox) for its bike. This implemention of diamond type can be look at the NSR150RR and CBR150R bike. This time Honda seems to go further and use a beautiful Trellis frame for its naked CB150R.  \n\nThe web of the Trellis frame of this CB150R is nicely designed and properly sized so that it won’t look too big or too thin for the overall stance of the bike. The Trellis frame is well exposed for the riders to appreciate the machine with its compact structure and added strength. The overall design of this bike works well and matched each other perfectly, from the headlamp, side half-fairing, radiator, wheel and the use of Pro-link suspension. BTW, it is also equipped with the fuel-efficient PGM-FI fuel injection system.\n\nAs you can see above, this CB150R StreetFire features the proven Pro-link suspension setup that should provide better shock absorbing for better handling and corner taking. The design of this Pro-link suspension itself is a really nice view to see when you get near the bike. And with Pro-link suspension, it means that it gets monoshock type rear suspension. It would be much better if it is equipped with the much loved elf-Honda ProArm.\n\nThe engine case, front sprocket protector and front footrest are looking beautiful in this picture. Everything is perfect and compliments each other. This CB150R StreetFire is definitely one the nicest naked 150cc bike I have ever seen and this time Honda doesn’t dissappoint. I’m ready to show the money if this bike ever make it to Malaysia.\n\nYou might want to ask what is the price and when will it come to Malaysia. The answer for both question is, I don’t know. But, I’ll keep you updated as soon as I get the info.\nvia: TMCBlog and thank to Pengecat Bintang for sharing the pic on the MM FB page\nAdvertisements",

The event itself has a long tradition and is one of the most important in Europe, even if doesn’t count for any official championship.\nSince last year, when Rok was among rookies and took penultimate position in rankings, he improved dramatically. In just one year he climbed form the bottom, to the very top in his class.  Rok and his KTM 125 Duke put on a fantastic show which was a result of a hard training program. Rok was training last days before the event without any mercy to his body and KTM stunt machine, but the final result paid for everything when he stepped on the top of the podium.\nHis comment after the event was full of positivism: ‘This victory mean a lot to me, since the competition was very hard and already a small mistake would cost me valuable points. To win among the juniors who ride on such high level I had to show all my skills in 4 minute show, where I put numerous tricks, combined with flawless performance and connected them with my recognizable and unique riding style’.\nNext opportunity to show the stunting world his mixture of elegance and aggressive riding style will be in France on the Stunt Bike show 2011 in September , where Rok will try to win the 125 cc class with his loyal KTM Duke. After a superb win at the last year event in scooter class, the goal is now to prove his talent also on the motorbike.\nFOTO: Gémesi Balázs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisements",

How do you feel the first race weekend at Qatar was for Bridgestone?\n\n“The Qatar circuit is a difficult venue for tyre development due to its low grip, high abrasion levels and cool track temperatures. Considering the difficult track conditions, I felt it was a positive debut for our 2014 specification tyres and I think the inclusion of the soft compound rear slick added another dimension to the action, particularly in qualifying. The whole race weekend was extremely competitive, with the top half of the field separated by less than a second in almost every session and the race itself was also highly entertaining. In QP2 the lap time difference from first place to twelfth was only 0.65 seconds which was an unbelievable result, and this was a good indication that the riders have now worked out how to get maximum performance out of our 2014 specification tyres.\n\nThere is always an initial period during the pre-season when everyone has to adapt to the new tyres they will be using for the upcoming season, but I think the performances we saw in Qatar are evidence that the hard work put in by the teams and riders testing tyres in pre-season paid off.”\n\nThe soft compound rear slick which was only available to the Ducati and Open-class riders at Qatar helped create exciting qualifying sessions, but did many riders use it for the race?  \n\n\n“The soft compound rear slick was chosen by seven riders for the race, including all of the riders on the Honda RCV1000R. Both Scott Redding and Nicky Hayden – who finished in seventh and eighth place respectively – managed to set a fastest race lap only 0.8 seconds slower than the best time in the race on the soft compound rear, and on average were about 1.5 seconds per lap slower over the race distance than the leading pack. If you see the sector times, the Open-class riders on the soft rear slick were very close in the first three sectors, and only lacked compared to the Factory bikes in the last sector where engine power is the most influential factor. I was happy to see such a positive result from the riders using the soft compound rear slick at Qatar.”\n\nThe hard compound rear tyre was selected by just one rider for the race, Marc Marquez who ended up winning the race. What advantage does this option offer over the medium compound rear slick which was used by most of the riders on Sunday?\n\n“Tyre choice often comes down to the rider’s personal preference and how they can maximise the different advantages each option provides. When he tried the hard compound rear slick in FP4, Marc felt that this option offered consistent performance and gave better grip from the centre section of the tyre, which helps provide good drive out of the corners. The more consistent performance and drive grip obviously worked well for Marc’s riding style and helped him win the race. In comparison, the medium compound rear slick offered a bit better warm-up performance which would benefit riders in the opening couple of laps of the race at the expense of slightly less durability. It was pleasing to see that both of our rear slick options were viable race options at Qatar and we expect this trend to continue for the rest of the season.” \nAdvertisements",

        "motogp \n\nRound 8 Assen MotoGP: Marquez blows away the field in fantastic flag-to-flag Dutch TT – 1st Marcquez, 2nd Dovizioso, 3rd Pedrosa \n\n\nPosted on June 29, 2014June 29, 2014 by eddy \n\n\n\nDutch TT at Assen was an eventful flag-to-flag contest, with a wet track at the start of the race rapidly drying over the twenty-six laps, but in the end there was no stopping Repsol Honda’s Marc Marquez who adapted best to the changing conditions for his eighth consecutive victory in 2014.\nMarquez traded the race lead with Ducati’s Andrea Dovizioso in the early stages of the race while on wet tyres, before the leading pair swapped bikes on lap six and headed out of pit lane on slick tyres to resume their battle. Marquez made the race-winning pass on Dovizioso on the fifteenth lap and then upped the pace – almost setting a new race lap record on lap 19 – to eventually take the chequered flag 6.714 seconds ahead of Dovizioso who claimed an excellent second place. Dani Pedrosa ensured two Repsol Honda’s made the podium by seizing third place.\nRain fell leading up to, and for the first few laps of the race but once it stopped the track dried extremely quickly at which point the riders on slicks were able to lap much quicker than those still on wet tyres. By the eighth lap all the riders that started on wet tyres had changed to slicks to take advantage of the improving track surface. Twenty-one riders started the race on the soft compound wet tyres front and rear with only two riders; Pramac Racing’s Yonny Hernandez and Paul Bird Motorsport’s Broc Parkes starting the race on the soft compound slick tyres front and rear. The slick tyre options that were used on the riders’ spare bikes after they changed bikes for the dry conditions were the extra-soft and soft compound front slick, and the soft and medium compound rear.\nMarquez has amassed 200 championship points courtesy of his flawless win record, while Pedrosa and Movistar Yamaha MotoGP’s Valentino Rossi are joint-second in the standings with 128 points each.  \nShinji Aoki – Manager, Bridgestone Motorcycle Tyre Development Department\n“The variable weather certainly made for an exciting race, but in the end Marc showed the same impressive performance so congratulations to him and Repsol Honda on another superb performance. Today was quite tricky for the riders and teams as conditions changed quickly leading up to the race which meant final decisions on race tyre choice were made just moments before the race . Almost every rider made the decision to start on wet tyres before switching to slicks, and the pace that some of the riders were able to set on slick tyres as the track dried out was very impressive. I am pleased with how both our specifications of tyres performed today in what were challenging conditions.”\nMarc Marquez, Repsol Honda – Race Winner\n“Today was incredible, before the race I was quite nervous because these are the conditions nobody wants, as it’s hard to know the best strategy. We started on wet tyres even though we knew that after six or so laps the track would dry. After I swapped bikes I made a mistake which allowed Dovi to get past me, but then after a while I was able to catch Andrea as I had a better rhythm. After that it was a bit easier but I still had to keep my concentration to take the win.”\nBridgestone slick compounds available: Front: Extra-soft, Soft & Medium; Rear: Soft, Medium & Hard (Asymmetric)\nBridgestone wet tyre compounds available: Soft (Main), Hard (Alternative)\nWeather: Wet/Dry.
