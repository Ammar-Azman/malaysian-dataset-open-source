Video games can be efficient tools and useful resources for \\nlanguage learning. Considering this possibility, it is vital for the issue of \\nlearning a language, particularly English via playing video games to be \\ninvestigated. The topic of video games and language learning is examined \\nfrom the perspective of how such games can inspire players to learn \\nEnglish grammar, improve their English vocabulary and practice English \\ncommunication. For data collection of the present study, 100 Universiti \\nTeknologi MARA, Cawangan Pulau Pinang (UiTMCPP) students \\nparticipated in the questionnaire survey. It was discovered that 84% of the \\nrespondents agreed that they feel motivated to improve their English \\ngrammar when they do not understand the storylines of the video games, \\nperhaps because they need to know the grammar in order to understand the \\nstorylines in the games. 88% of them feel very motivated to learn new \\nEnglish vocabulary that they find in video games. Clearly, playing video \\ngames can contribute to positive effects on the students’ English language \\nlearning. The results of this study can support the objectives of this research \\npertaining to language learning through games. Most respondents \\napparently have positive perception towards video games as reliable \\nsources of motivation in learning, improving and practicing English. \\nBesides, they also seem to have positive experiences in learning and \\nimproving their English in the contexts of autonomous learning and social \\ninteractions while playing video games.  \\n \\nKeywords: Video games, grammar, vocabulary, communication, language \\nlearning \\n \\nAbstrak: Memandangkan teknologi telah digunakan secara meluas dalam \\nkehidupan kebanyakan orang pada masa kini, bermain permainan video \\ntidak dapat dinafikan dianggap sebagai aktiviti yang digemari ramai. \\nPermainan video boleh menjadi alat yang efektif dan sumber berguna untuk \\npembelajaran bahasa. Berdasarkan kemungkinan ini, isu pembelajaran \\nbahasa, terutamanya Bahasa Inggeris dengan bermain permainan video \\nadalah penting untuk diterokai. Topik permainan video dan pembelajaran \\nbahasa dikaji dari perspektif bagaimana permainan sebegini boleh memberi \\ninspirasi kepada pemain untuk mempelajari tatabahasa Bahasa Inggeris, \\nmeningkatkan perbendaharaan kata mereka dan mempraktikkan \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoraziah Mohd Amin & Mohd Saifulnizam Abu Bakar, Sains Insani  2022, Volume 07 No 1 : 51-60 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n52 \\n\\n\\n\\nkomunikasi Bahasa Inggeris. Untuk pengumpulan data kajian ini, 100 \\npelajar Universiti Teknologi MARA, Cawangan Pulau Pinang (UiTMCPP) \\ntelah mengambil bahagian dalam tinjauan soal selidik. Didapati bahawa \\n84% daripada responden bersetuju bahawa mereka berasa bermotivasi \\nuntuk meningkatkan tatabahasa bahasa Inggeris mereka apabila mereka \\ntidak memahami jalan cerita permainan video, memandangkan mereka \\nperlu mengetahui tatabahasa untuk memahami jalan cerita dalam permainan \\ntersebut. 88% daripada mereka berasa sangat bermotivasi untuk \\nmempelajari perbendaharaan kata bahasa Inggeris baharu yang mereka \\ntemui dalam permainan video yang dimain. Jelas sekali, bermain permainan \\nvideo boleh menyumbang kepada kesan positif terhadap pembelajaran \\nBahasa Inggeris pelajar. Hasil kajian ini dapat menyokong objektif kajian \\nyang berkaitan dengan pembelajaran bahasa melalui permainan. \\nKebanyakan responden nampaknya mempunyai persepsi positif terhadap \\npermainan video sebagai sumber motivasi yang boleh dipercayai dalam \\npembelajaran, penambahbaikan dan latihan Bahasa Inggeris. Selain itu, \\nmereka juga dilihat mempunyai pengalaman positif dalam pembelajaran \\ndan meningkatkan bahasa Inggeris mereka dalam konteks pembelajaran \\nautonomi dan interaksi sosial semasa bermain permainan video. \\n \\nKata kunci: Permainan video, tatabahasa, perbendaharaan kata, \\nkomunikasi, pembelajaran bahasa \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nIntroduction \\n\\n\\n\\nBackground of the Study \\nAccording to Demirbilek, Yilmaz and Tamer \\n\\n\\n\\n(2010), since game-based language learning is \\nfundamentally different from conventional book-\\nbased learning, a range of research avenues can be \\nexplored further. As for the present study, the type of \\ngame-based language learning is referred to using \\nvideo games in learning English and it is discussed \\nfrom the perspective of the influence of video games \\nin motivating the players to learn English grammar, \\nimprove their English vocabulary and practice their \\nEnglish communication. Communicating with and \\nthrough video games has become a regular, language-\\nmediated occurrence and has become a source of \\ninformal language learning for millions of players \\naround the globe (Chik, 2014). deHaan, Reed and \\nKuwada (2010) conducted a study on a video game \\nentitled, “Parappa the Rapper” and they discovered \\nthat the players’ attention was split between game \\nrules and the words of the game narrative. Clearly, \\nvideo games are able to catch language learners’ \\nattention in learning a language. Besides, Hitosugi, \\nSchmidt and Hayashi (2014) conducted a study on \\nretention of vocabulary after playing the video game, \\n“Food Force” and it was found that their study’s \\nparticipants retained the vocabulary from the game \\nbetter as compared to their text book. Also, the results \\n\\n\\n\\nof the study of Chen and Yang (2013) indicate that \\nadventure video games like “BONE” may supply \\nvaluable insights to help university students improve \\ntheir learning motivation and English vocabulary as it \\nwas found that the students deemed the game useful in \\nenhancing their language skills and motivation. Based \\non these discoveries, it is evident that playing video \\ngames has the potential to generate motivation in \\nindividuals learning a language and therefore, the \\nissue of how they can be motivated to learn some \\ncomponents of language such as grammar and \\nvocabulary is fundamental to be unraveled. \\n\\n\\n\\n Problem Statement \\nAccording to Reinhardt (2017), it was once \\n\\n\\n\\nsuggested that games only were attractive to sub-sets \\nof learners who are not part of the mainstream \\ncommunity. However, since video games are common \\nin people’s lives nowadays, it is therefore crucial to \\ninvestigate what benefits the games can offer to their \\nplayers. Numerous claims are made about the impact \\nof games on affective factors such as anxiety and \\nmotivation, but few studies have specifically explored \\nthe effects of digital games on second-language \\nacquisition (Shahriarpoura & Kafi, 2014). Realizing \\nsuch lack of studies on the impact of video games on \\nsecond language learning, the execution of the present \\nstudy is then important to fill the gap in the literature. \\nAccording to Rankin, Gold and Gooch (2006), even \\nthough video games have received many criticisms for \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoraziah Mohd Amin & Mohd Saifulnizam Abu Bakar, Sains Insani  2022, Volume 07 No 1 : 51-60 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n53 \\n\\n\\n\\nbeing mindless entertainment without any educational \\nvalue or content, it is argued that video games model \\nsuccessful learning practices (Gee 2004). Chen and \\nYang (2013) claim that some research indicated that \\ncomputer simulation games could offer context-rich, \\ncognitively challenging virtual language learning \\nsettings. However, it is uncertain if all these claims \\nare also supported by UiTMCPP students that play \\nvideo games and if they also experience similar \\neffects of playing video games, and thus, their \\nopinions are vital to be collected through the present \\nstudy. Reinhardt (2017) claims that many \\nobservations of the early computer‐assisted language \\nLearning (CALL) researchers are still valid today and \\nhe gives the example of Baltra (1990) who discovered \\nthat, for some reasons, adventure and simulation \\ngames particularly could encourage language \\nlearning: 1) they combined all four language skills, 2) \\ntheir objective was not to teach vocabulary or \\ngrammar but instead to foster goal-oriented activities \\ninvolving effective use of language, and, 3) they \\nintroduced discovery-based pedagogical methods that \\ncould stimulate collaboration and interaction between \\nstudents. As grammar is regarded as the fundamental \\narea of language and that it is closely related to \\nvocabulary (Cook, 2011), based on Baltra’s (1990) \\nfindings, it is important to examine how playing video \\ngames can specifically motivate language learning in \\nterms of grammar, vocabulary and communicative \\npractices, and to discover if the findings are still true \\ntoday as claimed by Reinhardt (2017) by conducting \\nthe present study. \\n\\n\\n\\nResearch Objectives \\n\\n\\n\\nThe study was conducted to achieve these objectives:  \\n1) to investigate how playing video games \\nmotivates UiTMCPP students to learn English \\ngrammar. \\n\\n\\n\\n2) to investigate how playing video games \\nmotivates UiTMCPP students to improve English \\nvocabulary. \\n\\n\\n\\n3) to investigate how playing video games \\nmotivates UiTMCPP students to practice their English \\ncommunication. \\n\\n\\n\\nResearch Questions \\n\\n\\n\\nThe research questions of the present study are as \\nfollows: \\n1) How does playing video games motivate \\n\\n\\n\\nUiTMCPP students to learn English grammar? \\n\\n\\n\\n2) How does playing video games motivate \\nUiTMCPP students to improve English vocabulary? \\n\\n\\n\\n3) How does playing video games motivate \\nUiTMCPP students to practice their English \\ncommunication? \\n\\n\\n\\nLiterature Review \\n\\n\\n\\nVideo Games and their Features \\nAccording to Tavinor (2008) video games are \\n\\n\\n\\ndistinctively referred to as “computer games”, \\n“electronic games”, and even “digital entertainments” \\nand that terms cannot be considered synonymous. \\nEspocito (2005) claims that a video game is a game \\nthat is played by audio-visual equipment and which is \\nestablished from a story. Hardware, graphical \\ncomplexity, human-computer interface, target \\naudience, concept, and player interaction can make \\neach video game different from each other (deHaan, \\nReed & Kuwada, 2010). Wood et al. (2004) define the \\nfeatures of video games that make them attractive to \\nplayers. Among the features proposed by Wood et al. \\n(2004) are; 1) sound (i.e., sound effects, talking \\ncharacters and background music), 2) graphics (i.e., \\nhigh-quality realistic or cartoon-style illustrations and \\nfull motion video (FMV), 3) background and setting \\n(i.e., whether the game is based on a narrative, film, \\nor television program, and the use of realistic or \\nfictional settings), 4) Game dynamics (i.e., \\nexploration of new areas, elements of surprise, \\nfulfilling a quest, skill development, AI interactions, \\ngathering things, avoiding things, surviving against \\nthe odds, shooting, different ending alternatives, \\ndifferent types of transport, deciphering puzzles, \\nbeating times, cheats/Easter eggs, resolving time \\nconstraint problems, constructing environments, \\nmapping, and linear/non-linear game format, and 5) \\nwinning and losing features (i.e., the potential to earn \\nor lose points, obtaining bonuses, needing to start \\nlevel again, and capability to save regularly. It is \\nargued by Enayat and Haghighatpasand (2017), in \\nterms of learning a language through video games, the \\nutilization of various modalities of presentation, such \\nas movies, music, meaningful conversations, and \\nnative pronunciation of words that are commonly used \\nin various settings, may all help with vocabulary \\ndevelopment. In a study conducted by Enayat and \\nHaghighatpasand (2017) on a video game, “The Secret \\nof Monkey Island– Special Edition”, it was concluded \\nthat one of the features of gaming is the frequency of \\nthe appearance of new words, which aids learners’ \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoraziah Mohd Amin & Mohd Saifulnizam Abu Bakar, Sains Insani  2022, Volume 07 No 1 : 51-60 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n54 \\n\\n\\n\\ncomprehension of the uses of words in various \\nsituations and meaningful phrases. Such a repeated \\nexposure may ensure the occurrence of vocabulary \\nlearning and maximize the probability that a word’s \\nmeaning will be transferred from the short-term to \\nlong-term memory. Besides, Enayat and \\nHaghighatpasand (2017) believe that subtitles are an \\nimportant element of “The Secret of Monkey Island– \\nSpecial Edition”, since they assist learners in \\nvisualizing the words they hear. \\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits of Language Learning through Video \\nGames \\n\\n\\n\\nThe distinctions between games and other \\nmultimedia should be the emphasis of second \\nlanguage study, education, and design (deHaan, Reed \\n& Kuwada, 2010). To provide both entertainment and \\ntraining to the player, video games include a variety \\nof technological and educational features (deHaan, \\nReed & Kuwada, 2010). Rankin, Gold and Gooch \\n(2006) claim that computer games mimic the \\nexperiential approach to second-language learning by \\noffering an immersive learning experience. Ang and \\nZaphiris (2006) found that video games contributed to \\nlanguage learning through the use repetition \\n(behavioral nature) as well as thought organization \\nand adaptation processes (constructivist nature). \\nEnayat and Haghighatpasand (2017) argue that the \\npossible impact of commercial adventure video games \\non learning a second language prompted a few \\nscholars to investigate it. For example, Miller and \\nHegelheimer (2006) explored the impact of playing \\n“The Sims” on L2 learners’ grammar and vocabulary \\nskills. The Sims is a computer adventure video game \\nthat allows players to experience the hardships of \\ndaily life via the characters of a family known as the \\nSims. The researchers discovered that the language \\nlearner’ knowledge of vocabulary had improved \\nsubstantially. The replication of the same study by \\nRanalli (2008) also revealed similar results. The study \\nof Vahdat and Behbahani (2013) reported that \\nlearning vocabulary is more beneficial through video \\ngames and that males are more inclined than females \\ntowards video game learning. It was found that the use \\nof vocabulary games and activities improves students’ \\nability to learn words, promotes student interaction \\nand enhances student motivation (Shahriarpour & \\nKafi, 2014). In a study conducted by Rankin, Gold \\nand Gooch (2006), it is posited that a video game, \\n“Ever Quest 2” offers a rich environment that is \\nsuitable for developing the vocabulary of ESL \\nstudents and “Ever Quest 2” also enhances the \\nstudents’ conversation skills. Turgut and Irgin (2009) \\nreported that video games are effective in in terms of \\n\\n\\n\\nlearning sub-skills, especially vocabulary and \\npronunciation. Baltra (1990) claims that adventure \\ngames are valuable tools for improving \\ncommunicative proficiency. Besides, computer \\nsimulation games may offer rich context and \\ncognitively engaging virtual language learning \\nsettings (Chen & Yang, 2013).  \\n\\n\\n\\nMotivation in Language Learning through Video \\nGames \\n\\n\\n\\nIt was discovered in the study of Chik (2011), that \\nthere were two categories of motivation that could \\nstimulate one’s language learning through gaming; 1) \\nthe need to advance in a game level influenced gamers \\nto be more aware of the English text in the game, and \\n2) games offered authentic platforms for \\ncommunication with other gamers in English. With \\nrespect to motivation generation from playing video \\ngames, the study of Shahriarpour and Kafi (2014) on \\ndigital games to develop learning English vocabulary \\nparticularly via video games discovered that digital \\ngames do improve the incentive of learners to learn, \\nand thereby change the direction from rote learning to \\nsubstantive learning and that the use of digital games \\nis one of the factors that makes learners excited and \\ninspired to learn language. Osma-Ruiz et. Al (2015) \\ndiscovered in their study that the integration of \\n“serious games” or, more accurately, “serious video \\ngames” into the teaching-learning process led \\nsignificantly to improving the enthusiasm of the \\nstudents and thus to promoting their further \\nparticipation in their own learning. In short, the \\nrespondents in the study of Osma-Ruiz et. Al (2015) \\nbelieve primarily that playing video games \\nsignificantly enhances their desire to learn English. \\nBado and Franklin (2014) investigated the impact of \\nplaying Trace Effects, an instructional adventure \\nvideo game. This adventure video game was created \\nby a group of EFL experts with the goal of teaching \\nAmerican English. The results of the investigation \\nrevealed that playing the game benefited the English \\nas Foreign Language (EFL) students in terms of \\nimproving their knowledge and understanding of \\nvocabulary and motivation in learning English. The \\nstudy of Chen and Yang (2013) on the influence of \\nadventure video game, “Bone” on English vocabulary \\nlearning uncovered positive outcome after the players, \\nEFL learners played the game extensively for six \\nweeks where they admitted that the game improved \\nthe range of their vocabulary as well as listening and \\nreading skills. In addition, it was also discovered that \\nthe game increased the learners’ motivation by \\nproviding them with a sense of accomplishment in \\nlearning. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoraziah Mohd Amin & Mohd Saifulnizam Abu Bakar, Sains Insani  2022, Volume 07 No 1 : 51-60 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n55 \\n\\n\\n\\nMethodology \\n\\n\\n\\nResearch Design \\nA quantitative, descriptive research design was \\n\\n\\n\\nchosen for the present study. This study did not employ \\nexperimental or lab research approach to investigate or \\nobserve how the respondents play video games in a \\ncontrolled environment but rather examining their \\nexperiences playing video games and learning English \\nthrough administering a pre-designed questionnaire.  \\n\\n\\n\\nRespondents \\nThis research was implemented at UiTMCPP and the \\n\\n\\n\\nsubjects of this research were 100 undergraduates who \\nwere in part five completing their Degree in Electrical \\nEngineering at the university. \\n\\n\\n\\nSampling Method \\n\\n\\n\\nThe method of purposive sampling was used to \\nobtain a sample of the research. This method which \\nbelongs to the category of non-probability sampling \\ntechnique, sampled some UiTMCPP students on the \\nbasis of their experience in playing video games. A few \\nfilter questions needed to be answered by the \\nrespondents first in order to sample them as qualified \\nrespondents and only those who played video games \\nwere selected. However, for additional data collection, \\nthe names of video games they played were asked to \\nconfirm that they knew about video games and they did \\nplay them.   \\n\\n\\n\\nInstrument \\nA questionnaire was chosen to be the instrument for \\n\\n\\n\\ncollecting data from the respondents. The items in the \\nquestionnaire were developed by partially adopting the \\nstudies of Vahdat and Behbahani (2013), and Chik \\n(2011). Vahdat and Behbahani (2013) devised a \\nquestionnaire to determine their participants’ experience \\nof learning a language via video games. The study of \\nChik (2011), employed a qualitative design by applying \\nnarrative approach and content analysis. The transcribed \\nresponses from the participants of this study such as “I \\nuse the dictionary when I find new vocabulary in the \\ngames” (p. 35) and “Although the English I used was not \\ngood, but it was an opportunity to chat with foreigners in \\nEnglish” (p. 36) were referred to for designing the \\nquestionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 20 \\nquestions (excluding demographic and filter questions) \\nwhich were self-reporting statements related to the \\nobjectives of this study. Each item in the questionnaire \\nwas measured in terms of the respondents’ levels of \\nagreement or disagreement with the statements by using \\nLikert scale; Strongly disagree= 1, Disagree= 2, \\n\\n\\n\\nUndecided= 3, Agree= 4, Strongly agree= 5.  \\n\\n\\n\\nData Collection Method \\nAn online survey was conducted where the \\n\\n\\n\\nrespondents had to answer questions by clicking the \\nGoogle form link given to them. This online survey \\nmethod was chosen due to its low cost and flexibility. By \\nusing this option, the researchers could quickly access \\nthe e sample without time or location constraints. There \\nwas no pre-test or post-test conducted and the data was \\ncollected in one phase only.  \\n\\n\\n\\nData Analysis Method \\nThe main advantage of data analysis is that it helps to \\n\\n\\n\\nensure that the data collected is simplified and reduced, \\nwhile at the same time producing results that may then \\nbe measured using quantitative techniques. As for the \\npresent study, the data obtained was input on SPSS for \\nnumerical data generation and analysis. \\n\\n\\n\\nFindings and Analyses \\n\\n\\n\\nDemographic Video Game Playing Profiles of the \\nRespondents \\n\\n\\n\\n \\nFigure 1.

Based on the data \\nobtained, the mean and standard deviation for item 15 \\nare 4.17 and 0.652 respectively where 62% of the \\nrespondents believe that they can make their English \\nmore fluent when communicating with other players \\nwhile playing video games. For item 16, 61% (M= \\n4.00, SD= 0.739) of the respondents agreed that after \\nplaying video games, they usually feel motivated to \\ncommunicate in English. For items 17-20, the \\nmajority of the respondents selected the response \\noption, “agree” with the percentages of 44% (M= \\n3.83, SD= 1.006), 52% (M= 4.12, SD= 0.820), 55% \\n(M= 4.05, SD= 0.757), and 58% (M= 4.17, SD= \\n0.652) respectively. \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nFirstly, it can be deduced from the results that \\ninteresting animations in video games make \\nremembering the grammar used in the sentences \\nmentioned in video games easier. In terms of \\nvocabulary, most of the respondents have the idea that \\nthey feel motivated to expand their English \\nvocabulary because they need to communicate with \\nother players in English and thus, they need to know \\nmany words. Based on the results, obviously, being \\nable to interact well with other players and to \\ncomprehend the storyline in the games are the \\nmotivational drivers in their vocabulary expansion. As \\nfor practicing communicative English, being corrected \\nwhen using English while interacting with other \\nplayers can motivate the respondents to learn English. \\nIt is probable that positive corrective feedback from \\nother players can contribute to positive feelings in the \\nrespondents. As indicated by most of the respondents, \\noral and auditory skills of English communication can \\nbe improved by playing video games. Also, the \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNoraziah Mohd Amin & Mohd Saifulnizam Abu Bakar, Sains Insani  2022, Volume 07 No 1 : 51-60 \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n59 \\n\\n\\n\\nrespondents in majority believe that they feel \\nmotivated to improve their confidence level in English \\ncommunication when they see other players speak \\nbetter English than them. This apparently shows that \\nexternal motivation in the form of other players’ \\nproficiency can stimulate one to improve their \\nEnglish. Most respondents claim that they feel \\nmotivated to improve their English when playing \\nvideo games so that they can communicate fluently \\nwith other players. Thus, communicative fluency is \\nclearly a motivational driver in improving their \\nEnglish. \\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion \\nIn summary, playing video games is viewed \\n\\n\\n\\npositively by the respondents with respect to the players’ \\nlearning, improving and practicing their English. Also, \\nobviously, video games can be considered as useful tools \\nin facilitating English learning in terms of their visual \\nand audio features such as graphics or animations, \\nstorylines, theme songs and so on. Besides, individual \\nlearning of English by referring to some sources such as \\ntranslation devices, collaborative learning of English can \\nalso occur when video game players communicate with \\nother players. In conclusion, video games apart from \\nbeing tools for entertainment can also be learning aids \\nparticularly in generating incidental learning and \\ntherefore, video games should not be perceived as \\nmerely a non-beneficial activity. \\n\\n\\n\\nAcknowledgment \\nThe researchers would like to thank UiTMCPP for its \\n\\n\\n\\nsupport to academics in conducting research concerning \\ntheir related field and financial opportunities in \\ndisseminating research findings and sharing them either \\nlocally or internationally. \\n\\n\\n\\nReferences \\nAng, C.
