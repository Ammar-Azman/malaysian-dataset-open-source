Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019 by some Muslims polarized Sri Lanka and contributed to the compromise of the country\u2019s security. Sri Lankan Muslims often claim they are a peaceful community and thus have no serious interests in violent mobilization. But the evidence would basically contradict Muslims\u2019 claim of a peace-loving community. The Easter Sunday terrorist attacks did not take place in any vacuum. This paper will situate some key developments in the violent mobilization of Sri Lanka during the war against the LTTE.

not to kill, the first of the religion's five precepts, is central to the ethos of the different Buddhist traditions. In the past decade, however, a surprising amount of popular and scholarly discussion on the subject of killing and Buddhism-from Slavoj \u017di\u017eek's commentaries, to Michael Jerryson's essay 'Monks with Guns' in Aeon-has stressed how violent Buddhists themselves have historically proven to be. Being what they are, some human beings will choose to kill, for better and for worse reasons. And many of them might happen to have been raised in one of the various Buddhist traditions, from South and Southeast Asia, to North, Central and East Asia, and, increasingly since the 1970s, in many Western countries as well. Unsurprisingly, then, there are numerous cases of cultural Buddhists killing for the usual reasons. Animals, especially in the high Tibetan plateau, as elsewhere, have been a staple source of sustenance. Sometimes, defensive wars have been engaged to save a city or state from foreign incursion. Buddhist women have chosen to abort unwanted foetuses. There is also textual record, stretching back to the early Buddhist period, of suicide being condoned in rare cases where its agent possesses remarkable properties of wisdom, is incurably ill, and is, in early Buddhist terms, an arhat (an 'awakened one'). These cases of suicide, but notably not others, were exonerated from moral blame by no less an authority than the Buddha himself.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 94149624, "asset_id": 90643800, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158930035, "first_name": "Bikram", "last_name": "Lamba", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BikramLamba", "display_name": "Bikram Lamba", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BikramLamba?f_ri=105857", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/17ccc2c4776bb55151f7851695729ca3?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1222, "name": "Buddhist Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Philosophy?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 105857, "name": "Conflict Resolution Sri Lanka ethnic conflict Buddhm and War Buddhist Attitude to Social Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_Sri_Lanka_ethnic_conflict_Buddhm_and_War_Buddhist_Attitude_to_Social_Violence?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 524606, "name": "Domestic Viloence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Viloence?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1129268, "name": "Rohingya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rohingya?f_ri=105857"}]}, {"id": 85864368, "title": "Frontline informality", "created_at": "2022-08-29T21:25:57.448-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/85864368/Frontline_informality?f_ri=105857", "dom_id": "work_85864368", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 90438844, "asset_id": 85864368, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37232758, "first_name": "Srisompob", "last_name": "Jitpiromsri", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SrisompobJitpiromsri", "display_name": "Srisompob Jitpiromsri", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SrisompobJitpiromsri?f_ri=105857", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37232758/33844320/29988687/s65_srisompob.jitpiromsri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37778, "name": "Law Enforcement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_Enforcement?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 515939, "name": "Backup", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Backup?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 84658562, "title": "Peaceful Thai, Violent Malay(-Muslim): A Case Study of the \u201cProblematic\u201d Muslim citizens of Southern Thailand", "created_at": "2022-08-13T17:54:09.488-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/84658562/Peaceful_Thai_Violent_Malay_Muslim_A_Case_Study_of_the_Problematic_Muslim_citizens_of_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=105857", "dom_id": "work_84658562", "summary": "This paper tries to understand why the Malay-speaking Muslims of southern Thailand are viewed perpetual national security threats by looking at some deep-seated identity constructions that aligns Malay identity with violence and Thai identity with peace and patriotism.

Easter Sunday terrorist attacks in 2019 by some Muslims polarized Sri Lanka and contributed to the compromise of the country's security. Sri Lankan Muslims often claim they are a peaceful community and thus have no serious interests in violent mobilization. But the evidence would basically contradict Muslims' claim of a peace-loving community. The Easter Sunday terrorist attacks did not take place in any vacuum. This paper will situate some key developments in the violent mobilization of Sri Lanka during the war against the LTTE. The primary goal of such an attempt is to read the growing religious conservative and violent trends among Muslims between 1977 and 2009. In understanding the growing religious conservative trends, an understanding is attempted to situate a later propensity for violence within the community that would manifest itself with the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. Interviews were conducted with members of the Islamic Dawah organizations and Muslim youth who were formerly associated with violent groups in the Eastern Province to understand the ground reality. The period of 1977-2009 is important as the rise of religious conservatist influences in Sri Lanka mirrors the global transnational influences of Iran and Middle East Petro Dollars, especially Saudi Arabia. The article draws mainly on secondary sources. But to gain a better understanding of the ground reality, we spoke to a few Eastern Muslims between July 2016 and September 2021 at regular intervals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78882888, "asset_id": 68392463, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2215396, "first_name": "Amjad", "last_name": "Mohamed-Saleem", "domain_name": "exeter", "page_name": "AmjadMohamedSaleem", "display_name": "Amjad Mohamed-Saleem", "profile_url": "https://exeter.academia.edu/AmjadMohamedSaleem?f_ri=105857", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2215396/709048/880673/s65_amjad.mohamed-saleem.jpg"}, {"id": 37398172, "first_name": "Mohamed-Imtiyaz", "last_name": "Abdul-Razak", "domain_name": "temple", "page_name": "MohamedImtiyazAbdulRazak", "display_name": "Mohamed-Imtiyaz Abdul-Razak", "profile_url": "https://temple.academia.edu/MohamedImtiyazAbdulRazak?f_ri=105857", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37398172/10877535/12139171/s65_mohamed-imtiyaz.abdul-razak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52629, "name": "Political Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Identity?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 105857, "name": "Conflict Resolution Sri Lanka ethnic conflict Buddhm and War Buddhist Attitude to Social Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_Sri_Lanka_ethnic_conflict_Buddhm_and_War_Buddhist_Attitude_to_Social_Violence?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120972, "name": "Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 285718, "name": "Muslim Exclusion Identity Nationalism Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Exclusion_Identity_Nationalism_Violence?f_ri=105857"}, {"id": 831573, "name": "Muslim Identity Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Identity_Politics?f_ri=105857"}, {"id": 924737, "name": "Buddhist-Muslim Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist-Muslim_Relations?f_ri=105857"}, {"id": 1383784, "name": "Buddhist-Muslim Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist-Muslim_Conflict?f_ri=105857"}, {"id": 1625088, "name": "racial conflict in Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/racial_conflict_in_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=105857"}, {"id": 1863203, "name": "history of Sri lankan Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Sri_lankan_Muslims?f_ri=105857"}, {"id": 3812999, "name": "sri lankan muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/sri_lankan_muslims?f_ri=105857"}]}, {"id": 65209719, "title": "Introduction: Conflict in the Deep South of Thailand: Never-ending Stalemate?", "created_at": "2021-12-20T10:33:17.487-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/65209719/Introduction_Conflict_in_the_Deep_South_of_Thailand_Never_ending_Stalemate?f_ri=105857", "dom_id": "work_65209719", "summary": "The Introduction to this Special Issue lists the background, principal causes, possible future scenarios and potential solutions to the conflict in Thailand\u2019s Deep South.

However, the data reveals discrepancy between government policies on religious education and religious education textbooks used in schools. While diversity is mentioned in the constitution, textbooks show otherwise. The faith of majority, Theravada Buddhism and its teachings-are main content of the text books with minimally recognizing other faiths. The religious education textbooks introduce concepts of peaceful coexistence, reconciliation, and basic principles of human rights yet exclude narratives of those who subscribe to faith minorities. Schools run by minority groups, in this study, reveal to be accommodating to other faith groups by opening space for discussion, exposing students to different places of worships and celebrating diversity by facilitating different religious holiday's celebration.

Over 90% of the Thai population identify themselves as Buddhist, and while the constitution does not name Buddhism as the national religion, it does state that Buddhism is the religion \u201cwhich the majority of Thais have followed for a long time\u201d and shall be patronized and protected by the State (Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand 2007). However, given the recent scandals involving Buddhist monks such as the controversy surrounding Luang Poo Nen Kum, a monk who lives a luxurious life, travelling in private jets, has led the sacredness of the religion into question for some Thais. While some Thais remain adamant in their religious beliefs and dismiss these recent scandals as bad monks in an otherwise good religion and some have argued for reforms in the Sangha, others have decided to question the idea of religion altogether and have begun looking for alternatives. Furthermore, globalization and exposure to alternative ideas also mean that the Thai youth no longer have to accept Buddhism without questioning. They can choose an alternative religion, or no religion altogether. However, the idea of atheism \u2013 rejecting deities or religion altogether \u2013 is a concept that has yet to become popular in Thailand. This paper will aim to address whether there is the freedom or the opportunity for atheism to grow in Thailand. The paper will start by examining religious freedom in Thailand, both de jure- by looking at the constitution and related laws- as well as de facto- looking at actual practices by the Thai state that shows whether the Thai state favors Buddhism over other religion or those with no religion. Then it will look at whether the Thai State makes any assumptions about religion and non-religion. It will then compare Thailand to Denmark, a country with a similar constitution and laws regarding religion. This paper will also discuss challenges faced by any potential anti-religious movements in Thailand, such as the proposed Act to Patronize and Protect Buddhism.

Yet the significance of the military uniform can only be grasped if read against a performative concept of the gentlemanly state, emphasizing that the abstraction from violence is constitutive to military masculi- nities. Thus the powerful function of soldierly costume can be understood as one of demar- cating boundaries of gentlemanly statehood: dressed in military attire, the soldier is authorized to use \u2018civilized force\u2019. Based on this conceptual argument, I trace the uniform\u2019s imperial reconfigurations, before describing the manifold historical strands of meaning that have been woven into its contemporary fabric in Thailand. Exploring the gentlemanly con- notations attached to the soldiers\u2019 costume by girls in Thailand\u2019s southern provinces, I more- over argue that its favourable contours have to be read in light of military counterinsurgency practices that have intensified the vestimentary encoding of gendered, religious and ethnic difference. In this context, the military uniform has been attached to Thai notions of gentle- manly modernity, encompassing gentlemanly manners, light skin as well as fashionable progress. In conclusion I argue for broadening the feminist research agenda towards prac- tices of gentlemanly soldiering that work to codify and re-define its violent Other.", "downloadable_attachments":

It moves beyond the routine rounding up and interrogation of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d in two ways: first, by including a range of uncivil elements of Thai Buddhism, and second, by examining often ill-conceived Thai interference in Islamic matters. The article also poses questions about the \u201cusual suspects\u201d, beginning with a description of Islamic movements which contribute to an increasingly divided Islamic community less able to prevent and limit Islamic violence. The paper investigates the Islamic credentials of the insurgency and distinguishes between the presence of jihadi rhetoric with a developed jihadi rationale, a recent development in southern Thailand. The article argues for the localization of the global, a process which features local actors and agents that are informed by parochial and highly ethnocized version of Islam that is countering occasionally uncivil Buddhist opponents, as an approach for studying violence in the Thai south.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30306328, "asset_id": 2254860, "asset_type": "Work",

comments on conflict and its causes. His concern is seen to be to uncover the deep psychological roots of what manifests as social/political problems. He shows that conflicts are rooted in flawed perception, which includes prejudice and unhealthy mental propensities. How these arise is briefly discussed. Emotional attachment to \u201cviews\u201d is also often treated as causes of conflict. Ideologies and divisive notions such as race are to be counted among \u201cviews\u201d. Attachment to \u201cviews\u201d is also a result of misperception. Misperception, being ultimately akin to ignorance, allows greed and hate to rule our minds. Thus conflicts arise from the same roots as suffering. Just as suffering is curable, so is conflict, but, as long as mankind has the kind of consciousness it has, conflict will be difficult to avoid. Yet there is a firm belief in the possibility of a saner society through sustained moral education. It is possible to glean a number of \u201cinputs\u201d for such education and for conflict resolution from the ethical values of Buddhism and the overall Buddhist outlook. Some of these inputs are examined in the paper.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2496252, "asset_id": 518674, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 360226, "first_name": "Mahinda", "last_name": "Palihawadana", "domain_name": "sjp", "page_name": "MPalihawadana", "display_name": "Mahinda Palihawadana", "profile_url": "https://sjp.academia.edu/MPalihawadana?f_ri=105857", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/360226/99918/119540/s65_mahinda.palihawadana.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 105857, "name": "Conflict Resolution Sri Lanka ethnic conflict Buddhm and War Buddhist Attitude to Social Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_Sri_Lanka_ethnic_conflict_Buddhm_and_War_Buddhist_Attitude_to_Social_Violence?f_ri=105857", "nofollow": false}]}]
