The present expos\u00e9 surveys close to three centuries worth of references to Singapore and its adjacent straits in European printed materials in order to make the case for its visibility and significance in readership. Besides offering a categorization of the references at hand, it argues that several thematic impressions emerge: of danger, division, antiquity and concentration which would be reached by an interested and resourceful reader. These references point to public familiarity with Singapore which was dismissed by British colonial scholarship after 1819. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73561307, "asset_id": 59852981, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}, {"id": 58864254, "first_name": "Benjamin JQ", "last_name": "Khoo", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "BenjaminJQKhoo", "display_name": "Benjamin JQ Khoo", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/BenjaminJQKhoo?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58864254/110150687/99395338/s65_benjamin_jq.khoo.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1241, "name": "Knowledge Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_Management?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 7354, "name": "Early Modern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Europe?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 15812, "name": "Early Modern Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Intellectual_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 429524, "name": "History of Books, Printing, and Publishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Books_Printing_and_Publishing?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 21273653, "title": "Singapore's Historical Journey toward a Global Trading Hub An Introductory Overview", "created_at": "2016-01-30T19:06:07.122-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21273653/Singapores_Historical_Journey_toward_a_Global_Trading_Hub_An_Introductory_Overview?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_21273653", "summary": "Singapore's status as a trading hub is probably as old as the settlement itself. In earlier times its history was tightly knit to the development and prosperity of its port. Today's global trading hub, however, is broadly conditioned by its position within a global communications regime that includes various modes of transportation by sea, land and air, as well as electronic forms of communication such as telephony and the internet. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure are certainly prerequisites for success, but Singapore's rapid rise in becoming a global trading hub cannot be explained by these factors alone: the hub is backed by an array of industries that directly or indirectly support transport and trade at large, ranging from warehousing to finance and trade. All these activities, moreover, are regulated and driven by policies that have been carefully formulated and put into place over the past five decades. Then there is Singapore's greatest asset today: its people. In the context of this introduction, it is of course impossible to give a detailed or even comprehensive overview of the historical developments that have evolved and today underpin the global trading hub. What is possible, however, is to single out some of the developmental highlights as well as explain their historic relevance and interdependence. In the following sections I shall do so with an eye cast on history and chronological development as well as moving from the larger picture to the particular. As the SG50 celebrations move into the past, the Republic will begin to look toward 2019, the bicentennial of the British colonial settlement's founding. Like SG50, the bicentennial will offer a unique opportunity to look back and take stock, though the time horizon taken on during the bicentennial will be rolled back well beyond 1965 to the beginning of the 19 th century or perhaps even before. There will be a fresh, vigorous debate about what makes Singapore a special place. One question is likely to feature prominently: Just how much of Singapore's historic success is locationally pre-conditioned?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63772949, "asset_id": 21273653, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26, "name": "Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2074, "name": "International Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Business?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3479, "name": "Business History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 18673, "name": "Economic history/Trade history/Oriental trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_history_Trade_history_Oriental_trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 30568852, "title": "Sustainability studies and the changing landscape of social science research in Singapore", "created_at": "2016-12-21T21:12:17.855-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30568852/Sustainability_studies_and_the_changing_landscape_of_social_science_research_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_30568852", "summary": "The Singapore government has traditionally invested heavily in, and focused on, the development of the hard sciences since gaining independence in 1965. This bode well for the fate of sustainability studies as the state, in the initial decades, focused heavily on performance legitimacy, emphasising issues of survivability and economic progress. With the country now at the top of global charts on many rankings on economic prosperity, the city-state has steadily begun to examine issues of nation-building rather than state-building. This can be attributed, in part, to the paradox of soft authoritarian regimes that invest heavily in human capital, because in the long run, an educated electorate will want, as active and informed citizens, to participate effectively in politics. The social sciences are slowly evolving to look at the Singapore model from a comparative perspective, moving away from the dominant narrative of \u201cSingaporean exceptionalism\u201d, which overstates the uniqueness of the city-state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51010756, "asset_id": 30568852, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403373, "first_name": "Kamaludeen", "last_name": "Mohamed Nasir", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "KamaludeenMohamedNasir", "display_name": "Kamaludeen  Mohamed Nasir", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/KamaludeenMohamedNasir?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403373/99485/5021698/s65_kamaludeen.mohamed_nasir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4524, "name": "Sustainable Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Development?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4995, "name": "History of Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Social_Sciences?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 10439, "name": "Academia Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academia_Research?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 552366, "name": "Developmentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Developmentalism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 578214, "name": "Impact of Social Sciences and Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 743628, "name": "Liberal Arts and Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Arts_and_Social_Sciences?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1197942, "name": "Social Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Science?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 49174650, "title": "Singapore\u2019s two-front battle with water security and climate change", "created_at": "2021-06-08T12:19:01.908-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49174650/Singapore_s_two_front_battle_with_water_security_and_climate_change?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_49174650", "summary": "\u2018Boom and bust\u2019 rainfall is one challenge as weather patterns change.

The most foundational factor in our model is the role of institutional entrepreneurs, who drew upon the symbolic representation of Singapore's vulnerability to legitimize the use of foresight, thus resonating well with local technocratic groups to maintain steady economic progress. This study further argues that the underdevelopment of foresight in the local private and academic domains can be at least in part explained by the historical connotations of foresight that were uncovered. \nResearch limitations/implications-As the findings are fruit of the authors' interpretation of the secondary literature/interview data, they require further triangulation by future research. \nOriginality/value-This study presents the interpretation of elite informants' accounts and historical documents to explain one of the most exemplar yet classified case studies of governmental foresight globally.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72773766, "asset_id": 58288750, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45308409, "first_name": "Alessandro (Alex)", "last_name": "Fergnani", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "AlessandroAlexFergnani", "display_name": "Alessandro (Alex) Fergnani", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/AlessandroAlexFergnani?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45308409/14133625/93719828/s65_alessandro_alex_.fergnani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2789, "name": "Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Government?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3477, "name": "Strategic Foresight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategic_Foresight?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9771, "name": "Foresight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foresight?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18289, "name": "Scenario planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scenario_planning?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 36260, "name": "Futures Studies and Foresight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Futures_Studies_and_Foresight?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 36273, "name": "Forecasting and Foresight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forecasting_and_Foresight?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 62209, "name": "Strategic Foresight and Warning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategic_Foresight_and_Warning?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 71006, "name": "Technology Foresight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_Foresight?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 264251, "name": "Foresight and Scenario Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foresight_and_Scenario_Planning?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 895003, "name": "Scenario Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scenario_Building?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 39341918, "title": "SEKULARISME PRAGMATIS SINGAPURA", "created_at": "2019-06-01T18:23:20.509-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39341918/SEKULARISME_PRAGMATIS_SINGAPURA?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_39341918", "summary": "BAGIAN 1 PENDAHULUAN Singapura, seperti kita ketahui, merupakan Negara muda modern dengan basis ekonomi terbuka.

Ditambah lagi, Singapura memiliki keberagaman populasi yang cukup variatif, terdiri dari 74% etnis Cina, 14% etnis Melayu, 9% etnis India serta 3% Eurasia dan lain-lain.

However, amidst the meteoric rise of the Singapore economy and the accompanying increase in domestic incomes, a growing number of people have expressed concern about the state of emotional well-being among the citizenry. This paper will begin by briefly outlining the \u2018survival narrative\u2019 which has underpinned the country\u2019s sustained economic success by legitimising the policies propagated by the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) since the nascent years of independence. Having discussed that, this paper will then argue that the growing emotional discontent among citizens has led to the happiness-income paradox in Singapore, in which they face mounting dissatisfaction even amidst rising incomes. This paper ascribes this paradox to, among other things, the diminishing level of volunteerism in Singapore. The final segment shows how insights from behavioural science may be used by policymakers to \u2018nudge\u2019 citizens towards greater volunteerism, to the effect of engendering happiness in Singapore. This would enable the state to not only continue in its pursuit of economic development but concurrently elevate the emotional well-being of its citizens.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Roger Crowley\u2019s narration takes the reader, both the simple curious and the specialist, through a relatively short historical parable that changed the history of the world forever. The book starts with the exploration of the west African coast made by Diogo C\u00e3o between 1483 and 1486, and it ends in 1515 with the death of Afonso de Albuquerque, conqueror of Malacca, Goa and Ormuz. Between these chronological boundaries, the author explores the epic moments of the Portuguese maritime, military, and commercial expansion towards the east and the west. It recounts the achievements of some great Portuguese explorers such as Bartolomeu Dias, who rounded the Cape of Good Hope, Vasco da Gama, discoverer of India, and Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, who first arrived in Brazil.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64889626, "asset_id": 44463297, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4940254, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Salomoni", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "DavidSalomoni", "display_name": "David Salomoni", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/DavidSalomoni?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4940254/2134078/46919833/s65_david.salomoni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4916, "name": "Portuguese Discoveries and Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Discoveries_and_Expansion?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33833, "name": "History of Colonial India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_India?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37681, "name": "Portugal (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portugal_History_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 224060, "name": "History of Navigation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Navigation?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 371309, "name": "Malacca past history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malacca_past_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 714402, "name": "History of Portugal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Portugal?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 735681, "name": "History of Geographical Discoveries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Geographical_Discoveries?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1153379, "name": "Vasco da Gama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vasco_da_Gama?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 12416924, "title": "\u201cT\u00ecm hi\u1ec3u v\u0103n h\u00f3a ch\u00ednh tr\u1ecb c\u1ee7a Singapore t\u1eeb sau n\u0103m 1965 \u0111\u1ebfn nay / Understanding of the Political Culture of Singapore since 1965\u201d, T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed Nghi\u00ean c\u1ee9u \u0110\u00f4ng Nam \u00c1, s\u1ed1 05 (254) n\u0103m 2021, tr. 59-66.", "created_at": "2015-05-16T17:22:42.985-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12416924/_T%C3%ACm_hi%E1%BB%83u_v%C4%83n_h%C3%B3a_ch%C3%ADnh_tr%E1%BB%8B_c%E1%BB%A7a_Singapore_t%E1%BB%AB_sau_n%C4%83m_1965_%C4%91%E1%BA%BFn_nay_Understanding_of_the_Political_Culture_of_Singapore_since_1965_T%E1%BA%A1p_ch%C3%AD_Nghi%C3%AAn_c%E1%BB%A9u_%C4%90%C3%B4ng_Nam_%C3%81_s%E1%BB%91_05_254_n%C4%83m_2021_tr_59_66?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_12416924", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68152683, "asset_id": 12416924, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16253180, "first_name": "V\u0129 An", "last_name": "L\u01b0", "domain_name": "istanbul", "page_name": "V\u0129AnL\u01b0", "display_name": "V\u0129 An L\u01b0", "profile_url": "https://istanbul.academia.edu/V%C4%A9AnL%C6%B0?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16253180/4961794/98733686/s65_v_an.l_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6749, "name": "Cultural Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 224609, "title": "Where the World Meets: Regionalism and Globalization in Singapore\u2019s Convention Industry", "created_at": "2010-03-30T14:50:55.127-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/224609/Where_the_World_Meets_Regionalism_and_Globalization_in_Singapore_s_Convention_Industry?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_224609", "summary": "Singapores meetings, incentive, convention and exhibition industry (M.I.C.E.) attracts over 4,000 events and over 400,000 foreign participants every year.

An assessment of Singapore MICE attractiveness shows that while the country has many strengths, particularly infrastructure and management, it has a number of weaknesses, as well, including limited entertainment and cultural attractions. Further analysis shows that much of Singapores success has been based on regional meetings, rather than truly global events.

sense\u2019 are conditioned by a group of influential myths. Our main myths are examined in this collection of essays and thoughts on the social ramifications of myth-making: The Singapore Story (that our nation has a singular story), From Third World to First (our story of success), Vulnerability and Faultlines (the threats we still face despite success) and A Deficient People (the threats exist because people remain immature).\n\nMyths build social consensus but also marginalise crucial stories, perspectives and possibilities that don\u2019t fit the main narrative. Should we teach our students to be good citizens by telling them one unifying narrative of Singapore, or many varied narratives? Have we always said no to social welfare, or to the casino? Is liberal democracy necessarily a threat to social stability? Have Singaporeans historically been apathetic, ignorant or irrational?\n\nThe contributors to this book believe that knowing, and debating, how we live with myths will help us to better understand Singapore today, and to imagine its future. Here they share the robust discussions and debates which took place from 2014 to 2015 even as Singapore celebrated 50 years of full independence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53423012, "asset_id": 33365987, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 258868, "first_name": "Jack Meng-Tat", "last_name": "Chia \u8b1d\u660e\u9054", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JackMengTatChia", "display_name": "Jack Meng-Tat Chia \u8b1d\u660e\u9054", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JackMengTatChia?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/258868/54913/95545755/s65_jack_meng-tat.chia_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 61620605, "title": "[Book Review] CHRISTIAN CIRCULATIONS: Global Christianity and the Local Church in Penang and Singapore, 1819\u20132000.

She does this by paying attention to the Brethren movement in Singapore and Penang, which is remarkable for two reasons. The first is that in Singapore and Malaysia the Brethren, alongside other denominations, is a religion \u201cof heritage for many\u201d (p. 2). And yet scholarship about them has been limited. The second is that her work foregrounds the significant role of the Brethren in the globalization of Christianity, whose contemporary narrative is predisposed to Pentecostalism. In many parts of Asia, Christianity has a much longer tradition.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74598548, "asset_id": 61620605, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

In pursuing this programme I will make use of a broad range of sources including chronicles and histories, letters and treaties, navigational instructions and travel literature, as well as (European) cartography of the 16th to 18th centuries. In order to gain deeper appreciation of the multi-faceted roles and understandings of the Singapore Straits across the longue dur\u00e9e, I  not only adduce and evaluate materials of European colonial origin, but importantly also heed special attention to sources of Asian origin in general, and specifically to materials that have originally been written in Arabic, Malay, Chinese and have been made accessible to the wider reading public in various contemporary translations.

The research paper will explore the genius loci of Singapore and propose that the unique quality is created through the experience of daily life instead of intentional place-making. In particular, void decks under HDB housings, which has became the container of social activities, express the city\u2019s genius loci more accurately than created urban spectacles and conserved monuments intentionally planned by the government. \n\nNation-building efforts have overlooked the significance of void decks in creating the city\u2019s genius loci. Singapore has been referred as to a city built on tabula rasa: all traces of history and precedence erased, planned from scratch from the vision of one man. This view is problematic because traces of the past was never completely removed. The simultaneous construction of new spaces and conservation of older ones has created a \u201cvisual rojak\u201d in the city\u2019s urban fabric, making it increasingly difficult to have a clear sense of the city. Furthermore, the exploration of new housing typologies and public space design has lead to the slow disappearance of the void, notable in newer HDB precincts such as Punggol.  \n\nWhen we visualise a city like Singapore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate it from another metropolitan elsewhere in the world. When cities around the world are being impacted by the effects of rapid globalisation, one way for a city to establish its significance is to embrace its uniqueness. For the case of a young country like Singapore, finding the genius loci will strengthen the national identity and contribute tremendously to nation-building efforts. The paper urges planners of the city to avoid barking up the wrong tree and focus on enhancing the commonplace which Singaporeans have identified themselves with. \n ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55672279, "asset_id": 35795812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34980575, "first_name": "Yu Chuan", "last_name": "Song", "domain_name": "np", "page_name": "YuChuanSong", "display_name": "Yu Chuan Song", "profile_url": "https://np.academia.edu/YuChuanSong?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34980575/18925394/66719830/s65_yu_chuan.song.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61835, "name": "Urban Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Design?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 407193, "name": "Housing in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2713447, "name": "Singapore Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Heritage?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 38212990, "title": "Hadi Osni, 2018. \"Ponthuk: A desa away from the homeland\", \"Memories of B\u00e8ngkor Ghunung Turin and K\u00e8l\u00e8m\", \"Memories Of Ponthuk Parkind\u00e8\" and \"Memories Of Ponthuk Tamphilung\".

To do so, it adopted a comparative study design, comparing the development of the Republic of Singapore under authoritarian leadership, and the development of the Republic of Zambia under authoritarian leadership. It sought to answer the questions: Why and how does authoritarian leadership influence development differently in Singapore compared to Zambia? The research used the modernization theory as the background of the research. It adopted the case study method for its research methodology and employed the descriptive method of analysis. It used purely secondary data sources in the research. From the findings it is noted that authoritarian leadership can either lead to the development of an economy or the underdevelopment of an economy. This is realized through the analysis of the authoritarian leadership style exhibited by Lee Kuan Yew  in Singapore and Kenneth Kaunda in Zambia during their leadership tenures. The paper recommends that it is important for leaders to know their leadership styles so as to use the styles effectively in building their economies; and heads of state summits should be held to deal with issues of governance and development, most specifically authoritarian leadership and development. This is to help states still under authoritarian leadership to thrive within their contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53242181, "asset_id": 33153926, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29502909, "first_name": "Victoria", "last_name": "Muhumuza", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "VictoriaMuhumuza", "display_name": "Victoria Muhumuza", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/VictoriaMuhumuza?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29502909/8457180/9452646/s65_victoria.muhumuza.jpg_oh_77d2f7d7de2e0cb2af1414f88605144b_oe_55e2f2db___gda___1441128365_b13bb02d0fbd78c930f13c942b1671e2"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6051, "name": "Social Development in developing countries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Development_in_developing_countries?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11395, "name": "Economic Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Development?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34598, "name": "Authoritarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authoritarianism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 36135, "name": "Authoritarian regimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authoritarian_regimes?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 64987, "name": "Social Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Development?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 151869, "name": "Political leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_leadership?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 629441, "name": "Zambian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zambian_History?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 17023825, "title": "Stepping Stone Singapore: The Cultural Politics of Anti-immigrant Anxieties", "created_at": "2015-10-19T22:54:05.104-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17023825/Stepping_Stone_Singapore_The_Cultural_Politics_of_Anti_immigrant_Anxieties?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_17023825", "summary": "This chapter looks at local anxieties over the influx of immigrants in Singapore. It argues that such anxieties do not flourish in an ideological vacuum but have, instead, emerged from the fertile ground of national survivalist rhetoric. Decades of People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) government reminders of the city-state\u2019s inherent vulnerability, lack of natural resources and precarious future have nurtured a \u2018siege mentality\u2019 and a materialist anxiety which, in turn, aggravate anxiety over in-coming competition for employment and public resources. Three types of anxieties will be examined \u2013 anxiety over citizenship; anxiety over material and public resource; and anxiety over self-worth \u2013 to explain the pervasive concern that immigrants are using Singapore as a stepping stone to greener pastures. The chapter concludes by identifying a possible response from cultural producers to these anxieties.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39311699, "asset_id": 17023825, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 518375, "first_name": "Terence", "last_name": "Chong", "domain_name": "iseas", "page_name": "TerenceChong", "display_name": "Terence Chong", "profile_url": "https://iseas.academia.edu/TerenceChong?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/25b62c366bde3bbe49037915646750f8?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4374, "name": "Immigration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38566752, "title": "The Anti-Yellow Culture Campaign in Singapore: 1953-1979", "created_at": "2019-03-17T05:26:00.653-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38566752/The_Anti_Yellow_Culture_Campaign_in_Singapore_1953_1979?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_38566752", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58639605, "asset_id": 38566752, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6132275, "first_name": "Cheng Tju", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChengTjuLim", "display_name": "Cheng Tju Lim", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChengTjuLim?f_ri=50974", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8693, "name": "Pop Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pop_Culture?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3166885, "name": "anti-yellow culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/anti-yellow_culture?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 43015138, "title": "Eating Chilli Crab in the Anthropocene: Environmental Perspectives on Life in Singapore", "created_at": "2020-05-11T21:25:33.926-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43015138/Eating_Chilli_Crab_in_the_Anthropocene_Environmental_Perspectives_on_Life_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_43015138", "summary": "In this era of climate crisis, sustainability is a global imperative.

The authors represent a new generation of cultural critics and environmental thinkers, who will inherit the future we are creating today. From chilli crab to Tiger Beer, Changi Airport to Pulau Semakau, O-levels to orang minyak films, these essays offer fresh perspectives on familiar subjects, prompting us to recognise the incredible

Multilingual, interdisciplinary, and audiovisual projects are particularly prominent. A community is growing around an emergent concept of DH, and it is developing results mainly in society-driven research projects. Although the DH label is relatively new, and DH dialogue across Singapore institutions is at its early stages, Singapore-based researchers have carried out digital research for decades. An increasing number of projects are home-grown, but several projects have also migrated to Singapore recently due to the high degree of mobility at Singaporean institutions. Current trends suggest that the next stage of DH history in Singapore will include the development of more formal institutions and more participation in global DH conversations.",

Singapore\u2019s development and the fundamental role that water has had in shaping it. What makes this case so unique is that the quest for self-sufficiency in terms of water availability in a fast-changing urban context has been crucial to the way development policies and agendas have been planned throughout the years. The authors analyse plans, policies, institutions, laws and regulations, water demand and water supply strategies, water quality and water conservation considerations, partnerships and importance of the media. They assess overall how all these issues have evolved in response to the dynamic needs of the city-state.\n\nThe study of Singapore shows how a dynamic society can address development without losing its focus on the environment. In the city-state, environmental concerns in general, and water concerns in particular, have played a major role in its transformation from a third world to a first world country. How and why this transformation took place is the main focus of this authoritative book.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67573344, "asset_id": 49190386, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30458579, "first_name": "Prof. Asit K.", "last_name": "Biswas", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "ProfAsitKBiswas", "display_name": "Prof. Asit K.

nationalisation of religion is introduced in this article as the condition in which the secular interests and values of the state are articulated and enacted by religious organisations or individuals participating in public life. It has two attributes: (1) performances are shrouded in a nationalistic character that renders the religious significantly invisible and as a result; (2) the prevailing political order proceeds unquestioned. To make its case, the article draws from the experiences of the youth of Soka who perform in public events such as the National Day Parade and Chingay in Singapore. These performances are some of the ways in which Soka presents itself as a cultural organisation working for peace and progress in Singapore. For them, it is about sending a message that individual and collective struggles can be overcome and that in spite of their differences, people can come together.\r\n\r\nURL:

Singaporeans are now finding different outlets to express themselves, weighing in on political and social issues. While the political impact of alternative media has been the subject of much discussion in recent years, the social impact has yet to receive as much attention. This dissertation sets out to address this gap in research by comparing two mainstream newspapers \u2013 The Straits Times and TODAY \u2013 with two prominent alternative websites \u2013The Online Citizen and Temasek Review Emeritus \u2013 to examine if they differ in the way they construct nationalism and identity within their coverage. Through content and critical discourse analysis of three case studies, this dissertation reveals that although certain methods are popular with both mainstream and alternative media, differences can be found in the way each side formulates who is or isn\u2019t considered a \u2018fellow Singaporean\u2019, thus informing different stances on nationalism and identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31869913, "asset_id": 4460652, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4916862, "first_name": "Kirsten", "last_name": "Han", "domain_name": "cardiff", "page_name": "KirstenHan", "display_name": "Kirsten Han", "profile_url": "https://cardiff.academia.edu/KirstenHan?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4916862/10530888/11752328/s65_kirsten.han.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16547, "name": "Alternative Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Media?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 123787, "name": "Mainstream Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mainstream_Media?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 14759986, "title": "\"Shenti Lixing: The Documenting Practice of Loke Hong Seng\" (2015)", "created_at": "2015-08-08T07:50:47.699-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14759986/_Shenti_Lixing_The_Documenting_Practice_of_Loke_Hong_Seng_2015_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_14759986", "summary": "Zhuang, Wubin. \u201cShenti Lixing: The Documenting Practice of Loke Hong Seng.\u201d In A Social Portrait of Singapore, The Critical Years.

The region is home to some of the largest labor surplus countries, namely the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Research on contemporary migration in Asia are dominated by the view that migration is an economically driven phenomenon; hence, the overwhelming interest in labor migration. However, if migration is regarded as more than an economic phenomenon, then we can appreciate how incredibly diverse it is as a human and social experience.

These stereotypes are mainly described as inadequate representations for understanding the ethnic Other in multiethnic Singapore. The persistence of these stereotypes in spite of Singapore\u2019s multicultural aspirations can be attributed to their commercial value, particularly in the context of audience demand for light entertainment that is immediately gratifying at least with respect to multiethnic insecurities. However, given their resilience and commercial value, stereotypes can be harnessed in ways that jolt audiences out of the comfort of their taken-for-granted and easy-to-manage world of ethnic caricatures. This would require the kind of technical, social, and artistic knowledge and skill that any \u201crenaissance city\u201d should aim to nurture and promote among its citizenry. In fact, this is the kind of social and cultural vibrancy that, set up in dialectical relationship with the official policy-making and\r\ninstitution-building efforts of officialdom, is necessary for giving\r\nsubstance, depth, and critical relevance to the mostly emblematic and loudly celebratory, but correspondingly abstract and hollow, principle of multiracialism in Singapore.\"",

This admiral of the Dutch East India Company sailed to Asia in 1605 and besieged Portuguese Melaka in 1606 with the help of Malay allies. A massive Portuguese armada arrived from Goa to fight the Dutch at sea, break the siege and relieve the Portuguese colony. During his Asian voyage and on his return to Europe in September 1608, Matelieff penned a series of letters and memorials in which he provided a candid assessment of trading opportunities and politics in Asia. He advised the VOC and leading government officials of the Dutch Republic to take a long-term view of Dutch involvement in Asia and fundamentally change the way they were doing business there. Singapore, the Straits region, and Johor assumed a significant role in his overall assessment. At one stage seriously contemplated establishing the VOC\u2019s main Asian base at a location near the Johor River estuary. On deeper reflection, however, Matelieff and the VOC directors in Europe began to shift their attention southward and instead began to prefer a location around the Sunda Strait. This was arguably a near miss for Singapore two full centuries before Thomas Stamford Raffles founded the British trading post on the island in 1819. This book is aimed at students, researchers and general readers who are interested in the history of Singapore and Johor as well as in answering the question: Was Singapore\u2019s potential as a strategic and commercial center not recognized before the arrival of the British?\n\nThis book has been published by the National Library of Singapore's Books SG site.

political leader of the anticolonial and Malayan left-wing in Singapore until his detention without trial in 1963 ended his political career. That he had a major impact on Singapore\u2019s decolonisation is beyond dispute \u2013 indeed, both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew formulated their merger policy specifically in response to Lim\u2019s politics and his values. Yet Lim remains a poorly understood figure because of a lack of sources and a historiography written almost entirely from his opponents\u2019 perspectives. Reassessing existing literature in view of recently declassified British archives, this essay pieces together Lim\u2019s articulation of three tenets in the political thinking that guided his tactics for social mobilisation: anticolonial unity, non-violence, and popular sovereignty. Lim put these principles into practice with great success, becoming the leader of the largest and most formative nationalist movement Singapore has ever known. Understanding Malayan nationalism in Singapore \u2013 and its successor, Singaporean nationalism \u2013 is thus impossible without understanding Lim Chin Siong.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54542641, "asset_id": 34683473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 380793, "first_name": "Pingtjin", "last_name": "Thum", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "PingtjinThum", "display_name": "Pingtjin Thum", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/PingtjinThum?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/380793/118176/2411453/s65_pingtjin.thum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 4302708, "title": "The Memoirs and Memorials of Jacques de Coutre: Security, Trade and Society in 16th and 17th Century Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2013-08-22T12:27:48.059-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4302708/The_Memoirs_and_Memorials_of_Jacques_de_Coutre_Security_Trade_and_Society_in_16th_and_17th_Century_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_4302708", "summary": "A native of Bruges (now part of Belgium), Jacques de Coutre was a gem trader who spent nearly a decade in Southeast Asia in the early 17th century.

Through this we argue that augmenting linguistic analysis with philosophical perspectives develops and supports CDA scholarship more broadly by accommodating the shifting complexity of social problems of ideologically driven inequality that are inbuilt through, in our case, social policy texts. In discussing philosophical-methodological issues, the paper argues for the need to continually adapt CDA to the particular data so as to remain sensitive to and avoid hegemonic tendencies in analysis. Through adopting the principles of a working methodology, we discuss a micro-meso-macro CDA framework that draws on the analytical concepts of movement, metaphorical superfluidity, thematic condensation, and surrealism to conceive of a research approach capable of examining and comprehending evolving discourses of political economies. The most immediate benefit of this framework is its capacity to illustrate how forms of valuations perpetuated by and through policy discourse are the motivational locus of meaning making insofar as they strongly inform the moral underpinning the ideology of economic growth.\n ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55445759, "asset_id": 35579690, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Since independence, the PAP has revamped Singapore's colonial downtown into a conceptually empty postnational space filled with decontextualized buildings designed by famous foreign architects. While this uniformly high-rise environment and urban development is common among the high-economic-growth East and Southeast Asia countries since the 1980s, one difference in Singapore's urbanism is a utopian belief that once existed in the advanced West \u2014 that rational design will make rational societies without superfluousness. The commercial downtown and successful public housing jointly become the embodiment of a uniform urban space of physical perfectibility.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the emergence of Singapore contemporary art practices has been the exploration in 1990s independent film of the suppressed nonelite subjectivities in public housing. Some filmmakers took public housing to be a space separate from the commercial downtown, and they suggested that this space represents an ambivalent site of modernity in its relationship to increasingly elitist capitalist development\u2014they constitute a geography that indicates sociocultural difference. The filmmakers, in attempting to map an urban space capable of yielding knowledge of nonelite people, also attempt to delineate the interiority of a major part of Singapore's city space, given that 80 percent of the population lives in public housing. The films inscribe city space by depicting the ordinary and the potentially tragic cultural meanings that are emitted from this place. They represent an interest in depictions of class, though not in class-based politics. Such films also mark the imaginative disappearance of a colonial \u201ctropical\u201d city for an urban world now thoroughly modernized.\r\n\r\nThe representative films undertaking explorations of class and the urban environment that form the focus of this article are Eric Khoo's Mee Pok Man (1995), Kelvin Tong and Jasmine Ng's Eating Air: A Motorcycle Kungfu Love Story (1999), and Royston Tan's 15 (2002). The filmmakers accept the \u201carrival\u201d of the extended public-housing cityscape as a fait accompli and an iconic marker of Singaporean identity. However, they also look at public housing as locales where utopian impulses foster dystopic places that possess diverse cultures under erasure or suppression, and in which there is no past, only endlessly present space. Critical independent film, like much of the contemporary film since the 1980s, displays dissatisfaction with the stifling enclosure of a quasi-authoritarian late modernity, and from which a thematized break is longed for. This essay examines the similar and contrasting means by which three filmmakers present the city-state as a palimpsest of suppressed urban cultures.

In fact, this exhibition is an example of the regular international exchange of material heritage of the Sikhs, since five important artworks from the Kapany Collection of Sikh Art were loaned to this exhibition. This loan, and the attention this exhibition is receiving in Singapore as well as internationally, are components of the growing international recognition of Sikh art, and the role it plays in diasporic Sikh communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83005117, "asset_id": 74410628, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19091, "name": "South Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 22151, "name": "Collecting (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collecting_Art_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 24047, "name": "Indian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 26049, "name": "Sikh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikh_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 199271, "name": "Punjab Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjab_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 38626109, "title": "'From Third World to First': A Case Study of Labor Laws in a Changing Singapore", "created_at": "2019-03-25T06:27:39.616-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38626109/From_Third_World_to_First_A_Case_Study_of_Labor_Laws_in_a_Changing_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_38626109", "summary": "The aim of this article is to examine the shift in the policy underpinnings of labor law in Singapore, and how the Singapore legislature appears to have recalibrated the emphasis placed on the competing goals of labor law, to now develop local policies more tilted towards social justice. A former British colony, Singapore has developed its own sui generis jurisprudence, influenced by unique political, social and economic traits that have evolved diachronically as it has struggled to achieve independence and then emerge as a 'First World Economy' - which makes it an interesting contribution to existing literature on the 'purpose' of labor law. A collective laissez-faire approach in the 1950s was followed by a sharp turn towards pro-employer efficiency and flexibility in the labor market over job security from the 1960s to the 1980s, at which point an influx of foreign workers marked a transition in the labor force constitution. In contrast, since then, the 21st century has witnessed genuine institutional efforts to 'counteract the inequality of bargaining power' inherent in the employment relationship. The 2018 amendments proposed to the Employment Act indicate more focus towards 'worker protection'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58703435, "asset_id": 38626109, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2750822, "first_name": "Meera", "last_name": "Rajah", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MeeraRajah", "display_name": "Meera Rajah", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MeeraRajah?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2750822/892176/36857160/s65_meera.rajah.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29, "name": "Industrial And Labor Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_And_Labor_Relations?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 751, "name": "Labor Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Economics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19415, "name": "Labor History and Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_History_and_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 4285020, "title": "The Singapore Straits in the Latter Middle Ages and Early Modern Period (c.13th to 17th Centuries).

It proceeds to argue that the discourse of public protest and efforts to save Bukit Brown from the impending road has reconstructed Bukit Brown as an \u201cauthentic\u201d national space in three different but interrelated ways. First, Bukit Brown\u2019s authenticity is played out in its depiction as a heritage space. Such depictions are generally\nframed within a dichotomy of sites and in this particular case in distinction against the Gardens by the Bay, a billion-dollar state project in the downtown area, designed to give the city-state an international profile. The second way is as a green sanctuary through the naturalist\u2019s gaze. Finally, Bukit Brown is deemed authentic because it signifies cultural destruction and loss. The threat of destruction and loss conjures up cultural trauma which can be visited upon other cultural-ethnic heritage sites and thus serves as a cautionary tale to other ethnic groups. It is argued that these three discourses of authenticity enable Bukit Brown to transcend its ethnic origins, thus making it accessible to other ethnic groups who, though may not connect to it as intimately or culturally as ethnic Chinese, are able to incorporate the site in their national imaginary.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44153338, "asset_id": 23724750, "asset_type": "Work",

Suryadinata makes the case in the book that as the PRC becomes more globally prominent, it is increasingly blurring lines in its treatment of PRC citizens and non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese overseas. This claim comes amid allegations of growing PRC efforts to mobilize ethnic Chinese communities abroad to serve its national interests, be they economic, political, or strategic. These concerns are not new and are in fact a throwback to the past. They give the book an added timeliness and importance.\nFor much of the Cold War, ethnic Chinese communities in non-communist parts of Southeast Asia faced the suspicion of being a possible subversive fifth column for the PRC, especially if they seemed left-leaning. Such perspectives diminished as the PRC engaged in economic reform from the late 1970s, eschewed radical revolution, and passed a nationality law in 1980 clearly demarcating non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese abroad from PRC citizens. Recent reports of PRC efforts to lobby and police opinion in foreign countries using members of local ethnic Chinese communities ranging from Europe and North America to Oceania and Southeast Asia have again brought these long-dormant issues to the fore.1 This is an issue on which Suryadinata has previously written, and he provides readers a brief reminder of these themes in Chapter 3.2 [End Page 151]\nAn Awkward Closeness\nSuryadinata organizes the book into four parts. Part I (Chapters 1\u20133) discusses the PRC's rise to prominence from the 1980s till the present, changes in ethnic Chinese communities outside the PRC, and the organization of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO). The OCAO is the government body responsible for managing official ties with ethnic Chinese communities outside the PRC, be they PRC citizens abroad or ethnic Chinese who do not hold PRC citizenship. Within these pages, Suryadinata introduces his main observation\u2014that Beijing seems to be reverting to its older policy of reducing distinctions between PRC citizens and non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese in foreign jurisdictions. The key motivation behind this move, according to Suryadinata, is PRC efforts to advance and protect its interests and concerns overseas.\nPart II (Chapters 4\u20138) examines how the PRC responds officially to events outside its borders that affect ethnic Chinese and PRC citizens. Each chapter contains a case where ethnic Chinese come under threat from developments outside China and assess the PRC position. Beijing's reaction to the 1998 anti-Chinese race riots in Indonesia and violence in the South Pacific, Middle East, and Africa indicates a willingness to evacuate PRC citizens, especially those who work for PRC state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The 2014 anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam, triggered by a Beijing-initiated escalation in its maritime dispute with Hanoi, suggests that the PRC is not above placing its citizens overseas in danger for the pursuit of more important interests.\nHowever, contrasting PRC responses to incidents involving ethnic Chinese in Malaysia and Myanmar point toward an evolution in Beijing's position. Beijing responded to alleged ill-treatment of its citizens by Malaysian police in 2005 as well as political pressure, even violence, toward ethnic Chinese Myanmar citizens in the Kokang region along the PRC border in 2015 with diplomatic entreaties. Such actions resulted from Beijing's desire to maintain positive official relations with Malaysia and Myanmar. Threats against ethnic Chinese Malaysians in 2015, in comparison, saw the then-PRC ambassador to Malaysia publicly expressing an intention to protect these co-ethnics even though this was tantamount to intervention and divided local opinion. This step appears to portend an effort by Beijing to extend influence over non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese communities overseas, even at the risk of upsetting foreign governments.\nThe next four chapters in Part III examine the ways domestic considerations in the...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57007360, "asset_id": 37056621, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Some of you may have even been through Singapore your way to somewhere else. For those who come to the city as tourists, they are likely to check out the famous Raffles Hotel. Here at one of Asia\u2019s finest addresses you will learn that the hotel has been named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, an agent of the East India Company in London, who founded the British trading post and settlement in 1819. Before Raffles arrived, it is said, there was nothing much on the island except a handful of fishermen and pirates. Singapore was a place forgotten by time.\r\nMy paper seriously challenges this view. If you attend my lecture, I want you to walk away knowing that Singapore has a longer and deeper history that predates 1819. Raffles did not discover either the location Singapore or its potential as a trading emporium: that had been recognized long before. As a second takeaway I want viewers to appreciate that Singapore was everything but a forgotten place before 1819 and that it fulfilled different functions at different times.

In the mid-eighteenth century European reference works continued to describe Batu Sawar as the capital of Johor, even though the city had long ceased to serve as a trading center, let alone as Johor\u2019s capital, and almost certainly no longer existed. Such observations raise the question of urban impermanence \u2013 the transience of sizeable settlements with reference to the Malay Archipelago. Two overarching questions form the backbone of the investigation: First, why did Batu Sawar rise as a regional trading center, and second, what are the factors that contributed to its decline? Batu Sawar\u2019s fate was sealed by a combination of factors that included poor defenses, multiple external shocks, destruction by fire, court politics and rivalry between the early colonial powers.

Gay businesses thrive in one of Singapore\u2019s most socially conservative neighbourhoods, because the state allows relative free rein on the usage of preserved buildings after conserving the ethnic enclave as a bastion of Chineseness. Invoking Lefebvrian spatial concepts, I argue that the uneasy interface between moral conservatism and economic neoliberalism opened up intersticial spaces of business opportunities. Gay entrepreneurs took advantage of these spaces and their thriving businesses became the cluster today. I further maintain that as spaces of social interactions for gay men and lesbians, these enterprises help develop Singaporean queer identities. Yet, they simultaneously retard the country\u2019s nascent LGBT rights movement by remaining largely closeted. By granting access to privatised consumption without challenging the heteronormative status quo of Singaporean society, gay Chinatown buttresses homonationalism (Kulick, 2009; Puar, 2007).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38375841, "asset_id": 14638749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3078274, "first_name": "Chris K.

The memory of Zheng He and his legacy rooted in an anomalous series of sea expeditions makes him unique in Chinese history and speaks to contemporary issues of multiculturalism, ethnic hybridity, and the geopolitics of migration and diaspora. Kuo reappropriates the Zheng He theme to re-present the eunuch admiral as an ancient paradigm of the modern multicultural man in an increasingly transnational world. Scholars have noted the way Kuo uses storytelling to prompt people in Singapore to show a greater willingness to live together as a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation. However, I argue that the play\u2019s text reveals more somber and personal undercurrents, where Kuo draws upon an intimate understanding of the classical Chinese Zheng He story to record shrewd observations and articulate concealed shafts of criticism about Singapore\u2019s bureaucracy, intermingled with philosophical reflections addressing contemporary Sinophone lived reality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48867246, "asset_id": 28516708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33761858, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Leng", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "RachelLeng", "display_name": "Rachel Leng", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/RachelLeng?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33761858/9944794/36160202/s65_rachel.leng.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 9801, "name": "Chinese Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language_and_Culture?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 15514, "name": "Contemporary Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 22123, "name": "Classical Chinese literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Chinese_literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 24550, "name": "Contemporary China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_China?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 27584, "name": "Chinese literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 34132, "name": "Chinese Modern Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Modern_Literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 39262, "name": "Sinophone Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone_Literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 60807, "name": "Maritime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 81388, "name": "Multiethnic Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiethnic_Literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 351900, "name": "Zheng He", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zheng_He?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 407650, "name": "Admiral Zheng He", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Admiral_Zheng_He?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 618429, "name": "Chinese Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 858132, "name": "Kuo Pao Kun", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kuo_Pao_Kun?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 960793, "name": "Diasporic and Sinophone Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporic_and_Sinophone_Writing?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1235192, "name": "Sinophone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 15055959, "title": "REPRODUCTION AND PROBLEMS OF \u201cTHE MALAY PROBLEM\u201d : The \u201cDysfunctional\u201d Malay Families in Singapore", "created_at": "2015-08-20T06:21:12.378-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15055959/REPRODUCTION_AND_PROBLEMS_OF_THE_MALAY_PROBLEM_The_Dysfunctional_Malay_Families_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_15055959", "summary": "This was a term paper done when I was an undergraduate in NUS.

It analyses all seven government-authored lower-secondary-level history textbooks, published between 1984 and 2015. Since Singapore does not presently have an environmental education curriculum, the mandatory history curriculum taught in all government schools is a rich site of inquiry to study the environmental education that schoolchildren gain from textbooks. The results show that Singapore\u2019s history textbooks largely and consistently portray humans in Singapore as independent from, rather than depending on and inextricably entangled with, the environment. We describe and analyse two trends. First, narratives about the nonhuman environment are largely relegated to Singapore\u2019s past and disappear almost entirely as textbook narratives approach the present, teaching children that the environment is largely irrelevant as we approach the present. Second, history narratives represent narrowly utilitarian, negativistic, and dominionistic perspectives of thinking about and relating to the nonhuman environment. In contrast, aesthetic, humanistic, moralistic, and ecologistic-scientific interactions with the nonhuman environment are either entirely absent or infrequently portrayed in textbook narratives. We contextualize these results and discuss the implications of teaching such narrow and misleading conceptions of human-environment interactions in official history education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69065292, "asset_id": 51274381, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24458, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Schneider-Mayerson", "domain_name": "colby", "page_name": "MatthewSchneiderMayerson", "display_name": "Matthew Schneider-Mayerson", "profile_url": "https://colby.academia.edu/MatthewSchneiderMayerson?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24458/7959/42047601/s65_matthew.schneider-mayerson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1063, "name": "Environmental Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Education?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3136, "name": "Qualitative methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_methodology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 134137, "name": "Textbook Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textbook_Analysis?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 523896, "name": "Environmental Values", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Values?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 36678157, "title": "The Governance of Risks in Ridesharing: A Revelatory Case from Singapore", "created_at": "2018-05-20T23:01:46.741-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36678157/The_Governance_of_Risks_in_Ridesharing_A_Revelatory_Case_from_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_36678157", "summary": "Recently we have witnessed the worldwide adoption of many different types of innovative technologies, such as crowdsourcing, ridesharing, open and big data, aiming at delivering public services more efficiently and effectively. Among them, ridesharing has received substantial attention from decision-makers around the world. Because of the multitude of currently understood or potentially unknown risks associated with ridesharing (unemployment, insurance, information privacy, and environmental risk), governments in different countries apply different strategies to address such risks. Some governments prohibit the adoption of ridesharing altogether, while other governments promote it. In this article, we address the question of how risks involved in ridesharing are governed over time. We present an in-depth single case study on Singapore and examine how the Singaporean government has addressed risks in ridesharing over time. The Singaporean government has a strong ambition to become an innovation hub, and many innovative technologies have been adopted and promoted to that end. At the same time, decision-makers in Singapore are reputed for their proactive style of social governance. The example of Singapore can be regarded as a revelatory case study, helping us further to explore governance practices in other countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56615313, "asset_id":

Challenging the previous studies and adopting a mixed research method utilizing a wide range of quantitative and qualitative data, we identify three major factors affecting the results of policy transfer: (1) a systemic combination of \"hardware\" and \"software\" in the conceptualization of transnational policy transfer; (2) localization of transnational policy and its enforcement; and mostly importantly, (3) institutionalization of key processes in both ends of policy exchanges and implementation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68790892, "asset_id": 50916235, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73527365, "first_name": "Hong", "last_name": "LIU", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "LiuHong", "display_name": "Hong LIU", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/LiuHong?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/73527365/18729268/38153617/s65_hong.liu.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 799, "name": "Public Administration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Administration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13470, "name": "Comparative Public Administration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Public_Administration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80810, "name": "Public Policy Implementation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy_Implementation?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 41192403, "title": "Virtual Epistle: Text and Image of the Film 7 Letters in Celebration of Singapore's Golden Jubilee", "created_at": "2019-12-05T06:11:42.931-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41192403/Virtual_Epistle_Text_and_Image_of_the_Film_7_Letters_in_Celebration_of_Singapores_Golden_Jubilee?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_41192403", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61431857, "asset_id": 41192403, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3829528, "first_name": "I, Lo-fen", "last_name": "\u8863\u82e5\u82ac", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "lofen", "display_name": "I, Lo-fen \u8863\u82e5\u82ac", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/lofen?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3829528/1398737/1719618/s65__._.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5543121, "title": "The Asian Modern: Culture, Capitalist Development, Singapore.

With this opening question, the author proceeds to give an account of how the modernization processes for postcolonial societies in Asia, such as those of India, Malaysia, and Singapore, are fraught with collaborations and conflicts between different socio-political, historical, economic, and cultural agents. Such ambivalent dynamics contribute to what Wee argues is a 'revealing distortion' of the extant models of Western modernity, which is nonetheless rooted in the politics of worldwide capitalism.\r\n\r\n\"Wee\u2019s narrative refuses to accept the uncritical interpretation of the modernizing processes in Asia as liberation from the hegemony of Euro-American capitalism. But neither is Wee prepared to concede that all cultural initiatives in the postcolonial societies are, therefore, denied all power to devise alternative forms of expression in the face of this haunting presence. It is the persistent effort to see the many faces of modernization in Asia in their full complexity that sets this study apart.\r\n\r\n\"Readers will discover that what seems to be the modernization of a single geopolitical entity is inevitably linked to the dynamics of various agents in other locations at different times, which makes us reflect on the existence of the many \u201cdistortions\u201d in our societies.\"  [From NUS Press website]\r\n\r\nhttp://books.google.com.sg/books/p/hkup?id=BuqgzNI_LP4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+asian+modern&ei=8OC-UsvyOY3CkwSM0IA4&cd=1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20asian%20modern&f=false\"\r\n\r\nFor partially available text (in book form), see:\r\nhttps://www.hkupress.hku.hk/pro/con/873.pdf [Hong Kong UP website]\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50388165, "asset_id": 5543121, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7346585, "first_name": "C.

Biopolis, however, is itself the result of a long-term effort to build up capacities for biotechnological research. The present paper analyzes the early (pre-Biopolis) biotechnology discourse in Singapore, with special emphasis on its representations in the official media and on its strategic uses by the various stakeholders involved. Against the backdrop of the global emergence of biotechnology from the late 1970s onwards, the paper traces the motivations for Singapore\u2019s formulation of its own biotechnology policy, paying attention throughout to the dynamic between scientists and policymakers. It is this relationship, along with the ambiguities that characterize it, which is responsible for the sustained establishment of biotechnology in Singapore. At an interpretative level, an attempt is made to compare the case of Singapore\u2019s biotechnology policy with competing discourses of technology and modernity. The discourse on biotechnology can thus be recognised as a means of mobilizing its intended audience for the various stages in the country\u2019s path towards (real or perceived) modernization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35031129, "asset_id": 8675234, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2616, "first_name": "Axel", "last_name": "Gelfert", "domain_name": "tu-berlin", "page_name": "AxelGelfert", "display_name": "Axel Gelfert", "profile_url": "https://tu-berlin.academia.edu/AxelGelfert?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2616/1164/10838054/s65_axel.gelfert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1524, "name": "Science Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Policy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4125, "name": "Global cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_cities?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4491, "name": "Innovation Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Innovation_Policy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13106, "name": "Economics of Biotechnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economics_of_Biotechnology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14907, "name": "Industrial Biotechnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_Biotechnology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 21658, "name": "Science, technology and Innovation Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_technology_and_Innovation_Policy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 28907, "name": "History of biotechnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_biotechnology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 36997, "name": "Emerging Technologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emerging_Technologies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 46181, "name": "Innovation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Innovation_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 54424, "name": "science and technology studies (STS)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/science_and_technology_studies_STS_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 69791, "name": "Science Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 130439, "name": "History of Biomedical Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Biomedical_Sciences?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1025585, "name": "Hong Kong & Singapore Comparative Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong_and_Singapore_Comparative_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1594538, "name": "Biopolis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolis?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1744493, "name": "Science and Technology Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_and_Technology_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2777377, "name": "Bioethics Infrastructure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioethics_Infrastructure?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 9639656, "title": "Graduation Short Films from Singapore\u2019s ADM, 2009-2011", "created_at": "2014-12-05T13:07:43.473-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9639656/Graduation_Short_Films_from_Singapore_s_ADM_2009_2011?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_9639656", "summary": "A taxonomy of film graduation projects based on key issues common to the films and on the generation-specific points of view.

When I tell them that I research working-class literature in Singapore and other Asian countries, their very first reaction is always a perplexed look followed by a rapid-fire of questions: \u201cWho are the working class in Singapore? Do you mean workers can write literature?\u201d Colleagues even dis- miss my topic, stating, \u201cYour project is so political, it sounds like a sociological investigation rather than literary studies. We don\u2019t do that here in Singapore.\u201dThese reactions, I believe, are conditioned by a significant lack of discourse on working-class literature in Singapore. The main aim of this essay, therefore, is to begin constructing such a dis- course. I will do this by analyzing from a historical perspective three working-class writers from Singapore \u2013 Chong Han (1945\u2013), Tan Kok Seng (1939\u2013), and MD Sharif Uddin (1978\u2013).2 By analyzing these very different writers, I will delineate a rudimentary his- historical overview of working-class literature in Singapore, stressing the different possibilities and limits under various \u201cproduction modes.\u201d In line with John Lennon and Magnus Nilsson\u2019s argument in their first edited collection Working-Class Literature(s), I will not offer a decisive resolution of what constitutes Singaporean working-class literature, but rather, I will explore this literature through the lens of \u201cwhat it could be\u201d (Lennon & Nilsson, 2017, p. 203).

At this time, Singapore had revived as a trading port under the Johor Sultanate. The port and its facilities were significant enough to warrant the presence of a shahbandar, a \u201clord of the haven\u201d, whose existence and trade facilities are found in some crucial travelogues and cartographical specimens of the period. Deemed \u201cone of the best ports that serves the East Indies\u201d by the Flemish trader Jacques de Coutre, Singapore acted as a strategic choke point: It served as gatekeeper of the upstream towns of the Johor River, including Johor\u2019s royal administrative centre at Batu Sawar. Singapore\u2019s location along the busy Straits also made it an important nodal point in the transition from the South China Sea to the Melaka Straits and the Bay of Bengal. Due to these roles and its geographic location, it is unsurprising that the waters around Singapore became contested spaces. Moreover, the islands here and nearby featured regularly in plans of the early colonial powers to assert their dominance and project commercial hegemony across the region in the five decades from 1590 to 1640.

The COVID-19 pandemic supplies us with a unique window of opportunity to understand how Singaporean Christian groups have been compliant actors to the state's policies, even during this health crisis. By evaluating the differing responses of various churches and organisations, I argue that in spite of inadequacies in the state's public health and social measures, Christian leaders and groups crafted state-centred responses, and engaged in crisis-driven social action and the construction of state-affirming narratives within government-promoted boundaries. This also meant that Christians have projected an image of themselves as being socially-responsible Singaporeans who are willing to adhere to the government's crisis-mandated standards, while sacrificing their regular faith-based practices and physical gatherings for the greater good of the nation. The willingness to adhere to the single-party state's measures and boundaries has, nevertheless, disclosed the Christian community's inability to provide a critical voice about public health gaps and socio-economic injustices during this crisis. Secular civil-society groups and academics have filled this gap by highlighting these problems and criticising the government's failures. In sum, the COVID-19 episode reveals the lack of a \u2018prophetic\u2019 capacity in the responses of contemporary Christian groups and leaders because of their predilection to firstly acquiesce with the state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64994105, "asset_id": 44387774, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35491773, "first_name": "Joshua Dao

The Singapore state tends to focus on economic prerogatives, and to discourage a rights-based, socio-political understandings of disability. Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) are often seen as objects of charity rather than as subjects with rights. For instance, Singapore has no equivalent to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the UK\u2019s Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). Yet, despite its economic pragmatism and lack of protective legislation, Singapore has not been immune to global trends on norms and standards for disabled populations, especially from international organizations and the developed world. This chapter offers some reasons for the mindset change in both Singapore\u2019s government and society, between 1965 and 2015\u2013 from viewing persons with disabilities as unfortunate economic liabilities on society and state, to viewing them as human beings deserving of dignity and state support.  This chapter takes issue with the outside-in explanation of the diffusion of ideas. It argues that two domestic factors - first, an aging population; and second, civil society activism - were more important than international sociocultural, political and structural factors in explaining the mindset shift which led to the state\u2019s signing of the UN Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) in December 2012.  Some might consider this the story of a neglected segment of Singapore\u2019s population, one hitherto deprived of attention and resources, but which has become visible in recent years (Zhuang 2007).  This chapter argues that the attendant policy change in three areas critical to independent living in Singapore - education, employment and accessibility \u2013 are making Singapore a more inclusive and compassionate society for persons with physical and cognitive challenges.

The memory of Zheng He and his legacy rooted in an anomalous series of sea expeditions makes him unique in Chinese history and speaks to contemporary issues of multiculturalism, ethnic hybridity, and the geopolitics of migration and diaspora. Kuo reappropriates the Zheng He theme to re-present the eunuch admiral as an ancient paradigm of the modern multicultural man in an increasingly transnational world. Scholars have noted the way Kuo uses storytelling to prompt people in Singapore to show a greater willingness to live together as a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation. However, I argue that the play\u2019s text reveals more somber and personal undercurrents, where Kuo draws upon an intimate understanding of the classical Chinese Zheng He story to record shrewd observations and articulate concealed shafts of criticism about Singapore\u2019s bureaucracy, intermingled with philosophical reflections addressing contemporary Sinophone lived reality.

developments of Therav\u0101da Buddhist communities in the Malay Archipelago region. This article charts how the neglected topics Hallisey urged scholars to attend to have opened new pathways for the study of Therav\u0101da minority communities. Drawing on recent studies of Therav\u0101da Buddhist communities in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, I discuss how Therav\u0101da Buddhists established institutions, participated in rituals, and relied on vernacular and non-canonical texts to preserve their sense of diasporic identity and ensure the survival of Buddhism as a minority religion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67544218, "asset_id": 49155380, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 258868, "first_name": "Jack Meng-Tat", "last_name": "Chia \u8b1d\u660e\u9054", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JackMengTatChia", "display_name": "Jack Meng-Tat Chia \u8b1d\u660e\u9054", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JackMengTatChia?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/258868/54913/95545755/s65_jack_meng-tat.chia_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25051, "name": "Theravada Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theravada_Buddhism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1737126, "name": "Southeast Asian Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Buddhism?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 5854192, "title": "\"Voids, Riverine and Otherwise\", Iconoclast (Cheo Chai-Hiang)", "created_at": "2014-01-27T00:05:03.682-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5854192/_Voids_Riverine_and_Otherwise_Iconoclast_Cheo_Chai_Hiang_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_5854192", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65652607, "asset_id": 5854192, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2648444, "first_name": "Louis", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LouisHo7", "display_name": "Louis Ho", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LouisHo7?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2648444/844434/4111271/s65_louis.ho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20178, "name": "Conceptual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conceptual_Art?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 998282, "name": "Singapore Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 57035237, "title": "Toxic Military Masculinities and the Politics of Conscript After-Death Remembrance in Singapore (open access)", "created_at": "2021-10-10T18:12:13.227-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/57035237/Toxic_Military_Masculinities_and_the_Politics_of_Conscript_After_Death_Remembrance_in_Singapore_open_access_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_57035237", "summary": "This article discusses the relationality between death and masculinity in economically prosperous Singapore.

In the aftermath of four training-related deaths, this work examines the extent in which the authoritarian state is selective in exercising necropower by denying slain military bodies their existence as bodies-as-space. Granted that bodies-as-space are generative of emotions and affects, the final section of this work discusses how the Singaporean state exercises necropower to enhance life-giving conditions.

I respond to Cobb's provocation, taking seriously the phenomenon of singledom among youths and working adults in Singapore, experienced existentially as a choice and/or a curse. Drawing upon eight months of initial fieldwork in Singapore, I attend to the state's hegemonic discourse of heterosexual coupledom, family and reproduction, and by contrast, its presentation of the rising levels of singlehood as a crisis of capitalist modernity and development - a problem to be addressed by extensive social engineering and public education. At the same time, I examine the mediated and cultural literacies of singlehood in the country, including (but not limited to) filmic, theatrical and televised presentations of dating, courtship and romantic desire, the increasing popularity of matchmaking agencies and rising use of internet-based or mobile dating applications, as well as everyday talk and attitudes toward being single in Singapore. By doing so, I will unpack the complexities of this cultural production; being single involves learning and embodying particular subjectivities, both in terms of one's emotions, behaviours and desires. Ultimately, I broach the question of how and why singlehood constitutes a troubling aporia for the Singaporean state and wider society. I ask why singledom is often viewed as a necessarily temporary or deficient condition of individual being - singles are treated as wanting to be happily \u201ccoupled\u201d - or as living barely bearable, unhappy and/or unfulfilled lives. Subsequently, the need to eradicate or sublate singlehood into the couple or familial unit suggests its existence as a dangerous excess for state and society. By focusing on the elected singlehood of young educated middle-class women in Singapore, and on feminist activism in the country, I enquire into what being single means, as a queer sexual, but also moral and political stance, against prevailing heteronormative state and social expectations in this particular Asian context. Overall, I propose to think about singlehood, but also with it, as generative of critical insight and as potential queer resistance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49146932, "asset_id": 27451092, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 307254, "first_name": "Sherman", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "ShermanTan", "display_name": "Sherman Tan", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/ShermanTan?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/307254/61916/17285656/s65_sherman.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16456, "name": "Romantic Relationships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romantic_Relationships?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1262149, "name": "Singleness/ Singlehood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singleness_Singlehood?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 20434120, "title": "A \"Great Affective Divide\": How Gay Singaporeans Overcome Their Double Alienation", "created_at": "2016-01-21T06:12:16.744-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20434120/A_Great_Affective_Divide_How_Gay_Singaporeans_Overcome_Their_Double_Alienation?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_20434120", "summary": "Since its independence in 1965, Singapore has been trying to unify its diverse ethnic, linguistic, and religious communities under one coherent national identity. Queer Singaporeans, however, suffer from a double alienation from the nation. While socially ostracised by the existing anti-sodomy Section 377A and the queer-unfriendly state policies that it justifies, they also suffer from that inability to identify with the nation called the \u2018Great Affective Divide\u2019. In this essay, I aim to achieve two goals. Firstly, I invoke the idea of cultural citizenship as I ethnographically investigate the efforts that queer Singaporeans make to overcome their national estrangement, particularly an event called \u2018Pink Dot\u2019. While such efforts do not receive universal support from queers, they are essential in the development of a better understanding of it means to be citizens of Singapore. Secondly, rather than wanting to remain socially marginal and critical of the norm, queers actually express their desire for national inclusion through Pink Dot. Yet, I argue that it would be erroneous to read this desire as \u2018homonationalism\u2019. As such, Pink Dot provides a fertile example that counters the conventional view within Queer Studies that queers always resist the hetero-patriarchal norm.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45052291, "asset_id": 20434120, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3078274, "first_name": "Chris K.

Its unexceptional presence belies a rich cartographical history and infamous reputation for leading ships to grief since antiquity. Pedra Branca was first pushed into the spotlight when the British constructed the Horsburgh Lighthouse in 1851. It later caught international attention when a heated territorial dispute for the island between Singapore and Malaysia arose, lasting from 1979 to 2018, with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) eventually granting rights to Singapore. The ensuing legal battle led to renewed interest in the geography and post-19th century history of the island. The most recent breakthrough, however, provides a glimpse into an even earlier history of Pedra Branca - and, by extension, Singapore - as shipwrecked remains dating from the 14th century were uncovered in the surrounding waters. Historical research on the ancient history of Pedra Branca has been mostly neglected by scholars over the years; thus, this paper aims to shed some light on this enigmatic history of the island and at the same time establish its history and significance by utilizing pre-British-colonization historical cartographical data from as early as the 15th century.

Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand carry the impression that they are the origins of cheap, sometimes easily exploitable, migrant labor for employers in Taiwan. Many people in Taiwan also see the former two countries as sources of brides for lower-income men. These same countries, along with Cambodia and, to a lesser degree, Malaysia, are locations where Taiwanese capital is invested in factories for low-cost labor, proximity to Taiwan and China, and the relative absence of political contentiousness for being Taiwanese. With the advent of cheap air travel, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also offer the middle class in these areas options for quick holiday getaways. These interactions and the condescension toward Southeast Asia that sometimes accompany them belie the rich history of interactions that Taiwan and Southeast Asia share.\n\nhttp://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=831", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55538728, "asset_id": 35667987, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Today these societies are experiencing unprecedented social challenges to the filial tradition of adult children caring for aging parents at home. Marshalling mixed methods data, this volume explores the complexities of aging and caregiving in contemporary East Asia. Drawing on ethnographic, demographic, policy, archival, and media data, the authors trace both common patterns and diverging trends across China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and Korea.

chapter examines how the Malay Peninsula shaped the ethnological and historical writings of the nineteenth-century British scholar-administrator of Southeast Asia, John Crawfurd (1783-1868), who

By analysing the manner in which he collected his information and made sense of the inhabitants of the region and their history, this paper also offers a closer glimpse on the workings of British, and European, intellectual discourse on foreign places during the colonial period, and invites us to think beyond the simplistic framework of knowledge as a tool of Western imperial domination.

What, then, accounts for the many centuries when it seemed not to thrive, and was seen in the words of John Crawfurd as \u201conly the occasional resort of pirates\u201d? This seeming paradox sits uneasily at the heart of Singapore historiography, and over time historians have suggested a variety of ways to resolve it. This volume collects studies about Singapore before 1800 bringing together different efforts across the 20th century at reconstructing Singapore\u2019s \u201cmissing years\u201d. Some authors have found additional details by scouring ancient and early modern texts for references to Singapore, and by reading well-known classics such as the Sejarah Melayu against the grain. Others have built narratives that bridge pre- and post-1800 perspectives by positioning Singapore within long-term global history. These efforts have yielded a much richer understanding of Singapore\u2019s changing fortunes before 1800. The articles collected in this volume represent key milestones in this effort.

Based upon a collection of policy texts from 2002 to 2012, our analysis illustrates that the metaphor of diversity in policy texts provides ways for systemic discrimination within the education system and that this inequality is given legitimacy as necessary through various moral discourses. The paper employs a critical discourse analysis that draws upon the relationship between language analysis, the philosophical study of valuation, and political economy as a composite formulation of values to highlight the ways in which an argument for inequality permeates policy from within a frame of meritocracy, and to analyse how changes associated with new modes of value determination serve to legitimize inequality.\r\n\r\n1. The article questions and challenges the official meritocratic principle of \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 (Wong, 2000) in Singapore's education system. Drawing on Foucault's and Nietzsche's philosophical perspectives, there is an explicit illustration through an in-depth analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in policy report/speech.\r\n\r\n2. Discourse builds in/tangible structures in society and greatly determines the possibilities of the now. As such, I am also arguing that it would be more difficult to 'help' any 'community' if the structural discrimination which has been deeply embedded, is not made explicit through national policies, and by this I mean an explicit illustration through an in-depth policy analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in Singapore's education policies. It may be through this that discriminatory structures could be substantially challenged.\r\n\r\nAn initial analysis of the original 1979 policy on primary school streaming which I conducted illustrates how dichotomous (arbitrary) categorization of pupils, i.e. 'slow' and 'fast' learners legitimates and sustains increasing institutional/structural access (over the years terms like 'talents' have been employed in policy discourse), of who gets privileged knowledge access. Through this, I also ask then to what ends do forms of 'categorization' or conventional designation entail? By this, given that categorization legitimizes structural access, my question is, what is 'Malay/Muslim community' and how is this categorization necessary?\r\n\r\n3. Even though the analysis in the article was based on Singapore's education system, it provides possible ways of understanding how inequality is continuously being inbuilt through policies on the basis of the ideology that economic growth is the (only) way forward. A way to critique this ideology is to expose its underlying assumptions. I believe the findings have much resonance with the widening inequality across many developed nations, as Singapore's policies have parallels with that of the U.K., U.S., and international organizations such as the World Bank.\r\n\r\n4. Economically considered, the transliteration of meritocratic discourse into the metaphor of diversity pinpoints how the appeal of development for all necessarily also demands the advance of inequity for the sake of the whole, i.e. advancing the 'growth with inequity' principle.\r\n\r\n5. The analysis highlights that value judgments are continually at work in the policy discourse and that despite the strong discourse of meritocracy that the Singapore education system promotes, it is argued that it is in the interests of the Singapore people that 'talents' should get privileged access to knowledge as it is through this that more 'opportunities' for the rest of the population are created. The findings demonstrate that although the underlying assumptions of this 'logic' that has been constructed in policies are unsubstantiated, the logic is continuously legitimated through forms of e/valuations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article has been featured in websites such as:

existing research on toponymy in Singapore by focusing on the many offshore islands that form an inalienable component of the landscape of the Lion City. Diverging from more micro reconstruction-based toponymic approaches, the analysis adopts a critical toponomastics framework, placing emphasis on the interaction between the use and maintenance of toponyms and the wider socio-political context. Acknowledging the complex past of Singapore\u2019s becoming, the period of British colonial rule forms the basis in which contemporary toponyms are treated in the study. Both old and newly reclaimed offshore islands are considered, and this article ultimately finds Singapore\u2019s toponymic landscape to have remained relatively stable. The stasis does not represent a lack of development, for it instead reveals that the unchanging naming practices are in fact responses to socio-political contexts diachronically unveiled between colonial and contemporary Singapore. Situating toponomastics within the wider development of Singapore as the post-colonial nation it is today, this paper reveals how the landscape has sought to cement social, economic, and political goals.\n\nKey words: Historical Toponomastics, Island Toponymy, Toponymic Landscapes, Singapore, Colonial Place Names", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75914564, "asset_id": 63503877, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4424566, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Perono Cacciafoco", "domain_name": "xjtlu", "page_name": "FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco", "display_name": "Francesco Perono Cacciafoco", "profile_url": "https://xjtlu.academia.edu/FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4424566/1801903/2148322/s65_francesco.perono_cacciafoco.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2717, "name": "Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etymology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3904, "name": "Onomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 4469, "name": "Toponomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponomastics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 13239, "name": "Place Names (Cultural Geography)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Names_Cultural_Geography_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16337, "name": "Lexicography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lexicography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 34818, "name": "Toponymy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponymy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 90016, "name": "Topography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Topography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 130755, "name": "Names", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Names?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 130809, "name": "Place Names", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Names?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 174666, "name": "Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islands?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 444741, "name": "Onomastics, Toponomastics, Hydronyms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics_Toponomastics_Hydronyms?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 32932769, "title": "The Doctor Turned Diplomat: John Crawfurd's Writings on the Malay Peninsula, Biblioasia Apr-Jun 2017", "created_at": "2017-05-10T01:08:15.236-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32932769/The_Doctor_Turned_Diplomat_John_Crawfurds_Writings_on_the_Malay_Peninsula_Biblioasia_Apr_Jun_2017?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_32932769", "summary": "John Crawfurd, the 19th-century British colonial administrator in Southeast Asia, was known for his insightful writings on ethnology and history in the Malay Peninsula.

It attempts to explain how the judiciary in Singapore actually functions, partly by using the concept of the core executive to locate the judiciary more accurately within its political context. The study demonstrates that the judicial system has been hegenomized by a number of political and bureaucratic strategies, and interprets its role in terms of the overall goals of the political executive. The lower judiciary is an amateur judiciary and forms part of the executive government. Despite this, the contemporary superior judiciary is not wholly a creature of the political executive, as is often postulated, but rather the result of a compromise which balances the need for a reputable judiciary with the requirement by the political executive for the judicial system to assist with the control of political opposition. This negotiated balance is qualitatively different from the relationship that characterized that between the Lee Kuan Yew governments and their Supreme Courts until 1991 and reflects the maturing of hegemonic control strategies under Goh Chok Tong. The analysis was completed in 1999.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32936341, "asset_id": 1833345, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2246483,

"dom_id": "work_31300973", "summary": "The book compares different approaches to urban development in Singapore and Seoul over the past decades, by focusing on community participation in the transformation of neighbourhoods and its impact on the built environment and communal life. Singapore and Seoul are known for their rapid economic growth and urbanisation under a strong control of developmental state in the past. However, these cities are at a critical crossroads of societal transformation, where participatory and community-based urban development is gaining importance. This new approach can be seen as a result of a changing relationship between the state and civil society, where an emerging partnership between both aims to overcome the limitations of earlier urban development. The book draws attention to the possibilities and challenges that these cities face while moving towards a more inclusive and socially sustainable post-developmental urbanisation. By applying a comparative perspective to understand the evolving urban paradigms in Singapore and Seoul, this unique and timely book offers insights for scholars, professionals and students interested in contemporary Asian urbanisation and its future trajectories.\n\nhttp://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811019852", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51696489, "asset_id": 31300973, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5412308, "first_name": "Bla\u017e", "last_name": "Kri\u017enik", "domain_name": "hanyang", "page_name": "blaz", "display_name": "Bla\u017e Kri\u017enik", "profile_url": "https://hanyang.academia.edu/blaz?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5412308/6484843/7333703/s65_bla_.kri_nik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3470, "name": "Community Engagement & Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Engagement_and_Participation?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3902, "name": "Korean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6422, "name": "Urban Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Regeneration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 19298, "name": "Community Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Participation?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 25072, "name": "Social sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_sustainability?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 28849, "name": "Urban Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Development?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 35646, "name": "Community Empowerment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Empowerment?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 272073, "name": "Seoul", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seoul?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 2357156, "title": "The Closure of the National Bio-bank in Singapore", "created_at": "2013-01-03T11:25:13.765-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2357156/The_Closure_of_the_National_Bio_bank_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_2357156", "summary": "The Singapore Bio-Bank (SBB), originally known as Singapore Tissue Network (STN), was established in 2002 as a national non-pro\ue000t tissue bank under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and the Agency \ue001or Science, Technology and Research in Singapore (A*STAR).

The first were descendants of Chinese sea-faring merchants who settled in the Nanyang colonies such as Batavia (Jakarta) and Penang and Malacca, where some of the earliest portraits still survive. The Straits Chinese did not only established themselves in the Straits Settlements but also in many parts of the archipelago where they were equally as prominent and firmly established. Hence, Colonial Singapore and the Straits Settlements cannot be talked about separate from other Straits Chinese communities from other colonies. The paintings and photographs in the NUS Museum Straits Chinese Collection and the Peranakan Museum\u2019s Straits Chinese Chinese portrait collections has formed most of the content of this study.  As these are the first of these types of pictures to be studied and seen rigorously, this study is limited to portraits of the early Chinese residents in Singapore and the older colonial settlements such as Malacca, Penang and Java. Although there is to be found, some portraits of Arabs, Chettiars, Malays and Europeans, they will not be included in the scope of this study. The Chinese, being the most populous of the groups, have provided for the bulk of surviving examples of portraits were produced by Chinese artists as well as portraits depicting the Chinese. \n\nThis early period of artistic production that warrants requisite attention and should be situated at the very threshold of early modernities in Singapore\u2019s History of Art. A revision of this historiography is therefore deservedly requisite. In addition, the development of artistic practices in Singapore have undeniably inextricable connections to the artistic practices in her neighboring countries, hence must be articulated not by national narratives nor circumscribed by national borders. These recent discoveries of early pictures germane to this study will therefore be a pioneering attempt at establishing a new framework for Singapore\u2019s History of Art.\n\n",

Solar power has the greatest potential. Given the country\u2019s limited spare land, rooftops and vertical spaces on high-rise buildings are of particular importance. Singapore set a target of producing solar energy to cover 350,000 households in 2030 that would be equivalent to 4% of the country\u2019s current electricity demand. In 2019, solar energy accounted for less than 1% of Singapore\u2019s total energy mix.

Before this date \u2013 we\u2019ve been told \u2013 \u201cnothing very much appears to have happened in Singapore\u201d. Pre-1819 Singapore was a sleepy, historically insignificant fishing village, little more than the \u201coccasional resort of pirates\u201d. This ambitious book, co-written by four of Singapore\u2019s foremost historians, offers an assertive re-evaluation of that view, firmly situating Singapore\u2019s starting point seven hundred years ago. Drawing on a multi-disciplinary range of archival, textual and cartographical records, as well as the latest archaeological discoveries, the authors cast a singular historical trajectory for Singapore over the past seven centuries, animating its history like never before. Written in a compelling and accessible manner, and richly illustrated with more than 200 artefacts, photographs, maps, art works and ephemera, this volume builds upon the foundations of an earlier book, Si...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86125351, "asset_id": 68156511, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23048684, "first_name": "Derek", "last_name": "Heng", "domain_name": "nau", "page_name": "DerekHeng", "display_name": "Derek  Heng", "profile_url": "https://nau.academia.edu/DerekHeng?f_ri=50974", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 41327, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 117855, "name": "Maritime Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 273287, "name": "Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Johor?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 41218146, "title": "Legal and Regulatory Framework of Islamic Banking and Finance: A Study in Singapore", "created_at": "2019-12-07T19:49:36.419-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41218146/Legal_and_Regulatory_Framework_of_Islamic_Banking_and_Finance_A_Study_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_41218146", "summary": "The aim of this paper is to examine the Islamic Banking and Finance (IBF) industry in Singapore.

This study analyses Singapore's legal and regulatory framework of IBF to review the legal and regulatory framework which promotes the development of Islamic finance in Singapore. IBF in Singapore has been treated equally as the conventional banking under the same regulatory framework, with little guidelines on Shariah governance in the country.

Following this acknowledgement, a need to specify how different innovation based industrialization policies adopted by these countries determined and directed their path emerged in the development discourse. This paper aims to explore the dynamics of the dependencies between various actors by investigating the effects of the specific innovation policies adopted by different countries on their development. While recognizing possible shortfalls born from reliance on quantitative data, a perspective that utilizes relevant indicators from World Bank statistics is nonetheless adopted in the described exploration process of the innovative performance led industrialization components in the chosen cases of Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. At the end of our study, we expect to confirm initial predictions of 1-) selective government intervention is an undeniably important component of industrialization, 2-) there is no single path to industrialization and 3-) although export-oriented technology manufacturing has helped the three case study countries in the past, the current global situation now requires the other developing countries to form their own path suited to their own capabilities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41065009, "asset_id": 20174662, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

This article examines the conditions and consequences of the riot in Singapore and posits that the event signified a rupture in the politics of multicultural practice. It analyses media representations, official state narratives and vitriolic public responses to consider how the voices of the rioters have been violently silenced. Framed by what Georges Bataille terms the dialectic of civilized speech versus silent violence, where silence is regarded as dispossession and objectification, and vocality as empowerment and subjectivity, this article considers the performativities of silence and violence, and the ways the riot is an event of dissensus, a politics of interruption that fractures hegemonic, state-prescribed narratives of multiculturalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55325457, "asset_id": 15440029, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3304216, "first_name": "Marcus", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "MarcusTan", "display_name": "Marcus Tan", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/MarcusTan?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3304216/1100376/2916493/s65_marcus.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1492, "name": "Racial and Ethnic Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_Ethnic_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6013, "name": "Performativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performativity?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6749, "name": "Cultural Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 71529, "name": "Silence Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silence_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 286499, "name": "Theatre, Performance Studies, Voice and Sound Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Performance_Studies_Voice_and_Sound_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1294985, "name": "Voice Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Voice_Studies?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 10108325, "title": "History of Music Space at The Substation", "created_at": "2015-01-11T03:12:20.622-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10108325/History_of_Music_Space_at_The_Substation?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_10108325", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36227733, "asset_id": 10108325, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2108071, "first_name": "Jun Kai", "last_name": "POW", "domain_name": "nlb", "page_name": "JunPow", "display_name": "Jun Kai POW", "profile_url": "https://nlb.academia.edu/JunPow?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2108071/685862/18499773/s65_jun.pow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 70919278, "title": "Revisiting the Past to Understand the Present: The Linguistic Ecology of the Singapore Deaf Community and the Historical Evolution of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL)", "created_at": "2022-02-08T04:02:03.630-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70919278/Revisiting_the_Past_to_Understand_the_Present_The_Linguistic_Ecology_of_the_Singapore_Deaf_Community_and_the_Historical_Evolution_of_Singapore_Sign_Language_SgSL_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_70919278", "summary": "Singapore, a young nation with a colonial past from 1819, has seen drastic changes in the sociolinguistic landscape, which has left indelible marks on the Singapore society and the Singapore deaf community. The country has experienced many political and social transitions from British colonialism to attaining independence in 1965 and thereafter. Since independence, English-based bilingualism has been vigorously promoted as part of nation-building. While the roles of the multiple languages in use in Singapore feature prominently in the discourse on language planning, historical records show no mention of how these impacts on the deaf community. The first documented deaf person in archival documents is a Chinese deaf immigrant from Shanghai who established the first deaf school in Singapore in 1954 teaching Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) and Mandarin. Since then, the Singapore deaf community has seen many shifts and transitions in education programming for deaf children, which has also been largely influenced by exogeneous factors such as trends in deaf education in the United States A pivotal change that has far-reaching impact on the deaf community today, is the introduction of Signing Exact English (SEE) in 1976. This was in keeping with the statal English-based bilingual narrative. The subsequent decision to replace SSL with SEE has dramatic consequences for the current members of the deaf community resulting in internal divisions and fractiousness with lasting implications for the cohesion of the community. This publication traces the origins of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) by giving readers (and future scholars) a road map on key issues and moments in this history. Bi- and multi-lingualism in Singapore as well as external forces will also be discussed from a social and historical perspective, along with the interplay of different forms of language ideologies. All the different sign languages and sign systems as well as the written/spoken languages used in Singapore, interact and compete with as well as influence each other. There will be an exploration of how both internal factors (local language ecology) and external factors (international trends and developments in deaf education), impact on how members of the deaf community negotiate their deaf identities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80471300, "asset_id": 70919278, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18155523, "first_name": "Phoebe", "last_name": "Tay", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "PhoebeTay", "display_name": "Phoebe Tay", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/PhoebeTay?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18155523/5067956/17781849/s65_phoebe.tay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10632, "name": "World Englishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Englishes?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17292, "name": "Deaf Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deaf_Education?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36467, "name": "Language Ideologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Ideologies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 117612, "name": "Deaf history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deaf_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 380069, "name": "Linguistic Imperialism in Postcolonial Era and Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Imperialism_in_Postcolonial_Era_and_Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 37056743, "title": "It\u2019s Complicated: Singapore\u2013China Relations, an Overview", "created_at": "2018-07-16T08:27:58.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37056743/It_s_Complicated_Singapore_China_Relations_an_Overview?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_37056743", "summary": "Independent Singapore and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) have a historically varied and complex relationship. The two states enjoy excellent economic ties, which have been a key feature of bilateral interactions since the PRC\u2019s \u201cOpening and Reform\u201d initiative in the late 1970s. Substantial cultural, educational and tourist exchanges are also a feature of Singapore\u2013PRC relations. Yet diplomatic ties have only recently reverted to a general cordiality after a protracted two-year period of friction. There have been other, longer periods of estrangement between Singapore and Beijing \u2013 Singapore discouraged its citizens from having contact with the PRC during the Cultural Revolution and established official ties with the PRC only in 1992.\n\nSingapore and the PRC are deeply economically intertwined. The PRC is Singapore\u2019s largest trading partner, as well as being the largest of the other member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As a major international capital exporter, Singapore is the PRC\u2019s second-largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI). Singaporean investments in the PRC include major government-linked development projects in Suzhou, Tianjin and Chengdu, in addition to regular commercial interests. Globalized production and capital networks mean that the Singaporean and Chinese economies also connect through other economies in the region and beyond.\n\nWhat must be noted, however, is the diversification of Singapore\u2019s economy: ASEAN, the United States, Europe and Japan remain substantial trading partners for Singapore. Moreover, the United States, Europe and Japan are still larger investors in Singapore than the PRC in terms of both FDI and capital stock. Even if some proportion of trade and investment tilts more favourably towards the PRC, especially as Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) gets underway, Singapore is likely to continue to seek economic options beyond the PRC. These relationships provide Singapore with some buffer against overdependence on the PRC.\n\nThe BRI obviously presents opportunities for Singapore. Indeed, Singapore was one of the earliest members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which is associated with the project. To the extent that infrastructure development promotes growth in Singapore\u2019s immediate neighbourhood, this could raise demand for Singaporean goods and services. Prosperous neighbours are likely to be more invested in regional security. Of course, Hong Kong is likely to offer competition to Singapore, particularly in terms of financial and finance-related services. Moreover, Singapore\u2019s economy has been diversifying away from maritime services \u2014 they now account for only about 7 percent of GDP. This mitigates some of the pressure resulting from enhancements in regional transport infrastructure.\n\nExternalities that could result from the BRI may be cause for greater concern. Economic benefits from the initiative that flow to various business and political elites in Southeast Asia may make the establishment of consensus more difficult among ASEAN members, particularly over issues that Beijing deems sensitive. Limited transparency and unclear corporate governance in the BRI projects may encourage rent-seeking and abuse, as well as distributions of costs and benefits that foster political instability. Furthermore, uncertainty over dispute management stemming from investment projects introduces higher degrees of risk in such projects. \u201cWin\u2013win\u201d approaches and \u201csetting differences aside\u201d are fine until problems that require urgent management or resolution emerge.\n\nRules, procedures, norms, laws, processes, and their practice, especially as they pertain to strategic restraint by the powerful, are especially important to Singapore. This is an area of some divergence between Beijing and Singapore. Singapore tends to favour stronger, binding processes that guarantee a degree of even-handedness.\n\nAn area where Singapore\u2013PRC differences over rules and processes are especially noticeable is over the rule of law in the South China Sea. When the Philippines sought an interpretation from an arbitral tribunal over claims on maritime features in waters it disputes with Beijing, the PRC called the processes flawed, refused direct participation and rejected the ruling of the tribunal. Singapore, in comparison, stressed the importance of the legal process and the binding nature of its findings even though it is not a South China Sea claimant. Rather, Singapore felt that complying with such internationally established legal procedures offered a better means of handling differences, maintaining stability and protecting its interests. A similar distinction appears to divide Singapore and the PRC over the degree to which a South China Sea code of conduct should be binding. Such differences recently presented key points of contention and friction between the PRC and Singapore.\n\nMore knotty for Singapore is, perhaps, the way ethnicity intersects with PRC nationalism. Given that Singapore\u2019s population is 70 per cent ethnic Han Chinese, many PRC citizens and even officials believe that Singapore should be particularly understanding of, if not sympathetic to, PRC concerns. This includes issues such as the PRC\u2019s various territorial disputes and suspicions of the United States and Japan. There is sometimes surprise, a sense of betrayal, and even anger from PRC official quarters when Singapore\u2019s official position diverges from that of Beijing. Such perspectives come from a sense of Chinese nationalism that rests heavily on linking ethnicity to political loyalty to the PRC.\n\nSingapore and its Chinese citizens, however, do not and should not share the same sense of nationalism as in the PRC. Despite historical linkages between Chinese nationalist movements, ethnic Chinese in Singapore now have very different political loyalties. Even though Singaporean Chinese may speak languages and share cultural practices that originated from what is today the PRC, they are no more Chinese citizens than French-Canadians are French citizens. Singapore\u2019s post-independence nation-building project continues to be about creating distinct Singapore citizens. Such a position is critical given the need to hold together Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic population and avoid characterisation as a potentially hostile Chinese \u201cfifth column\u201d by its neighbours.\n\nThe PRC is one of Singapore\u2019s most important foreign relationships. Much of this comes from the fact that the PRC is critical to prosperity and stability in Asia. Singapore\u2019s future is in many ways tied to the PRC doing well. However, Singapore will continue to seek other partnerships, inside its region and out, for the simple reason that such diversification of ties is an effective risk management strategy. This means that Singapore has an incentive to continue engagement with Europe, Australia, India, Japan, the United States and others. Singapore also has a longstanding interest in binding international rules that it prefers major powers, including the PRC, to abide by.\n\nTo the extent that Beijing accepts an open and inclusive Southeast Asia as well as established and binding rules, the Singapore\u2013PRC relationship is likely to continue smoothly. That said, predictability and comfort in the Singapore\u2013PRC relationship also depend on a continued commitment to the region by Singapore\u2019s other international partners. The positive trajectory of Singapore\u2019s current ties with the PRC rests on such conditions being sustained. If this situation changes, as may arguably be the case at present, Singapore\u2019s relationship with the PRC may become more fraught and require some recalibration.", "downloadable_attachments":

The narrative begins in the colonial era, at the point when the transfer of photographic technology occurred between visiting practitioners and local photographers. With individual chapters dedicated to the countries of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, The Philippines and Vietnam, the bulk of the book spans the post-WWII era to the contemporary, focusing on practitioners who operate with agency and autonomy. The relationship between art and photography, which has been defined very narrowly over the decades, is re-examined in the process.

Chinese-language newspapers and other sources to create a comprehensive view of how the Chinese-speaking community in Singapore perceived David Marshall and his government. It draws a contrast with how he was regarded by the English-language press and by the British. It argues that Marshall was an effective and highly regarded Chief Minister who succeeded in passing many reforms that were important to the Chinese community. While Marshall was limited by his own lack of political skill and by a divided minority government, he was able to exploit British fears of a radical Chinese electorate to enable his success. As a result, Marshall was far more successful than anyone predicted, and tremendously popular among the Chinese throughout his term in office. The David Marshall government thus demonstrates how effective Singapore\u2019s repre- sentative government could be, even in its limited form. This article also illustrates the importance of vernacular sources and multiple perspectives to developing a more complete historical analysis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30246523, "asset_id": 2195036, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 380793, "first_name": "Pingtjin", "last_name": "Thum", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "PingtjinThum", "display_name": "Pingtjin Thum", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/PingtjinThum?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/380793/118176/2411453/s65_pingtjin.thum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19197, "name": "Decolonialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonialization?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29367, "name": "Subaltern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subaltern_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 614845, "name": "Singapore Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Political_History?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 63500332, "title": "Isles and Their Stories: A Study of Three Islands of the Singapore Archipelago", "created_at": "2021-12-07T20:21:18.382-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63500332/Isles_and_Their_Stories_A_Study_of_Three_Islands_of_the_Singapore_Archipelago?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_63500332", "summary": "This paper studies three Singaporean islands (with their original Malay names in brackets): St. John\u2019s Island (Pulau Sakijang Bendera), Sentosa (Pulau Blakang Mati), and Coney Island (Pulau Serangoon). Using primary sources, such as maps and newspapers, and secondary sources, like books on Singaporean toponymy, the authors trace these place names across time. The toponyms conform to the broader trend of naming patterns of Singaporean toponyms. More importantly, the facilities, land uses, and histories of the three islands dovetail with pertinent aspects of Singapore\u2019s history and, more broadly, with global discussions on linguistic toponymies and geographies. Through this research, it is evident that the toponyms, or place names, along with their connected stories, are inextricably linked to the history, languages, cultures, and societies of the places they name. This paper ultimately aims to be a starting point for further research on Singapore\u2019s island names, an area that has received scant attention in Singaporean toponymy thus far. \n\nKeywords: Singapore, Toponymy, Toponomastics, Historical Geography, Islands, Insulonyms, Islotoponomastics, Island Names, Sociolinguistics ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75912258, "asset_id": 63500332, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4424566, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Perono Cacciafoco", "domain_name": "xjtlu", "page_name": "FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco", "display_name": "Francesco Perono Cacciafoco", "profile_url": "https://xjtlu.academia.edu/FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4424566/1801903/2148322/s65_francesco.perono_cacciafoco.jpg"}, {"id": 70653847, "first_name": "Shaun", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "ShaunLim", "display_name": "Shaun Lim", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/ShaunLim?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/70653847/39788533/42161614/s65_shaun.lim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2717, "name": "Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etymology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3904, "name": "Onomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 4469, "name": "Toponomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponomastics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 13239, "name": "Place Names (Cultural Geography)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Names_Cultural_Geography_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16337, "name": "Lexicography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lexicography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 34818, "name": "Toponymy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponymy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 90016, "name": "Topography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Topography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 130755, "name": "Names", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Names?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 130809, "name": "Place Names", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Names?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 174666, "name": "Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islands?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 444741, "name": "Onomastics, Toponomastics, Hydronyms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics_Toponomastics_Hydronyms?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44519348, "title": "Water Reuse in Singapore: The New Frontier in a Framework of a Circular Economy?", "created_at": "2020-11-17T08:36:40.651-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44519348/Water_Reuse_in_Singapore_The_New_Frontier_in_a_Framework_of_a_Circular_Economy?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44519348", "summary": "As part of the circular economy, there is increasing interest internationally in water reuse, reclaimed water or recycled wastewater. This interest responds to water scarcity concerns at present and to demands projected for the resource by all sectors in the future, which will surpass freshwater available. It also responds to the incentive to close the water loop and extend the lifetime of water resources through longer use, with the related economic, social and environmental benefits. In this chapter, we discuss water reuse in Singapore where it has been implemented since 2003 for potable and non-potable uses, putting in practice the concept of circular economy. We argue that water reuse is part of a comprehensive framework of water security in the city state that considers long-term policy, planning, management, governance and technological developments. As essential foundations for a reliable water reuse system, we discuss water resources management related institutional and legal frameworks and their evolution over time. We conclude that water reuse is one of the most important pillars for Singapore to provide safe and reliable water sources at present and looking towards the future.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64962143, "asset_id": 44519348, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66038744, "first_name": "Cecilia", "last_name": "Tortajada", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "CeciliaTortajada", "display_name": "Cecilia Tortajada", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/CeciliaTortajada?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/66038744/17208015/71909957/s65_cecilia.tortajada.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5167, "name": "Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Governance?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51731, "name": "Water Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_Security?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77723, "name": "Water Reuse and Recycling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_Reuse_and_Recycling?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 321721, "name": "Circular Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Circular_Economy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 37304992, "title": "'Historicity and the Contemporary Theatre of Kuo Pao Kun and Krishen Jit'", "created_at": "2018-08-28T07:39:45.515-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37304992/Historicity_and_the_Contemporary_Theatre_of_Kuo_Pao_Kun_and_Krishen_Jit?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_37304992", "summary": "What is the place of contemporary art forms from the 1980s within the present global dispensation in which the attempt to obliterate temporality transpired, as witnessed in the Hegelian revivalism of Francis Fukuyama\u2019s The End of History and the Last Man (1992)? This essay suggests that the contemporary of contemporary art in Singapore and Malaysia is less a period style and more a differing artistic response to the end of temporality as a situation. The idea of contemporary art entails the existence of an idea of the contemporary. Temporality, in turn, is to be comprehended as the way time is conceptualised and lived out in society. The contemporary is both an idea of the time in which we\nare in and a goal of reacting more effectively to the demands of the immediate present. And a part of the 1980s was a sense that earlier regional formations of modern art that had eradicated traditional cultural forms as backward needed to be rethought. The artistic practices of Singapore playwright and director Kuo Pao Kun (1939-2002) and Malaysian director Krishen Jit (1939-2005) are major examples of such artistic responses. Their work incarnates a contemporary in which historicity, cultural memory, and interpretations of traditional art forms had roles. Their overlapping theatre commitments require us to see their engagement with the issue of plural identities within and without the modernising nation-state (for Kuo) and within the boundaries of the modernising nation-state (for Jit) in the decades of the 1980s and 1990s, when that great modern ideology of nationalism was being revamped by globalising imperatives. They represent a shared engagement with a common colonial-era Malayan legacy of multiracialism and state formation from the Cold War. Historicity for Kuo and Jit is not the modernist desire to reconstruct the fragments of the past into a whole, and is not centrally about the representation of the past (though that occurs), but is in the first instance the need to capture the past\u2019s fragments in order to conceive a fuller sense of the present\u2019s multicultural opportunities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57260716, "asset_id": 37304992, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7346585, "first_name": "C.

This thesis seeks to understand the pros and cons of Chinese literature education in Singapore by analysing its development over the years.

How have these earlier research themes transformed in our current era of intensified neoliberalism, cyber-connectivity and mobility? This article draws from the title of the blockbuster 2010 film Eat Pray Love (partially set in Bali) to highlight several emergent 21 st century themes that bear relevance for our understanding of the interplay between tourism and ethnicity in insular Southeast Asia. Starting with \" eating \" , I outline how the increasing appeal and rhetoric of the slow and sustainable food movements offers a promising avenue for scholarship on tourism and ethnicity, opening up new lines of research spotlighting the multisensory dimensions of touristic ethnicity, as well as the ties between food, ethno-cultural sensibilities and visions of morality. Turning to the theme of \" praying \" , the article explores emergent research on religious and spiritually-inspired tourism in insular Southeast Asia. I also discuss the need to better understand how the post 9-11 and post-Bali bombing era of heightened religious identity-consciousness in insular Southeast Asia (as well as on the part of travelers) bears relevance for emergent dynamics pertaining to tourism and ethnicity. Finally, I turn to examine the third component of the film's title, \" love \" and its relevance for novel insights into tourism and ethnicity in contemporary island Southeast Asia. I draw on this final term loosely as a springboard for considering the need to better explore the realm of the emotions in our studies of tourism and ethnicity. Here, I underscore the need for further nuanced studies of tourists who take on or celebrate idealized identities of ethnic Others, either through marriage, emulation, or by partaking in festival tourism. I also address some of the complex emotional ambivalence regarding ethnic heritage experienced by Southeast Asian diaspora tourists and return migrant tourists. Throughout the article I illustrate some of the potentials and challenges entailed in these new avenues of inquiry with reference to recent anthropological and sociological work in various parts of island Southeast Asia. I also draw on examples and illustrations from my ongoing research on far-flung Toraja (Indonesian) migrants whose recreational returns to the homeland for family visits and international festivals entail varied re-imaginings of identity and ethno-cultural heritage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47002381, "asset_id": 26722075, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28011, "first_name": "Kathleen", "last_name": "Adams", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "KathleenAdams", "display_name": "Kathleen M Adams", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/KathleenAdams?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28011/9143/10440268/s65_kathleen.adams.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4071, "name": "Heritage Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Tourism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6275, "name": "Tourism Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Geography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 7860, "name": "Cultural Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Tourism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 9932, "name": "Travel & Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_and_Tourism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 22559, "name": "Philippine Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 25237, "name": "Food and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Tourism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43883, "name": "Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 172509, "name": "Religious Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Tourism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 391715, "name": "Ethnicity and National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_National_Identity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1033294, "name": "Heritage, Tourism, and National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Tourism_and_National_Identity?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 17595961, "title": "Reclaiming Solid Earth from the Legal Sea - Poh Boon Kiat v Public Prosecutor: A Case Commentary", "created_at": "2015-11-02T00:08:52.151-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17595961/Reclaiming_Solid_Earth_from_the_Legal_Sea_Poh_Boon_Kiat_v_Public_Prosecutor_A_Case_Commentary?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_17595961", "summary": "The Magistrate\u2019s Appeal case of Poh Boon Kiat v PP  signaled a promising step forward for Singapore\u2019s crackdown on trafficking in persons .

Early nationalist rhetoric about culture touted fusion and hybridity as the desired result of racial harmony, even as government policy enshrined separate but equal policies (CMIO) that rewarded efforts among the four primary ethnic groups to preserve and maintain ancestral cultural traditions. Representations of ethnicity on stage during national day extravaganzas are neatly compartmentalized and predictable, even when people from different ethnic groups perform together. It is politically important to see and hear distinct cultural differences. As a result, long-standing, local hybrid genres, like keroncong, have been recategorized as representative of one ethnicity. Citizens of the nation often castigate Singapore as relentlessly international and a bit boring and there is now doubt among the general population as to whether \"Singaporean\" performance exists in any way not mediated by government policy. Some claim that all performance in Singapore is imported from somewhere else-China, Malaysia, India, or the Anglo-phonic West-and is, therefore, not actually Singaporean. Interviews with long-time Singaporean performers of multiple ethnicities, however, suggest that while local differences in traditional genres have developed in Singapore, these changes are interpreted to be the result of individual aesthetics and agency rather than signs of incipient local style. Using data from interviews, an online survey, archives , and fieldwork in a Carnatic arts academy, I suggest that evading the construction of local styles as Singaporean resists their appropriation for nationalist narratives and maintains politically necessary continuity with ancestral traditions.

In this land-scarce and densely-populated city-state, to purchase a high-end car, landed property, or to have a fine dining experience, ranks amongst the most expensive in all Asian cities. That luxurious approach in life, however, does not find a parallel in death. As this paper indicates, a life of luxuries in Singapore does not necessarily mean deluxe burials, graves, mausoleums, or shrines. In fact, due to scarcity of land and the tight control on its usage, there are limited options for the well-off to display the same sense of wealth in death as they did in life. This paper explores the correlation between elaborate burials and the right to eternal rest, and investigates how a land-deprived country faces the challenge of sustainably balancing modernisation aspirations with respect for burial customs and cultural heritage.

"This study draws on recent scholarship about Chinese Christian textual traditions to analyze the posthumous biographies of Leona Jingling Wu (1897-1974), the prominent leader of John Sung's evangelistic bands in Singapore and founder of the island's first Chinese Protestant higher education institute, Chin Lien Bible Seminary. The essay argues that these biographies \"Confucianized\" Wu by re-casting her as a Chinese-Christian female spiritual model. First, a survey of literary productions from the pre-1970s demonstrates that Wu was initially portrayed as an evangelical rather than a female Confucian model. Second, the process of \"Confucianizing\" Wu only becomes apparent in her biographies written in the 1970s. Three strategies were employed to highlight Wu's Confucian attributes-the re-telling of her Chinese-Christian genealogy, an emphasis on her filiality before she moved to \nSingapore, and the re-imagination of her as a spiritual mother. In all, her biographers re-casted her as a Chinese and Christian who successfully melded the key values of both traditions. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68641540, "asset_id": 50773464, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35491773, "first_name": "Joshua Dao Wei", "last_name": "SIM", "domain_name": "hkbu", "page_name": "JoshuaDaoWeiSIM", "display_name": "Joshua Dao Wei SIM", "profile_url": "https://hkbu.academia.edu/JoshuaDaoWeiSIM?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35491773/10314819/32240974/s65_joshua_dao_wei.sim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2837, "name": "Chinese Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Religions?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16833, "name": "Evangelicalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evangelicalism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19227, "name": "World Christianity and Chinese Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Christianity_and_Chinese_Christianity?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 510588, "name": "Chinese Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Christianity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 549393, "name": "Chinese Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Womens_History?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 35193498, "title": "\u8449\u5b63\u5141\u8207\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u540c\u6fdf\u91ab\u9662 Ye Jiyun and Singapore Thong Chai Medical Institution", "created_at": "2017-11-19T23:40:27.836-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35193498/%E8%91%89%E5%AD%A3%E5%85%81%E8%88%87%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1%E5%90%8C%E6%BF%9F%E9%86%AB%E9%99%A2_Ye_Jiyun_and_Singapore_Thong_Chai_Medical_Institution?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_35193498", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55054484, "asset_id": 35193498, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3829528, "first_name": "I, Lo-fen", "last_name": "\u8863\u82e5\u82ac", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "lofen", "display_name": "I, Lo-fen \u8863\u82e5\u82ac", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/lofen?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3829528/1398737/1719618/s65__._.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26848, "name": "Chinese medicine (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_medicine_History_?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33387918, "title": "Yang, H., Yang, P., & Zhan, S.

In many ways, such negotiations are largely rendered irrelevant in the cyberspace of video-sharing sites, particularly YouTube where countless videos are uploaded, disseminated, commented on and even parodied in a new circulatory network and paradigm. In this respect, for the case of Singapore, the ubiquity of YouTube as a new digital tool of viewership and expression has vernacularised and de-formalised the art and politics of filmmaking. In certain areas, the formal and the informal spheres converge when traditional independent films have found new platforms for exhibition and circulation in the video-sharing sites, while the user generated content of an emerging group of casual amateur YouTube vloggers and commentaries have gained greater public limelight in the mainstream media. As this chapter would argue, not only have such quantitatively more voluminous materials overwhelmed the monitoring mechanisms of the state, more importantly, the multiplication of traditional and new media film materials in more varied platforms have inevitably been redefining film as a singular medium confined to that of the big screen.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46468484, "asset_id": 26130037, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3413577, "first_name": "Liew", "last_name": "Kai Khiun", "domain_name": "hkmu-hk", "page_name": "LiewKaiKhiun", "display_name": "Liew Kai Khiun", "profile_url": "https://hkmu-hk.academia.edu/LiewKaiKhiun?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3413577/51132378/39191349/s65_liew.khiun.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16488, "name": "Film Censorship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Censorship?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42350, "name": "Youtube", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youtube?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 219589, "name": "Arts Management, Cultural Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_Management_Cultural_Policy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 12955566, "title": "Archiving Singapore before 1800", "created_at": "2015-06-12T18:50:19.288-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12955566/Archiving_Singapore_before_1800?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_12955566", "summary": "FORTHCOMING 2023\r\n\r\nThis volume offers selected excerpts from European texts touching on Singapore and the Straits region dating from the period c.1500-1819.

It displaces the locus of cultural difference from highly Orientalized others located outside the metropolitan centers to diffuse populations dispersed across the globe\u201d (TCG, 368). Further, the \u201cdifferences between [Western] centers and [non-Western] margins\u201d are effaced, with non-Western subjection appearing \u201cas a market effect, rather than as the consequence of a Western political project\u201d (TCG, 369).\r\n\r\n\tThere is a risk, though, Coronil notes, that in the process of \u201creferring to capitalism by a single word (and in the singular) and attributing to it features that may give the impression that it is a bounded or self-willed entity, rather than as complex, contradictory, and heterogeneous process mobilized by the actions of innumerable social agents\u201d (TCG, 353).\r\n\r\n\tWhile Coronil\u2019s image of a West now dispersed into the globe is a cogent one, we must not allow this formulation to be so general that it loses its analytical usefulness. Not to inflect how various parts of the world relate and connect to capitalism now is indeed to make capitalism look like a \u201cself-willed entity\u201d and possibly even fails to let us see how \u201cinnumerable social agents\u201d respond to capitalist modernity as a complex phenomenon. Late capitalism may be propelling the world \u201ctoward ever more ever more immaterial domains\u201d under \u201cever more abstract forms of control,\u201d but the processes he writes about are not as \u201cabstract\u201d as he makes it out to be \u2014and neither do developing societies see their subjection as \u201cmerely\u201d a market effect, with their sense of (postcolonial) marginality or, for the more economically advanced, being semi-peripheral effaced.\r\n\r\n\tA number of East and Southeast Asian nations from the 1980s actually have benefited, we know, from the shift by the West into the globe, ranging from the capitalist mini-dragon Singapore to the not-quite-post-socialist Vietnam and, along with them, post-World Trade Organization China. They desire a continued or new part in the current global order. Such desires do not in themselves lead to a lessened sense of the present imperialist modality of domination\u2014even if such \u201cdomination\u201d now also requires some collusion from their \u201cvictims.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe economic and cultural dispersal of the West into the globe itself engenders new forms of cultural difference and production that can link various regional identities into what are (still) limited cosmopolitan versions of \u201cAsia\u201d that attempt to contend with their subordinate positions within what I will call the \u201cglobal West,\u201d and the cosmopolitan culture related with it. Western cosmopolitanism, it has been noted, \u201cis local while denying its own local character.\u201d Indeed, such cosmopolitanism serves \u201cas a relay for the center\u2019s values.\u201d  The values here naturally are the values of the Western metropole, urban centers with an intellectual and cultural predominance because of their wealth. The (now-defunct) East Asian Miracle gave some Asian urban centers the increased confidence that perhaps they could now be influentially cosmopolitan in the same way.\r\n\r\nThis essay will examine two Asian theater practitioners who have created \u201climited cosmopolitan\u201d versions of regional Asia that are connected to but simultaneously contend with the global West. They are Singapore\u2019s theater doyen, the late Kuo Pao Kun (1939-2002), and the rising intercultural theater director, Ong Keng Sen. Kuo\u2019s play, Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral (1995), written both in Mandarin-Chinese and English, worked to extend Singaporean cultural memory in the face of culturally fragmenting economic development by envisaging a fractured, non-statist Singapore-Asian and, indeed, global humanism, even as the playwright depicts the inescapability of servitude to the state and global markets. Ong directed the English-language version of Descendants in 1995 and 1996, and thereafter proceeded to direct a hugely ambitious \u201cintercultural\u201d Asian Lear project. In a way, Kuo\u2019s Descendants and intellectual reflections and Ong\u2019s self-conscious status as an Asian \u201cmodernized\u201d into speaking English as his native tongue enabled the Asian Lear that the Japan Foundation Asia Center (JFAC) produced in 1997 and 1999. JFAC financed its first play to the tune of U.S.$1.2 million as a way of conceiving a \u201cNew Asia\u201d out of various traditional Asian components. This was not a recapturing of a pre-modern past, but imagined a \u201cpresent moment of the past\u201d  and a \u201cmind of Asia\u201d more problematic than even T. S. Eliot\u2019s attempt at recuperating a war-fragmented \u201cmind of Europe.\u201d Producer Hata Yuki  wanted \u201cAsian artists to present a new direction for Asian theatre\u201d  and Ong, hailing from modernized and multi-ethnic Singapore, with the oldest official multicultural policy in the region, seemed the obvious choice to help show the way.\r\n\r\nThe relative success, challenges, or difficulties of such theatrical attempts to imagine such a cosmopolitan Asia must be considered within the already existing constraints of the logic of dispersed Western-now-globalized capitalist modernity in relation to culture. Lear\u2019s thrust, in particular, transpires within the desire of wealthier Asian nations to take their cultural place in the New World Order. While the production critically exceeds the instrumentalist logic of culture and race, as managed and homogenized by Singapore\u2019s People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) government in the interests of becoming modern, and also indicates some of the impasses in this statist identity politics, it does not subvert the state\u2019s identity strategies. Still, Lear is an intra-Asian (if not a South-South) rather than a North-South attempt to ground a pan-Asian space utilizing a cultural practice that tries to transcend national notions of collective memory and create cross-cultural connections. This means that while we should not think of the world in terms of the West and the Rest, neither should we think of it in any overtly direct way as \u201cthe West is all-in-all.\u201d Globalization dialectically fosters multiple cross-cultural and cross-border dialogues out \u201cthere\u201d by Asians within a potentially emerging Asian metropole in relation to the modern-capitalist part of the West inextricably in their midst.

He started coming home late from work, he hardly cared about me or the kids anymore, Sometimes he goes out and doesn't even come back home for about 2-3 days. I did all I could to rectify this problem but all to no avail. I became very worried and needed help. As I was browsing through the Internet one day, I came across a website that suggested that Dr USMAN  can help solve marital problems, restore broken relationships and so on. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he did a spell for me. Two days later, my husband came to me and apologized for the wrongs he did and promised never to do it again. Ever since then, everything has returned back to normal. My family and I are living together happily again.. All thanks to Dr USMAN. If you need a spell caster that can cast a spell that truly works, I suggest you contact him. He will not disappoint you.

TFSV refers to a range of behaviors using or aided by various digital technologies to harm, offend, humiliate, or intimidate women and other individuals, some examples of which include sexual voyeurism, online sexual harassment, and non-consensual distribution of unwanted and sexually explicit content. Although the current scholarship on TFSV has so far examined Australian, North American, and United Kingdom contexts, few academic studies have so far been done in Asian contexts. This is despite rampant TFSV occurrences in Asia in recent years, such as the spy camera epidemic in South Korea and pervasive spread of image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) across Taiwan, Malaysia, and Cambodia, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Collectively, all three presentations trace the lived experience of TFSV victims-survivors in Singapore, drawing primarily on ethnographic data. Examining abusive online behaviors through interviews, Catherine Chang and Holly Apsley identify five clusters of abuse that occur in Singapore and four overlapping categories of harm. Based on interviews with IBSA victims-survivors, Yi Ting Lee argues that currently available recourse options frequently enact violence on them. Drawing on digital ethnography, Shivani Gupta and Michelle Ho contend that university students who experience TFSV and campus sexual misconduct have a complex relationship to their digital well-being. Comprising an interdisciplinary and diverse group of scholars, this panel is timely and significant for contributing to a growing body of work on TFSV in Asia.\r\n\r\n\"The Harms of Abusive Online Behaviours\"\r\nCatherine Chang and Holly Apsley\r\nLee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities, Singapore University of Technology and Design\r\n\r\n\"'The Police Told Me to Delete My Social Media': Responding to Image Based Sexual Abuse in Singapore\"\r\nYi Ting Lee\r\nIndependent Scholar\r\n\r\n\"Digital Well-being on Campus: Technology Facilitated Sexual Violence Amongst University Students in Singapore\"\r\nShivani Gupta and Michelle Ho\r\nNational University of Singapore", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1101452, "first_name": "Shivani", "last_name": "Gupta", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "ShivaniGupta", "display_name": "Shivani Gupta", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/ShivaniGupta?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1101452/3974670/19617722/s65_shivani.gupta.jpg"}, {"id": 507217, "first_name": "Michelle", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "Ho", "display_name": "Michelle Ho", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/Ho?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/507217/1767283/34633396/s65_michelle.ho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 859, "name": "Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4801, "name": "Sexual Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_Violence?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 55516, "name": "Sexual and Gender-Based Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_and_Gender-Based_Violence?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2641154, "name": "Online Sexual Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Sexual_Violence?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 51794648, "title": "Trees in a forest: Becoming Chinese Singaporean in multicultural Singapore", "created_at": "2021-09-10T20:53:47.438-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51794648/Trees_in_a_forest_Becoming_Chinese_Singaporean_in_multicultural_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_51794648", "summary": "This essay examines how the distinctiveness of Chinese culture in Singapore arose due to a complex interplay of socio-geographical factors coming together over time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69359387, "asset_id": 51794648, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1137804, "first_name": "Sze Wee", "last_name": "Low", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SzeWeeLow", "display_name": "Sze Wee Low", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SzeWeeLow?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1137804/399703/35425569/s65_sze_wee.low.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 129305, "name": "Chinese Overseas Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Overseas_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 189364, "name": "Chinese Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Culture?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1756379, "name": "Singaporean Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singaporean_Culture?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2895446, "name": "History of Overseas Chinese Communities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Overseas_Chinese_Communities?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44618418, "title": "Framing the Pandemic and the Rise of the Digital Surveillance State", "created_at": "2020-12-02T01:01:44.168-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44618418/Framing_the_Pandemic_and_the_Rise_of_the_Digital_Surveillance_State?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44618418", "summary": "The pandemic caused by the SARS-COV-2 virus has provided a pretext for many countries of the world to extend executive powers, and their digital surveillance capacities in particular.

First, drawing upon the capability approach (Sen, 1999), we operationalize the dependent variable as self-perceived employability, conceptualized as both a measure of well-being and a livelihood capability. Secondly, we used Selwyn\u2019s (2010) digital divide hierarchical impact assessment framework, to define and measure the ICT assets of access, usage, and appropriation. Primary data was gathered from 302 under-employed and unemployed workers in Singapore, a developed Asian economy. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that higher-order hierarchies of ICT usage and appropriation were associated with the dependent variable of employability, while access was not. We discuss the implications for development discourse in regions with ubiquitous access, advocating for policymakers to focus on ICT training. Further, we offer nuanced findings on vulnerability in developed economies as an enhancement to mainstream ICT4D scholarship, focused exclusively on poverty in developing countries.",

It was conducted in Singapore which has a unique cultural context; a multi-cultural society with a large trans-national migrant population. Other predictors of acculturative stress such as gender, English proficiency, food seeking behavior and time spent with friends both online and in person were measured to see if results could replicate prior findings and to explore the interaction between predictors in the Singapore environment.\r\nMethod: \r\nA survey was administered to 403 international students from 41 different nationalities. Two groups were formed, those who stayed in international student only housing and those who lived in residences where they would come into contact with the host population.\r\nAcculturative stress was measured using the Acculturative Stress Scale for International Students (ASSIS; Sandhu and Asrabadi, 1994), other acculturative stress predictors were measured through additional questions on behavior frequency and demographics.\r\nResults: \r\nUsing between groups ANOVA, this study found that students staying in international student housing reported significantly more acculturative stress then those staying in other types of housing. Further correlational analysis showed the effects of variables on acculturative stress experienced by international students in Singapore were similar to findings made in previous literature. The interactions between predictors are also explored.\r\nConclusion: \r\nThe results obtained suggest that migrants staying in contact with their host community fare better. Predictors of stress relating with each other significantly, indicating the viability of creating a model of multi-cultural stress and coping based on the surrounding environment and available social technologies in future research. Further investigation should be carried out using ecological approaches to understand migrant stress through the processes and motivations that come through interactions in a multi-cultural environment.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34012856, "asset_id": 7428537, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3457093, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Nair", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JosephNair", "display_name": "Joseph Nair", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JosephNair?f_ri=50974", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 248, "name": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5515, "name": "Cross-Cultural Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Psychology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 9729, "name": "Stress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stress?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 13889, "name": "International Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Students?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 140930, "name": "Residence Life & Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residence_Life_and_Housing?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 407193, "name": "Housing in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1143888, "name": "Singapore Housing Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Housing_Policy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1149222, "name": "Acculturative Stress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acculturative_Stress?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1424644, "name": "Singapore Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Psychology?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 77784911, "title": "Superdiversity in Highly Regulated Global Cities", "created_at": "2022-04-27T07:12:11.616-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77784911/Superdiversity_in_Highly_Regulated_Global_Cities?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_77784911", "summary": "This chapter examines the analytical productivity of superdiversity as a perspective in conversation with issues of nationalism, citizenship, and immigration from an empirical perspective that draws primarily from studies of (im)migration in highly globalized citystates with intensely regulated migration regimes. In relation to concepts of \"intersec tionality\" and immigrant integration, it asks how superdiversity helps to interrogate key empirical and political questions of migration-led stratification and boundary-making. In doing so, the chapter suggests that superdiversity as a frame prompts scholars to be better primed to uncover complex intersections of difference that cannot be encompassed by traditional binaries of Black-White, citizen-foreigner, or majority-minority. This chapter shows how the superdiversity lens disrupts assumptions made by a Eurocentric migration paradigm that is less suited for understanding empirical social realities in contexts in contemporary Asia. However, the chapter follows others in highlighting that a superdiversity framework is less useful in speaking to issues of domination and entrenched structural racism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85057048, "asset_id": 77784911, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 794826, "first_name": "Laavanya", "last_name": "Kathiravelu", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "LaavanyaKathiravelu", "display_name": "Laavanya Kathiravelu", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/LaavanyaKathiravelu?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/794826/2132048/17934296/s65_laavanya.kathiravelu.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2613, "name": "Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 5347, "name": "The Persian Gulf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Persian_Gulf?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14861, "name": "Arabian Gulf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arabian_Gulf?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 38429, "name": "Global South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_South?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 51050, "name": "Dubai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dubai?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 54259, "name": "Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cities?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 127642, "name": "Superdiversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Superdiversity?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 68363405, "title": "She's a Woman but she acts very fast Women Religion and Law in Singapore", "created_at": "2022-01-15T22:06:34.263-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68363405/Shes_a_Woman_but_she_acts_very_fast_Women_Religion_and_Law_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_68363405", "summary": "Women Religion and Law in Singapore", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78864179, "asset_id": 68363405, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74337, "first_name": "Li-ann", "last_name": "Thio    \u5f20\u9ece\u884d", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "LiannThio", "display_name": "Li-ann Thio    \u5f20\u9ece\u884d", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/LiannThio?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/74337/20524/19039/s65_li-ann.thio_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5197, "name": "Women and the Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_the_Law?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 61871176, "title": "\"I'm a child of Lee Kuan Yew, cannot help it\": Students' narratives on language and ethnic planning in Singapore", "created_at": "2021-11-17T09:09:23.166-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61871176/_Im_a_child_of_Lee_Kuan_Yew_cannot_help_it_Students_narratives_on_language_and_ethnic_planning_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_61871176", "summary": "This article examines the perceptions of young Singaporean university students on their country\u2019s language policies and their own linguistic practices.

The discourses analyzed here express feelings that range from legitimization of the choices made by the first rulers of independent Singapore to resentment for creating artificial and essentialist categories which led to language loss, language shift and communicative barriers.

The article also examines how some Singaporean Chinese students position themselves critically vis-\u00e0-vis the homogeneous Chineseness that was imposed onto them via the post-independence Mandarin-only policy.\r\n\r\n(The published article can be found here : https://journals.openedition.org/archipel/2629)", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95896258, "asset_id": 61871176, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3527393, "first_name": "Gilles", "last_name": "Forlot", "domain_name": "inalco", "page_name": "GForlot", "display_name": "Gilles Forlot", "profile_url": "https://inalco.academia.edu/GForlot?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3527393/7867487/8900613/s65_gilles.forlot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 951126, "name": "Ethnicity and Identity Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Identity_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1445645, "name": "Singapore Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Social_History?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 43345330, "title": "T\u00dcRK\u0130YE'DE S\u0130NGAPUR \u00c7ALI\u015eMALARI- (Singapore Studies in Turkey-I) Edit\u00f6rler: A.

\tIn this thesis, I argue that the rising levels and subjective experiences of singlehood in Singapore are symptomatic of broader currents of social change and (pseudo)liberalisation in the country. Especially among younger Singaporeans, and with the advent of postmodern culture, there exist collective desires (both real and imagined) to overcome political and social histories of patriarchy and authority, in the public/private domains of state governance, work, education, family and friendship. However, these desires to liberalize and seek emancipation through singledom (and other everyday personal projects) ultimately fall short of expectations, or fail to satisfy positive expectations, since they must contend with the elusiveness of identity, and the vacuity and uncertainty of an ineradicable political, cultural and historical void in postcolonial Singapore. Ironically, attempts to search for (or revive) authentic forms of freedom in a (highly desired) postmodern, post-Oedipal, secular and post-ideological Singapore, instead, continue to produce disillusionments and offer no relief from precarity/uncertainty, whilst unwittingly creating new \u201cgods\u201d and novel forms of (self) regulation and control. \n\n[ Extended Abstract ]          I started on my Ph.D. journey, in 2014, with the intention of writing an ethnography of romantic relationships, dating culture and singlehood in Singapore. My anthropological enterprise, however, has diverged from a straightforward description of gendered, class-stratified or racial distinctions of elective/non-elective, short-term/durable singledom. Instead, for all its specific forms, embodiments and particularities, I argue that the experience and cultural representations of singledom should be employed as a critical heuristic towards understanding postcolonial Singapore and the aporias which mark the advent of hyper-capitalism on the island-state. In particular, singlehood as a social phenomenon highlights the chronic desire - yet, dissatisfaction - at the level of intimate relationships, as symptomatic of impasses and antagonisms that plague the celebratory discourses and practices of neoliberalism, consumerism and technological capitalism in first-world Singapore. I argue that singlehood, and its subsequent and multiple trajectories into marriage, coupledom and family (however these may be defined), is inevitably afflicted with what Lauren Berlant (2011) calls \u201ccruel optimism\u201d, and must contend with what Mari Ruti (2009) describes in psychoanalytic terms as \u201cthe fall of fantasies\u201d amidst \u201ca world of fragile things\u201d. In other words, the promises of happiness and fulfilment that attach to couplehood and family life may be found wanting - or at the least, fraying - even as these intimate relationships are paradoxically idealised by the state, community and individuals, yet experienced at some point as dissatisfying or insufficient, amidst a lifeworld of other persistent desires. \n\nTaking as my starting point, and focusing on the embodied experiences of singles in Singapore, as well as cultural and mediated representations of singledom in theatre, film, television and cyberspace, I attempt to conceptually distill and describe the permanence of \u201csingleness\" at an interpersonal and social-relational level, differentiating this categorically from singlehood/singledom as lived experience or symbolic presentation. \u201cSingleness\", as a marker of Singaporean contemporaneity, is defined as the persistent void/otherness and irretrievable loss of authenticity which eludes each attempt at identification and self-identity. As such, \u201csingleness\" may be genealogically traced from the inauguration of an independent, postcolonial Singapore - uniquely divorced from any sense of historical indignity or singular cultural tradition/origin - and further sustained through, and in spite of, the compulsive (and repetitive) labour of state-making alongside projects of social construction and self-determination. Concurrently, encounters with \u201csingleness\" are ever more pronounced against what I describe as  the advent of \"postmodern culture\" in Singapore - a transitory and unstable social formation, involving intellectual, artistic, public and individual ambitions to move beyond various forms of patriarchy and authority, to ultimately post-oedipal and post-ideological cultural configurations. \u201cSingleness\", in itself, as irreducible void/otherness, however, may neither be approached directly nor observed empirically, only inferred from all necessarily futile attempts to eradicate this lacuna or furnish it with positive and progressive meaning. Not limited to its manifestation in singlehood, \u201csingleness\" - as a palpable sense of nullity and absence - traverses various spaces and scales of political, cultural and social being in Singapore. It motivates desires for (re)productivity in the time of neoliberal personhood, while producing abjections (avoidances/dismissals) of personal, communal and national confrontations with existential precarity, (ir)relevance and (in)significance, amidst a constantly changing global climate of migration, labour and capital flows. \n\nUltimately, singlehood/singledom (as embodied experience or cultural-symbolic representation) is a fertile site of enquiry for the presence and definition of \u201csingleness\u201d in the Singaporean context. During my year-and-a-half-long fieldwork in the country, singles - of different class, gender and religious orientations, and across various ages - bore attitudes towards their singledom as personally liberating or limiting, or were simply ambivalent towards their experience of singlehood. However - and regardless of their existence as happy, bitter or indifferent singles - the material and existential conditions of singledom afforded these individuals a space of heightened recognition, reflection, (re)assessment of their participation in meaningful life projects, whether this entailed the persistent search for intimate partnership and the desire for marriage and family, and/or involved having sufficient time to pursue activities such as activism, philanthropy, and the enjoyment of a new hobby, or material fulfillment within the pleasure-circuits of urban consumerism. The horizon of \u201csingleness\u201d, as described above, appears in the experience of singlehood as the relentless personal pursuit of symbolic goals and simulacra (Baudrillard, 1981) in the time of late- or hyper-capitalism, accompanied by an equally fastidious repudiation of lethargy and fatalism in singledom and their damaging effects. These (temporal and sometimes temporary) pursuits and desires take on both embodied emotional and material forms of labour, but more importantly, single individuals stress the enduring need for personal productivity in these spaces, citing narratives of precarious, banal and meaningless living which should be avoided at all costs. At the same time, \u201csingleness\u201d permeates the lives of single individuals (and arguably, couples too) through the state ideology and cultural impetus, more than anything, to substitute these forms of personal productivity for possible biological reproductivity in the familial domain. In short, the clearest encounter with \u201csingleness\u201d in singlehood may be traced in the double-movement of desiring and searching for productive activity (and desire itself), and the concomitant abjection of insignificant and purposeless lives. However, \u201csingleness\u201d stubbornly persists even when singlehood ends, both in the duration or aftermath of singledom, underlined by narratives of dissatisfaction and restlessness in coupledom and family life, and encapsulated by the ineradicable social demand that one\u2019s commitment to intimate relationships and families must contend with other capitalist desires in a Singaporean cultural lifeworld which stresses material enjoyment and pleasurable self-improvement.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53600112, "asset_id": 32303846, "asset_type": "Work",

Bruges named Jacques de Coutre arrived at Melaka. For the next eight years, Melaka would be his home, and from there he travelled extensively throughout the region. In almost three decades in Asia, Jacques made and lost fortunes, and embarked on two overland voyages from Goa to Europe. His autobiography and other writings, now translated into English, offer important insights on Asian societies, customs, trading networks, and objects of trade. They are also the most expansive surviving eyewitness testimony of Singapore before 1800. This lecture will introduce the new translation and edition, and reveal what grand plans Jacques de Coutre had for Singapore around 1625 \u2013 about two centuries before Thomas Stamford Raffles. \r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\nPeter Borschberg is associate professor in the Department of History at the National University of Singapore. He has published several books and articles on topics relating to early colonial expansion and the origins of international law in Southeast Asia during the 16th and 17th centuries. These include The Singapore and Melaka Straits. Violence, Security and Diplomacy in the 17th Century (2010) and Hugo Grotius, the Portuguese and Free Trade in the East Indies (2011).\r\nThis lecture is free.

inequality in Singapore society. The\r\nrole of opposition internet activism is also explored. Semi-structured personal and group interviews,\r\nwith politicians and grassroots activists; literature search; and attendance at opposition party\r\nfunctions. The opposition in general and Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and National Solidarity\r\nParty (NSP) in particular have repeatedly highlighted the growing income inequality and poverty in\r\nthe country. Pictures in the SDP\u2019s promotional literature skillfully and dialectically present wealth\r\nand poverty in Singapore within the same pictorial image. Interviewees speak of the Dickensian\r\nliving conditions in the one-room rental flats in Bukit Merah, just a taxi ride from Changi Airport, in\r\nthe Minister Mentor Harry Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s constituency of Tanjong Pagar GRC.

The SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19) pandemic and its concomitant movement control measures have had a profound impact on the world. In spite of its potential impact on sexual health, there is a lack of research on how the pandemic and its movement control measures have impacted sexual wellbeing among Singaporeans. Methods. This observational, cross-sectional study was conducted from August to September 2020. Participants were recruited through an online survey instrument promoted through social media. Respondents self-reported their sexual behaviours and levels of sexual satisfaction prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic movement control measures. Results. We recruited a total of 562 participants, of whom 338 (60.1%) ever had a sexual experience. Singles (n = 106, 31.4%) and those not living with their partners (n = 115, 34.0%) reported a greater decrease in partnered sexual activities but a greater increase in individual sexual activities such as masturbation, sending and receiving nudes and watching pornography, relative to those who were living with their partners (n = 117, 34.6%). Multivariable analyses indicated that relative to singles, those who were not living with their partners were more likely to experience a decrease in sexual satisfaction (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.42, 95% CI [1.07, 1.90]), whereas those who were living with their partners were less likely to experience a decrease in sexual satisfaction (aPR = 0.45, 95% CI [0.25, 0.81]). Conclusions. Interventions may focus on enhancing sexual wellness by educating on and supporting individual or partnered sexual activities that may vary along the lines of partnership status and living arrangements during the implementation of movement control measures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79335731, "asset_id": 69114211, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19088624, "first_name": "Rayner Kay Jin", "last_name": "Tan \u9648\u5609\u9a8f", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "raynerkjtan", "display_name": "Rayner Kay Jin Tan \u9648\u5609\u9a8f", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/raynerkjtan?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19088624/5304720/48129042/s65_rayner_kay_jin.tan_.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111921, "name": "Sexual Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_Behavior?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3567366, "name": "Coronavirus COVID-19", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coronavirus_COVID-19?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44027581, "title": "Introduction: art, culture, capitalist development and Kuo Pao Kun", "created_at": "2020-09-06T06:31:58.616-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44027581/Introduction_art_culture_capitalist_development_and_Kuo_Pao_Kun?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44027581", "summary": "Special issue on 'Kuo Pao Kun: Art, Culture, Capitalism'. Overview of issues in relation to Kuo's theatre development. There is no preview: the document will need to be downloaded.\n\nThe bilingual playwright, theatre director and public intellectual Kuo Pao Kun, who was born in 1939 in Xiaoguo village, Hebei, China, passed away on 10 September 2002, having been ill since the previous year. In one of a number of tribute articles that appeared in the major English-language paper, the Straits Times, one socio-cultural commentator acutely contends that Kuo is \u201cthe most important cultural figure in Singapore\u2019s history\u201d (Janadas 2002, 55).1 When detained in 1976 under security laws spawned by the Cold War, he \u201cwork[ed] on himself, and emerged from it refined and spare, stripped of superfluities, but he did not, in the process, abandon his ideals. He did not, to use a word from those times, break\u201d (Janadas 2002, 56). Proceeding from and continuous with Chinese letters from the early twentieth century, Kuo\u2019s work is prompted by the question, \u201cWhat is Chinese modernity?\u201d \u2014 and that enquiry latterly extended into an examination of \u201cthe Asian present\u201d (Janadas 2002, 58).\n\nThe assessment captures Kuo Pao Kun\u2019s distinctive place in Singapore\u2019s cultural history. Culture (in both senses of \u201cways of life\u201d and \u201cartistic achievement\u201d), politics and economic development are not easily separated in his art, and this remains so before and after his detention: the cultural self and the political self remain tightly intertwined. The morphing of modernisation theory from the Cold War (with its commitment to industrialisation and social progress) into discourses on globalisation (with its emphases on finance, information technology and the service sector) can be traced in his art, for these changes carry implications for culture and the formation of a contemporary art. Indeed, he placed his artistic-intellectual capacities in the service of a long-term engagement with the historical and contemporary upheavals, both positive and negative, that the attempt to become modern entailed, broadly taken, in Singapore and the larger region. From Singapore\u2019s postcolonial nation-building process during and after the years of the Cold War, to the fate of cultural and linguistic diversity as a result of the city-state\u2019s socio-engineering of its citizens in accordance with the standards linked with the \u201cdecade of development\u201d in the 1960s thought necessary to \u201csupport the growth of infrastructure and industrialization\u201d (UNICEF 1996), to the dangers of Asian nationalism in the age of transnational capital, Kuo\u2019s art concerns itself with peoples and cultures unhoused or displaced. There is a persistent interest in the multiplicity of things, and with the scarcity of shared ideals on culture and society. And yet, despite the difficulty of thinking new versions of wholeness \u2014 itself potentially oppressing, Kuo was aware \u2014 his art and thought implies that being unhoused and displaced can force us to look for new places to stand and to live.

Nous nous attachons ici plus particuli\u00e8rement aux figures du mouvement anarchiste Joseph Proudhon et Murray Bookchin pour penser des alternatives au n\u00e9olib\u00e9ralisme \u00e9cologique en

While many decolonial efforts have been undertaken actively in North America and Australia, and in departments of history, political science and sociology, increasingly in the United Kingdom, music departments are slowly, if sometimes reluctantly, seeking to address epistemological shifts in their very structures of existence. These exertions have ranged from questioning the raison d'\u00eatre behind knowledge-building itself in an idealised (and unattainably) equal world, to curriculum reviews both superficial and extensive. Polite panel discussions have been organised alongside the rearing up of fiery messages channelling #RhodesMustFall campaigns on mailing lists, blogs, podcasts and vociferous social media platforms led by younger student voiceswith social media becoming platforms crucial for the decolonisation of narratives and methodologies themselves, particularly in the affordance of spaces to both marginalised voices and thinkers who choose not to speak in, for want of a better word, potentially elite language styles of 'academese'. 1 Tackling day-today anxieties of 'politically correct' versus 'triggering' discussions in classrooms of morphing and differently-privileged participants as well as teachers, has stepped up from the generic to the targeted. More specifically in the COVID-hit month of June 2020, the global fallout of the not-unrelated #BlackLivesMatter movement (henceforth #BLM), returned with renewed energy following protests against the murder of George Floyd, led to an increased call for actions on all academic and societal fronts. 2 An intervention was made by scholar-musician-activist Danielle Brown, whose open letter to ethno/musicologists on her blog 'My People Tell Stories' and to the mailing list of the Society for Ethnomusicology 3 exposed the longunsaid but widely-known reality: that systemic racism is embedded within the field in small and large degrees; that academia itself (including ethnomusicology) remains a neocolonial enterpriseby dint of its default setup of (often, BIPOC/ Black & Global Majority [henceforth BGM]) research informants as secondary inputs to the careers of (often, tenured, elite and white) scholars in established institutions. 4 That decolonisation is caught up in uproar, debate, activism and necessary institutional change is clear enough.

Here, such educational choices are discussed as examples of parents expressing subjectivity choices as they reconcile state led conceptualizations of the modern with their interpretations of Islamic forms of modernity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64248880, "asset_id": 43924453, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403373, "first_name": "Kamaludeen", "last_name": "Mohamed Nasir", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "KamaludeenMohamedNasir", "display_name": "Kamaludeen  Mohamed Nasir", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/KamaludeenMohamedNasir?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403373/99485/5021698/s65_kamaludeen.mohamed_nasir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3353, "name": "Subjectivities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subjectivities?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 11705, "name": "Multiple Modernities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiple_Modernities?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 20109, "name": "Religion and Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Modernity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 32425, "name": "Madrasa education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madrasa_education?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 44462, "name": "Islam and Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Modernity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 57971, "name": "Modern Islamic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Islamic_Thought?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 65338, "name": "Islamic revival and reform movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_revival_and_reform_movements?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 232070, "name": "Adat Melayu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adat_Melayu?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 233935, "name": "Pengajian Melayu Dan Pengajian Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pengajian_Melayu_Dan_Pengajian_Islam?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 42975485, "title": "IFN Annual Guide 2020 - Singapore: Harmonizing Islamic finance with Halal businesses", "created_at": "2020-05-07T20:09:48.126-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42975485/IFN_Annual_Guide_2020_Singapore_Harmonizing_Islamic_finance_with_Halal_businesses?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_42975485", "summary": "Singapore has a renewed interest in the Islamic business after several lackluster attempts in the past focusing on just Islamic banking.

At the dawn of the seventeenth century, the escalation of Portuguese expeditionary activities in and around the region led to the uncovering and creation of new knowledge. The Miscellany Atlas contains three maps of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra that offer a glimpse into a local trading world that was interconnected by riverine systems and overland trails. With the help of different analytical frameworks employed for understanding Malay polities of the pre-modern era, this paper carefully peels back the layers of information that have been sketched out and visually represented in these maps.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62257606, "asset_id": 41243491, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

In busting the myth that Singapore was a forgotten place before the intervention of Thomas Stamford Raffles, they also introduce new genres of European printed materials - writings that throw light not only on the Straits region but arguably on Southeast Asia at large.\r\n \r\nAnthony Milner\r\nUniversity of Malaya &, University of Melbourne\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}, {"id": 58864254, "first_name": "Benjamin JQ", "last_name": "Khoo", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "BenjaminJQKhoo", "display_name": "Benjamin JQ Khoo", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/BenjaminJQKhoo?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58864254/110150687/99395338/s65_benjamin_jq.khoo.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2340, "name": "Book History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Hist\u00f3ria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hist%C3%B3ria?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 104797, "name": "Histoire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Histoire?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 33535886, "title": "\u3008\u300c\u8fd1\u300d\u800c\u9060\u4e4b\uff1f\u63a2\u8a0e\u65b0\u4e2d\u95dc\u4fc2\u8207\u6771\u5357\u4e9e\u6d77\u4e8b\u7684\u65b0\u8da8\u5411\u3009", "created_at": "2017-06-18T07:51:15.651-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33535886/_%E8%BF%91_%E8%80%8C%E9%81%A0%E4%B9%8B_%E6%8E%A2%E8%A8%8E%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%AD%E9%97%9C%E4%BF%82%E8%88%87%E6%9D%B1%E5%8D%97%E4%BA%9E%E6%B5%B7%E4%BA%8B%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B0%E8%B6%A8%E5%90%91_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_33535886", "summary": "\u5411\u6765\u5e73\u9759\u7684\u65b0\u4e2d\u53cc\u8fb9\u5173\u7cfb\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u6b63\u5728 \u7ecf\u5386\u4e00\u6bb5\u5c11\u89c1\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u65b0\u52a0\u5761 \u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u5357\u6d77\u9886\u57df\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u4e00\u65b9\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u65b0\u4e2d\u4e4b\u95f4 \u6240\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u5374\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5357\u6d77\u7eb7\u4e89\uff0c\u7279\u522b \u662f\u4e24\u56fd\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u6d77\u6d0b\u516c\u7ea6(UNCLOS)\u7684\u8be0 \u91ca\u548c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u5728\u5357\u6d77\u586b\u76d6\u4eba\u5de5\u5c9b\u7901\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u65b0 \u4e2d\u89c2\u70b9\u843d\u5dee\u80cc\u540e\u662f\u53cc\u65b9\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u56fd\u9645\u79e9\u5e8f\u3001\u56fd \u9645\u6cd5\u3001\u6d77\u4e8b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u4e0e\u7f8e\u56fd\u6218\u7565\u5408 \u4f5c\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u65e2\u4f7f\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u653f\u5e9c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684 \u89c2\u70b9\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8be5\u56fd\u5728\u534e\u5e9c\u4e0e\u5317\u4eac\u4e4b\u95f4\u201c\u4e0d\u9009 \u8fb9\u201d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6d77\u4e8b\u548c\u822a\u6d77\u6743\u76ca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u628a\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u5377\u5165\u7f8e\u4e2d\u7d27\u5f20\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\nThis is a Mandarin version of the piece, \"Diverging Paths?

world order in place since the end of World War II. Based on campaign promises and post-election statements, Trump promises either taking on a highly aggressive outward stance or turning the United States strategically inward as it reverses US participation in international affairs. During the election campaign Trump took highly protectionist positions [1] on trade and promised to name China a currency manipulator [2] on whose goods his administration would impose very high tariffs. Such policies depart from the US-sponsored liberal economic order that has been the bedrock of global economic prosperity since World War II. Based around the Bretton Woods institutions and the US dollar, the US-led economic order was a commitment to economic development, liberalisation and stability. This came from a broad postwar consensus that the absence of economic coordination, beggar-thy-neighbour policies and the lack of an international lender of last resort exacerbated and prolonged the effects of the Great Depression. Moreover, proponents of this postwar consensus saw such conditions as creating fertile ground for the rise of fascism and, ultimately, World War II. An outwardly-oriented, internationalist United States created the opportunities for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan and the economic rise of Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and China from the 1970s. Southeast Asian states plugged into the US-backed international economic order and Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand moved into the ranks of middle income economies.

Moreover, globalisation usually reveals the ignorance on the cultural legacy accelerated by its instrumentalised branding. Moreover, this vision of economic trade fails to resolve these issues of intangible heritage. Above all, since there is no future without past, like the sustainability of environment, and that cities and territories of the silk road territories are defined by a good cohesion of these entities, the current critical issues are the establishment of good balances between the global world and the local heritage. Thus, the transverse degeneration of these geographical roots, territorial strategies, social management, and economic exchanges of the various globalisations seems exceptionally fragile in the 21st century. To the point that these counterexamples are now refused by responsible citizen movements considering such models of urban expansions that capitalistic corruption reigns over as the figures of ontological aberrations. To illustrate these phenomena in the Asian region, the following study takes three cases directly investigated on site: Japan as the symbol and symptom of the introduction of exogenous philosophy and practice which have altered its nature / culture relations of the 19th century to the point to entirely return to its indigenous environmental ethics; now stabilised, exports and reproduces the same errors in the heart of countries undergoing the similar drifts as rural Australasia.   The state Island of Singapore, rich of a multi-ethnic community evolving in a neoliberal socialism, combines the ontologies that move each society to develop its territory from culturally appropriate practices to the pressures of a standardised educational system. This paradoxically leads its experts towards a universality of cultural landscapes posing the problem of urban and landscape alienation to unique market aims. The rowdy reinvention of the traditions devoted to the western hegemonic submission has profoundly damaged the cultural identity of South Korea\u2019s urban, natural, and social environment. Example of exogenous diktats on fragile autochthonous practices by a corporate malpractice, South Korea raises the question of political governance and ecosophical resistances always ignored in globalisation aims. From these three cases of territorial governance, we will consider what can be the sustainable growth and preservation policies within the vast Silk Road spaces.

Malaysia is a multicultural society with 65% of Malay Malaysians and other Bumiputeras, 26% Chinese Malaysians and 7% Indian Malaysians. Ethnic categorizations build the basis for the Malaysian society, in which the Malay Malaysians benefit more from governmental policies than Chinese and Indian Malaysians do. Despite cultural diversity, Islam as the religion of the Malay Malaysians is the dominating one. The ethnically and religiously based social segregation has its rootedness in British colonial policies. Ethnic exclusion and inclusion were introduced through the education system also along gender- and class-specific lines. The emphasis on ethnic inclusion and exclusion in Malaysia so far hindered an expression of women\u00b4s and gender issues referring to women of all ethnic groups simultaneously. Singapore as a Southeast Asian Metropolis is a destination for migration for reasons of labour and education. Due to low birthrates, the city state promotes so called foreign talents from Primary School on, i.e. young people classified as intelligent, who shall be beneficial for the economy later on. The education and migration policies are related to ethnicity, class and gender. The majority of educational migrants in Singapore are Chinese Malaysian middle-class women. Not only are governmental policies factors for educational migration, the parents of young Chinese Malaysian women actively choose Singapore as a destination for further education of their children. By means of migration to Singapore, the young women develop their own ways to achieve social agency. The neoliberal education system and meritocratic society offer opportunities and access for migrants from \u201cmodern\u201d, Christian, middle-class backgrounds.

Ed. Farish A. Noor & Peter Carey. Amsterdam: AUP, 15 January 2021\n\nThe colonisation of Southeast Asia was a long and often violent process where numerous military campaigns were waged by the colonial powers across the region. The notion of racial difference was crucial in many of\nthese wars, as native Southeast Asian societies were often framed in negative terms as 'savage' and 'backward' communities that needed to be subdued and 'civilised'. This collection of critical essays focuses on the colonial construction of race and looks at how the colonial wars\nin 19th-century Southeast Asia were rationalised via recourse to theories of racial difference, making race a significant factor in the wars of Empire. Looking at the colonial wars in Java, Borneo, Siam, the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia, the\nessays examine the manner in which the idea of racial difference was weaponised by the colonising powers and how forms of local resistance often worked through such colonial structures of identity politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65515543, "asset_id": 44977866, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3186061, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Carey", "domain_name": "indonesia", "page_name": "PeterCarey", "display_name": "Peter B Carey", "profile_url": "https://indonesia.academia.edu/PeterCarey?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3186061/1047844/1308753/s65_peter.cary.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 15468, "name": "The Moros Of Mindanao In Southern Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Moros_Of_Mindanao_In_Southern_Philippines?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 28507, "name": "History of Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 225603, "name": "Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabah?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 272528, "name": "Pahang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pahang?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 344654, "name": "Mindanao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mindanao?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 630718, "name": "History of the Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Philippines?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1289943, "name": "history of Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Thailand?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44538839, "title": "Singapore: The Shadow of A Nation Under a Mask - Alfian Sa'at, and the question of national identity", "created_at": "2020-11-19T23:36:29.263-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44538839/Singapore_The_Shadow_of_A_Nation_Under_a_Mask_Alfian_Saat_and_the_question_of_national_identity?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44538839", "summary": "This essay seeks to discuss how the debate over migrant workers during the COVID- 19 pandemic reinforced my reading of the literary texts, namely the poem \u201cSingapore, you are not my country\u201d by Alfian Sa\u2019at.

Official and often state-sanctioned conceptualizations of the peculiar mind are grievously justified in behavioral manifestations deemed socially unacceptable. Koe's stories about idiosyncratic Singaporeans illustrate the way personal experiences-of memory loss, homosexual tendencies, and emotional self-expressions-are informed by, and in turn inform, the biopolitical regulation of Singaporean citizens rendered objects of biopower. In this way, her stories invite a meditation on the state, people and power. Foregrounding fractured and unorthodox characters, these stories serve to intensify individual voices articulated in personal narratives addressing affective experiences, including sadness culminating in loneliness. Furthermore, the stories attest to socially constructed norms instigating the repudiation and criminalization of sexual deviants. Significantly, they add to the \"cultural apparatus\"-which C.W. Mills defines as \"the source of Human Variety-of styles of living and of ways to die\"-by questioning the nation's ideological imperatives, including heterosexual norms, social insistence on mono-cultural marriages and state/family-endorsed medical intervention. Offering a critique of ideological state apparatus embedded within the power structures inherent to psychopathology, Koe's Ministry of Moral Panic challenges the established ways of viewing \"Others\" who are ostensibly \"mad\". Consequently, her stories mediate a broadening human experience, by calling for inclusivity amid the social rejection and insular treatment of afflicted subjects with alleged disorders.",

Based on her ethnic, religious and education-based belonging, she characterizes this environment as \u201ctraditional\u201c. In this respect, \u201cromantic love\u201c is a means to identify herself as \u201cmodern\u201c. \nMalaysia is a multicultural society with 65% of Malay Malaysians and so called indigenous people, 26% of Chinese Malaysians and 7% of Indian Malaysians. Singapore as a \u201cmodern Southeast Asian metropolis\u201c, which is comprised of the same ethnic groups due to the historic ties to Malaysia, however, is Chinese dominated. In both states, the concept of romantic love developed in the 1960s in all of the three ethnic groups as an alternative to arranged marriage. \nThe process to identify oneself as a modern woman through practices of romantic love is mostly negotiated by Christian Chinese Malaysian women who earned a high degree of formal education. They intensify this process through a migration step to \u201cmodern\u201c Singapore. In the local context, the concept of \u201cromantic love\u201c is defined through having a partner before marriage, being sexual active with him and strengthening this relationship through a \u201cwhite wedding\u201c. \u201cRomantic love\u201d in Singapore and Malaysia is based on practices of adaption of the concept of romantic love developed in Western modern times, which developed on the basis of Western subjectivity, individuality and the differentiation between public and private spaces.

For my informants, the capacity to be content has three aspects: the pursuit of happiness, the questioning of Singapore\u2019s incessant drive for economic growth, and the neglect of those left-behind. Taken collectively, these nuances show that the aspirations of young adult Catholics are effectively a moral critique of the social and economic state of affairs in the city-state. The capacity to be content also informs these young adults\u2019 decision to be involved in welfare activities or even be employed in social work altogether. However, such moral critique\u2019s potential to contest the political status quo is tempered by the resounding opinion that religion and politics do not mix in Singapore. \n\nIt is precisely by interrogating this tension between their aspirations and their views of the moral state of Singapore that this article is a contribution to this special issue on Christianity and the nation in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe special issue is edited by Jose Mario C.

The country\u2019s limited territorial lands and\r\nnatural resources, combined with huge per capita income, high population density and sensitive racial concoction, make Singapore the quintessential pragmatic trading state of the twenty-first century. This paper examines the dynamics with which Singapore has embedded itself at the centre of regional and global trade systems by exploiting various forms of free trade agreement including multilateral, regional and bilateral FTAs that underpin its security and survival. It\r\nargues that in order to maintain the city-state\u2019s geo-economic and geo-political viability, the Singaporean government has progressively linked its security interests with its multilevel free trade activities. Given the vulnerability fetish and siege mentality that confront Singaporean leaders and policymakers, the pursuit of economic development via free trade has become the heart of its national security policy and strategy. The paper concludes by arguing that the enhancement and preservation of Singapore\u2019s survival as a sovereign nation-state demands a strategic utilization of FTAs with different trade partners, especially with inter-regional and transregional powers such as the United States and China.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35943209, "asset_id": 9762647, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1920447, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Magcamit", "domain_name": "leicester", "page_name": "MichaelMagcamit", "display_name": "Michael Magcamit", "profile_url": "https://leicester.academia.edu/MichaelMagcamit?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1920447/4443544/38693761/s65_michael.magcamit.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4370, "name": "Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 5535, "name": "Critical Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Security_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6276, "name": "International Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Political_Economy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 10370, "name": "East Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 10371, "name": "South East Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 18794, "name": "Critical international political economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_international_political_economy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 22965, "name": "Political Economy of International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy_of_International_Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 22967, "name": "Trade and Industrial Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_and_Industrial_Policy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 28578, "name": "Fair Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fair_Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 32014, "name": "Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 39038, "name": "Free Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 71228, "name": "Trade Liberalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Liberalization?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 97103, "name": "Free trade agreements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_trade_agreements?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 137587, "name": "International Relations, Security, Strategic Studies, Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_Security_Strategic_Studies_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 257285, "name": "Social and political science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_political_science?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 410377, "name": "Foreign Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 430672, "name": "International and Comparative Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_and_Comparative_Political_Economy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 516104, "name": "Trade Liberalization and Poverty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Liberalization_and_Poverty?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 954124, "name": "Singapore Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 8919694, "title": "Bios, Polis and the Autoimmune", "created_at": "2014-10-22T21:35:48.175-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8919694/Bios_Polis_and_the_Autoimmune?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_8919694", "summary": "This essay focuses on the example of biotechnology in Singapore, but tracks a course across conceptual and geographical boundaries. A single message in different versions implicates many fields in the same disturbing perplexity. It can be put in the form of the following proposition: that which harms us protects us from harm; or, in the perhaps more pessimistic formulation, that which protects us from harm harms us. The proposition, gathered from diverse registers (philosophical, political, aesthetic, biological, technological, social), might thus seem to achieve considerable generality. And the situation in Singapore will reveal the strange power of its synecdoche. The exception that proves the rule, the part that stands in for a whole from which it nevertheless radically differs, Singapore and its adventure with biotechnology will come to exemplify a law that might otherwise have remained obscure. We should try to be clear from the outset. It is not that a protective body from time to time exhibits, in addition to its protective qualities, regrettable, perhaps avoidable, tendencies with harmful consequences\u2014the benevolent power forgetting itself for a moment, lashing out in fury or error: a consoling idea in comparison.  On the contrary, the very quality of safety\u2014the protective layer itself\u2014must be regarded as simultaneously harmful, as at once and in the same movement harmful and protective, threatening danger in the very process and inner quality of its defensive operations.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35244534, "asset_id": 8919694, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

The objectives of this study were: 1) to investigate Singapore's development as a British colonial trading port, and 2) to examine trade and development of labor in seaport towns. Using a historical methodology, the data were collected from the records of the indigenous people explored in previous research studies. The key concepts of the article were colonialism and labor liberalization, which reflected the context of Malay Peninsula trading at that time. The results of the study showed that: 1) maritime trade attracted labors and migrants, especially from East Asia and South Asia to Singapore; 2) traditional slave trade was abolished by the British colonial regime and consequently, 3) labor liberalization was encouraged in Singapore. This study brought about an understanding of changing meanings and forms of labor, as well as social development of Singapore as an important colonial seaport in Southeast Asia during the 19 th and 20 th centuries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77533753, "asset_id": 66279443, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52566228, "first_name": "Chaiwat Pasuna", "last_name": "\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e22\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e4c \u0e1b\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e30", "domain_name": "chula", "page_name": "CPasuna", "display_name": "Chaiwat Pasuna \u0e0a\u0e31\u0e22\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e4c \u0e1b\u0e30\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e30", "profile_url": "https://chula.academia.edu/CPasuna?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52566228/15287411/107213620/s65_chaiwat_pasuna._.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9160, "name": "Maritime Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Policy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18970, "name": "British Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperialism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39038, "name": "Free Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_Trade?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 84213, "name": "Labor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 478558, "name": "Free Labor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_Labor?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 560464, "name": "Seaport development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seaport_development?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1397747, "name": "Straits Settlements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_Settlements?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1477490, "name": "History of Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 62783654, "title": "Violent Christian Extremism Interreligious Ties", "created_at": "2021-11-30T19:57:26.089-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62783654/Violent_Christian_Extremism_Interreligious_Ties?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_62783654", "summary": "The case of a self-radicalised Christian youth planning to attack two mosques in Singapore highlights the global nature of an extremist threat that may manifest as ethno-religious supremacism or as faith-driven.

Singapore\u2019s Golden Jubilee in 2015, which commemorated its triumphant postcolonial development, was accompanied by the proliferation of public expressions of nostalgia across a variety of media platforms. Amid the rise of the participatory culture of media convergence, this paper examines how nostalgic longing is no longer necessarily articulated as an antagonistic critique of the precarious present of neoliberal capitalism, which withdraws into a timeless image of a congenial past. Departing from this conventional understanding of nostalgia in the scholarship of Singapore, it explores how the ruling government since independence has reconfigured its dissemination of historical and cultural knowledge to manage its transition from a global city defined by rapid growth to a smart nation reliant on perpetual adjustment by cultivating a form of citizenship centred on entrepreneurship and innovation. Through immersive spatialisation, commissioned mobile video games oblige players to internalise the protocols of knowledge and agency of the Singapore Story, the official narrative of economic success and national progress. Two other state-run interactive digital platforms, the National Library\u2019s online archive the Singapore Memory Project and the National Museum\u2019s art installation 'The Story of the Forest', are designed to cultivate a new openness to the inevitability of iteration in urban informatics. Helping to assuage popular anxiety over the constancy of change and the failure of risk-taking, the latter frames perpetual adjustment as a vital component of the cosmic cyclicality of deep time, in which vanished realities are recreated with different permutations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56929602, "asset_id": 35660391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 404426, "first_name": "Elmo", "last_name": "Gonzaga", "domain_name": "cuhk", "page_name": "ElmoGonzaga", "display_name": "Elmo  Gonzaga", "profile_url": "https://cuhk.academia.edu/ElmoGonzaga?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/404426/2647747/14555165/s65_elmo.gonzaga.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5315, "name": "Creative Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Cities?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 17813, "name": "Digital Archives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Archives?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 22047, "name": "Digital Media Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Media_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 24410, "name": "Creative City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_City?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 37400, "name": "Interactive Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interactive_Art?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 42042, "name": "Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 72039, "name": "The Social and Institutional Construction of Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Social_and_Institutional_Construction_of_Nostalgia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 90835, "name": "Urban Informatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Informatics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 94893, "name": "Smart City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Smart_City?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 182681, "name": "Nostalgia and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia_and_Memory?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1938032, "name": "Creative City, Creative Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_City_Creative_Economy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 38229219, "title": "2018 \u201cAmbins along the Five Footway: Baweanese Ponthuks at Everton Road.\u201d Maintaining Heritage Series.

examines international labour migrants in the context of South\u2013South migration with a focus on Bangladeshi migration to Singapore. Two principal questions in the South\u2013South migration are addressed: Why and how individuals migrate for work; and what impact this temporary form of migration has for migrants and their families. The book adopts a relatively new methodological approach to labour migration by linking different phases that migrants undergo in the migration process and by combining migrants in the host country with their families in the origin country. This is achieved through identifying and addressing six key areas: (i) migration policy, (ii) social imperatives of migration (iii) recruitment, (iv) social worlds of the migrants, (v) remittance process, and finally, (vi) family development dynamics. This book introduces the bari to migration research as a unit of analysis over and above individual and family units. The book reveals how social and cultural forces both initiate and perpetuate migration, and later on influence bari dynamics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52396272, "asset_id": 32157969, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 948474, "first_name": "Md Mizanur", "last_name": "Rahman", "domain_name": "qu", "page_name": "MdMizanurRahman", "display_name": "Md Mizanur Rahman", "profile_url": "https://qu.academia.edu/MdMizanurRahman?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/948474/351755/49006147/s65_md_mizanur.rahman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4374, "name": "Immigration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16622, "name": "Contemporary International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_International_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 19051, "name": "Transnational Labour Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Labour_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 24370, "name": "Emigration Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emigration_Research?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 30249, "name": "Immigration and identity (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_and_identity_Anthropology_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 41875, "name": "Bangladesh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 86977, "name": "Emigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emigration?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 9006176, "title": "SINGAPORE   I   [...]  Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 Trzecia:\tRozdzia\u0142 2. cz\u0119\u015bci trzeciej:  (pe\u0142en tytu\u0142 artyku\u0142u i jego tre\u015b\u0107 u  wydawcy broszureczki)", "created_at": "2014-10-28T21:17:33.507-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9006176/SINGAPORE_I_Cz%C4%99%C5%9B%C4%87_Trzecia_Rozdzia%C5%82_2_cz%C4%99%C5%9Bci_trzeciej_pe%C5%82en_tytu%C5%82_artyku%C5%82u_i_jego_tre%C5%9B%C4%87_u_wydawcy_broszureczki_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_9006176", "summary": "Obszerne prace naukowe autorstwa K.K.

the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait lies Pedra Branca, an island of granite rock situated in hazardous waters. Its unexceptional presence belies a rich cartographical history and infamous reputation for leading ships to grief since antiquity. Pedra Branca was first pushed into the spotlight when the British constructed the Horsburgh Lighthouse in 1851. It later caught international attention when a heated territorial dispute for the island between Singapore and Malaysia arose, lasting from 1979\u20132018, with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) eventually granting rights to Singapore. The ensuing legal battle led to renewed interest in the geography and post-19th century history of the island. The most recent breakthrough, however, provides a glimpse into an even earlier history of Pedra Branca\u2014and by extension, Singapore\u2014as shipwrecked remains dating from the 14th century were uncovered in the surrounding waters.

The case in point is Gwee Li Sui\u2019s 2018 companion Spiaking Singlish, lauded as the first book to be written in Singlish about Singlish. It is argued that in tactically leveraging Singlish in a folk-lexicographical project, Gwee takes the vernacular to the third indexical order; and in so doing, he performs a ludic and extreme form of Singlish through which an everyday tongue turns into a fetish object. Contextualising Gwee\u2019s polemics within his tension with\nthe language establishment in Singapore, the article highlights the ethical dilemma implicit in the celebration of languages speaking to an egalitarian ethos, suggesting that in enunciating a vernacular on the order of reflexive performance, intellectuals may inadvertently fashion it into a more elitist language than that which is spoken on the streets.

names of Singapore and of their variants and different versions produced over time is extremely interesting and shows still some unclear stages, both at the etymological level, in the linguistic explanation of the origins and original meanings of the numerous names the island had throughout the centuries, and at the historical level, in the attempt to connect the names of Singapore with local and external peoples who inhabited and occupied the island in the past. This paper aims at providing a synthetic, but punctual, survey on the names used for the Lion City over time, with the addition of some linguistic and historical details. The main issue in the diachronic reconstruction of the names of Singapore resides in the early stages of the history of the island, for which the historical sources are rare and, sometimes, controversial. The different names used for Singapore from the beginnings of its history witness changes in population and settlement dynamics that are not always very clear, due to the lack of reliable historical sources, but that give an outstanding image of the multicultural and multilingual nature of Singapore already from its origins. The paper reconstructs and documents the different stages of the naming process of Singapore from the origins to the present time. \n\nKey words: The Names of Singapore, Toponomastics, Naming Process", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65668303, "asset_id": 45103952, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4424566, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Perono Cacciafoco", "domain_name": "xjtlu", "page_name": "FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco", "display_name": "Francesco Perono Cacciafoco", "profile_url": "https://xjtlu.academia.edu/FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4424566/1801903/2148322/s65_francesco.perono_cacciafoco.jpg"}, {"id": 7248213, "first_name": "Chloe", "last_name": "Gan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GanChloe", "display_name": "Chloe Gan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GanChloe?f_ri=50974", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 778, "name": "Diachronic Linguistics (Or Historical Linguistics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diachronic_Linguistics_Or_Historical_Linguistics_?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1206, "name": "Lexicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lexicology?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2717, "name": "Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etymology?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3904, "name": "Onomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 4469, "name": "Toponomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponomastics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 17445, "name": "Historical maps", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_maps?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 34818, "name": "Toponymy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponymy?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 52505, "name": "Historical topography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_topography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 648975, "name": "Trade Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Routes?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44991747, "title": "An analysis of Singapore's AWARE case", "created_at": "2021-01-27T10:21:48.644-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44991747/An_analysis_of_Singapores_AWARE_case?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44991747", "summary": "Our case involves the women\u2019s group Association of Women for\nAction and Research (AWARE), founded on 25 November 1985, which\nhas proven itself to be a tireless long-term campaigner for women\u2019s\nrights in Singapore.

In the second phase of this saga, the\nExtraordinary General Meeting on 2 May 2009 led to the secular\n\u2018Old Guard\u2019 recapturing AWARE and the Church of Our Saviour\ngroup being removed from power. This AWARE case shows the rise in\npower of fundamentalist Protestant Christianity within Singapore and\nits growing influence upon English-educated Chinese-Singaporeans.\nThe fact that this upper middle-class demographic traditionally\nhas supported the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) is probably\none key reason why the government decided not to intervene in this\nparticular case as part of \u2018the more consultative style of government\u2019\nfirst introduced by former PM Goh Chok Tong.

It suggests more freedom for some NGOs\nin the contemporary era of Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s prime-ministership.\nSignificantly, PAP may be splitting into \u2018reformist\u2019 and \u2018hardline\u2019\nfactions headed by, respectively, Lee Hsien Loong and the MP for\nBishan-Toa Payoh GRC Mr Wong Kan Seng.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65533554, "asset_id": 44991747, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 179721135, "first_name": "Kieran", "last_name": "James", "domain_name": "westscotland", "page_name": "KJames", "display_name": "Kieran James", "profile_url": "https://westscotland.academia.edu/KJames?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/179721135/49778238/37786252/s65_kieran.james.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4586, "name": "Women's Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Rights?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 165686, "name": "Grassroots Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grassroots_Activism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 318546, "name": "Women's rights (Singapore)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_rights_Singapore_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3794440, "name": "Christianity in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44778522, "title": "Curriculum Development in Singapore and Turkey: Reflections of Administrative Structure and Educational Reforms Singapur ve T\u00fcrkiye'de Y\u00f6netsel Yap\u0131 ve E\u011fitim Reformlar\u0131 Ba\u011flam\u0131nda Program Geli\u015ftirme S\u00fcre\u00e7leri", "created_at": "2020-12-26T12:32:54.565-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44778522/Curriculum_Development_in_Singapore_and_Turkey_Reflections_of_Administrative_Structure_and_Educational_Reforms_Singapur_ve_T%C3%BCrkiyede_Y%C3%B6netsel_Yap%C4%B1_ve_E%C4%9Fitim_Reformlar%C4%B1_Ba%C4%9Flam%C4%B1nda_Program_Geli%C5%9Ftirme_S%C3%BCre%C3%A7leri?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44778522", "summary": "The purpose of the study was to investigate the curriculum development process in Singapore and Turkey comparatively regarding administrative structure and educational reforms. As a qualitative descriptive research, this comparative study is expected to contribute to evaluation of possible strengths and weaknesses of the two countries in curriculum development and support the adoption of effective policies and practices by policymakers. Considering the purpose of the study, the data were collected through document analysis. Content analysis was utilized to analyze qualitative data gathered from the official documents and research reports. Results revealed similarities and differences in terms of centralized approach, administrative units and their missions in Singapore and Turkey with respect to administrative structure of curriculum development. Regarding the reflections of educational reforms on curriculum development process and policies, it was found that although the educational reforms were implemented for similar purposes in the two countries, the way of implementation and sustainability demonstrated considerable differences in terms of conditions such as planning, delivery, timing and monitoring. It is recommended that regulations should be made in Turkey such as establishing research mechanisms to systematically study on the integration of curriculum policy and practice to fill in the gap between them.

These claims are made in discussions of the current state of affairs or future course of Singapore. They go beyond the past and reflect (and reinforce) our perspectives and identities. We call such claims \u2018myths\u2019 in the manner that they render history useful for non-historical pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis forum series unpacks the myths of Singapore history. By myths, we do not mean fabrications, but discursive devices that have become accepted as part of our \u2018common sense\u2019. Myths are a shorthand for official discourses and policies; they thus mask countervailing views of history and obscure other possibilities for the future. As Singapore celebrates 50 years of nationhood in 2015, being aware of myths is an important social project that will make us a more mature, self-reflexive and inclusive people.\r\n",

An abandonment after selection and contract would seem to indicate that a university press responded to undisclosed &amp;quot;stakeholder&amp;quot; concerns. This seems to fit a pattern that has overtaken the evolution of universities across Asia. Professionally, I advocate the role of historians in trying to explain the background of contemporary problems and that policies could be better informed if they are made with an understanding of the history behind them, and this is what I will try to encourage briefly here. Across the long history-and I look beyond the first university at Bologna to early proto-universities at Nalanda and Gundishapur as well, so thousands of years-universities were actually given to parochialism, the teaching of religion, the education of noble sons to do and think exactly as their fathers had done and their peers would do, the university was a place where thinking was structured according to what I call state-think-I am here applying James Scott&amp;#39;s concept of state space to the patterns of thinking 1-in a way that made thinking easy to conform to the state, to run the state, to lead the state. 2 The unspoken part of this process was learning how to control, suppress, and exploit the vast majority of the population. Colonial authorities knew this when they introduced colonial universities in the decades up to and just after World War I. These were to teach the colonial mother tongue, European ideas and values, and both obedience and the figurative whip through the provision of certain kinds of knowledge and behaviour. Select Southeast Asian youth of means and merit, would walk in elite children and walk out colonial bureaucrats, military officers, and intermediary elites. They saw or were meant to see the world as sharply defined, hierarchically stacked ethnic minorities, right and wrong moral sexual behaviour, the legitimacy of the huge global and racial disparities in wealth and just why Southeast Asians on the whole deserved to be servants and peasants, and why the indigenous mode of thought was inherently inferior to the western mode of thought.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 136151, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Charney", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "MichaelCharney", "display_name": "Michael W Charney", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/MichaelCharney?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/136151/36138/43430952/s65_michael.charney.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 46666, "name": "Human Rights in Asia / ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_in_Asia_ASEAN?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 334316, "name": "ASEAN Plus Three", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Plus_Three?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 541313, "name": "LGBT rights in ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_rights_in_ASEAN?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 692049, "name": "ASEAN Political Security Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Political_Security_Community?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 995742, "name": "ASEAN Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Community?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1218765, "name": "National University of Singapore.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_University_of_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 75743920, "title": "Poverty in Paradise City: When the Jester has a broken Heart", "created_at": "2022-04-07T10:49:27.743-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75743920/Poverty_in_Paradise_City_When_the_Jester_has_a_broken_Heart?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_75743920", "summary": "... one-hour personal interview and subsequent e-mail and informal conversations);

His findings were published in three articles in the Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society between 1955 and 1957. The untimely death of this researcher abruptly ended what appeared to be a promising trajectory in writing the history of Singapore and the region. For the past two decades, research on the Portuguese and other early European sources touching on the region in the 16th and 17th centuries has intensified and thanks to modern IT facilities easier access to archival materials worldwide, the question has resurfaced as to what the value of the Portuguese sources might be for identifying important events in Singapore\u2019s pre-modern history. This has become especially important against the backdrop of the ongoing preparations for the Singapore Bicentennial in 2019. The present paper should be seen as a contribution to the historiography of pre-1800 Singapore insofar as it critically engages with the different types of materials at hand, compares them with other period European sources, and reviews some of the different materials that have been published in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57167963, "asset_id": 37217257, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 19455, "name": "Early Modern economic and social history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_economic_and_social_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 36876896, "title": "Uniquely Singapore", "created_at": "2018-06-20T07:21:02.669-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36876896/Uniquely_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_36876896", "summary": "In this historical essay, Christopher Chew compares the fortunes of two Singapores - one in Asia, the other in the United States - and asks the question: \"Is Singapore really that unique?\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56831865, "asset_id": 36876896, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20087416, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Chew", "domain_name": "columbia", "page_name": "ChristopherChew", "display_name": "Christopher Chew", "profile_url": "https://columbia.academia.edu/ChristopherChew?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20087416/5594890/19747161/s65_christopher.chew.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8032, "name": "Cross-Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35967196, "title": "The 1824 Treaties", "created_at": "2018-02-20T02:43:26.459-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35967196/The_1824_Treaties?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_35967196", "summary": "This is a  summary write-up on the Crawfurd and Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1824 and their significance to  the history of Singapore.

Regional states are at a moment where they are adjusting domestic politics, their relationships with each other and the main inter-governmental organization, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). They are also responding to China, whose role in the region is evolving as Beijing moves into a new stage in its decades-long development into a major world power that is more ready to take robust positions on issues where its interests sometimes diverge with those of its neighbours. Amid these changes, Washington seems to be looking to move away from its longstanding commitment to liberalizing trade and investment in Asia, while taking a more openly muscular stance on security. Specifically, the United States under Trump is pondering possibilities for altering the longstanding basis for its economic and security exchanges with China, which includes adopting policies that differ more starkly from, or even oppose, those of Beijing.\n\nFull roundtable available at: https://bookshop.iseas.edu.sg/publication/2221", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52852735, "asset_id":

first two decades of Singapore's independence in 1965, specifically the bilingual education policy and the \u2018Speak More Mandarin, Less Dialects\u2019 campaign. The policy and campaign simultaneously divide and restructure the heterogeneous Sinophone community into a cohesive homologous unit with the promotion of Mandarin as the common language among the various Sinitic dialect groups. The policy and campaign also directly impacted the relationship between the Chinese, Indian and Malay communities and their mother tongues. Mandarin was assigned as the mother tongue to all Sinophone Singaporeans, serving as a maternal figure to preserve cultural traditions against western influence in a rapidly modernizing, postcolonial nation-state. This essay analyses three contemporary Sinophone poems, showing how each of them directly or indirectly responds to the impact of the bilingual policy and the \u2018Speak Mandarin\u2019 campaign on Singapore society and its literary traditions.\r\nComplimentary Download (http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/W2DCnhr2ZykIDHRKTzWy/full)", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37241757, "first_name": "E.K.", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "sbsuny", "page_name": "EKTan", "display_name": "E.K.

Yet there are different models of philanthropy. American philanthropy tries to improve conditions for different people, without reference to race or language; this evolved from the notion of equality. In contrast, Chinese clans arose in Singapore, as a response to a society segmented along racial and linguistic lines; in a culture that emphasized face, rich entrepreneurs could \"buy\" prestige and leadership positions, by assisting their poor. This article examines philanthropy as practiced by entrepreneurs in America, and compares this to the Chinese model of wealth redistribution. The latter is centered on clan associations. In the new economy, however, these have been losing importance, as governments take on some roles previously taken care of by such associations; this includes, for instance, education and assistance to start-up entrepreneurs. We conclude that there appears to be a relationship between philanthropy, government and entrepreneurship.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32461885, "asset_id": 3165416, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 100744, "first_name": "L\u00e9o-Paul", "last_name": "DANA", "domain_name": "supdeco-montpellier", "page_name": "LeoDANA", "display_name": "L\u00e9o-Paul  DANA", "profile_url": "https://supdeco-montpellier.academia.edu/LeoDANA?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/100744/15142900/15841554/s65_l_o-paul.dana.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1020, "name": "Chinese Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Philosophy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 87811, "name": "Charity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Charity?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 107942, "name": "International Redistribution of Wealth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Redistribution_of_Wealth?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 253645, "name": "Strategic Philantrophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategic_Philantrophy?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 4128675, "title": "Acoustic and perceptual features of eating-places in Singapore.", "created_at": "2013-07-29T06:09:55.823-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4128675/Acoustic_and_perceptual_features_of_eating_places_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_4128675", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31642463, "asset_id": 4128675, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 310881, "first_name": "PerMagnus", "last_name": "Lindborg", "domain_name": "cityu-hk", "page_name": "PerMagnusLindborg", "display_name": "PerMagnus Lindborg", "profile_url": "https://cityu-hk.academia.edu/PerMagnusLindborg?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/310881/76738/83574/s65_permagnus.lindborg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 499, "name": "Acoustics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acoustics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6634, "name": "Soundscape Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15687, "name": "Soundscape Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Design?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54333, "name": "Soundscape", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 328269, "name": "Soundscapes Aural Architecture Urban Acoustic Environments Sensory Geography Public Art and Policy Concepts of Place Sense of place + place experience Place-making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscapes_Aural_Architecture_Urban_Acoustic_Environments_Sensory_Geography_Public_Art_and_Policy_C?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 383177, "name": "Servicescapes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Servicescapes?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 82227908, "title": "The Hard State, Soft City of Singapore", "created_at": "2022-06-26T20:36:17.425-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82227908/The_Hard_State_Soft_City_of_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_82227908", "summary": "With Singapore serving as the subject of exploration, The Hard State, Soft City of Singapore explores the purview of imaginative representations of the city.

ethnographic survey of the ownership, use, and display of television-related devices of forty households in Singapore, this article frames the concept of Skeuomorphic Domestic Television. This term describes the continued centrality of the traditional \"living room television\" amid digital media's portability. Results from the stocktaking of the ownership of television-related devices in the surveyed households point to the narrowing of the digital divide arising from the greater affordability of media technologies. However, within the highly densely populated city-state, it was found that social distinctions from television cultures were maintained in the skeuomorphic luxury of the \"TV-Sofa space\" in living rooms of surveyed households. Such a space that distinguishes individuals watching television in cluttered rooms against the more communal viewing practices in designated spacious living rooms characterizes the \"Analog Spatial Divide\" of skeuomorphic domestic television cultures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65591415, "asset_id": 45040047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3413577, "first_name": "Liew", "last_name": "Kai Khiun", "domain_name": "hkmu-hk", "page_name": "LiewKaiKhiun", "display_name": "Liew Kai Khiun", "profile_url": "https://hkmu-hk.academia.edu/LiewKaiKhiun?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3413577/51132378/39191349/s65_liew.khiun.jpg"}, {"id": 185561624, "first_name": "\u6797", "last_name": "\u7d79", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "\u6797\u7d79", "display_name": "\u6797 \u7d79", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/%E6%9E%97%E7%B5%B9?f_ri=50974", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10660, "name": "Television And Social Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Television_And_Social_Change?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44928155, "title": "From Folk Musicians to Popular Icons: The Resilient U\u1e5fumi M\u0113\u1e37am Tamil Folk Drumming Ensemble in Singapore", "created_at": "2021-01-18T08:08:23.860-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44928155/From_Folk_Musicians_to_Popular_Icons_The_Resilient_U%E1%B9%9Fumi_M%C4%93%E1%B8%B7am_Tamil_Folk_Drumming_Ensemble_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44928155", "summary": "This article discusses the concept of resilience within the context of Singaporean u\u1e5fumi m\u0113\u1e37am groups.

model of economic development, governance and management of inter-communal relations. Part travelogue, part history, Walton charts the opportunities and pitfalls confronting small states that have become particularly acute in an era of identity politics and civilizational leadership. Potential threats include not only the Singapore\u2019s struggle to insulate itself from global trends as well the impact of the rise of ultra-conservative attitudes in its majority Muslim neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, but also increased difficulty in balancing rival powers China and the United States. If that were not enough, Singapore is juggling multiple issues at a time that it is transiting to a new generational leadership faced with the challenge of ensuring that Singapore remains relevant to its neighbours as well as the international community at large.\n\nTo do so, Singapore\u2019s leadership will have to upgrade if not reinvent its relevance to its neighbours as well as the international community at large given tectonic geopolitical and technological shifts among which first and foremost artificial intelligence. Walton argues convincingly that complacency may be one of Singapore\u2019s greatest challenges. Generational change involves not only a new generation of leadership but also a generation that was born into a wealthy welfare state, lacks the older generations\u2019 sense of being pioneers and takes things for granted. It is a challenge that is likely to have consequences for a rethink of Singapore\u2019s education system, considered one of the world\u2019s best. In portraying the miracle of Singapore\u2019s success and the challenges it faces, Walton brings a strong sense of history, keen observation and a journalist\u2019s ability to paint with words an incisive picture of a country that has turned its lack of resources into an asset.\n\nListen to the podcast at https://dcs.megaphone.fm/LIT5437635421.mp3?key=ac069218022a771a4a516305aa6f55d5 \n________________________________________\nJames M.

While the reasons for migrating to Singapore are many and contextual, labour and education have been the primary driving factors for attracting\nmigrants from around the world to Singapore. Although a popular migrants\u2019 destination, education and migration policies in Singapore are often gendered, and are negotiated along and across other axes of identification and differentiation such as ethnicity and ideas of \u2018modernity\u2019. This article analyses gendered educational migration from Malaysia to Singapore focusing particularly on how educational migration leads to female self-transformation. Specifically, I argue that social actors negotiate educational migration within their gendered family constellations. The article first contextualises the empirical material by illustrating socio-historical processes in Singapore and Malaysia. In the next sections, I discuss my ethnographic methods and examine a brief history of the state of research in gender and educational migration. In conclusion, I offer a significant contribution to the growing and important body of scholarship on gender and transnational families by illustrating how gender is negotiated in migration using the case of a single Chinese woman\u2019s migration journey to becoming a \u2018modern woman\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50506770, "asset_id": 25486610, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49003838, "first_name": "Viola", "last_name": "Thimm", "domain_name": "uni-heidelberg", "page_name": "ViolaThimm", "display_name": "Viola Thimm", "profile_url": "https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/ViolaThimm?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49003838/12893031/49218176/s65_viola.thimm.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1909, "name": "Family studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14783, "name": "Biographical Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biographical_Methods?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 33481, "name": "Social Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Mobility?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 46400, "name": "Student Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Mobility?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 69256, "name": "Generations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generations?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 72708, "name": "Biography and Life-Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography_and_Life-Writing?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 153914, "name": "Malaysia education system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_education_system?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 296449, "name": "Singapore Education System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Education_System?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 356884, "name": "Social mobility and education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_mobility_and_education?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 402313, "name": "Biographical Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biographical_Research?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1440280, "name": "Educational Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2861313, "name": "chinese in malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/chinese_in_malaysia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2861328, "name": "malaysian education policies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/malaysian_education_policies?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 33532825, "title": "Singapore caught between a rock and a hard embrace", "created_at": "2017-06-18T02:49:33.775-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33532825/Singapore_caught_between_a_rock_and_a_hard_embrace?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_33532825", "summary": "A key feature of Singapore\u2019s foreign and security policy is its insistence to not \u2018choose sides\u2019 between the United States and China. Singapore\u2019s longstanding approach has so far relied on substantive overlaps in US and Chinese strategic interests. But changing strategic orientations in Beijing and Washington now see greater Chinese willingness to apply pressure to achieve its interests, as well as less US attentiveness to the region. Singapore\u2019s traditional political space may be shrinking, as might that of its traditional partners in ASEAN and elsewhere in the Asia Pacific. These developments may press the city-state to fundamentally recalibrate its strategic outlook.\n\nDiffering perspectives on the South China Sea territorial disputes, the nature of Singapore\u2013US ties and Singapore\u2019s unilateral military training in Taiwan have made Singapore a target for popular and sometimes official criticism in China. Beijing apparently snubbed Singapore by not inviting its prime minister to the inaugural Belt and Road Forum. China also consistently warns Singapore \u2018not to take sides\u2019 when it articulates positions that depart from China\u2019s, even when such statements simply reflect Singapore\u2019s own interests. This suggests China\u2019s preference for silence from Singapore on key issues.\n\nIn comparison, the past year has seen Washington\u2019s Asia policy vacillate from opposing China\u2019s expansive maritime claims to disinterest in the region. Such events make Singapore\u2019s external environment much more uncertain.\n\nWith Asia caught between greater US\u2013China friction, the range of realistic options for Singapore when it comes to not choosing sides is shrinking. Should the United States effectively cede its Asian influence to China, not choosing sides may come to mean that Singapore should refrain from actions or voicing concerns that Beijing finds objectionable. Such issues would at best emerge behind closed doors in bilateral settings where Beijing wields a significant advantage, given the stark power asymmetry. Singaporean concerns would be dependent on China\u2019s pleasure.\n\nSingapore\u2019s increasingly restricted options may limit it to a policy of strict neutrality that leaves both Washington and Beijing dissatisfied. Not only might such conditions reduce Singapore\u2019s ability to exercise initiative, but would also invite the United States and China to coerce Singapore into a sympathetic position or result in the city-state\u2019s isolation.\n\nIndeed, Singapore may have to accept \u2018Finlandisation\u2019 in the face of Chinese regional primacy, deferring to China on all foreign policy but keeping nominal independence. This is arguably already happening with some of its ASEAN neighbours. Under such an arrangement, Singapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be in the hands of Beijing\u2019s largesse.\n\nSelf-neutralisation is another possible response to greater US\u2013China contention in Asia, but this would risk making Singapore either irrelevant or an object of competition between the two major powers. There is of course the choice of picking between Washington and Beijing, but such a move introduces the danger of betting on the wrong ally, provoking major power ire, or being reduced to a major power proxy.\n\nAnother reaction could be to work with like-minded regional actors facing similar circumstances on regulating regional affairs in ways that go beyond the ASEAN framework. Candidates include Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and potentially Malaysia \u2014 all have long-term interests in maintaining substantive autonomy alongside regional stability, prosperity and sustainability. Such partnerships, if successful, can effectively manage key aspects of regional affairs even-handedly and blunt Washington and Beijing\u2019s need to directly oversee regional developments or compete for influence.\n\nNonetheless, establishing an enhanced basis for jointly handling regional affairs must overcome significant collective action problems and major power opposition. The enormity of such tasks places Singapore\u2019s fate in the hands of potential collaborators and ad-hoc cooperation rather than the established institutions and regimes to which Singapore is accustomed.\n\nPolitical dynamics in Asia may ultimately compel Singapore to re-examine its long-held position on external affairs. The old, comfortable approach of working with Washington for security and Beijing for prosperity \u2014 having its cake and eating it too \u2014 may be becoming increasingly unsustainable. Adjustments in US\u2013China relations might turn Singapore\u2019s fence-sitting from strategic advantage into cause for consternation.\n\nGoing forward, Singapore may have to be less complacent and more active in taking steps to handle the changing nature of Sino\u2013US relations and its consequences for Asia as disentanglement becomes more difficult. It may even need to demonstrate visible leadership on tricky issues ranging from managing disputes to regulating regional relations or tackling cross-border crime. This means being prepared to take political risks. Singapore and other actors can no longer simply hope for a happy middle ground between Washington and Beijing, and must instead address a much more uncertain and unpredictable reality.\n\nJa Ian Chong

"work_32593559", "summary": "This article discusses how the Singaporean Chinese director, Yi Shui, created a Malayanized Chinese-language cinema during the 1950s and 1960s, and offers a retrospective of the way people in Malaya and Singapore framed their nation-building discourse in terms of anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism after the Bandung Conference in 1955. This article holds that the term huayu dianying (Chinese-language cinema) was not first used in the 1990s by scholars in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but that its origins can be traced to Singapore and Malaya in the 1950s where Yi Shui promoted Malayanized Chinese-language cinema in the Nanyang Siang Pau. This earlier use of the term \u201cChinese-language cinema\u201d overlaps with its current academic usage, including films in Mandarin and Chinese dialects. In 1959, Yi Shui\u2019s essays were collected in On Issues of the Malayanization of Chinese-Language Cinema. Yi Shui also directed several Malayanized Chinese-language films. This article analyzes his \u201cChinese language cinema\u201d film practice by examining the discourses surrounding the \u201cMalayanization of Chinese-language cinema\u201d in order to show that his semi-documentary Lion City and the melodrama Black Gold attempted to mediate the misunderstandings rooted in the national boundaries and politics of various dialect groups through a \u201cmulti-lingual symbiosis\u201d of Chinese languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63289172, "first_name": "Wai-Siam", "last_name": "Hee", "domain_name": "nanyang",

Such changes in the urban identity of the city, that ranged from a major liberty given to the private sector to develop programmes of high-end housing to the construction of huge resorts and casinos have had a strong impact on the local conception of what urbanity is, in a country where the most common paradigms had been for 50 years that of collective public housing and of a strict, and sometimes intrusive, State supervision of urban virtues.

In earlier times its history was tightly knit to the development and prosperity of its port. Today\u2019s global trading hub, however, is broadly conditioned by its position within a global communications regime that includes various modes of transportation by sea, land and air, as well as electronic forms of communication such as telephony and the internet. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure are certainly prerequisites for success, but Singapore\u2019s rapid rise in becoming a global trading hub cannot be explained by these factors alone: the hub is backed by an array of industries that directly or indirectly support transport and trade at large, ranging from warehousing to finance and trade. All these activities, moreover, are regulated and driven by policies that have been carefully formulated and put into place over the past five decades. Then there is Singapore\u2019s greatest asset today: its people. In the context of this introduction, it is of course impossible to give a detailed or even comprehensive overview of the historical developments that have evolved and today underpin the global trading hub. What is possible, however, is to single out some of the developmental highlights as well as explain their historic relevance and interdependence. In the following sections I shall do so with an eye cast on history and chronological development as well as moving from the larger picture to the particular.

It is high on the agenda of Singapore policy makers due to the negative effects each severe iteration brings to Singapore. Through this study, I augment the literature by studying and describing the impact of the 2013 haze on Singapore. I do this by administering a qualitative survey of 421 households and application of various quantitative methods. I estimate that the 2013 haze, though brief, cost Singapore approximately SGD 341,000,000 (0.0960% of GDP). I find that prior work in quantifying damages associated with haze significantly underestimated losses accruing from foregone recreational activities and mitigative expenditures. I also find that a 1- unit increase in PSI increases 1\u20442-hour household energy demand by 0.635 MW, decreases tourist arrivals by an average of 78.53 persons per week, and increases polyclinic attendances by at least 2.526 persons per week.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37869745, "asset_id": 12123668, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5115953, "first_name": "Denis", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "columbia", "page_name": "DenisTan", "display_name": "Denis Tan", "profile_url": "https://columbia.academia.edu/DenisTan?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5115953/2241197/9830370/s65_denis.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9787, "name": "Environmental Policy and Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Policy_and_Governance?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11976, "name": "Air pollution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Air_pollution?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11979, "name": "Air Pollution and Health Effects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Air_Pollution_and_Health_Effects?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25445, "name": "Environmental Pollution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Pollution?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 129654, "name": "Air Pollution, Climate Change, Atmospheric Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Air_Pollution_Climate_Change_Atmospheric_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 326240, "name": "Long-range transboundary air pollution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Long-range_transboundary_air_pollution?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1913629, "name": "Transboundary Air Pollution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transboundary_Air_Pollution?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 12086497, "title": "INEQUALITY AS MERITOCRACY The use of the metaphor of diversity and the value of inequality within Singapore\u2019s meritocratic education system.

The paper employs a critical discourse analysis that draws upon the relationship between language analysis, the philosophical study of valuation, and political economy as a composite formulation of values to highlight the ways in which an argument for inequality permeates policy from within a frame of meritocracy, and to analyse how changes associated with new modes of value determination serve to legitimize inequality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37406152, "asset_id": 12086497, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 227900, "first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Fitzgerald", "domain_name": "umac", "page_name": "RichardFitzgerald", "display_name": "Richard Fitzgerald", "profile_url": "https://umac.academia.edu/RichardFitzgerald?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/227900/50721/46220713/s65_richard.fitzgerald.png"}, {"id": 1182718, "first_name": "Nadira", "last_name": "Talib", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "NadiraTalib", "display_name": "Nadira Talib", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/NadiraTalib?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1182718/2368696/41345125/s65_nadira.talib.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94, "name": "Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 938, "name": "Critical Discourse Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10633, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 30086, "name": "Critical sociology and politics of education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_sociology_and_politics_of_education?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1007924, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis of Media Texts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis_of_Media_Texts?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 9844852, "title": "Christopher (AKA Krzysztof) Konstanty Vorbrich \u2013 Sports CV \u2013 Scientific CV \u2013 A Letter of Recommendation from Professor Piotr Olszewski, Nanyang Technical University and the Changi Sailing Club in Singapore", "created_at": "2014-12-20T02:30:57.651-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9844852/Christopher_AKA_Krzysztof_Konstanty_Vorbrich_Sports_CV_Scientific_CV_A_Letter_of_Recommendation_from_Professor_Piotr_Olszewski_Nanyang_Technical_University_and_the_Changi_Sailing_Club_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_9844852", "summary": "I am writing a few lines to introduce a very old friend of mine Dr Krzysztof (Chris) K. Vorbrich, whom I think you might like to meet.\r\n\r\nI have known Dr Vorbrich since the beginning of 2001. In 2001 and 2002 he was attached to the Global Positioning Systems Centre at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. He has written almost hundred research papers on navigation and satellite navigation and he used his knowledge in Singapore with great success.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Singapore Dr Krzysztof K. Vorbrich gave more than 20 lectures on the topic of satellite navigation at NTU and other scientific organisations in Singapore. His work as a scholar versed in satellite navigation was outstanding; he showed great proficiency in general navigation and performed his task as a lecturer and research worker with great success.\r\n\r\nI have introduced Dr Vorbrich to become a guest member of the Changi Sailing Club in Singapore. I have had the pleasure to sail with him dozens of times in the waters near Singapore and Malaysia. I have found his skills in practical navigation and boat handling to be commendable, and equal to his theoretical training in those matters.\r\n\r\nI understand that Dr Krzysztof K. Vorbrich is travelling to UK in order to get more practice in skippering yachts, teaching and training. He is also planning to collect research materials in British libraries, universities and museums for his second PhD, which he is writing in the School of English Language at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any help you can give him in his endeavour.

"summary": "ABSTRACT Social media has a role to play in shaping the dynamic relations between immigrants and citizens. This study examines the effects of threat perceptions, consumptive and expressive use of social media, and political trust on attitudes against immigrants in Singapore. Study 1, based on a survey analysis (N\u2009=\u2009310), suggests that symbolic but not realistic threat perception, is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. The consumptive use of social media and political trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant attitudes. Moderation analyses suggest that consumptive social media use has negative consequences for individuals with increased symbolic threat perception and high political trust. But is there a correspondence between consumptive and expressive use of social media in terms of predicting prejudicial attitudes? Study 2 benchmarks the survey findings against participants\u2019 opinion expression via Facebook posts (N\u2009=\u2009146,332) discussing immigrants. Automated linguistic analyses reveal that self-reported survey measures correlate with the expressive use of social media for discussing immigrants. Higher anti-immigrant attitudes are associated with higher negative sentiment, anger, and swear words in discussing immigrants. The findings highlight the need to pay attention to the combined influence of social media use and individual political beliefs when analyzing intergroup relations.", "downloadable_attachments": [],

the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait lies Pedra Branca, an island of granite rock situated in hazardous waters. Its unexceptional presence belies a rich cartographical history and infamous reputation for leading ships to grief since antiquity. Pedra Branca was first pushed into the spotlight when the British constructed the Horsburgh Lighthouse in 1851. It later caught international attention when a heated territorial dispute for the island between Singapore and Malaysia arose, lasting from 1979\u20132018, with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) eventually granting rights to Singapore. The ensuing legal battle led to renewed interest in the geography and post-19th century history of the island. The most recent breakthrough, however, provides a glimpse into an even earlier history of Pedra Branca\u2014and by extension, Singapore\u2014as shipwrecked remains dating from the 14th century were uncovered in the surrounding waters.

For the last decades, the effects of globalisation have threatened this local knowledge, leading to the disappearance of cohesive environmental ethics. Recent political developments such as RIO+20 and the Nagoya Convention (2012) suggest that revisiting traditional ecological philosophies can provide new possibilities to approach current environmental crises.\nThe endeavour to defend local ecological philosophies and competencies is not a new phenomenon in the Asian context. First attempts can be traced back to the end of the industrial revolution, which overturned centuries of nature-and-culture adjustments, giving rise to the idea of political ecology. Theories discussing concepts such as \u2018citizen disobedience\u2019 (Thoreau, 1849), \u2018mutual aid\u2019 (Kropotkin, 1901), and \u2018universal geography\u2019 (Reclus, 1891) emerged alongside the ideas of ecological conservation and civil society resistance in the Asia Pacific region. For instance, a politician and social activist Shozo Tanaka, considered to be the first Japanese environmentalist, engaged in the advocacy for rural resistance following the Ashio mines pollution in 1890. Recent years have seen a resurgence of local political philosophies and a renewed focus on Asian ontologies lost since the nineteenth century.\nTo decipher current dynamics of Asian landscape, it is essential to understand and appreciate what is happening at a local level through analysing contemporary projects. Impacted by the environmental crises, Japan and Singapore have each demonstrated their capacity for resilience through the ecological philosophies deeply rooted in their ontologies. This represents a legitimate resistance to the current intellectual orthodoxy infused by various international congresses, which try to reassess each culture on generic models. Notably, two cases are examined here: the ecological philosophy approach of a landscape architecture firm in Japan dealing with social injustice, and the political ecology approach of urban farmers in Singapore addressing regional spatial injustice.\n\nAlban Mannisi, Deep Asian Ecology, in The Big Asian Book of Landscape Architecture, Heike Rahmann / Jillian Walliss (eds.), Jovis, Berlin, 2021, pp 177-179", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76999592, "asset_id": 65375461, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2540472, "first_name": "Mannisi", "last_name": "Alban", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "MannisiAlban", "display_name": "Mannisi Alban", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/MannisiAlban?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2540472/791494/18881811/s65_mannisi.alban.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 387, "name": "Japanese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3407, "name": "Environmental Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49926986, "title": "Food safety and tourism in Singapore: between microbial Russian roulette and Michelin stars", "created_at": "2021-07-14T19:37:07.017-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49926986/Food_safety_and_tourism_in_Singapore_between_microbial_Russian_roulette_and_Michelin_stars?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_49926986", "summary": "Drawing on multiple culinary traditions, foodways, and networks\nof trade, food is both good and important in Singapore.

This study examines the effects of threat perceptions, consumptive and expressive use of social media, and political trust on attitudes against immigrants in Singapore. Study 1, based on a survey analysis (N = 310), suggests that symbolic but not realistic threat perception, is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. The consumptive use of social media and political trust is negatively related to antiimmigrant attitudes. Moderation analyses suggest that consumptive social media use has negative consequences for individuals with increased symbolic threat perception and high political trust. But is there a correspondence between consumptive and expressive use of social media in terms of predicting prejudicial attitudes? Study 2 benchmarks the survey findings against participants\u2019 opinion expression via Facebook posts (N = 146,332) discussing immigrants.

This model is nonlinear because of the nonlinear boundary conditions and the moving seawater level boundary. It is therefore solved numerically with appropriate initial conditions. Good model-data comparison is confirmed with field measurements. Results show that the maximum seawall temperature reached as high as about 48 C. Temperature variation was illustrated using contour plots. A high temperature index on the seawall, T 95% , is defined as the threshold temperature that 95% of all temperatures at a given elevation do not exceed. T 95% will be useful for investigating the effects of temperature on biodiversity in intertidal systems. The effect of seawall slopes and monsoons on T 95% is further examined.

"summary": "One familiar, even pervasive, narrative in Singapore is that the country and its people live under the shadow of ever-present existential threats. Such dangers are supposedly always lurking just beneath the surface of internal prosperity and calm or just outside the country\u2019s borders, ready to ensnare Singapore and Singaporeans if they should ever let down their guard. From successive generations of political leaders to senior civil servants, estab- lishment elites repeatedly remind Singaporeans of these grave external dangers.5 ey reiterate the need for Singapore to be ever vigilant in the constant defence against perils beyond the border just to be able to survive. An extension to this account is the need to keep political and social liberalisa- tion in check lest they render Singapore vulnerable to deadlock, susceptible to unrest, and prone to predation. According to this perspective, only a government headed by a strong and capable ruling party that guarantees political stability can protect the nation, its people, and its prosperity from danger. is reasoning provides continuing justi cation for Singaporeans to accept the political status quo and continued controls over political contestation and civic organisation in Singapore. By taking a comparative perspective that considers other states in positions of external vulnerability, this essay brings the tension between security imperatives and greater political openness, plurality, and contestation into sharper relief. In doing so, I wish to encourage re ection over the possibilities for stable political evolution, security, and prosperity in the face of di cult conditions.", "downloadable_attachments": [],

Apart from participating in the Asian values debate of the 1990s, re-visioning itself as \u2018New Asia\u2019 and a global-Asian hub, and establishing Asian identities for the commodities it consumes and produces, Singapore has also repurposed its modernity, cultures, and ethos along similar regionalist precepts. However, even in recent times, Singapore continues to vacillate ambivalently between identifying with and differentiating itself from Asia.\r\n\r\nResponding to the challenges Singapore faces in coming to terms with its Asian identity, this book examines the complex cultural, social, and political underpinnings that have shaped Singapore\u2019s mainstream discourse on Asia. Indeed, it argues that its legacy as a colonial port city, the exigencies of managing the post-independence nation state, and the larger forces of imperialism and capitalism all contribute to its politics of Asianism. Taking a thoroughly interdisciplinary approach that spans history, cultural studies, postcolonialism, and cultural geography, Leong Yew reveals how Asia has been used to narrate Singapore\u2019s beginnings, revalidate Singaporean ethnic culture and to consolidate its practices of consumption and commodification.\r\n\r\nThis book will be welcomed by students and scholars working across a range of fields, including Asian culture and society, Asian politics, cultural theory and postcolonial studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32264956, "first_name": "Leong", "last_name": "YEW", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "lyew", "display_name": "Leong  YEW", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/lyew?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32264956/16720595/16998000/s65_leong.yew.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11354, "name": "Globalization And Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 231257, "name": "Southeast Asian Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 546460, "name": "Inter-Asia Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inter-Asia_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1370578, "name": "Asian Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 9488114, "title": "ON SOME ASPECTS OF THE SATELLITE I INERTIAL INTEGRATED NAVIGATION SYSTEMS", "created_at": "2014-11-25T00:38:04.424-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9488114/ON_SOME_ASPECTS_OF_THE_SATELLITE_I_INERTIAL_INTEGRATED_NAVIGATION_SYSTEMS?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_9488114", "summary": "Invited lecture presented at the GPSC.NTU Saturday seminar.

A unique feature of the book is that it focuses as much on films as it does on the societies from which these films emerge: it considers the reasons for film-makers taking the positions they take; the positions and counter-positions taken; the response of different communities; and the extent to which these interventions are connected to global flows of culture and capital.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of subjects covered include documentaries as political interventions in Singapore; political film-makers\u2019 collectives in the Philippines, and films about prostitution in Cambodia and patriotism in Malaysia, and the Chinese in Indonesia. The book analyses films from Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines, across a broad range of productions \u2013 such as mainstream and independent features across genres (for example comedy, patriotic, political, historical genres) alongside documentary, classic and diasporic films.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1167046, "first_name": "David C.

Past studies have established the links between the state\u2019s socioeconomic goals, the state\u2019s language policy, and their social impact on the average Singaporean. Elaborating on these studies, this paper regards modernity not in terms of the modernization theory but as a desired and imagined outcome of the language policy. This paper argues that the \u201clanguage struggle\u201d in Singapore is far from over with a state victory, as individuals and segments of the Chinese community continue to invest the \u201cstruggle\u201d with multiple meanings based on their social experiences. One durable form of resistance against the state hegemony over language issues appears in the broadcast mass media of film, radio, and television, where self-assured citizens and organizations have begun, in recent years, to challenge the state narrative of \u201clanguage for use and modernity\u201d and reclaim the relevance and validity of their own dialect or language in Singaporean society.",

moment in which the contemporary arts, new museums and art biennales have become linked to what can be called \u2018commodity reification\u2019  and a near-frenzied consumerism that are part of the free-market capitalism that became dominant after the fall of the Berlin Wall. This \u2018moment\u2019 \u2013 essentially from the 1990s for Singapore \u2013 has led to a seemingly overnight establishment of institutionalised art markets, galleries, museums and arts centres, notably The Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the Bay, opened on 12 October 2002. Such developments have transformed the puritanical and (that favoured People\u2019s Action Party [PAP] adjective) \u2018pragmatic\u2019 city-state from a purported \u2018cultural desert\u2019 into \u2026 what exactly?  A \u2018Global City for the Arts\u2019?  An empty cultural hub where other people\u2019s cultural products flow through,  and \u2018hip\u2019 capitalism is celebrated?\r\n\t\"On the one hand, the transformations have led to more outlets for the ambitions of younger writers, visual artists and theatre practitioners; on the other hand, paradoxically, I suggest that it has also contributed to a lack of critical clarity of what the arts might signify in relation to the global capitalist system within which the city-state is entrenched. This essay attempts to look at two specific events in 1993 and 1994 and consider what they might retrospectively reveal to us now of this extraordinary contemporary moment.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32648132, "asset_id": 5554595, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7346585, "first_name": "C.

The article explores the colonial origins of Singapore\u2019s contemporary ethnic population breakdown and the emergence of ethnic Chinese as the island\u2019s majority community. It examines how the Singapore government has come to officially depict the island\u2019s multicultural \u2018success story\u2019 since independence, and the official emphasis on the necessity of maintaining fixed ethnic ratios which ensure that Chinese remain roughly three-quarters of the island\u2019s settled population. At the same time, this article interrogates the official rationale behind such a policy, illuminating the colonial-era discursive assumptions that underpin it, and highlighting the way such assumptions have been contested. The article especially focuses on the role that immigration has played in the state\u2019s effort to ensure Singapore\u2019s racial \u2018balance\u2019, and argues that such an ethnically-determined immigration policy has frequently unsettled the Chinese majority it has been intended to bolster, while calling into question the multicultural idealism on which the Republic of Singapore was ostensibly founded.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5633584, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Frost", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "MarkFrost", "display_name":

here to share a testimony on how Dr Ighumhighu helped me. After a 5 year relationship with my boyfriend, he changed suddenly and stopped contacting me regularly, he would come up with excuses of not seeing me all the time. He stopped answering my calls and my sms and he stopped seeing me regularly. I then started catching him with different girls several times but every time he would say that he loved me and that he needed some time to think about our relationship. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about him so I decided to go online and I saw so many good talks about this spell caster called Dr Ighumhighu and I contacted him and explained my problems to him. He cast a love spell for me which I use and after 24 hours, my boyfriend came back to me and started contacting me regularly and we moved in together after a few months and he was more open to me than before and he started spending more time with me than his friends. We eventually got married and we have been married happily for 3 years with a son. Ever since Dr Ighumhighu helped me, my partner is very stable, faithful and closer to me than before.

We conducted a sequential exploratory mixed methods study using in-depth interviews, cyber ethnography and surveyor-administered structured surveys among sex workers. We report two key findings on how the pandemic has impacted sex markets in Singapore. First, the organisation of sex markets shifted as a result of lockdown and associated movement control measures. This shift was characterised by the out-migration of sex workers, the reduction in supply and demand for in-person sex work, and a shift towards online spaces. Second, we found that sex workers experienced greater economic hardship as a result of such changes. Given the potential shifts in sex markets as a result of the pandemic, we adopt a World Health Organisation Health Workplace Framework and Model to identify interventions to improve the occupational safety and health of sex workers in a post-COVID-19 era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79335513, "asset_id": 69113791, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19088624, "first_name": "Rayner Kay Jin", "last_name": "Tan \u9648\u5609\u9a8f", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "raynerkjtan", "display_name": "Rayner Kay Jin Tan \u9648\u5609\u9a8f", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/raynerkjtan?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19088624/5304720/48129042/s65_rayner_kay_jin.tan_.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15011, "name": "Sex Work", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_Work?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22739, "name": "Sex Industry and Workers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_Industry_and_Workers?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184813, "name": "Sex Work/sex Workers Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_Work_sex_Workers_Rights?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3567366, "name": "Coronavirus COVID-19", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coronavirus_COVID-19?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 66297211, "title": "The Big Question: What should governments keep secret?", "created_at": "2021-12-28T21:47:05.555-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66297211/The_Big_Question_What_should_governments_keep_secret?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_66297211", "summary": "&quot;Challenging Secrecy&quot; The increasing public demand for information is challenging long-held government insistence on secrecy throughout East and Southeast Asia. This applies as much to societies with open political systems, like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as those with more government control, such as China and Vietnam. Citizens are demanding access to official information on everything from environmental impact assessments to development zoning and food safety. In Singapore, perceived lack of transparency over population policy brought thousands out in an unprecedented protest in early 2013. Similarly, a desire for openness in the treatment of military personnel and the military justice system prompted approximately 250,000 people to demonstrate before Taiwan\u2019s presidential office in August 2013. The opacity of the Chinese political system makes it difficult for China\u2019s neighbors to understand the motivation behind Beijing\u2019s toughening position on maritime disputes, fueling regional apprehensions. Chinese officials admit not knowing the full extent of local government indebtedness, raising concerns about China\u2019s economy. The fact that member governments appear less forthcoming about ASEAN activities encourages skepticism about the organization\u2019s ability to deal with regional issues from maritime disputes to human trafficking. Too much government secrecy can hinder cooperation in a world where information of varying levels of quality is increasingly abundant. Persistent official reticence promotes a distrust of governments worldwide. Citizens, businesses, and other governments may fear the worst under such conditions. Governments do need confidentiality to function, yet need to develop procedures for responding effectively to shifting demands of openness and secrecy.

Singapore is a destination for migration for reasons of labour and education. The majority of educational migrants in Singapore are Chinese-Malaysian women. These actors shape the transnational space between their countries of origin and of destination, among other things, through bodily self-representation. Malaysia is a multicultural society with Malay Malaysians, Chinese Malaysians and Indian Malaysians. Ethnic categorizations build the basis for the Malaysian society, in which the Malay Malaysians benefit more from governmental politics than Chinese and Indian Malaysians do. Despite cultural diversity, Islam as the religion of the Malay Malaysians is the dominating one. Chinese Malaysian mid-dle-class women, who have access to the necessary resources, have developed their own ways to achieve social agency: they migrate to Singapore for further education. In Singapore, gender ideologies and practices are linked to modernity and Confucianism. Female educational migrants express these ideologies and practices with regard to the concept of the body through the way they dress. A lot of them constitute themselves as modern women through a certain level of bodily exposure. Whereas these social actors regard as modern the opportunity to present oneself in Singapore with naked shoulders, they distinguish themselves from the traditional lifestyle in Malaysia where they are required to wear long Muslim clothing. The social space constructed in such a way between Singapore and Malaysia is thus affected by using the gendered body as a means of self-transformation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48584238, "asset_id": 25486917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49003838, "first_name": "Viola", "last_name": "Thimm", "domain_name": "uni-heidelberg", "page_name": "ViolaThimm", "display_name": "Viola Thimm", "profile_url": "https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/ViolaThimm?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49003838/12893031/49218176/s65_viola.thimm.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 7216, "name": "The Body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Body?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 9834, "name": "Gender Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Discourse?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14162, "name": "Sociology of the Body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_the_Body?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 38503, "name": "Politics of the Body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_the_Body?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 46400, "name": "Student Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Mobility?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 106080, "name": "International student mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_student_mobility?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 110388, "name": "Biopower and Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopower_and_Biopolitics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 150472, "name": "Body politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Body_politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 592917, "name": "Female body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Female_body?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1440280, "name": "Educational Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2869705, "name": "singapore biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/singapore_biopolitics?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 35529287, "title": "British Empire: 12.

It had a functioning port and a shahbandar (port master). When the Portuguese merchantman Santa Catarina was attacked and plundered by the Dutch with the support of Johor on 25 February, 1603, Singapore became a cradle of the laws of war and peace. The incident formed the basis of a discussion by Hugo Grotius published in 1609 as The Freedom of the Seas. This was one of the historically most influential works ever published on the freedom of trade and navigation on the high seas. But that\u2019s not all.\n\nThe Portuguese authorities in Melaka were miffed at the loss of the Santa Catarina and at the staggering losses the Dutch and the Johoreans inflicted on the merchants of Macao, Melaka and Goa---the owners of the Santa Catarina\u2019s rich cargo. To punish Johor for its role in the Santa Catarina incident, the Portuguese imposed a blockade on the Johor River between in August and October, 1603. At the end of September, unexpectedly, a squadron of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) showed up off Pasir Panjang. The Dutch ships were lost and disoriented by the maze of islands of the Singapore Straits. While they were attempting to find their way through Singapore waters, they were informed by local fishermen of the Portuguese blockade. The events that began to unfold from this point onward brought the scene of action back to Changi.\n\nThe different stages of the Dutch battle with the Portuguese in the Johor River, off Changi and in the final stage off northern Batam were captured on a map sketch with published in 1606. This map sketch together with the travelogue of the Dutch naval commander who spearheaded the attacks on the Portuguese off Changi will form the backbone of this lecture.  \n\nhttp://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/what-could-we-learn-from-the-1603-sea-battle-off-changi-by-dr-peter-borschberg-98257684\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52742780, "asset_id": 32563543, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 4157, "name": "Naval Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_Warfare?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 12785, "name": "History of International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Relations?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 89295, "name": "Relaciones Internacionales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Relaciones_Internacionales?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Hist\u00f3ria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hist%C3%B3ria?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 132848, "name": "Diplomacia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 195481, "name": "Geopol\u00edtica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopol%C3%ADtica?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 316016, "name": "Geopolitica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitica?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 31528473, "title": "A Study of Attitudes of Dialect Speakers Towards the Speak Mandarin Campaign in Singapore", "created_at": "2017-02-20T04:12:18.804-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31528473/A_Study_of_Attitudes_of_Dialect_Speakers_Towards_the_Speak_Mandarin_Campaign_in_Singapore?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_31528473", "summary": "This book makes an original contribution to the fields of sociolinguistics, language planning policy and Chinese language studies. It examines the effectiveness of the Singapore's Speak Mandarin Campaign in changing the language use of dialect speakers towards Mandarin. Singapore may be only \" a small red dot \" and barely visible on the world's map. However, its complex and dynamic linguistic diversity and its quadrilingual educational system make it a unique and fascinating research site for examining deliberate language planning on the part of governmental authorities. 2017 marks the 38th anniversary of the Speak Mandarin Campaign, a focused language-planning policy aimed at changing the deeply entrenched sociolinguistic habits of Chinese Singaporeans who are used to speaking Chinese dialects. This book provides a revealing update on dialect speakers' attitudes towards the campaign by including discussions and other related issues such as the recent call for the revitalisation of Chinese dialects by younger dialect speakers, Chinese students' attitude towards learning Mandarin in schools, the encroachment of English in the home environment, the spread and dominance of English in the local linguistic landscape, and the challenges of maintaining Mandarin as a language of use and preference.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52209700, "asset_id": 31528473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4217969, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "NG: EdD (Applied Linguistics and TESOL) University of Leicester, UK", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PatrickNGEdDAppliedLinguisticsandTESOLUniversityofLeicesterUK", "display_name": "Patrick NG: EdD (Applied Linguistics and TESOL) University of Leicester, UK", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PatrickNGEdDAppliedLinguisticsandTESOLUniversityofLeicesterUK?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4217969/1661305/60406649/s65_patrick.ng_edd_applied_linguistics_and_tesol_university_of_leicester_uk.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82774, "name": "Chinese Dialects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Dialects?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 118144, "name": "Mandarin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mandarin?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 180300, "name": "Beliefs and attitudes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beliefs_and_attitudes?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 30701874, "title": "SARE: Southeast Asian Review of English Volume 50 (1), 2010/2011", "created_at": "2017-01-02T01:10:30.640-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30701874/SARE_Southeast_Asian_Review_of_English_Volume_50_1_2010_2011?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_30701874", "summary": "Special 30th anniversary of SARE, Southeast Asian Review of English, with particular emphasis on Singaporean and Malaysian literature.

The scene took place on a square carpeted area connected by Kabuki-style hanamichi-bridge ramps to curtained cubicles in the four corners. Some performers sported commedia dell'arte or Noh masks, while others (including the king) were clad in royal kimonos with ruffled collars. \n\nAsian-themed Shakespearean performance in Europe raises critical issues about cultural tourism and the identities of Shakespeare's text, Europe, and Asia. While various national Shakespeare traditions around the world also raise similar issues, the additional layer of defamiliarisation of performing Asian-themed Shakespeares for an European audience \u2013 rather than a home (Asian) audience or an English-speaking audience who often assume native familiarity with either Asia or Shakespeare \u2013 makes both Shakespeare and Asian audio-visual idioms seem at once familiar and alienated, which complicates the idea of the \"original\" and the \"derivative.\" \n\nHow do new sites of performance (Europe) and a non-Asian canon (Shakespeare) affect the traffic between European and Asian identities?\n\nAsian Shakespeares in Europe have evolved from something that is unfamiliar to something that is familiarly known at major festivals but that needs to be defamiliarised again, with Ninagawa being a prominent example. \n\nWhether watching these performances at their places of origin or in Europe, with or without the cultural and linguistic competence to understand them fully, the audience will become keenly aware of the gap between unexamined assumptions.

On his return to the Netherlands in the autumn of 1608 he began to write a series of epistolary reports and memoranda which were received and carefully studied by leading policy makers in the Republic at the time, including Hugo Grotius and Jan van Oldenbarnevelt.

readings of contemporary made-in-Singapore films (by Jack Neo, Eric Khoo, and Royston Tan) and television programs (Singapore Idol, sitcoms, and dramas), this book explores the possibilities and limitations of resistance within an advanced capitalist-industrial society whose authoritarian government skillfully negotiates the risks and opportunities of balancing its on-going nation-building project and its \u201cglobal city\u201d aspirations. This book adopts a framework inspired by Antonio Gramsci that identifies ideological struggles in art and popular culture, but maintains the importance of Herbert Marcuse\u2019s one-dimensional society analysis as theoretical limits to recognize the power of authoritarian capitalism to subsume works of art and popular culture even as they attempt consciously\u2014even at times successfully\u2014to negate and oppose dominant hegemonic formations.\r\n\r\nTable of contents\r\nList of Illustrations\t\r\nAcknowledgments\t\r\nIntroduction\t\r\n1.

The author provides a powerful synthesis of Frankfurt School critical theory and British cultural studies to provide an original mapping of Singapore and its key forms of television and film culture. The book is extremely well-written, organized, and argued and . . . could be a classic on its subject. . . . Drawing on a wealth of critical material, the author provides an insightful mapping of these cultural forms and creators of popular culture in Singapore. The author has a definite talent for providing excellent analysis with detailed reading of cultural texts and producers and a sharp critical eye that appeared very illuminating. These studies are exemplary works of concrete analysis of Singapore film and television . . . . \"\r\nDouglas Kellner, Philosophy of Education Professor at UCLA and author of Media Culture and Media Spectacle.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe author\u2019s mediations on the battles inside the PAP-fortress have yielded insightful commentaries about contemporary Singapore society, made the book an interesting and compelling read . . ., and . . . offered a welcome spark to much of the extant scholarship on Singapore media, culture and society that have come out of Singapore . . . . the author has done an admirable job in tackling the \u2018thinking-out-of-the box\u2019 task he has set out for himself. In so doing, the book highlights the contradictions of contemporary Singapore framed by state apparatuses that foster \u2018one-dimensional\u2019 thinking and behaviour on the one hand, and on the other, residents who are, or appear, less one-dimensional in their outlook and praxis. This book[\u2019s] . . . revealing light over the epistemology of the Singapore cultural closet lends fodder to the ongoing debates about contemporary cultural formations in regards to media, state, and society in the interdisciplinary areas of critical/cultural studies, transnational media studies, multicultural/postcolonial studies, and Asian/globalization studies . . . . It has appeal for both conservative and liberal academics, researchers and university students in these areas, Singaporean or otherwise \u2013 for different reasons, of course.\u201d\r\nProfessor Tan

reference to the decision by NUS Press's decision to cancel Pavin's book contract, the problem here is not a university press per se NOT publishing one academic's book, this happens to academics all the time-books are constantly rejected on the basis of peer review, incompatibility with the mission of the press and so on. An abandonment after selection and contract would seem to indicate that a university press responded to undisclosed \"stakeholder\" concerns. This seems to fit a pattern that has overtaken the evolution of universities across Asia. Professionally, I advocate the role of historians in trying to explain the background of contemporary problems and that policies could be better informed if they are made with an understanding of the history behind them, and this is what I will try to encourage briefly here. Across the long history-and I look beyond the first university at Bologna to early proto-universities at Nalanda and Gundishapur as well, so thousands of years-universities were actually given to parochialism, the teaching of religion, the education of noble sons to do and think exactly as their fathers had done and their peers would do, the university was a place where thinking was structured according to what I call state-think-I am here applying James Scott's concept of state space to the patterns of thinking 1-in a way that made thinking easy to conform to the state, to run the state, to lead the state. 2 The unspoken part of this process was learning how to control, suppress, and exploit the vast majority of the population. Colonial authorities knew this when they introduced colonial universities in the decades up to and just after World War I. These were to teach the colonial mother tongue, European ideas and values, and both obedience and the figurative whip through the provision of certain kinds of knowledge and behaviour. Select Southeast Asian youth of means and merit, would walk in elite children and walk out colonial bureaucrats, military officers, and intermediary elites. They saw or were meant to see the world as sharply defined, hierarchically stacked ethnic minorities, right and wrong moral sexual behaviour, the legitimacy of the huge global and racial disparities in wealth and just why Southeast Asians on the whole deserved to be servants and peasants, and why the indigenous mode of thought was inherently inferior to the western mode of thought.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65373762, "asset_id": 44863166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 136151, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Charney", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "MichaelCharney", "display_name": "Michael W Charney", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/MichaelCharney?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/136151/36138/43430952/s65_michael.charney.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 46666, "name": "Human Rights in Asia / ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_in_Asia_ASEAN?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 334316, "name": "ASEAN Plus Three", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Plus_Three?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 541313, "name": "LGBT rights in ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_rights_in_ASEAN?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 692049, "name": "ASEAN Political Security Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Political_Security_Community?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 995742, "name": "ASEAN Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Community?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1218765, "name": "National University of Singapore.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_University_of_Singapore?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44787297, "title": "Poverty in Paradise City: When the Jester has a broken Heart", "created_at": "2020-12-28T06:02:27.401-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44787297/Poverty_in_Paradise_City_When_the_Jester_has_a_broken_Heart?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44787297", "summary": "Via detailed personal interviews, this paper canvasses the views of leading Singapore opposition politicians and grassroots activists about poverty and income inequality in Singapore society.

Pictures in the SDP's promotional literature skillfully and dialectically present wealth and poverty in Singapore within the same pictorial image. Interviewees speak of the Dickensian living conditions in the one-room rental flats in Bukit Merah, just a taxi ride from Changi Airport, in the Minister Mentor Harry Lee Kuan Yew's constituency of Tanjong Pagar GRC. The SDP's Alternative Economic Programme It's about You (2010) outlines the Party's proposals for minimum wage and unemployment insurance. The researchers obtain direct and personal access to Singapore's grassroots opposition community, including people that are not party leaders and who are difficult to access. The views of this community have rarely been heard because of the Singapore Government's hegemonic control of mainstream media within the country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65281475, "asset_id": 44787297, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 179721135, "first_name": "Kieran", "last_name": "James", "domain_name": "westscotland", "page_name": "KJames", "display_name": "Kieran James", "profile_url": "https://westscotland.academia.edu/KJames?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/179721135/49778238/37786252/s65_kieran.james.jpg"}, {"id": 180637156, "first_name": "Rex John", "last_name": "Walsh", "domain_name": "uwsc", "page_name": "RexJohnWalsh", "display_name": "Rex John Walsh", "profile_url": "https://uwsc.academia.edu/RexJohnWalsh?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/180637156/50788830/38830944/s65_rex_john.walsh.jpeg"}, {"id": 25972556, "first_name": "Bligh", "last_name": "Grant", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "BlighGrant", "display_name": "Bligh Grant", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/BlighGrant?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25972556/7119191/8020329/s65_bligh.grant.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49459, "name": "Income inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Income_inequality?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 108578, "name": "Online activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_activism?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 133222, "name": "Poverty Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poverty_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 181131, "name": "Poverty Alleviation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poverty_Alleviation?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 301239, "name": "Social Media Activism ,Online Protest activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media_Activism_Online_Protest_activism?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 461769, "name": "Singapore Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Society?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 2194949, "name": "Singapore Opposition Political Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Opposition_Political_Parties?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 44741076, "title": "Three questions on Malayo-European relations from the Southeast Asian Perspective (sixteenth to eighteenth centuries)", "created_at": "2020-12-19T21:29:10.464-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44741076/Three_questions_on_Malayo_European_relations_from_the_Southeast_Asian_Perspective_sixteenth_to_eighteenth_centuries_?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_44741076", "summary": "This paper will identify and discuss some issues in the bilateral dealings that arise during the period of documentation of the early colonial powers.

I will be exploring the region around the Melaka and Singapore Straits, emphasising the polities of the so-called Malay Coast between Singapore and Tenasserim along the western shores of the Malay Peninsula and the Isthmus of Kra. Although the main geographic focus defined as such here, I will also reference other coastal polities in this region such as on Java, Sumatra, Borneo and Siam.

Of equal importance are polemical developments that play integral roles in influencing conditions for artistic and social (re)production in Singapore. In foregrounding society-space relations and the city, we argue that physical spaces are subject to a multitude of social imaginings, which are then projected back into urban space to convey individual and shared meanings, identities and purposes.

The focus is on films from Phase 1 of the project, which were integral to an immersive arts experience that featured artworks to be encountered. I analyse how these provide space for medical professionals to unravel silences surrounding EOL and express their feelings around grief. Considering that medical professionals are expected to practise \u201cclinical empathy\u201d in their profession of saving and prolonging lives, the implications of such films are profound for they offer insight into their moments of emotional vulnerability and reflexivity. While the films challenge the taboo of talking about death and are inclusive insofar as they attempt to reflect social diversity in gender, ethnicity, age and job designation in the representation of medical professionals on and in grief, the notion of the \u201cgood death\u201d valorises grieveable subjects who belong to the heteronormative family model. This raises questions as to whether those who fall outside this model and beyond are less worthy of grieving.

and control in Singapore. Researching and building upon Michel Foucault\u2019s disciplinary society, and Gilles Deleuze\u2019s societies of control, a hyperrestrained society is an amalgamation of the former two types of societies. The \u2018hyper\u2019 refers to the hyperreal image \u2014 essentially a photogenic neoliberalist, dystopian state \u2014 that is a product of the coexistent hyperreality of both disciplinary, and controlled society.\n\nFrom the perpetuality of a statist education system, to the culturally and militaristically coded semiotics, and finally the everyday corporate language, The Hyperrestrained Order reveals the systematic reorganization, and occupation of time-space through the mobilization-and-mobility of amass of obedient citizen bodies. And these time-spaces are the enclosures of schools, the military camps, and then the corporation, where one moves in absolute control, and obedience \u2014 seamlessly between them. When one moves from the military camp to the office for instance, one brings along the docile trainings from the military camp to an office, optimizing time, and thereby maximizing productivity and profit. Mobilization, as a key characteristic of a hyperrestrained society, hence, means the infrastructural state of motion \u2014 of capital, goods, time, money, people, and so on \u2014 in fully enclosed and controlled spaces.\n\nAll in all, the hyperrestrained order highlights the ambiguity of ideology of a band of iron fist state apparatuses, backed up by a well-rounded, and meticulous government that constantly reinforces its right to exercise power, legitimacy and authority. The HRO puts into perspective the global economic systems and regimes, and the violence of capitalist oppression by questioning the current rhetorics of semio-capitalist citizenship behind neoliberal-nationstates-turning-technocratic sovereignties.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39058572, "first_name": "Wayne", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "dutchartinstitute", "page_name": "waynewjlim", "display_name": "Wayne W .

The study is embedded in the disciplinary debates on migration and gender. The complexity of the issues of education, migration and gender as they operate along and across other axes of inequality and differentiation such as ethnicity and religion get analyzed by focusing the perspective of the social actors. The central questions that have guided the research are: Why do Chinese Malaysian women migrate to Singapore for further education? How do the social actors negotiate the education path in a gendered manner? Which strategies do the female educational migrants pursue through appropriation and allocation of certain gendered ideals and norms in transnational space?\r\nThe most important finding of the study points out that against the background of an ethnically segregated and patrilineal Malaysian society, educational migration to Singapore is the key for a transformation of femininity for Chinese Malaysian women as it implies extended scopes of action and relative independence. \r\nIn multicultural Malaysia, the Malay Malaysian population profits most from national politics. \r\nDespite cultural diversity in Malaysia, the government legitimates a cultural Malay supremacy. This is also linked to religion, as Islam has been established as the compulsory religion for the Malay Malaysians. These developments of in- and exclusion are based on colonial categorizations of \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 and the concept of multiculturalism. The ethnic segregation was introduced during British colonial times mainly through the establishment of a formal education system. \r\nDue to the social emphasis on ethnic boundaries, broad, supra-ethnic political action regarding women\u2019s and gender issues has so far been difficult to organize. The Chinese Malaysian women have been denied equal access to education and equal participation in national gender politics for the last four decades. But not only do multicultural politics hamper women-related issues, but also patrilineal Confucian elements of the Chinese population group itself contribute to the poor implementation of gender-related claims.\r\nSingapore with its multiethnic meritocratic society is the destination for the educational migration of Chinese Malaysian women who seek more equal opportunities. Its \u201amodern\u2018 neoliberal education system opens up more possibilities for the migrants. The young Chinese Malaysian women do not only migrate to the \u2018modern\u2019, but also to the Chinese-dominated Singapore. Therewith, the migration process is also a means of ethnic distinction. Through appropriations of \u2018modern\u2019, Chinese-focused discourses on femininity, the social actors distance themselves from the Muslim Malay norms concerning family constellations, sexuality and romantic love as well as the body. \r\nBy means of change in perspective, the book not only analyzes the stories and topics of young Chinese Malaysian women, but also of female Malay Malaysian students with their perspectives on the similar issues. Through this complex picture, the transnational space between Singapore and Malaysia gets analyzed as a place of social order.

Such lessons are premised on the belief that gay HIV-positive men are prophets with lessons of life and faith for Christian communities, rather than polluted victims of a disease who simply merit pastoral assistance. The analysis of the narratives of three gay, HIV-positive Christian men through a Constructivist Grounded Theory Methodology is assisted by Erlinda N. Senturias\u2019 notion of People Living with HIV and AIDs as bearing God\u2019s mission for human wholeness. It explains that these men see the intersection of their sexuality, serostatus, and faith as invitations to collaborate in the unfolding of God\u2019s plan in their lives, and to form a greater appreciation for their physical bodies and loved ones.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53114992, "asset_id": 33000038, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 802243, "first_name": "Joseph N.", "last_name": "Goh", "domain_name": "umonash-my", "page_name": "JosephNGoh", "display_name": "Joseph N.

is a migration country with multiculturalism. In the eyes of westerners, it\u2019s an oriental society while in the eyes of Asians, it\u2019s a Western society. Eastern and Western societies consider Singapore as a transit station. Chinese and Western cultures paradoxically blend in Singapore to form a unique ecological civilization which cannot be ignored \u201cred dot\u201d (statement from former Indonesian President Habibie). \u201cTransfer-post\u201d is a phrase from Wang Guowei in 1905 that he thought Japan translate western academic into Chinese. The paper borrows this phase, of course, not to confine to academic translation and unilateral impact studies, while to focus on a considerable extent that Singapore has replaced Japan as a bridge in politics, economy, culture, diplomacy, etc. between China and Western countries and Chinese and Western cultures were integrated amazingly. However, real social status in Singapore proves Samuel Huntington\u2019s Theory of Clash of Civilization potentially exist because of cultures\u2019 misunderstanding and reflect in all aspects of social lives. Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s three words, survival, security and success have become key words of the great little country. Indeed, powerful flexibility and absolute pragmatism form a successful paradigm, so-called \u201cSingapore PI\u201d, which will be tested by future practice.

During this period the sultanate was split by competing colonial powers into a British sphere of influence including Singapore, and the Dutch-controlled sphere of Riau-Lingga, setting the two regions on different trajectories. In this thesis, I argue that sound-making and hearing were an important channel through which the colonial encounter was mediated in this region. I demonstrate how sonic encounters between ethnically-defined communities were highly productive; pre-existing sonic ontologies were refashioned, and certain sounds acquired new meanings. My analysis of the contrasting contexts of Singapore and Riau shows that the political, economic and spatial contexts affected how sounds were heard, and that these three factors were inextricably linked.\n\tMy focus on sound encompasses music, sound-art and noise among other things, and accommodates opposing viewpoints. I write from the perspective of my source material, discussing Chinese processional music, cannon fire and reciting Malay voices alike from the perspective of the listener. Chapter 1 explores concepts of the functions and powers of sound as represented in traditional Malay texts prior to the 1820s. Drawing on the local press, travelogues and colonial records, Chapters 2 and 3 examine the role of sound in the cosmopolitan port city of Singapore, showing how sound formed a point of contact, conflict and compromise between ethnic communities. Chapter 4 explores how these same issues played out in the contrasting social and spatial context of Riau-Lingga. Chapter 5 returns to Malay literature, exploring the lively tradition of syair recitation in 19th-century Riau, and the affective power of human voices as represented in the syair themselves. I propose that the defamiliarisation of this colonial encounter through attention to sound highlights above all the affective aspect of this process.\n\n(PhD thesis, King's College London, 2015)", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28400601, "first_name": "Jenny", "last_name": "McCallum", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "JennyMcCallum", "display_name": "Jenny McCallum", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/JennyMcCallum?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28400601/10515394/11733932/s65_jenny.mccallum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6634, "name": "Soundscape Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7212, "name": "Sound studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 244916, "name": "Malay Language and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 13396408, "title": "Singapore, Southeast Asia and the Place of Orientalism", "created_at": "2015-06-28T18:36:03.305-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13396408/Singapore_Southeast_Asia_and_the_Place_of_Orientalism?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_13396408", "summary": "Although Edward Said\u2019s critique of Orientalism has provided an insightful way of thinking about how the Oriental other is represented, the fundamental platform that authorizes the representation is that of the \u2018West\u2019.

This applies as much to societies with open political systems, like Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as those with more government control, such as China and Vietnam. Citizens are demanding access to official information on everything from environmental impact assessments to development zoning and food safety.\r\n\r\nIn Singapore, perceived lack of transparency over population policy brought thousands out in an unprecedented protest in early 2013. Similarly, a desire for openness in the treatment of military personnel and the military justice system prompted  approximately 250,000 people to demonstrate before Taiwan\u2019s presidential office in August 2013.\r\nThe opacity of the Chinese political system makes it difficult for China\u2019s neighbors to understand the motivation behind Beijing\u2019s toughening position on maritime disputes, fueling regional apprehensions. Chinese officials admit not knowing the full extent of local government indebtedness, raising concerns about China\u2019s economy. The fact that member governments appear less forthcoming about ASEAN activities encourages skepticism about the organization\u2019s ability to deal with regional issues from maritime disputes to human trafficking.\r\nToo much government secrecy can hinder cooperation in a world where information of varying levels of quality is increasingly abundant. Persistent official reticence promotes a distrust of governments worldwide. Citizens, businesses, and other governments may fear the worst under such conditions. Governments do need confidentiality to function, yet need to develop procedures for responding effectively to shifting demands of openness and secrecy. Developments in this direction benefit citizens, businesses, governance, and foreign policy. This is an area where Asian governments can do more.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37314482, "asset_id": 11958023, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Indeed, how safe is safe? The notion of safe migration for FDWs can very well include the time period of their entire length of stay in Singapore. To what extent do recruitment practices, legislations, processes and various actors affect or influence the safety and sense of security of these women during their time spent overseas? This paper expands the concept of migration channels to examine the lived experiences of FDWs, and explores the notion that the safety and security of these migrant workers are impacted not just along the conventional channels comprising recruitment to destination, but also by specific elements related to these throughout their stay in Singapore. The paper examines the case of Filipino and Indonesian FDWs. It looks at these women\u2019s experiences in Singapore pertaining to migration channels, ideas of security and sense of stability, and thoughts of three key elements involved in their transnational movements: processes, actors and legislations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA version of this paper was presented as an article, 'Training centres to domestic workers - You have to obey', here:\r\nhttp://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/12/training-centres-to-domestic-workers-you-have-to-obey/\"", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 274610, "first_name": "Roderick", "last_name": "Chia", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RoderickChia", "display_name": "Roderick Chia", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RoderickChia?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/274610/63478/2474551/s65_roderick.chia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8620, "name": "Poverty Reduction Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poverty_Reduction_Strategies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10678, "name": "Human Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Security?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 17424, "name": "International Economic Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Economic_Relations?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974"}, {"id": 939198, "name": "Governance and State Capacity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Governance_and_State_Capacity?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 1369305, "title": "10.1 Reviewing Singapore Editorial", "created_at": "2012-02-10T00:07:27.612-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1369305/10_1_Reviewing_Singapore_Editorial?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_1369305", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 8534909, "asset_id": 1369305, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1042954, "first_name": "Moving Worlds:", "last_name": "A Journal of Transcultural Writings", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "MovingWorldsAJournalofTransculturalWritings", "display_name": "Moving Worlds: A Journal of Transcultural Writings", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/MovingWorldsAJournalofTransculturalWritings?f_ri=50974", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1042954/359589/48798111/s65_moving_worlds_.a_journal_of_transcultural_writings.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=50974", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134697, "name": "Singapore Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Literature?f_ri=50974"}]}, {"id": 837373, "title": "Project Time revisited: thoughts on skin therapy, urban planning and Singaporean Angst", "created_at": "2011-08-16T12:34:49.934-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/837373/Project_Time_revisited_thoughts_on_skin_therapy_urban_planning_and_Singaporean_Angst?f_ri=50974", "dom_id": "work_837373", "summary": "In Project Time, A Theatre of Music1, we examined \u2018time\u2019 as the domain where the old and the new coexist in Singapore, articulated through the meeting of Indian and Chinese drumming with interactive computer sound transformation.
