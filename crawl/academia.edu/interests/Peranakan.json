This condition relates closely to authentic or traditional buildings at particular places. In real situations, vernacular architecture comes into being through different socio-cultural dynamics and from any existing building that provides sustainable solutions and sustainable characteristics containing material and immaterial values. The Peranakan houses in Lasem can be included in this category. They can last for generations and facilitate a variety of daily activities across generations with their own values. The varied activities can help identify the unique spatial characters, and create particular experiences. This qualitative study is based on the writer's experience and supported by spatial experience concept by Juhani Pallasmaa. This study sought to provide insights leading to an in-depth understanding of vernacularity through spatial experiences in Peranakan house-Kidang Mas in Lasem. The findings of the study unveiled that the dynamic changes of activities that involve family and non-family members inside the complex of Peranakan house-Kidang Mas is the justification of being vernacular.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64417509, "asset_id": 44073374, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51183876, "first_name": "Tessa Eka", "last_name": "Darmayanti", "domain_name": "maranatha", "page_name": "tessaekaDarmayanti", "display_name": "Tessa Eka  Darmayanti", "profile_url": "https://maranatha.academia.edu/tessaekaDarmayanti?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51183876/13550550/14723282/s65_tessa_eka.darmayanti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5553, "name": "Interior Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Design?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7654, "name": "Vernacular Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vernacular_Architecture?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 310595, "name": "Peranakan Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Culture?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 717248, "name": "Spatial Experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Experience?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 913777, "name": "Vernacular Settlements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vernacular_Settlements?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 1397747, "name": "Straits Settlements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_Settlements?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 37774832, "title": "Understanding the Chinese problem: Why have Peranakan been excluded from the imagined Indonesian nation", "created_at": "2018-11-14T16:12:29.494-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37774832/Understanding_the_Chinese_problem_Why_have_Peranakan_been_excluded_from_the_imagined_Indonesian_nation?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_37774832", "summary": "The phrase \u201cthe Chinese problem\u201d is used to describe the fragmentation of the ethnic Chinese group from the Indonesian nation, and their subsequent discrimination . In other words, the failure for ethnic Chinese Indonesians to be accepted as \u2018fully\u2019 a part of the Indonesian imagined community- following the definition of a nation as an imagined community, provided by Anderson . Ethnic Chinese Indonesians are a minority group in Indonesia, large in number and strong in the economic and trade industries . Recorded to make up 3% of the population according to the latest 2010 census , they are not a homogenous group, as Chinese in Indonesia have historically come from diverse ethnic backgrounds including Hakka, Hokkein, Teochieu and Cantonese. The minority is also religiously diverse. However, it has become commonplace in the literature for the primary distinction to be made between totok (Chinese migrants) and pernanakan (ethnically \u2018mixed\u2019 Indonesian born) Chinese. There has existed an unshakeable tendency for discrimination towards the Chinese minority, that has manifested into violence several times since the beginning of the Suharto era. Although the Chinese have existed in Indonesia since the pre-colonial period and are in many ways another segment of the diversity that Indonesia is characterised by, there remains a distinct attitude from pribumi (indigenous Indonesians) of racialized animosity towards Chinese Indonesian groups. This was demonstrated in 2017, when huge riots occurred which resulted in the arrest of the ethnically Chinese former Jakarta governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (known by his Hakka nickname \u2018Ahok\u2019). This essay asks the question; What are the fundamental causes of this longstanding discrimination? The problem seems to boil down to a history of tension over several issues. Economic jealousy provides the dominant explanation, coupled with a nationalist suspicion of the peranakan as holding loyalties to China, not Indonesia. Homogenisation of peranakan and totok groups, a lack of cultural assimilation, and religious differences are also factors. All of the aforementioned causes have, at some point, been perpetuated by the actions (or inactions) of Indonesian governments. Ergo, this essay primarily uses a state centred approach, grounding its analysis in Indonesian political eras in order to better understand the history and origins of the discrimination of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia. It begins with an analysis of the colonial era at the end of the 19th century.

Namun, fenomena ini sebenarnya bukanlah satu perkara baru, sebaliknya berlaku sejajar dengan pertembungan kontak antara etnik. Ini dibuktikan dengan kewujudan golongan Peranakan yang muncul hasil daripada proses asimilasi yang dimangkinkan oleh amalgamasi sosial (perkahwinan campur) secara turun-temurun antara kumpulan etnik majoriti dengan kumpulan etnik minoriti yang diamalkan secara meluas. Justeru, makalah ini cuba mengupas manifestasi isu perkahwinan campur dalam konteks fenomena Peranakan di Semenanjung Malaysia. Makalah terdiri daripada tiga bahagian utama. Bahagian pertama menyerlahkan kepelbagaian komuniti-komuniti Peranakan yang wujud di Semenanjung Malaysia. Bahagian kedua pula membincangkan faktor-faktor yang dikenal pasti sebagai penggalak kepada amalan perkahwinan campur untuk berlaku secara meluas sehingga membawa kepada kemunculan golongan Peranakan. Seterusnya, bahagian ketiga memfokus kepada penerimaan golongan Peranakan oleh masyarakat. Daripada situ dapat disimpulkan bahawa isu mengenai perkahwinan campur bukanlah disebabkan oleh masalah dalam institusi perkahwinan itu sendiri, sebaliknya berakar-umbi daripada isu pengkategorian masyarakat mengikut garis etnisiti yang terlalu sempit dan superfisial sehingga menidakkan kewujudan interaksi antara etnik yang subur dan dinamik dalam realiti kehidupan sebenar.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40560151, "asset_id": 16000599, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 945967, "first_name": "Giok Hun", "last_name": "Pue", "domain_name": "ukm", "page_name": "GiokhunPue", "display_name": "Giok Hun Pue", "profile_url": "https://ukm.academia.edu/GiokhunPue?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/945967/351754/16079111/s65_giok_hun.pue.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307453, "name": "Peranakan Chinese of Kelantan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Chinese_of_Kelantan?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 1197992, "name": "Social Amalgamation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Amalgamation?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 4098888, "title": "The Straits Chinese Magazine: A Malayan Voice", "created_at": "2013-07-24T15:43:50.903-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4098888/The_Straits_Chinese_Magazine_A_Malayan_Voice?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_4098888", "summary": "By the late 19th century, a number of Straits Chinese, or Peranakans, had acquired status, wealth and academic standing.

It is found that while Peranakan identity conveys the spirit of \u2018diversity in unity\u2019, the polemic of plural identity becomes an issue when the society especially on the State level does not recognize or is ill-prepared in managing and negotiating their (dis)position in present-day legislation system.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46843576, "asset_id": 20244883, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 945967, "first_name": "Giok Hun", "last_name": "Pue", "domain_name": "ukm", "page_name": "GiokhunPue", "display_name": "Giok Hun Pue", "profile_url": "https://ukm.academia.edu/GiokhunPue?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/945967/351754/16079111/s65_giok_hun.pue.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12098, "name": "Ethnic Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Identity?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307453, "name": "Peranakan Chinese of Kelantan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Chinese_of_Kelantan?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 27367843, "title": "Peranakan identity at the crossroads of Empire, the Malay World and the Sinophone World, c. 1900-1930", "created_at": "2016-07-29T07:32:37.859-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27367843/Peranakan_identity_at_the_crossroads_of_Empire_the_Malay_World_and_the_Sinophone_World_c_1900_1930?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_27367843", "summary": "The long-term migration of peoples into Southeast Asia resulted in the emergence of various \u201cPeranakan\u201d cultures. \u201cPeranakan,\u201d meaning locally-born, seems definitive today with the development of Peranakan heritage tourism in Southeast Asia.  This paper focuses on the Babas and Nyonyas of Chinese descent,  and seeks to deconstruct presentist notions and definition of \u201cPeranakan.\u201d Also known as the \u201cStraits Chinese,\u201d as many Babas and Nyonyas lived on the Straits Settlements, \u201cPeranakan\u201d was chosen to contest the geography of cultural identity. \n\nResearch on the Peranakans is largely based on The Straits Chinese Magazine  (1897-1907). By comparing it with other English and Romanised-Malay publications, this paper questions if Peranakans have always been as Anglicised as perceived to be. Academic attention on the SCM and the Straits Chinese Reform Movement has led to a domination of the Straits Chinese British Association dominating historiographical impressions of \u201cPeranakan\u201d socio-political identity.\n\nBesides the mixture of languages used, Chinese classics and English literature were adapted in these texts. Debates found in these texts ranged from the opium debate, gambling, to schooling. Schools were an avenue for the Methodist movement, \u201cAnglicization,\u201d and socio-economic improvement. The backdrop for these debates was the 1911 Chinese Republican movement that revitalised debates on \u201cChineseness,\u201d strong Victorian-English pride, and the development of writing and translation in the Malay literary sphere. Using the long-running theme of what was \u201cproper\u201d behaviour amongst the Nyonyas, this paper seeks to argue that Peranakan cultural identity was ever-changing.

These projects simultaneously foreground Straits Chinese history as a symbol of interracial harmony and marginalize it as a cultural artifact. Over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the ethnoculturally hybrid Straits Chinese positioned themselves as \u201cthe King\u2019s Chinese,\u201d champions of a Confucian-values renaissance, and citizens of independent Malaysia and Singapore. Their adaptability helped them survive the upheaval of imperialism, decolonization, and nation building, but it was also controversial for its suggestion of political flexibility. Today, Southeast Asian governments and the Peranakan themselves depict the community as a uniquely local model of ethnic integration. Museums and historic homes emphasize portrayals and consumption of supposedly feminine aspects of Peranakan culture (e.g., fashion and cuisine), while downplaying purportedly masculine elements (e.g., the possession of multiple nationalities). By conflating femininity, tradition, and racial hybridity, this approach reifies stereotypes about gender and cultural identity, and replaces transgressive potential with politically anodyne nostalgia and commercialization. As anxieties about race, national history, and belonging continue to undergird the modern polity, transnationalism and transculturalism are acceptable as long as they are confined to the past.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56840983, "asset_id": 28004840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10194240, "first_name": "Karen", "last_name": "Teoh", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "KarenTeoh", "display_name": "Karen Teoh", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/KarenTeoh?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10194240/14772974/15579444/s65_karen.teoh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 40719, "name": "Museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 638003, "name": "Straits Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_Chinese?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 11346368, "title": "Multilingual mediators: The (continuing) role of the Peranakans in the contact dynamics of Singapore", "created_at": "2015-03-09T20:23:36.991-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11346368/Multilingual_mediators_The_continuing_role_of_the_Peranakans_in_the_contact_dynamics_of_Singapore?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_11346368", "summary": "The Peranakans \u2013 descendants of 18th/19th-century southern Chinese seafaring traders in Malaya and local women, a privileged minority group in the Straits Settlements with pro-British alignments and access to English education \u2013 are well placed as a locus for contact dynamics in a diverse, multilingual context, their linguistic repertoire comprising Baba Malay (BM), (Peranakan) English (PerE), and Chinese languages.

Hidup sebagai perantau jauh lebih berat, oleh karena itu orang-orang Tionghoa lebih ekstra dalam menghadapi segala hal. Dan ingat tidak semua orang Tionghoa di Indonesia kaya, banyak dari mereka juga miskin dan tertindas seperti di Tangerang dan Kalimantan Barat.

To TCPA members, \u2018Mek Awang\u2019 is a derogatory term, which the Malays used to refer to someone as being \u201csoft\u201d, effeminate, or a cross-dresser. However, TCCCI has appropriated the term Mek Awang and used it as a brand name to promote the Festival, and to highlight the \u201cuniqueness\u201d of the Terengganu Chinese Peranakan community. This case is an example of how local cultural terms or practices have been readapted to suit tourism interests. Tourism is often accused of reinventing culture for capital ventures. Consequently, many academics and social critics have come to regard official national heritage sites and heritage tourism with scepticism and disdain. Combining ethnographic data from our in-depth interviews with the Terengganu Peranakan Chinese and our participant observation during the Festival, we argue that the dispute over \u201cMek Awang\u201d is not only a simple change in reference, but is also an indication of a deeper contemporary global process that affects ethnic minorities and their identities. We conclude that various attempts to commodify the peranakan experiences and culture in Terengganu as well as the intention to place the peranakan as a marketable heritage in Chinatown can be interpreted as attempts to replace a heterogeneous community with a homogeneous, uniform, genetic, and identifiable ethnic category with a Peranakan (with capital \u201cP\u201d) identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67363184, "asset_id": 48971280, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 74031583, "asset_id": 48971280, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 268935, "first_name": "Hong Chuang", "last_name": "Loo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AndrewLoo", "display_name": "Hong Chuang Loo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AndrewLoo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/268935/66050/55872973/s65_hong_chuang.loo.png"}, {"id": 945967, "first_name": "Giok Hun", "last_name": "Pue", "domain_name": "ukm", "page_name": "GiokhunPue", "display_name": "Giok Hun Pue", "profile_url": "https://ukm.academia.edu/GiokhunPue?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/945967/351754/16079111/s65_giok_hun.pue.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4071, "name": "Heritage Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Tourism?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43883, "name": "Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 87976, "name": "Chinatowns", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinatowns?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 3035308, "name": "Peranakan Chinese of Terengganu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Chinese_of_Terengganu?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 22985215, "title": "The Complex World of the Chung Hwa Hui: International Engagements of Chinese Indonesian Peranakan Students in the Netherlands, 1918\u20131931", "created_at": "2016-03-08T05:32:13.456-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22985215/The_Complex_World_of_the_Chung_Hwa_Hui_International_Engagements_of_Chinese_Indonesian_Peranakan_Students_in_the_Netherlands_1918_1931?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_22985215", "summary": "This article discusses the transnational contacts of Indonesian Chinese in the Netherlands in the interwar period.

Woman Series \" could be read through three main significant trajectories in parallel with the Peranakan ethos\u2014the persistence of nature veneration against mortality and ancestor worship, refined etiquette and gender roles, and camaraderie and communal guest reverence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55002783, "asset_id": 35141200, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44986, "first_name": "Sarena", "last_name": "Abdullah", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "SarenaAbdullah", "display_name": "Sarena Abdullah", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/SarenaAbdullah?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44986/14301/25059707/s65_sarena.abdullah.jpg"}, {"id": 32723386, "first_name": "Eddy", "last_name": "Musa", "domain_name": "mmu-my", "page_name": "EddyMusa", "display_name": "Eddy I Musa", "profile_url": "https://mmu-my.academia.edu/EddyMusa?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32723386/9759234/44106592/s65_eddy.musa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 159045, "name": "Malaysian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Art?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 183906, "name": "Erwin Panofsky", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Erwin_Panofsky?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2512600, "name": "Sylvia Lee Goh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sylvia_Lee_Goh?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36382347, "title": "Colonial Discourse in Perspective: The Malay Peninsula in John Crawfurd's Ideas on Ethnology and World History", "created_at": "2018-04-11T00:46:16.687-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36382347/Colonial_Discourse_in_Perspective_The_Malay_Peninsula_in_John_Crawfurds_Ideas_on_Ethnology_and_World_History?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_36382347", "summary": "This chapter examines how the Malay Peninsula shaped the ethnological and historical writings of the nineteenth-century British scholar-administrator of Southeast Asia, John Crawfurd (1783-1868), who served as the second British Resident of Singapore (1823-6).

"work_39677709", "summary": "In 1932, Aree Khorchareon, a Thai man of Penang-Hokkien descent opened a photography studio under the moniker of Liang Ewe. Liang Ewe has been regarded as a master of modern photography in Thailand due to his technical finesse in spite of being self-taught. The name of the studio which means \u201cgood friend\u201d, became synonymous with Khorchareon\u2019s mastery that it became his alias.  The purpose of this essay is to demonstrate how Liang Ewe can be conceived as a site of Asian interactions and its photographs as \u201carchives of hybridity\u201d. An examination of selected studio portraits provide an understanding of intercultural processes that entail the transnational flow of people, goods and ideas that became \u201cdeeply localized\u201d into mid-20th century Phuket. By taking into account of the town\u2019s role in converging regional networks due to the tin-mining boom, the studio can be interpreted as \u201ca space of translocal communications and a site for experimentation with new identities\". As a result, Liang Ewe provides the means of visualizing the expressions of dynamic mobile histories and highlight the negotiation  between modern inclinations of national identity and cosmopolitan practices that are not necessarily bounded by fixed categories.

The first were descendants of Chinese sea-faring merchants who settled in the Nanyang colonies such as Batavia (Jakarta) and Penang and Malacca, where some of the earliest portraits still survive. The Straits Chinese did not only established themselves in the Straits Settlements but also in many parts of the archipelago where they were equally as prominent and firmly established. Hence, Colonial Singapore and the Straits Settlements cannot be talked about separate from other Straits Chinese communities from other colonies. The paintings and photographs in the NUS Museum Straits Chinese Collection and the Peranakan Museum\u2019s Straits Chinese Chinese portrait collections has formed most of the content of this study.  As these are the first of these types of pictures to be studied and seen rigorously, this study is limited to portraits of the early Chinese residents in Singapore and the older colonial settlements such as Malacca, Penang and Java. Although there is to be found, some portraits of Arabs, Chettiars, Malays and Europeans, they will not be included in the scope of this study. The Chinese, being the most populous of the groups, have provided for the bulk of surviving examples of portraits were produced by Chinese artists as well as portraits depicting the Chinese. \n\nThis early period of artistic production that warrants requisite attention and should be situated at the very threshold of early modernities in Singapore\u2019s History of Art. A revision of this historiography is therefore deservedly requisite. In addition, the development of artistic practices in Singapore have undeniably inextricable connections to the artistic practices in her neighboring countries, hence must be articulated not by national narratives nor circumscribed by national borders. These recent discoveries of early pictures germane to this study will therefore be a pioneering attempt at establishing a new framework for Singapore\u2019s History of Art.\n\n",

Most studies on the Peranakan examine the architectural heritage, material culture and cuisine; there is limited focus on the study of visual artworks of the Peranakan. This paper explores and analyses a painting series entitled, \" Woman Oh! Woman Series \" by Sylvia Lee Goh, a descendant of a Peranakan family in Kedah, who works predominantly in producing Nyonya-themed paintings. This paper provides a deeper reading of this series by drawing on Panofsky's theory of iconography and iconology as a tool in discussing these artworks within the larger context of Peranakan culture. Through Panofsky's three stages of iconography, this paper explores how the four artworks in the \" Woman Oh! Woman Series \" could be read through three main significant trajectories in parallel with the Peranakan ethos\u2014the persistence of nature veneration against mortality and ancestor worship, refined etiquette and gender roles, and camaraderie and communal guest reverence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54968237, "asset_id": 35106802, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32723386, "first_name": "Eddy", "last_name": "Musa", "domain_name": "mmu-my", "page_name": "EddyMusa", "display_name": "Eddy I Musa", "profile_url": "https://mmu-my.academia.edu/EddyMusa?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32723386/9759234/44106592/s65_eddy.musa.jpg"}, {"id": 44986, "first_name": "Sarena", "last_name": "Abdullah", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "SarenaAbdullah", "display_name": "Sarena Abdullah", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/SarenaAbdullah?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44986/14301/25059707/s65_sarena.abdullah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 869, "name": "Iconography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iconography?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 140475, "name": "Lifestyle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lifestyle?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310595, "name": "Peranakan Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Culture?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1590479, "name": "Nyonya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nyonya?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 2512600, "name": "Sylvia Lee Goh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sylvia_Lee_Goh?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 13304989, "title": "The art of losing: Beyond java, patois and postvernacular vitality -- Repositioning the periphery in global Asian ecologies", "created_at": "2015-06-26T01:15:10.214-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13304989/The_art_of_losing_Beyond_java_patois_and_postvernacular_vitality_Repositioning_the_periphery_in_global_Asian_ecologies?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_13304989", "summary": "This paper discusses issues in endangerment and postvernacularity in the context of Asia, a region with complex dynamics in multilingual ecologies that also includes the presence \u2013 dominance \u2013 of English, a language that entered the ecologies through colonisation.

There is recognition, in particular, of how the evolution of Englishes in the non-settler, exploitation colonies in Asia is in many ways viewed as the epitome of language contact dynamics \u2013 because of the range of typologies of the indigenous languages in multilingual ecologies, which make for radically diverse Englishes, as well as because of language policies which have afforded the spread and penetration and thus evolution of the new varieties. The significance of a language contact analysis of Asian Englishes for the theorisation of World Englishes is however sometimes understated. In this paper we distil several of these contributions. We consider not only the usual account of contact between the English-speaking and indigenous language communities during Britain\u2019s trade and colonisation ventures from the 17th through 19th centuries, but also highlight other contact circumstances pre-dating British, such as that amongst various Asian communities, and with the Portuguese, evaluating the importance of contact chains. We illustrate how the evolution of features such as tone, particles, and mixed codes demonstrates the limits or otherwise on the typology of the emergent World English varieties. We also reflect on how, with communities who, even with English as a post/colonial language, are essentially other-language-dominant, contemporary contact situations such as computer-mediated communication (CMC) serves as a vital platform and catalyst for the evolution of multilingual English varieties \u2013 favouring the use of English, promoting significantly more mixing with and calqueing into English compared to spoken discourse, and prompting subsequent spread to other domains. In all the above, we draw parallels with other contact scenarios, to underscore how the dynamics and outcomes in World Englishes align with general patterns of contact and evolution. In so doing, we call for greater attention not just to the significance of the multilingual ecology in investigating World Englishes, but also to the positioning of World Englishes research more broadly within language contact, for a more unified theorising in the discipline.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71894014, "asset_id": 56573527, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2486555, "first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "curtinedu", "page_name": "LisaLim", "display_name": "Lisa Lim", "profile_url": "https://curtinedu.academia.edu/LisaLim?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2486555/777357/40025270/s65_lisa.lim.jpg"}, {"id": 78378, "first_name": "Umberto", "last_name": "Ansaldo", "domain_name": "curtinedu", "page_name": "UmbertoAnsaldo", "display_name": "Umberto Ansaldo", "profile_url": "https://curtinedu.academia.edu/UmbertoAnsaldo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/78378/84709/19858996/s65_umberto.ansaldo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5401, "name": "Computer-Mediated Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer-Mediated_Communication?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6642, "name": "Language Evolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Evolution?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 8998, "name": "Pidgins & Creoles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pidgins_and_Creoles?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 10632, "name": "World Englishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Englishes?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 25021, "name": "Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 28056, "name": "History of English Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_English_Language?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 29668, "name": "Tone systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tone_systems?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 32841, "name": "Language Typology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Typology?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 38910, "name": "Linguistic Typology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Typology?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 50796, "name": "Language contact", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_contact?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 240278, "name": "Code switching and code mixing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Code_switching_and_code_mixing?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 973080, "name": "Translanguaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translanguaging?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 1017078, "name": "Singapore Colloquial English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Colloquial_English?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 40002913, "title": "Between Empire and Nation(s): The Peranakan Chinese of the Straits Settlements, 1890-1948", "created_at": "2019-08-03T03:17:06.235-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40002913/Between_Empire_and_Nation_s_The_Peranakan_Chinese_of_the_Straits_Settlements_1890_1948?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_40002913", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34765810, "first_name": "Bernard", "last_name": "Keo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "BernardKeo", "display_name": "Bernard Z Keo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/BernardKeo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34765810/10140856/21850235/s65_bernard.keo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

stemmed from amalgamation as part of assimilation process which occurs continuously in interethnic relations between the majority ethnic group and the minority. It is an ethnic group that is often overlooked in the discourse of ethnicity as a way to organise social difference in a society into different ethnic categories. The perception that such a group has no place in mainstream society is reflected by the way labels that are created and used on the group tend to be negative and pejorative. As a result, this contributes to ethnic contestation in the society. However, this is not the case in the Malay Archipelago where culturally localised, local-born of non-indigenous descent, particularly offspring from mix-marriage with native women, are referred to as \u2018Peranakan\u2019. Derived from the root word \u2018anak\u2019 (meaning child), Peranakan may be seen as one of rare social concepts that refers to amalgam in a neutral, if not positive way where the majority accepts the minority as one of their own while simultaneously acknowledging the latter\u2019s ethnic differences. As such, Peranakan may be adopted into societies from non-Malay world as a more suitable social concept to explain amalgamation harmoniously as a way to promote social cohesion in a society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60988589, "asset_id": 1582795, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 945967, "first_name": "Giok Hun", "last_name": "Pue", "domain_name": "ukm", "page_name": "GiokhunPue", "display_name": "Giok Hun Pue", "profile_url": "https://ukm.academia.edu/GiokhunPue?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/945967/351754/16079111/s65_giok_hun.pue.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12098, "name": "Ethnic Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Identity?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64978, "name": "Language and Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Etymology?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 356952, "name": "Malay Archipelago", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Archipelago?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 459049, "name": "Mixed Marriages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mixed_Marriages?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 490308, "name": "Amalgamation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amalgamation?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 490309, "name": "Social Concept", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Concept?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 78994902, "title": "Understanding Vernacularity through Spatial Experience in the Peranakan House Kidang Mas, Chinatown, Lasem, Indonesia", "created_at": "2022-05-11T12:13:59.508-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78994902/Understanding_Vernacularity_through_Spatial_Experience_in_the_Peranakan_House_Kidang_Mas_Chinatown_Lasem_Indonesia?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_78994902", "summary": "Vernacularity is a quality or a state of being vernacular.

Nevertheless, in multi-ethnic society like Malaysia, language in the context of intraethnic communication remains understudied and little discussed in comparison to interethnic communication. Such scenario suggests that language-wise, each ethnic category in Malaysia appears to be homogenous with little or no similarities with the others. Against this background, this paper seeks to highlight and examine intraethnic communication with focus on Peranakan Chinese community in Kampung Cina, Terengganu. Despite Kampung Cina being the centre of Peranakan-related tourist attractions in the state of late, general consensus suggests that the Terengganu Peranakan Chinese community reside only in rural areas such as in Kampung Tirok and Kampung Banggol Kemang. Instead, Kampung Cina residents are believed to be composed of various groups of mainstream or non-Peranakan Chinese which equivalent of what Winzeler terms as the \u2018urban Chinese\u2019 in Kelantan context. By using qualitative data collected from a series of fieldwork conducted as part of a two-year research in Terengganu, this paper argues that Terengganu Peranakan Chinese community does not only exist in Kampung Cina, but also remains distinct from other Chinese sub-ethnic groups in the area to this day.

The repeated and time-consuming process of coloring results discomfort in the lower body of workers, because the traditional immersion tool is less consider from the view of ergonomic factors. However, along with the advancement of science and technology, the tool also transformed to support the convenience of its users. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of appropriate technology in a traditional tool, especially in the process of batik coloring. This research used ethnography with observation approach, documentation and deep interviews directly to the batik worker in coloring process at Batik Peranakan Oey Soe Tjoen's workshop for a period.

Although these events posed a significant threat to the fledgling Malayan state, few works have examined Penang\u2019s attempts to secede in great detail. My work focuses on analysing these political movements and placing them within the context of the process of decolonisation taking place in post-World War II Southeast Asia. Why did the secession movements take place? Who led them? What were their objectives? This paper will provide an in-depth examination of the secession movements, with an emphasis on the main actors and their motivations for supporting Penang\u2019s secession. In particular, I focus on a subset of the Overseas Chinese population in Penang known as the Peranakan or as they characterised themselves at the time, the Queen\u2019s Chinese. \n\nIn tackling these events, my work hopes to restore these important political movements to the narrative of Malaysia\u2019s post-war history and thus provide a deeper understanding of Malaysia\u2019s trajectory from British colony to independent state. On a broader level, the Penang Secession Movements serve as a case study for broader discussions about competing nationalisms in Southeast Asia. Particularly, how different stakeholders in nascent nation-states imagined the future of their countries, the process of nation-building and the related of question of who would belong to these nations and how particular groups believed to have loyalties elsewhere (i.e. diasporic groups like the Chinese) would be incorporated into the fabric of these new societies.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34765810, "first_name": "Bernard", "last_name": "Keo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "BernardKeo", "display_name": "Bernard Z Keo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/BernardKeo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34765810/10140856/21850235/s65_bernard.keo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10495, "name": "Nationalism And State Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_And_State_Building?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11358, "name": "Secession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secession?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 271586, "name": "Penang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Penang?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 60251922, "title": "Waterfront Heirlooms: Reflections of the Kampong China Peranakan (Book review)", "created_at": "2021-10-28T19:39:07.624-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/60251922/Waterfront_Heirlooms_Reflections_of_the_Kampong_China_Peranakan_Book_review_?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_60251922", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73779998, "asset_id": 60251922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 178460038, "first_name": "Hong Chuang", "last_name": "Loo", "domain_name": "utar", "page_name": "HongChuangLoo", "display_name": "Hong Chuang Loo", "profile_url": "https://utar.academia.edu/HongChuangLoo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28235, "name": "Multidisciplinary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multidisciplinary?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310595, "name": "Peranakan Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Culture?f_ri=307448"}, {"id": 982693, "name": "Terengganu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terengganu?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 39898901, "title": "Belonging in the Empire: Imperial Citizenship and the Peranakan of the Straits Settlements, 1900-1937", "created_at": "2019-07-22T14:46:51.038-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39898901/Belonging_in_the_Empire_Imperial_Citizenship_and_the_Peranakan_of_the_Straits_Settlements_1900_1937?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_39898901", "summary": "A hybridised overseas Chinese community combining elements of Chinese, Malay and British culture, the Peranakan Chinese of the Straits Settlements were experts in navigating the complex socio-cultural environment of colonial-era British Malaya.

Expanding on Gorman's (2006) study of imperial citizenship in the British Empire, I argue that ideas of belonging in the empire extended beyond ideological debates conducted by British colonial officials. Specifically, I argue that Anglophile Peranakan Chinese held a multi-faceted vision of imperial citizenship predicated on a sense of belonging to a cosmopolitan ideal of the British Empire. \n\nAs Banerjee (2010) explicates in the case of colonial India, analysis of imperial citizenship has been limited in comparison to studies on the development of Indian nationalism. There exists a similar lacuna in British Malaya as studies have focused on the growth of either ethnic Malay nationalism or civic Malayan nationalism at the expense of imperial citizenship. By examining the Peranakan and their ideas of belonging in the British Empire, this paper not only contributes to the growing literature on imperial citizenship but also serves to introduce a new approach to exploring the history of British Malaya.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34765810, "first_name": "Bernard", "last_name": "Keo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "BernardKeo", "display_name": "Bernard Z Keo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/BernardKeo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34765810/10140856/21850235/s65_bernard.keo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 466378, "name": "Singaporean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singaporean_History?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1397747, "name": "Straits Settlements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_Settlements?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 2903099, "title": "A Baba bibliography : a select annotated listing of sources on the Peranakan Chinese in Singapore and Malaysia", "created_at": "2013-03-04T09:26:58.013-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2903099/A_Baba_bibliography_a_select_annotated_listing_of_sources_on_the_Peranakan_Chinese_in_Singapore_and_Malaysia?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_2903099", "summary": "This bibliography highlights the rich holdings of resources on the Baba community and culture in the Singapore National Library.

Ben mengawali uraiannya dengan menuliskan, secara historis, posisi dari orang-orang Tionghoa dalam masyarakat di Indonesia melalui sebuah pembedaan dengan kondisi di Filipina. Pada dasarnya, diskriminasi dan kekerasan yang dialami oleh orang-orang Tionghoa di Indonesia dan Filipina berakar kepada perasaan terancam dan sekaligus ketergantungan Kumpeni (penjajah) terhadap mereka. Perasaan terancam muncul akibat jauhnya kampung halaman para Kumpeni dengan daerah jajahan mereka. Namun Kumpeni juga bergantung pada orang-orang Tionghoa dalam rangka meramaikan pusat-pusat perdagangan mereka di tanah jajahan. Kondisi tersebut kemudian membuat Kumpeni harus mengawasi betul aktifitas orang-orang Tionghoa demi kelancaran kepentingan Kumpeni di tanah jajahan. Perbedaan muncul terkait masalah peranakan Tionghoa di Indonesia. Menurut Ben, diskriminasi serta kekerasan yang dialami orang-orang Tionghoa dan peranakannya di Indonesia memiliki ciri khusus yang berbeda dengan di Filipina. Ciri khusus ini muncul akibat cara pandang Kumpeni Belanda terhadap orang-orang Tionghoa dan peranakannya itu. Didasari oleh \"alergi\" Kumpeni Belanda terhadap segala macam percampuran, peranakan orang Tionghoa, yang lahir melalui perkawinan campur antara laki-laki Belanda dengan perempuan Tionghoa, statusnya bergantung pada mau atau tidaknya sang Ayah Belanda mengakuinya sebagai keturunannya. Hal ini kemudian menjadi hukum di tanah jajahan. Selain hukum status peranakan, Kumpeni Belanda juga melakukan sistem ghettoisasi terhadapa orang-orang Tionghoa.

Rebuilding Space becomes an action by the homeowners as a form of preservation. This study aims can be simply stated. It is to understand which components could support the embodiment of \"new places\" within the main building of Peranakan house and to encourage the reader to think differently about the meanings of space. To answer the aims, the method began with a survey, interviews and observations by documenting tangible activities and spaces within the main building of the case study was a Peranakan house called Kidang Mas in Lasem, Central Java.

Where did their loyalties belong? To the British Empire, a declining relic of the past but of which they were subjects and to which they had owed much of their success? To the Malayan nation, a concept just beginning to take shape? Or to China, the homeland of their ancestors? As a community that occupied the space between the Chinese, Malay and British worlds, the Peranakan were caught between competing visions of the future in a period of dramatic change as nationalisms intensified and the process of decolonisation swept the world. This paper focuses on how the Peranakan reacted to this central question of loyalty and belonging as a community that existed within and between increasingly fracturing worlds. How did they respond to the challenge of being caught between the British Empire and competing forms of nationalism emerging in Malaya at the time (i.e. Malayan nationalism, Malay nationalism and Chinese nationalism)? What steps did they take to ensure the political, economic and cultural survival of their community?", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34765810, "first_name": "Bernard", "last_name": "Keo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "BernardKeo", "display_name": "Bernard Z Keo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/BernardKeo?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34765810/10140856/21850235/s65_bernard.keo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11358, "name": "Secession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secession?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28056507, "title": "A Peranakan family between Singapore and Shanghai: An exploration of its business-making, network and identity 1870s-1910s [in Journal of Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society vol.

Using portraits from this collection, Behind the Scenes investigates the artistic and technical processes involved in the production of portraits during an era predating colour photography.\nThe advent of the camera signaled a pivotal point in the landscape of portraiture and image making. The photographic image possessed both the ability to incite fantasy and the authenticity to stand as evidence, thus providing the Peranakans with a vehicle for expression and an agency to orchestrate their legacies.\nPortrait studios flourished contemporaneously with the availability of the newspaper and the rise of a literate society, heralding the emergence of novel practices of record keeping, observation and representation. The industry of commercial portraiture became one of the most lucrative trades of early 20th century Singapore. As many photographers were trained artists, many commercial studios could provide artistic services such as hand-coloured photographs and ivory miniatures.\nThe lives of portrait artists, their relationship with their patrons, and the biographies of lesser known portrait studios account for a largely unrecorded aspect of Singapore's history. This talk will shed new light on the industry and its patronage in colonial Singapore.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2611072, "first_name": "Daphne", "last_name": "Ang", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "Daphneang", "display_name": "Daphne  Ang", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/Daphneang?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2611072/825177/5119584/s65_daphne.ang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10796, "name": "Portraiture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portraiture?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20079, "name": "History of photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_photography?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27933, "name": "Photography & Portraiture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography_and_Portraiture?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448"}]}, {"id": 8222679, "title": "\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e4b\u0e32\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e01\u0e47\u0e15 \u0e2d\u0e31\u0e15\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c \u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e08\u0e33\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e22\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e15 Phuket Baba Identity Memory and Nostalgia", "created_at": "2014-09-06T18:13:20.959-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8222679/%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%9A_%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81_%E0%B8%95_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9_%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%88%E0%B9%8D%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%95_Phuket_Baba_Identity_Memory_and_Nostalgia?f_ri=307448", "dom_id": "work_8222679", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34648378, "asset_id": 8222679, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1733786, "first_name": "chontida", "last_name": "auikool", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "chontidaauikool", "display_name": "chontida auikool", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/chontidaauikool?f_ri=307448", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1733786/596656/2146376/s65_chontida.auikool.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=307448", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 74740094, "title": "Iconological Analysis of the Peranakan Intimate Lifestyle: A Case Study of Sylvia Lee Goh\u2019s Woman, Oh!
