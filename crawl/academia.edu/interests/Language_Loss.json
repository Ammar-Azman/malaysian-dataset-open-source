The issue is poignant and relatable to a lot of hybridized minds who try and fail continuously to cater to the spatial redesigning of themselves. But the portrayal is neither an issue in its objective veracity nor in its attempt to de-classify the ontological anguish of displacement. When any adaptation becomes the strategic tool to tell a story, an entirely new politics comes to the forefront: politics of interpretation. Such a case becomes quite problematic for the director's macroscopic vision as comparison between its source and performance develops into a questionable affair which often mars the subjectivity of two different platforms. The struggle goes on to the extent of having to produce a single winner amongst the two texts. Often, a body of adaptation falls into the category of some categorical simulacra with a reductionist effect upon the body of source. Mira Nair attempts to handle such discursive ideas within her direction pretty well and builds up a connecting textual tissue with Lahiri's text. The Namesake expresses a reassuring faith in family solidarity. Avoiding the clich\u00e9 of pitting disobedient immigrant children in pitched battles against tradition-bound parents from the old country, the film assumes that blood ties are the strongest bonds holding together the social order.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77466070, "asset_id": 66166026, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 113698800, "first_name": "Sanjana", "last_name": "Srivastava", "domain_name": "cal-univ", "page_name": "SanjanaSrivastava", "display_name": "Sanjana Srivastava", "profile_url": "https://cal-univ.academia.edu/SanjanaSrivastava?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/113698800/60388229/59115837/s65_sanjana.srivastava.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14464, "name": "Marginalized Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marginalized_Identities?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 162859, "name": "Jhumpa Lahiri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jhumpa_Lahiri?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261166, "name": "Loss of Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Loss_of_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1364830, "name": "Namesake Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Namesake_Hybridity?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1485767, "name": "The Namesake", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Namesake?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 36684739, "title": "The Pijao of Natagaima: Post-Linguicide Indigenous Identity and Language", "created_at": "2018-05-21T15:53:59.909-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36684739/The_Pijao_of_Natagaima_Post_Linguicide_Indigenous_Identity_and_Language?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_36684739", "summary": "Linguicide is a government act that illegalizes the use of a language. In Colombia, indigenous languages were illegalized in all but the most remote regions until 1991. While all indigenous languages were seriously affected, the Pijao language disappeared completely. In the generations that followed, the Pijao suffered an immediate change to their social identity as indigenous people and their recognition as an indigenous people. This study examines the nature of indigenous identity and language loss in the Pijao community in Natagaima. This investigation, through focus groups, examined the relationship between language loss and current Pijao indigenous identity in addition to current language use and the perceived causes of the linguicide. What was discovered is that indigenous identity is dependent on being othered in relation to colonist identity and that language is the most powerful tool of this othering. In removing language as a tool of othering and fore/backgrounding, the indigenous community suffers an immediate change in its social identity and a progressive weakening in the generations that follow the linguicide. Additionally, it created the largest list to date of Pijao and provides an analysis of current Natagaima Pijao speech. Finally, it examines the Pijao linguicide and examines the conclusion that the creation of the official Pijao reserves may have influenced in the disappearance of the Pijao language.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56622227, "asset_id": 36684739, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59033364, "first_name": "Joshua James", "last_name": "Zwisler", "domain_name": "ut-co", "page_name": "JoshuaJamesZwisler", "display_name": "Joshua James  Zwisler", "profile_url": "https://ut-co.academia.edu/JoshuaJamesZwisler?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/59033364/15700664/93385513/s65_joshua_james.zwisler.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 780, "name": "Ethnolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnolinguistics?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1861975, "name": "Colombian Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colombian_Languages?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 2847269, "name": "Pijao language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pijao_language?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 41138204, "title": "Language Shift in the Ryukyu Islands", "created_at": "2019-11-30T21:24:26.045-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41138204/Language_Shift_in_the_Ryukyu_Islands?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_41138204", "summary": "This chapter provides a broad overview of the way in which language shift has progressed in the Ryukyus over the last century.

I demonstrate how a language shift profile in the form of a timeline can be constructed retrospectively using qualitative synchronic data. These data comprise field recordings of natural conversation between Okinawans of different age cohorts in combination with parameters such as child-bearing age, life expectancy and the age at which people enter the workforce. As shown throughout the discussion, the results can then be triangulated with other researchers\u2019 accounts of the historical context of each phase of shift. The timeline drawn in this chapter illustrates how new subgroups of people with different linguistic behaviours have emerged in the Naha/Shuri community as language shift has progressed. It therefore enables us not only to see how language use has changed over the years, but also to make predictions as to the future course of shift, i.e. when the Okinawan language (Uchinaaguchi) is likely to reach various stages of decay, and finally, extinction. This method of visually representing language shift will be useful not only for scholars interested in the Ryukyuan situation but also for those involved in the study of other endangered languages. \r\n\r\nAPA citation: Anderson, Mark (2014).

Recently, however, a growing number of accounts hold that age effects in ultimate attainment are due to L1 entrenchment (e.g. Flege 1999; MacWhinney 2005; Ventureyra, Pallier & Yoo 2004). In this view, an increase in L1 proficiency leads to the progressive entrenchment of L1 representations, with the consequence that L2 acquisition becomes more difficult. Inherent in this interpretation is the assumption that the \u201cless L1\u201d, the less it will interfere with the L2.

It then focuses on results from the last wave of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), which followed a large sample of 1.5- and second-generation youth (immigrant children who arrived in the U.S. before adolescence, and U.S.-born children of immigrants) for more than a decade from mid-adolescence to their mid-twenties. The baseline sample of more than 5,000 was representative of 77 nationalities, including all of the principal immigrant groups in the U.S. today.

The ethnographic material presented is based on the author\u2019s ten years living and working among bilingual urban Malays, and a year making regular visits to rural communities in Narathiwat. One of the few things that informed analysts of South Thailand agree on is that a range of factors contributed to the resumption of violence in 2004. In addition to the role of political legitimacy, there is consensus that progress towards peace is complicated by the involvement of uncivil constituencies from two highly ethnicised religious communities. Despite the importance of ethnoreligious issues this paper argues that ethnolinguistic dynamics\u23afspecifically language loyalty, loss, and angst\u23afhave much to contribute to the return of peaceful co-existence and reconciliation. Although religious freedom in Thailand is promised and present, few minority languages in Thailand are strong now than they were before policies promulgated in the 1930s. I introduce the range of positions on the role of language and multi-lingualism in the construction of difference and the achievement of peaceful co-existence. I describe the range mono-lingual and bilingual communities in South Thailand. I also recount the variety of ways that Southern Malays have responded to the decline of Malay and the importance of Thai for those wishing to engage in Thai modernity. There is a need to as informed by ethno-linguistic angst as ethno-religious rebellion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32924081, "asset_id": 5960398, "asset_type": "Work",

of the saddest consequences of the demise of traditional Khoikhoi societies during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is the loss of their languages. Contemporary reports by visitors abound with references to how difficult the Khoi language was to learn, while at the same time commending the Khoikhoi for their ability to learn European languages. By about 1700, only half a century after Dutch colonisation, most Khoikhoi living in the colonised areas of the Western Cape could speak some form of Dutch in addition to their own language. However, the rapid spread of European settlers deeper into the interior, on the one hand, and the acculturation of the Khoikhoi and their inclusion in the colonial polity and economy, on the other hand, meant that by the end of the eighteenth century Khoi was spoken only on the fringes of the Cape colony. Cape Khoi was increasingly replaced by (a form of) Dutch as the first language of the native inhabitants of the Cape. Thus, on his tour of Southern Africa in 1803-1806, Heinrich Lichtenstein could observe that \u2018on the borders alone are some Hottentots to be found who speak their own lariguage; but among them several foreign words are introduced, spoken with the Hottentot accent and snort\u2019.

Notwithstanding the prevalent use of Ikinyarwanda, mass mastery in Ikinyarwanda is currently an issue. The increasing loss of Ikinyarwanda presents a plodding threat to the culture and identity of Rwandans in years to come. The English has been generally accepted in the international linguistic market and apparently seeks to increasingly become the default language of international community of states where approximately a half of the current 5,000 to 6,000 languages are likely to be extinct in the next one century. \n\nIt has been argued that the endangerment of most native languages is due to dissimilar pressures acting on the international community, such as economic, military, social and cultural demands. The acquisition of French or English does not constitute a linguistic problem per se, simply because we need them in the global market; the problem lies in the place practically given to Ikinyarwanda. While almost 85% of respondents supported the idea of preserving Ikinyarwanda from homes, 15% of the respondents avowed to be proud to see their children speaking French or English than their native language when they are still very young. The latter group does not help their children learn or speak Ikinyarwanda throughout while they are at home. Some experts averred that a language is born, grows up and die. If Ikinyarwanda is not well preserved and well used, small endangerments are likely to lead to its death in years to come. \n\nFrom this contextual background, the study attempts to contribute to the growth in linguistic awareness about the problem and discusses the revitalisation of Ikinyarwanda. It is argued that maintaining the native language always remains critical to one\u2019s identity as it contributes to a positive self-concept. Thus the study proposes, among others, the language standardization which requires a good linguistic management or even linguistic adjustment so that we get a sustainable preservation of Ikinyarwanda.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65314102, "asset_id": 43911699, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1245512, "first_name": "Protog\u00e8ne", "last_name": "Dusabe", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "Protog\u00e8neDusabe", "display_name": "Protog\u00e8ne Dusabe", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/Protog%C3%A8neDusabe?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1245512/454411/16987796/s65_protog_ne.dusabe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1712, "name": "Globalisation and cultural change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_cultural_change?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15305, "name": "Globalisation and \"global cultural flows\"", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_global_cultural_flows_?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19817, "name": "Language Endangerment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Endangerment?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24949, "name": "Language Attrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Attrition?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 13128731, "title": "English Plus: Exploring the Socioeconomic Benefits of Bilingualism in Southern California", "created_at": "2015-06-20T15:33:17.448-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13128731/English_Plus_Exploring_the_Socioeconomic_Benefits_of_Bilingualism_in_Southern_California?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_13128731", "summary": "This paper presents the results of a study carried out in Southern California with a multiethnic and multigenerational sample of young adults in their 20s and 30s.

Both surveys utilized the same measures for key variables, and were carried out at about the same time in the six contiguous counties of Southern California with respondents were of similar ages, ethnicities, and generations. The analysis focuses on the independent effects of fluent bilingualism (measuring multiple dimensions of linguistic ability) on three socioeconomic outcomes: dropping out of high school, occupational status, and earnings. Southern California, as the nation\u2019s largest regional site of immigrant incorporation over the past three decades \u2013 and home to the largest nationalities and most diverse types of immigrants (including professionals, refugees and undocumented laborers) to have settled in the U.S. over this period, as well as to their rapidly growing second generations \u2013 is a strategic site for such research. Of the region\u2019s 21 million residents, half speak a language other than English at home, while half speak English only. Remarkably, controlling for major predictors, multivariate analyses show significant effects of bilingualism on all three socioeconomic outcomes: decreasing the odds of dropping out of high school, and increasing occupational status and earnings.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37955752, "asset_id": 13128731, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4475610, "first_name": "Rub\u00e9n G.", "last_name": "Rumbaut", "domain_name": "uci", "page_name": "RubenGRumbaut", "display_name": "Rub\u00e9n G.

My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

The chapter initially discusses the nature of neoliberalism and its crash in 2008, before examining how this affected both overt and covert Irish-language policy. The findings of ethnographic research conducted in some of the strongest remaining Gaeltacht communities between 2014 and 2016 are then discussed to add empirical weight to the policy analysis presented in the first half of the chapter. The effects of large-scale unemployment, intensive out-migration, the intersection of economic disruption and gendered aspects of language maintenance, as well as the increased use of English-language technologies as \u201csurrogate child minders\u201d by Irish-speaking parents are all detailed. Language revitalization policies, it will be argued, are fundamentally contraindicated to neoliberal policy prescriptions, and as such the Irish language received proportionally much greater cutbacks than other sectors in the post-2008 period, which was used as an opportunity to implement a large scale \u201croll-back\u201d of state support for this sector.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86344785, "asset_id": 79728310, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10046839, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "\u00d3 Ceallaigh", "domain_name": "aber", "page_name": "Ben\u00d3Ceallaigh", "display_name": "Ben \u00d3 Ceallaigh", "profile_url": "https://aber.academia.edu/Ben%C3%93Ceallaigh?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10046839/3102730/3651731/s65_ben._ceallaigh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 205, "name": "Rural Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Sociology?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1188, "name": "Language revitalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_revitalization?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1392, "name": "Celtic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celtic_Studies?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 2523, "name": "Sociology of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Language?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 10586, "name": "Gaelic Ireland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gaelic_Ireland?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 29058, "name": "Financial Crisis of 2008/2009", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Financial_Crisis_of_2008_2009?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 29842, "name": "Ireland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ireland?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 100783, "name": "Language Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Management?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 168103, "name": "Gaeilge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gaeilge?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 622666, "name": "Politics of Austerity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Austerity?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 74482761, "title": "Economic Disruption and Language Shift \u2013 Some Ethnographic Data from Ireland After the 2008 Crash", "created_at": "2022-03-24T11:32:52.441-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74482761/Economic_Disruption_and_Language_Shift_Some_Ethnographic_Data_from_Ireland_After_the_2008_Crash?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_74482761", "summary": "This paper discusses some of the ways in which the \"Great Recession\" which followed the 2008 economic crash affected the vitality of Irish-speaking (\"Gaeltacht\") areas.

Various microlevel consequences of these macro-level economic and policy developments are then discussed by reference to ethnographic data gathered in the Gaeltacht. Issues such as deindustrialisation, unemployment and the problematic nature of tourism in minoritised language communities are discussed, as is language use amongst young people and the way in which technology can contribute to language shift.

And What are the effects of mostly speaking English on the children and their home language: Arabic? A total of ten participating parents took part in this research study where semi structured interviews were utilised to gather the primary data. Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main emerging themes and six subthemes. The findings from the data analysis revealed that Saudi parents speak English with their children so as to allow them the opportunity to be bilingual and linguistically (English-L2) proficient as well as the fact that those parents were pleased to see their children speak English with a British accent. Also, the analysis revealed that that children of Saudi parents speaking English only has led to the weakening and loss of their Arabic L1 language. The study concludes that parents should provide a linguistic balance for their bilingual children in order to preserve the native language. Additionally, the study recommends that further parallel research studies with bilingual children of various L1(s), are conducted.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58809826, "asset_id": 38724709, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24124734, "first_name": "Arab World English Journal", "last_name": "(AWEJ)", "domain_name": "asels", "page_name": "ArabWorldEnglishJournalAWEJ", "display_name": "Arab World English Journal  (AWEJ)", "profile_url": "https://asels.academia.edu/ArabWorldEnglishJournalAWEJ?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24124734/7201396/8209446/s65_arab_world_english_journal.awej.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 302356, "name": "Critical Period Hypothesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Period_Hypothesis?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 13611154, "title": "Minority language loss: socio-cultural and linguistic causes", "created_at": "2015-07-04T02:51:22.425-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13611154/Minority_language_loss_socio_cultural_and_linguistic_causes?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_13611154", "summary": "ABSTRACT\r\nThe current study is a review article surveying on the reasons behind minority languages and language losses.

According to this proposal (Pallier, Dehaene, Poline, LeBihan, Argenti, Depoux and Mehler, 2003; Ventureyra, Pallier and Yoo, 2004), such children experience a total loss of their L1, while, as adults, they exhibit a nativelike ultimate attainment of their L2. These authors suggest that what they see as a total loss of L1 allows a resetting of the neural network that normally subserves L1 retention and hence permits a complete acquisition of the L2. Data from two of our own research projects, one on L1 remnants in Korean adoptees in Sweden (see Park, forthcoming), and the other on age of acquisition and ultimate L2 attainment of Swedish (see Abrahamsson and Hyltenstam, in press), which included data from Latin American adoptees in Sweden among other participants, suggest (i) that L1 remnants are indeed maintained, (ii) that L2 attainment is NOT enhanced by severe L1 attrition, and (iii) that there is an age dimension to both the degree of L1 attrition and the level of L2 ultimate attainment in international adoptees. We therefore contend that a maturational interpretation of language replacement data is preferable.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51889683, "asset_id": 31550088, "asset_type": "Work",

The material presented is ethnographic, based on the author\u2019s ten years living and working among bilingual urban Malays, and a year making regular visits to rural communities in Narathiwat. One of the few things that informed analysts of South Thailand agree on is that a range of factors contributed to the resumption of violence in 2004. In addition to the role of political legitimacy, there is consensus that progress towards peace is complicated by the involvement of uncivil constituencies from two highly ethnicised religious communities. Despite the importance of ethnoreligious issues this paper argues that ethnolinguistic dynamics\uf0bespecifically language loyalty, loss, and angst\uf0behave much to contribute to the return of peaceful co-existence and reconciliation. Although religious freedom in Thailand is promised and present, few minority languages in Thailand are strong now than they were before policies promulgated in the 1930s. I introduce the range of positions on the role of language and multi-lingualism in the construction of difference and the achievement of peaceful co-existence. I describe the range mono-lingual and bilingual communities in South Thailand. I also recount the variety of ways that Southern Malays have responded to the decline of Malay and the importance of Thai for those wishing to engage in Thai modernity. There is a need to as informed by ethno-linguistic angst as ethno-religious rebellion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87631332, "asset_id": 5999051, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Joll", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "ChristopherJoll", "display_name": "Christopher M Joll", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/ChristopherJoll?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/667449/851788/1060921/s65_cm.joll.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15473, "name": "Muslims in Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23643, "name": "Language and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Religion?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 259953, "name": "Ethnoreligiopus Conflicts, Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnoreligiopus_Conflicts_Multiculturalism?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 625059, "name": "Language Loyalty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loyalty?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1280499, "name": "Language Grief", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Grief?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 33431980, "title": "REVIVAL OF ENDANGERED LANGUAGES: A CASE STUDY OF HADOTI", "created_at": "2017-06-13T00:15:02.952-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33431980/REVIVAL_OF_ENDANGERED_LANGUAGES_A_CASE_STUDY_OF_HADOTI?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_33431980", "summary": "The present work discusses about factors responsible for language endangerment with a specific focus on Hadoti, an indigenous regional varieties (RV) of Rajasthan, spoken by communities present mainly near the Kota region and neighboring state of Madhya Pradesh.

In 1910, 10 million people reported a mother tongue other than English, notably German, Italian, Yiddish, and Polish. The subsequent end of mass immigration from Europe led to a waning of language diversity and the most linguistically homogenous era in American history. But the revival of immigration after 1970 propelled the United States back toward its historical norm. By 2010, 60 million people (a fifth of the population) spoke a non-English language, especially Spanish.

This paper explores alternative diagnoses to social problems in Muslim Southeast Asia where the words \u201cIslam\u201d, \u201cIslamic\u201d, and \u201cIslamist\u201d appear in both diagnoses of causes and prescriptions for cures.

Furthermore, in today\u2019s hyper-connected ummah, a broad \u2013 and widening \u2013 range of Muslims and \u201cIslams\u201d exist in Southeast Asia. My specific interest is in the analysis of social problems in Thailand\u2019s Malay-dominated far-southern provinces, and this paper reiterates arguments that (tantalising) mono-causal myths must be discredited and replaced by approaches attentive to multicausality. As most things happen for more than one reason, religious\nailments are one of a number of factors that have contributed to social\nproblems. In South Thailand, others include political instability, Malay\nlanguage loss, and widespread social disintegration. Doctrinal medicine and religious institutions may, therefore, represent only one part of the\nalternative medicine to cure the social ills plaguing Muslim Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments":

Tunisia. Nevertheless, it is neither the official nor the majority language of the country. In being so, it acquires the status of an indigenous heritage language. It is still spoken today in scattered areas, amongst which is the village of Zrawa in the southeast of Tunisia. This paper reports the results of my previous sociolinguistic study of the Berbers of Zrawa (Bouhdima, 2017). The context of the study represents a setting where the Berber language is used in all informal settings. The study aimed at investigating the factors underpinning the Berber language maintenance among the Berbers of Zrawa. To get a complete understanding of the phenomenon, a mixed methods approach was adopted. This involved collecting data by means of one quantitative technique, namely a questionnaire, and two qualitative instruments, precisely semistructured interview and participant observation. Results from the study indicate that the factors contributing to Berber language maintenance in Zrawa are: (a) the geographic concentration of the Berber community, (b) the essential role of the Berber families, (c) the Berbers' positive attitudes towards the Berber language, and (d) the perceived close link between Berber language and identity. Results imply that Berber language is unlikely to disappear from Zrawa.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68780170, "asset_id": 50907778, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63583210, "first_name": "Mohamed Elhedi", "last_name": "Bouhdima", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "bouhdimamohamedelhedi", "display_name": "Mohamed Elhedi Bouhdima", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/bouhdimamohamedelhedi?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63583210/62375160/98120251/s65_mohamed_elhedi.bouhdima.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5572, "name": "Language Documentation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Documentation?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19817, "name": "Language Endangerment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Endangerment?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24949, "name": "Language Attrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Attrition?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38926, "name": "Language Maintenance and Shift", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Maintenance_and_Shift?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 112962, "name": "Language Death", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Death?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 138932, "name": "Sociolinguistics, Sociology of Languages, Language Policy and Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics_Sociology_of_Languages_Language_Policy_and_Planning?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 25924378, "title": "\" A Man Without a Country \" : Experiences of Francophone Migration during the Quiet Revolution", "created_at": "2016-06-06T09:12:56.044-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25924378/_A_Man_Without_a_Country_Experiences_of_Francophone_Migration_during_the_Quiet_Revolution?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_25924378", "summary": "There are numerous studies on shifting Francophone-Anglophone relations during the Quiet Revolution, and migration studies tend to focus on Anglophones who sought opportunity outside Qu\u00e9bec (Pettinicchio 2012). However, less attention has been paid to the experiences of Francophones who migrated to English Canada during this period. Undeniably, these people had their own unique political, economic and social motivations for leaving Qu\u00e9bec at this time. Their adopted communities brought experiences of cultural assimilation and language loss, which have been previously explored in relation to First Peoples in Canada and the indigenous groups of other countries (e.g. Hallett et al. 2007; Wanhalla 2007). Using the oral history of a Francophone whose family migrated from Qu\u00e9bec to British Columbia during the 1960s, I reveal the roles of motivation, alienation, assimilation and language in his migration experience. I argue that (1) the motivations of these Francophone migrants were complex, involving not only politicoeconomic reasons but also social and personal ones, (2) their subsequent experiences of alienation and assimilation were intimately connected to language and were sometimes self-enforced to prevent low-level persecution, (3) this partial assimilation resulted in a lack of belonging in both their original and adopted communities. My informant\u2019s narrative cannot speak for all interprovincial Francophone migrants, but it does provide insight into the intimate nuances and complexities of the situation that are often overlooked in generalized statistical approaches.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46283213, "asset_id": 25924378, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49718471, "first_name": "Jessie", "last_name": "Tougas", "domain_name": "ubc", "page_name": "JessieTougas", "display_name": "Jessie K Tougas", "profile_url": "https://ubc.academia.edu/JessieTougas?f_ri=654841", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4093, "name": "Qu\u00e9bec History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qu%C3%A9bec_History?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8000, "name": "French language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_language?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8920, "name": "History of Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Canada?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 11713, "name": "Francophone Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Francophone_Canada?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 23588, "name": "Qu\u00e9bec Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qu%C3%A9bec_Studies?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 28808, "name": "Quebec", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quebec?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 30327, "name": "Internal migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_migration?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 41079, "name": "Alienation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alienation?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 49664, "name": "Oral History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_History_and_Memory?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 54114, "name": "Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canada?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 90177, "name": "Language Maintenance & Loss in diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Maintenance_and_Loss_in_diaspora?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 94954, "name": "Canadian and Quebec Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_and_Quebec_Politics?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 121687, "name": "Cultural Assimilation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Assimilation?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 179481, "name": "Assimilation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assimilation?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 282026, "name": "French and Francophone Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_and_Francophone_Studies?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 364305, "name": "R\u00e9volution tranquille / Quiet Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Revolution_tranquille_Quiet_Revolution?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 582324, "name": "Anglophone and francophone relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglophone_and_francophone_relations?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 965253, "name": "Quiet Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quiet_Revolution?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1003949, "name": "Mobility (Internal and International Migration)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Internal_and_International_Migration_?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 44677002, "title": "Portugu\u00eas Brasileiro Falado pelo Povo Karipuna: uma forma de uso que sofre preconceito lingu\u00edstico Brazilian Portuguese Spoken by the Indigenous Karipuna Society: a form of use with linguistic prejudice Maxwara dos Santos Cardoso NEI/SEED 1", "created_at": "2020-12-10T10:32:51.099-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44677002/Portugu%C3%AAs_Brasileiro_Falado_pelo_Povo_Karipuna_uma_forma_de_uso_que_sofre_preconceito_lingu%C3%ADstico_Brazilian_Portuguese_Spoken_by_the_Indigenous_Karipuna_Society_a_form_of_use_with_linguistic_prejudice_Maxwara_dos_Santos_Cardoso_NEI_SEED_1?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_44677002", "summary": "O presente artigo pretende promover reflex\u00e3o acerca de caracter\u00edsticas do Portugu\u00eas Brasileiro em uso pela popula\u00e7\u00e3o ind\u00edgena Karipuna que vive em terras ind\u00edgenas \u00e0s proximidades do munic\u00edpio de Oiapoque-AP, Brasil.

However, few studies have focused on the wider Afrikaans-speaking expatriate population. This paper explores perceptions around language maintenance and loss of Afrikaans-speaking immigrants from 54 different countries.\r\n\r\nLanguage choices of individuals and families in immigrant contexts are determined by socio-political and economic factors (Curdt-Christiansen, 2009:351). It is also clear from the literature that parental ideology determines the nature of family language planning (Curdt-Christiansen, 2009:351; King, Fogle & Logan-Terry, 2008:909). Therefore, this research also focused on language choices by immigrants with children.\r\n\r\nThe main aim of this paper is to report on attitudes towards Afrikaans culture and language, languages used within family units as well as motivation for language choice. The research was conducted through the use of an online questionnaire completed by Afrikaans-speaking immigrants (n=1 362). The second part of the research consisted of qualitative analysis of responses by respondents in a Facebook group for Afrikaans expatriates. \r\n\r\nFrom the research it is evident that for these respondents the major language within the family unit is Afrikaans, especially in terms of communication between partners. Most respondents agree that mother tongue education is important, however less than half of the respondents indicated that they spoke Afrikaans with their children. Traces of language shift are evident and it seems that the age of children and nature of bilingualism at the time of immigration are important factors. In conclusion it seems that immigrant family language planning is a complex issue and that language use and choices are not consistent across the respondents of this study.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 319563, "first_name": "Jako", "last_name": "Olivier", "domain_name": "col", "page_name": "JakoOlivier", "display_name": "Jako Olivier", "profile_url": "https://col.academia.edu/JakoOlivier?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/319563/78817/14416994/s65_jako.olivier.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26072, "name": "Immigrant families & policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_families_and_policy?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38926, "name": "Language Maintenance and Shift", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Maintenance_and_Shift?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53925, "name": "Language revitalisation and shift", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_revitalisation_and_shift?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 216061, "name": "Immigrant Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_Languages?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 319606, "name": "Family Language Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Planning?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 640130, "name": "Reversing Language Shift", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reversing_Language_Shift?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 887573, "name": "Afrikaans Expatriates", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrikaans_Expatriates?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 887574, "name": "Afrikaans Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrikaans_Language?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1031371, "name": "Language Privileges", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Privileges?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 81790328, "title": "Mixed Mother Tongues: Memoirs of Interlingual Childhoods", "created_at": "2022-06-18T18:32:36.186-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81790328/Mixed_Mother_Tongues_Memoirs_of_Interlingual_Childhoods?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_81790328", "summary": "Childhood involves entering \u201ca stage which we did not design\u201d and playing \u201csubordinate parts in the dramas of others\u201d (in the words of philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre).

Examining the Family Language Policies (FLP) of seven non-English background immigrant families living in Australia, this paper explores how the adoption of FLP by parents is influenced by a number of factors including language ideologies both inside and outside family domains, parents\u2019 first and second language status, and the nature of domicile. This paper also critically considers FLP in relation to the complexities of heritage language maintenance in Australia - a country that despite being culturally diverse, still offers scarce additive bilingual environments, especially for children and students.\nUsing a case study this study looks at why and how parents implement Family Language Policies and the complexity of their connection to domicile and identity. The research involved mothers from Russia, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Indonesia who were living in Melbourne at the time of the study. The data were collected through three rounds of in-depth semi-structured individual interviews with each parent over a period of three months, exploring the rationales, strategies, and behaviours of FLP implementation. In analysing data, cross-case comparisons were made to identify possible correspondence between contextual variables and FLP choice. \nIt was found that families living outside their home countries would often impose upon their children to speak their heritage language in fear of language loss, although the level of implementation of heritage language use in the family context significantly varied. While some families used the heritage language exclusively, others let English freely intervene the use of heritage language at home. \nThis study establishes the nature of correlation between their domicile status - whether families were living temporarily or permanently - and the adoption of a particular language ideology. The notion of different FLP choice between families with temporary residence and permanent residence status develops because of the analysis on the future prospects of the heritage language maintenance that the families are confronted with.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58200223, "asset_id": 38165759, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3251277, "first_name": "Raqib", "last_name": "Chowdhury", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "raqib", "display_name": "Raqib Chowdhury", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/raqib?f_ri=654841", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3251277/1080792/21431694/s65_raqib.chowdhury.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2313, "name": "Multi- & Bilingualism & Biliteracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multi-_and_Bilingualism_and_Biliteracy?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15439, "name": "Teaching English As A Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_As_A_Foreign_Language?f_ri=654841", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20004, "name": "Immigrant children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_children?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 38926, "name": "Language Maintenance and Shift", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Maintenance_and_Shift?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 101410, "name": "Codeswitching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Codeswitching?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 319606, "name": "Family Language Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Planning?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1008368, "name": "Family Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Policy?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 1382397, "name": "Family Language Policies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Policies?f_ri=654841"}, {"id": 2501914, "name": "Family Language Planning (FLP)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Planning_FLP_?f_ri=654841"}]}, {"id": 35305282, "title": "International Conference on Policy toward Indigenous Peoples (Sapporo, 4.12.2017.)ppt", "created_at": "2017-11-30T17:49:26.106-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35305282/International_Conference_on_Policy_toward_Indigenous_Peoples_Sapporo_4_12_2017_ppt?f_ri=654841", "dom_id": "work_35305282", "summary": "Educated not to be able to speak your own language?\nUniversity of Lapland, Faculty of Education\nMadoka Hammine\n\nIn 2009, UN9ESCO recognized six Ryukyuan languages as endangered languages in Japan, including the Yaeyaman language. There are some initiatives or local efforts aimed at revitalizing or maintaining Yaeyaman as a living language. In this presentation, I first give you an overview of local language revitalization efforts in Miyara Yaeyaman, a variety of Yaeyaman spoken in Miyara Village on Ishigaki Island. Second, I introduce my own experience of learning and teaching Meeramuni (Miyaran Yaeyaman) at Miyara Elementary School. Being born in Miyara village, I grew up mostly speaking only in Japanese. Although our local language or Meeramuni is still used in ceremonial contexts and in family gatherings in the village, it was not taught in schools when I was a child. Furthermore, I want to focus on the experience of becoming aware of language loss within my family and language endangerement from an insider\u2019s perspective. Finally, based on my fieldwork in Miyara, I analyze the language attitudes of elders toward the local language, which might be one of the reasons why Yaeyaman is critically endangered. Ideology of one-language-one-nation seems to be an obstacle in language revitalization in Yaeyama. By considering the definition of mother tongue in linguistic minority contexts, young generations in Yaeyama Island have lost their mother tongue. The mono-lingualism of the Japanese education system has produced people with education but no ability to speak their own language. I conclude my presentation by raising the following question to the audience: why is it not acceptable to be educated but at the same time be able to speak our own language?  \n",

vernaculars of Shemir\u0101n shared with those of the J\u0101jrud valley to their\nnortheast certain idiosyncratic features at the lexical level. In morphological\ncategories, however, Shemir\u0101ni was close to standard Persian, though it with a rich\nCaspian impression. The noun phrase is marked by the weakness of the e\u017c\u0101fa\nconstruction and by the use of -r\u0101 for indirect objects. The verbal paradigm is\ndistinguished by its Caspian preverbs and past tense forms, and by non-Perside\n\u201cbe\u201d and \u201cbecome.\u201d These features make the designation \u201cF\u0101si-M\u0101zandar\u0101ni\u201d\nquite relevant for the Shemiran dialects.\n\nIn spite of the striking similarity among the vernaculars of Shemir\u0101n, we may\nlogically expect some geographical variation. S\u0101me\u201bi quotes his informant that the\ndialects were mutually intelligible but sufficiently distinct to reveal the home\nvillage of a speaker. Nevertheless, the data on each locality is too scanty to allow\none to draw isoglosses among them; each feature is found only in a few localities.\nThe older data on Tajrishi suggests that the dialects of Shemir\u0101n have been\nsubjected to intensive influence of Persian within a century. Borrowings from\nPersian could result in semantic shift. When Jam\u0101l\u0101b\u0101di borrowed the stem r(av)- \u201cgo\u201d from Persian, it caused the stem \u0161- to undergo a shift of meaning from \u201cgo\u201d to\n\u201cbecome\u201d, and this resulted in a mixture of stems for \u201cgo\u201d.\n\npublished in  Enat'mec'nierebis sakit'xebi/Issues of Linguistics 2011 (Jemshid Giunashvili Festschrift), Tbilisi: Tbilisi State University, 2012, pp. 79-90.

One such area that underwent a huge change was the education system in its entirety and hence the medium of instruction changed from Arabic to English. In the case where students study at a British or American school, Arabic is at times not taught at all. This means that Arab students go through their schooling (until 17 or 18 years of age) without formal knowledge of Arabic (Modern Standard, of course the spoken Arabic is always existent), which is often alarming and disconcerting for both citizens and their rulers. And even in schools where Arabic is the medium of instruction, inspectors and observers are often dissatisfied with the level and quality of Arabic teaching; prompting for parents and educators to call for an improvement in the Arabic curriculum.   Through interviewing Gulf students and teachers in London, and through analyzing many forums and webpages, this presentation aims to show that many young people struggle to maintain Arabic as their mother tongue and their feelings towards their respective language curriculums. Young Gulf students struggle to write and speak Arabic well, and often prefer to use English, not because they dislike Arabic but because they feel they cannot write or speak it, as well as they should (see Al-Issa & Dahan et. Al 2011). There have been (successful) attempts by young Gulf speakers to tackle the domination of English in their everyday lives, through the arabization of social networks for example, Twitter, and other platforms such as YouTube, TED, Wikipedia, and The Khan Academy.  On governmental levels, there have been initiatives such as declaring Arabic the national language (UAE, 2008) or the introduction of Arabic as a medium of instruction in higher education (Qatar university), the latter has been welcomed by many as a positive step towards re-instating Arabic as a national language. It is also a way of re-instating Arabic as a language capable of conveying knowledge, research, and coining new concepts. This presentation highlights the sociolinguistic nature of Arabic and English and the struggles that native Arabic Gulf speakers face in connecting to their language and hence their culture and identity in a modern world.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nAl-Issa, A and Laila Dahan et al (2011) \u201cGlobal English and Arabic- Issues of language, culture and identity\u201d.
