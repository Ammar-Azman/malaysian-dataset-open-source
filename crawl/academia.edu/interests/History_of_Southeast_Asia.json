All six booklets, published as Native Affairs Bulletins No. 1\u20136, covered the customs of these people. The bulletins were written and compiled by G. C. Woolley, who for many years was the Government Commissioner of Lands. The publication of these bulletins marked the only successful attempt by the Chartered Company to codify the customs of the indigenous people in Sabah. Until that time, the native customs, which varied from one place to another, had been the preserve of the native chiefs and had existed only in oral form. Though there were earlier efforts towards this end, none of those attempts were successful. This paper will investigate the role of Woolley in putting the customs into writing, and hence codifying them. It will also discuss how Woolley was supported by some native chiefs, including Pangeran Osman bin OKK2 Pangeran Omar, who were instrumental in providing impetus and support to Woolley in his endeavours. The paper will also examine how these codified customs have fared since the publication of the bulletins. Underlying this question is whether native chiefs, while exercising their customary authorities, prefer to be guided by \u2018local influence and more or less irrelevant considerations\u2019 or by strict procedures, as in the case of the Western legal system.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35301454, "asset_id": 8988302, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18780856, "first_name": "Humanities & Social Science", "last_name": "UM", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "HumanitiesUM", "display_name": "Humanities & Social Science  UM", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/HumanitiesUM?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18780856/5217441/5974643/s65_humanities.um.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 225603, "name": "Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabah?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 837437, "name": "History and Culture of Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Culture_of_Sabah?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1156288, "name": "Karya Sastera Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Karya_Sastera_Sabah?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1156289, "name": "Hadiah Sastera Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hadiah_Sastera_Sabah?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1639204, "name": "NATIVE CUSTOMS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/NATIVE_CUSTOMS?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1639205, "name": "History of Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Sabah?f_ri=532930"}]}, {"id": 10209541, "title": "Politicheskaya istoria i politicheskaya organizatsiya obstchestv Yugo-Vostochnogo Indokitaya i Malayskogo arhipelaga v I tysyacheletii", "created_at": "2015-01-17T12:46:47.100-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10209541/Politicheskaya_istoria_i_politicheskaya_organizatsiya_obstchestv_Yugo_Vostochnogo_Indokitaya_i_Malayskogo_arhipelaga_v_I_tysyacheletii?f_ri=532930", "dom_id": "work_10209541", "summary": "Zakharov, Anton O.

The historiography of the 1950s tended to political history and the dominant view of the external influences of India, China, Islam, and the West on Southeast Asian history. In the 1960s the thematic focus shifted to economic and social aspects along with the emergence of the trend of social sciences approaches in historical studies which was influenced by the Annales School. In the 1980s, with the onset of the linguistic and cultural turns in the social sciences, historians in the region turned to diachronic studies of the formation of identity, mentality, representation and discourse of local knowledge. The shift in perspective also occurred with the emergence of the (Southeast) Asian-centric perspective which saw changes in Southeast Asian society as a result of the dynamic interaction between the region's internal and external forces. Since the end of the 1990s, there has been a tendency for the 'interstices', that is linking the history of the Southeast Asian region with its global historical context, and on the connectivity of historical disciplines with other social-humanities disciplines to build bridges of trans-disciplinary studies. Abstrak: Artikel ini mengkaji perubahan tema dan perspektif dalam penulisan sejarah Asia Tenggara pada periode 1955 sampai 2010. Historiografi dasawarsa 1950-an cenderung pada sejarah politik dan dominannya pandangan ihwal pengaruh eksternal India, Cina, Islam, dan Barat atas sejarah Asia Tenggara. Pada dasawarsa 1960-an fokus tematis bergeser ke aspek ekonomi dan sosial seiring dengan munculnya tren pendekatan ilmu-ilmu sosial yang dipengaruhi oleh Mazhab Annales. Pada dasawarsa 1980-an, dengan menguatnya kajian linguistik dan budaya, sejarawan di kawasan ini beralih ke studi diakronis tentang pembentukan identitas, mentalitas, representasi, dan wacana pengetahuan lokal. Pergeseran perspektif juga terjadi dengan menguatnya perspektif Asia (Tenggara)-sentris yang melihat perubahan-perubahan di dalam masyarakat Asia Tenggara sebagai hasil interaksi dinamis antara kekuatan internal dan eksternal kawasan itu. Sejak akhir dasawarsa 1990-an, muncul kecenderungan pada 'interstisi', yaitu menghubungkan sejarah kawasan lokal Asia Tenggara dengan konteks historis globalnya, dan pada konektivitas disiplin sejarah dengan berbagai disiplin ilmu sosial-humaniora lainnya untuk membangun jembatan kajian transdisipliner.

societies as inveterately piratical and the different strategies that were adopted to punish and in some cases even to eradicate these societies. It focuses on how a set of historical, politico-legal and anthropological discourses transformed the term piracy from referring to an individual crime to constitute a cultural essence, epitomizing an entire community, nation, or race. This piratical character then became embodied in a set of rhetorical and pictorial stereotypes through which groups were characterized and assessed. Furthermore,\nthe concept of piracy provided an interpretive matrix, according to which the different types of piracy prevalent in the region could be categorized, condemned, and combated according to such criteria as race, level of civilization, and aspects of culture. \n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\nCet article interroge le discours produit au sein de l\u2019empire britannique au xixe si\u00e8cle d\u00e9crivant certaines soci\u00e9t\u00e9s maritimes du sud-est asiatique comme de v\u00e9ritables nids de pirates, ainsi que les dispositifs mis en place pour r\u00e9primer celles-ci voire les \u00e9radiquer, dans certains cas. L\u2019auteur montre que ce discours, se fondant sur des productions de type historique, politico-juridique et anthropologique, fit du terme piraterie, se r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 un crime individuel, une essence culturelle, d\u00e9signant une communaut\u00e9 nationale dans son entier ou un groupe ethnique. La dimension piratique fut d\u00e8s lors int\u00e9gr\u00e9e dans toute une s\u00e9rie de st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes picturaux caract\u00e9risant les groupes sociaux. Le concept de piraterie finit par constituer une matrice selon laquelle les\ndiff\u00e9rentes modalit\u00e9s de celle-ci, \u00e0 l\u2019oeuvre dans la r\u00e9gion, pouvaient \u00eatre class\u00e9es, condamn\u00e9es et combattues gr\u00e2ce un classement se fondant sur des crit\u00e8res raciaux, tenant compte de pr\u00e9tendus niveaux de civilisation et d\u2019aspects culturels.

The present book is a preliminary attempt to reconnect those corners as a worldwide phenomenon, and place within an Islamic framework the history of the early Islamization in the Philippine Archipelago. Describing the keys of Islam as a revolutionary message that linked nations in a shared civilization from West to East, from the Iberian Peninsula to China in a global human and commercial network, the book tries to contextualize how people from the Philippine Archipelago became the Islamic easternmost edge. \r\nFrom maritime lore of the marvels of the Indian Ocean to Muslim preachers arriving under the name of makhd\u016bm, communities from the islands eventually developed incipient sultanates beyond the barangay. Surprisingly, both sides of the Islamic world will be connected with the advent of Portuguese and Spaniards into Asia. Hence, the vestiges of the disintegration of Al-Andalus will be used to describe Islam in the other corner of the earth. \r\nIslamic Far East: Ethnogenesis of Philippine Islam is the analysis of historical and anthropological processes involved in the Islamization of eastern regions, and how under the name of Moro a Muslim synergy emerged in the Philippine Archipelago. The book includes as appendix the corpus of Arabic classical sources on the easternmost edge of the world: from the legendary Andalusian in Women\u2019s Island in the 10th century to Ibn Majid\u2019s Suluk in the 15th. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35247726, "asset_id": 8898609, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1507283, "first_name":

"In this dissertation I examine the uses of the notions of civilization, race, and culture within a set of British 19 th century discourses on especially Southeast Asian societies, their present state and history. Taking the point of departure in John Crawfurd's (1783-1868) publications, it contains a study of the many debates on economic, ethnological, historical, and linguistic issues in which he participated throughout six decades and to which he contributed significantly. Through this approach I aim at providing a densely contextualized analysis of the colonial, intellectual, political, and socio-cultural aspects of Crawfurd et al's knowledge production, its routes of transmission, receptions, and appropriations. The analytic focus is directed at the evaluative-descriptive qualities attributed to the terms civilization, race, and culture, and immanent in the concepts they refer to; on the surface claiming to be primarily descriptive, they nonetheless were normatively cogent in their inherent hierarchal and classificatory structures, as well as in providing a theoretical template delineating the naturalized historical trajectories. Arguing that the notions of civilization, race and culture were pivotal key concepts in this colonial knowledge production, I chart the intertwined dynamics between these notions-both in their conceptual framings and contextualized uses. During this quest I endeavour to demonstrate the interpretive primacy of the concept of civilization throughout the entire period, even though racial concerns clearly were on the ascendancy and by the 1860s constituted the major theme of discussion and dissent. Common to all the analysed discourses is that they were hinged upon these three fundamental notions and their ability to address the universal as well as the particular, their capacity to encompass the past, present and future within one interpretive framework, and not at least their provision of a conceptual common ground which also, however, facilitated the possibilities of fundamental dissent within the actual interpretations. ii", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64987690, "asset_id": 44539947, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20400995, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "M\u00fcller", "domain_name": "ku-dk", "page_name": "MartinM\u00fcller", "display_name": "Martin M\u00fcller", "profile_url": "https://ku-dk.academia.edu/MartinM%C3%BCller?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20400995/48709368/36893085/s65_martin.m_ller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 95, "name": "History of Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Linguistics?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4996, "name": "History of Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Anthropology?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11588, "name": "Oriental Despotism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oriental_Despotism?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16175, "name": "History of Linguistic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Linguistic_Thought?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18123, "name": "Imperial ideology and representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperial_ideology_and_representation?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 35165, "name": "History of the British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_British_Empire?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 195705, "name": "Colonial and Post-Colonial Forms of Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_and_Post-Colonial_Forms_of_Knowledge?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 284475, "name": "Intellectual History: Late Imperial and Post-Soviet Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History_Late_Imperial_and_Post-Soviet_Russia?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 447178, "name": "Colonial Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Knowledge?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1276812, "name": "Entangled Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entangled_Intellectual_History?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 3790655, "name": "John Crawfurd", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Crawfurd?f_ri=532930"}]}, {"id": 12497044, "title": "\u041d\u0430\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438\u0437 \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c (V\u1ecf-c\u1ea1nh) \u0432 \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0412\u044c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439 // \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438. 2011. \u2116 2 (277). \u0421. 165\u2013176.", "created_at": "2015-05-20T15:14:03.964-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12497044/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C_%D0%B8%D0%B7_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8C_V%E1%BB%8F_c%E1%BA%A1nh_%D0%B2_%D0%A6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC_%D0%92%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%B8_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA_%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B9_%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8_2011_2_277_%D0%A1_165_176?f_ri=532930", "dom_id": "work_12497044", "summary": "\"The Inscription of V\u1ecf-c\u1ea1nh from Central Vietnam: A Translation into Russian with a Commentary\", in Vestnik drevnei istorii = Journal of Ancient History 2011 No. 2 (277), pp. 165\u2013176.\nThe paper contains the first Russian translation of the V\u1ecf-c\u1ea1nh Sanskrit inscription found in Central Vietnam near Nha-Trang.

For three years, the settlement thrived and was an important part of the China trade network, especially as a stopping point for ships plying the China route. The island settlement also carried out trading activities with neighbouring ports along the Indochina coast and the Malay Archipelago. The setting up of the factory, however, coincided with the emergence of the new entity of southern Vietnam under the Nguy\u02dc\u00ean family who were expanding their power-base to the south. In the process, the Nguy\u02dc\u00ean had already subdued the Chams and were coming face-to-face with the Khmers when the English factory was established. This paper will trace the English venture on Condore Island and the reaction of the Nguy\u02dc\u00ean ruler towards this venture which culminated with the destruction of the factory in 1705. This paper will attempt to explore the following questions: the shifting importance of the islands in the Nguy\u02dc\u00ean\u2019s security and foreign relations vis-\u00e0-vis the English factory,

"summary": "This article examines the constructionist role played by the ideas and theories on language within the context of British colonial enterprise in insular Southeast Asia during the first half of the nineteenth century. It focuses on the views expressed by the scholar-administrators and prominent metropolitan savants, William Marsden and John Crawfurd, on the languages prevalent in this region, on the societies that spoke them, and on their histories. Their discrepancies upon these matters can, it is argued, be explained by their contrasting ideas on what constitutes language and their theories on how language was shaped by and in turn also influenced history and society. Such epistemic notions on language, although often only tacitly present in the texts on these topics, nonetheless permeated the colonial discourses by prefiguring the meaning attributed to the terms designating national, racial, and civilizational units and by stipulating their linguistic relevancy. Thomas R. Trautmann, Berhard S. Cohn, Sean P. Harvey, Joseph Errington and others have emphasized the importance of language in colonial knowledge production. This knowledge production shaped the colonial enterprise by providing a set of conceptual lenses and, in a broader context, epistemic imaginaries through which the foreign places, societies, and peoples could be approached, analysed, and assessed. The entwined relationship between colonial linguistics and governance has been thoroughly addressed in the historiography on South Asia. Similar patterns can, however, be discerned in Southeast Asia, as illustrated by Trautmann's study of Marsden's \"discovery\" of the Malayo-Polynesian language family. Yet, as this article argues, these linguistic theories-based on either a genealogical and diffusionist framework, or on an approach favouring stadial civilization and transcultural interaction-were vividly discussed in their day, and these debates both reflected and influenced the perceptions of the region, its peoples and their history. These debates between Marsden and Crawfurd on how to apply the theories and methodologies rooted in comparative philology most adequately thus demonstrate, in the words of Joseph Errington, \"how microscopic, recondite linguistic details could figure in broader questions about human diversity, and telescopic views of alien, colonized peoples\" (Errington 2008: 68).

Era kolonialisme dan imperialisme pula telah meninggalkan peluang yang sangat besar bagi setiap negara di Asia Tenggara untuk bangkit menentang seterusnya membentuk identity nasionalisme yang tersendiri. Menariknya, soal nasionalisme boleh berlaku dalam dua situasi yang berbeza sama ada rentetan daripada semangat sesebuah bangsa untuk mempertahankan kepentingan mereka atau pun tindakan sesebuah bangsa yang ingin melihat mereka keluar daripada penindasan penjajahan (self determination). Dua senario ini akan cuba diterangkan dengan menggunakan senario negara Kemboja yang mewakili negara yang sedang dijajah manakala Thailand sebagai sebuah negara yang bebas merdeka. Hal ini sudah pastinya akan memberi kefahaman yang sedikit berbeza berkaitan situasi nasionalisme melibatkan kedua-dua negara di rantau Asia Tenggara ini. Oleh itu, penulisan ini akan membincangkan hal-hal berkaitan nasionalisme dan perbezaannya di antara negara Thailand dan Kemboja pada abad ke-20.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64460191, "asset_id": 44111793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 98314863, "first_name": "ABDUL", "last_name": "HAFIZ RUSLAN", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "ABDULHAFIZRUSLAN", "display_name": "ABDUL HAFIZ RUSLAN", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/ABDULHAFIZRUSLAN?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/98314863/26467243/36397253/s65_abdul.hafiz_ruslan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 250859, "name": "ii.\tPolitical Change in Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ii._Political_Change_in_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 887192, "name": "Nasionalisme", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nasionalisme?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2098569, "name": "Ideologi Nasionalisme", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideologi_Nasionalisme?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11624899, "title": "A Source of Local Administrative Unit in Early Modern Vietnam [In Japanese]", "created_at": "2015-03-23T23:52:02.409-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11624899/A_Source_of_Local_Administrative_Unit_in_Early_Modern_Vietnam_In_Japanese_?f_ri=532930", "dom_id": "work_11624899", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37092807, "asset_id": 11624899, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3555391, "first_name": "Takashi", "last_name": "Hasuda", "domain_name": "ritsumeikan-apu", "page_name": "TakashiHasuda", "display_name": "Takashi  Hasuda", "profile_url": "https://ritsumeikan-apu.academia.edu/TakashiHasuda?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3555391/8446509/9441393/s65_takashi.hasuda.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7396, "name": "Vietnamese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_History?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36833194, "title": "Com\u00e9rcio, Fiscalidade e \u00c9tica Econ\u00f3mica em Malaca no sec XVI", "created_at": "2018-06-12T21:05:35.417-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36833194/Com%C3%A9rcio_Fiscalidade_e_%C3%89tica_Econ%C3%B3mica_em_Malaca_no_sec_XVI?f_ri=532930", "dom_id": "work_36833194", "summary": "This book chapter researches the influence of Catholic ethics and moral precepts in Portuguese organization of the fiscal system in Malacca at the end of the 16th century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56785508, "asset_id": 36833194, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13291436, "first_name": "Ivo", "last_name": "Carneiro de Sousa", "domain_name": "ipm", "page_name": "IvoCarneirodeSousa", "display_name": "Ivo Carneiro de Sousa", "profile_url": "https://ipm.academia.edu/IvoCarneirodeSousa?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13291436/12110563/13489804/s65_ivo.carneiro_de_sousa.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 403234, "name": "History of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Malaysia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30946894, "title": "Making Money in the Margins of War.

This article exemplifies how the Indonesian Republic could get its hands on weapons, venturing on the thin, controversial line between trade and smuggling at the final stage of the war.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26102749, "first_name": "Maarten", "last_name": "Manse", "domain_name": "vu-nl", "page_name": "MaartenManse", "display_name": "Maarten Manse", "profile_url": "https://vu-nl.academia.edu/MaartenManse?f_ri=532930", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 70307, "name": "Weapons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Weapons?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 80636, "name": "Colonial Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Warfare?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 124175, "name": "Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_History?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 166283, "name": "Dutch colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_colonialism?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 253522, "name": "Dutch East Indies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_Indies?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 447619, "name": "Dutch Imperial and Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Imperial_and_Colonial_History?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 582413, "name": "history of Indonesia during Western colonization era", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Indonesia_during_Western_colonization_era?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 957419, "name": "Colonial Wars", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Wars?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 972051, "name": "Netherlands East Indies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Netherlands_East_Indies?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1131941, "name": "History of Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indonesia?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1171307, "name": "Dutch Colonial History of Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_Colonial_History_of_Indonesia?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1483618, "name": "Wars for Independence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wars_for_Independence?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 1913357, "name": "Illegal Weapons Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Illegal_Weapons_Trade?f_ri=532930"}]}, {"id": 45095874, "title": "State and Society in Pre-Modern Southeast Asia: Current Research Into Traditional Forms of Governance", "created_at": "2021-02-10T14:50:08.723-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45095874/State_and_Society_in_Pre_Modern_Southeast_Asia_Current_Research_Into_Traditional_Forms_of_Governance?f_ri=532930", "dom_id": "work_45095874", "summary": "EuroSEAS2021 -

It sketches the shared precolonial heritage and the effects of European domination and Western capitalism, exploring how peoples and communities both resisted and accommodated these forces. The partition of India, and the decolonization of Indonesia and Indochina, are analyzed as foundational moments for the new political orders emerging in the mid twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe course addresses the dynamics of economic development in South and Southeast Asia during the subsequent decades, together with the myriad social and political problems - ranging from governmental abuse of human rights, to violent anti-government insurgencies - that have accompanied the growing prosperity enjoyed in many countries. We conclude by assessing how ideals of democracy, plurality and secularism are currently being reinterpreted and renegotiated in South and Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 197010, "first_name": "Lennart", "last_name": "Bes", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "LennartBes", "display_name": "Lennart Bes", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/LennartBes?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/197010/210675/3104090/s65_lennart.bes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 14806409, "title": "La r\u00e9forme des gongs - Dynamiques de christianisation chez les Bunong protestants  des hautes terres du Cambodge / The Reformation of the Gongs - Dynamics of Christianisation among the Protestant Bunong of Cambodia\u2019s highlands", "created_at": "2015-08-09T21:10:00.912-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14806409/La_r%C3%A9forme_des_gongs_Dynamiques_de_christianisation_chez_les_Bunong_protestants_des_hautes_terres_du_Cambodge_The_Reformation_of_the_Gongs_Dynamics_of_Christianisation_among_the_Protestant_Bunong_of_Cambodia_s_highlands?f_ri=532930", "dom_id": "work_14806409", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 139662, "first_name": "Catherine", "last_name": "Scheer", "domain_name": "efeo", "page_name": "CatherineScheer", "display_name": "Catherine  Scheer", "profile_url": "https://efeo.academia.edu/CatherineScheer?f_ri=532930", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/139662/9871769/18546038/s65_catherine.scheer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1712, "name": "Globalisation and cultural change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_cultural_change?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6995, "name": "Anthropology of Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Christianity?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7664, "name": "Religious Conversion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Conversion?f_ri=532930", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15149, "name": "Indigenous Peoples Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples_Rights?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 184372, "name": "Christianisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianisation?f_ri=532930"}, {"id": 532930, "name": "History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=532930"}]}]
