The article seeks to show that, despite the apparent success of Malaysia's national education system in producing a relatively large number of skilled and semiskilled workers who went on to form constantly expanding vibrant middle classes, these cohorts of new labour market entrants have largely failed to live up to expectations of them as socially progressive in the way envisaged by Wawasan 2020 \u2013 a liberal, rational, inclusive, scientific and progressive Malaysian nation. As a matter of fact, after fifty years, Malaysia's educational system remains unsuccessful in tackling its twin problems before independence \u2013 communal and class polarisation. We hereby argue that the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2025, notwithstanding the hulabaloo which accompanied its launching, not only also fails to confront the critical issue of identity and

This paper examines the role of social media in Malaysia\u2019s 2013 general elections and its political impact. Previously, in the 2008 general election, it was widely accepted that alternative online content determined the result. The country\u2019s opposition coalition was credited in using new media to overcome a hostile mainstream media owned by establishment political interests to secure a much improved showing at the polls. Back in GE 2008, the new media electoral landscape was comprised of blogs, party websites and alternative news portals and not really social media as we it know today. In 2008, BN was the clear social media outsider. In fact, BN literally had limited online presence and was said to have underestimated the impact of new media altogether on the electorate\u2019s voting behavior. Fast forward to April 2013, the landscape is very different. BN had made strong inroads onto social media and has carved itself a competitive position. What then has been social media\u2019s political impact on voter behaviour during Malaysia\u2019s 13th general elections?

It has been extensively used by the ruling coalition Barisan Nasional (BN), in particular by the dominant component party United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) against its political rivals. In 2013, during Malaysia's 13 th general election (GE13), negative campaigning spilled over from mainstream media onto social media platforms. Unlike in the one-sided past, during GE13, both the ruling and opposition coalitions equally employed negative campaigning over social media. This paper examines the phenomenon of negative campaigning over social media during GE13 and the the 6 by-elections held between 2013 to 2016. Preliminary examination shows that negative campaigning over social media contributed to increased polarisation among competing camps during elections. The evidence reviewed suggests that post-GE13 negative campaigning over social media is well-entrenched and will continue to polarise Malaysian politics. The proximity of violent incidents to periods of negative campaigning over social media has led to a discourse of internet regulation in the run-up to Malaysia's next general elections.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47309398, "asset_id": 27054788, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75404, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Gomez", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JGomez", "display_name": "James  Gomez", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JGomez?f_ri=921027", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75404/20812/1789115/s65_james.gomez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 7369, "name": "Political communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_communication?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 38483, "name": "New Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 50967, "name": "Mass Communication and New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mass_Communication_and_New_Media?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 137558, "name": "Malaysian media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_media?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 140615, "name": "New media and media freedom in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_media_and_media_freedom_in_Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 684611, "name": "Malaysian General Election 2013", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_General_Election_2013?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 979141, "name": "Malaysian General Elections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_General_Elections?f_ri=921027"}]}, {"id": 46486128, "title": "Mengkanunkan Agama: Islam, Hak-hak Liberal, dan Kenegraan Malaysia", "created_at": "2021-04-10T08:03:45.288-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/46486128/Mengkanunkan_Agama_Islam_Hak_hak_Liberal_dan_Kenegraan_Malaysia?f_ri=921027", "dom_id": "work_46486128", "summary": "Kebanyakan negara majori Muslim memiliki sistem perundangan yang meliputi peruntukan Islam dan hak-hak liberal.

Powered by Saudi Arabian largesse and buoyed by the advent of the Internet, this new wave of Salafization has eclipsed an earlier Salafi trend that spawned the Kaum Muda reformist movement. Recent surveys suggest that there has been a rise in the level of extremism among Muslims in Malaysia. While the majority is far from being enamoured by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the Wahhabi-Salafi doctrine that ISIS claims to represent in unadulterated form does appeal to many of them following the decades-long Salafization of Islam in the country. This tallies with media reports on increasing numbers of Malay-Muslim youth harbouring an attraction towards radical Islamist movements such as ISIS. Salafization, referring to a process of mindset and attitudinal transformation rather than the growth of Salafi nodes per se, is not restricted to individuals or groups identified as \u201cSalafi\u201d, but rather affects practically all levels of Malay-Muslim society, cutting across political parties, governmental institutions and non-state actors. It has resulted in Islamist, rather than Islamic, ideals increasingly defining the tenor of mainstream Islam in Malaysia, with worrying consequences for both intra-Muslim and inter-religious relations. Responses to the Wahhabi-Salafi onslaught from the Malay-Muslim ruling elite in Malaysia have been ambivalent, and have had weak counteracting effects on the Salafization process.",

"Malay-Muslim identity has been pivotal to the functioning of the modern nation-state that attained independence from Britain on 31 August 1957 as the Federation of Malaya and became Malaysia on 16 September 1963 with the incorporation of Sabah, Sarawak and Singapore into the federation. Malay-Muslims constitute the majority of Malaysia's population, albeit not by an overwhelming percentage, and the definitive features, structures and conventions of the Malaysian state give them control of the major levers of power. Malay-Muslim identity is grounded in the Federal Constitution, but has undergone metamorphoses as a result of shifting boundaries in the conceptualization and praxis of Islam among Malay-Muslims. This article discusses some of the causes and ramifications of the contemporary essentialization of Islamic thought and practice in Malaysia. I argue that a sharia-centric Islamist bias, paradoxically, came close to uniting hitherto opposing sides of the Malay-Muslim religio-political divide during Najib Razak's administration (2009-18).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61371936, "asset_id": 41117522, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=921027", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 27673, "name": "Sharia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sharia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 51278, "name": "Maqasid al-Sharia (Purposes of Islamic Law)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maqasid_al-Sharia_Purposes_of_Islamic_Law_?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 66015, "name": "Shariah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shariah?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 153914, "name": "Malaysia education system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_education_system?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 167916, "name": "Sejarah Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 251282, "name": "Malaysian legal system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_legal_system?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 259724, "name": "Syariah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Syariah?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 301193, "name": "Malaysian Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Law?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=921027"}]}, {"id": 7870299, "title": "Economics for Business -

A crucial element in this discourse is the official position of Islam as the \u201creligion of the federation\u201d in the\nMalaysian Constitution, which simultaneously guarantees the freedom of other religions embraced by almost half of the country\u2019s population. The population became even more diverse ethnically and religiously upon the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, which replaced Malaya, on September 16, 1963. Closely related to the discourse of political Islam in Malaysia, the evolving concepts of \u201creligion\u201d and \u201csecularism\u201d in Malaysia\u2019s Islamic context have undergone considerable shifts as a result of constant public engagement by an assortment of politicians, commentators, scholars, bureaucrats, and civil society activists. As the argument develops, Malaysia\u2019s interaction with Islam has been essentialized by political interests such that boundaries are hardened between what is considered Islamic and un-Islamic. The increasingly rigid positions adopted by Islamic stakeholders have arguably worsened both interreligious and intra-Muslim relations, with progressive Muslim voices increasingly finding themselves marginalized in the state-controlled political environment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58083643, "asset_id": 38059065, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Chinese Overseas: A Study of Beijing's Changing Policy in Southeast Asia and Beyond is a very welcome addition to the discussion of ties between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and ethnic Chinese living beyond its borders. Suryadinata makes the case in the book that as the PRC becomes more globally prominent, it is increasingly blurring lines in its treatment of PRC citizens and non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese overseas. This claim comes amid allegations of growing PRC efforts to mobilize ethnic Chinese communities abroad to serve its national interests, be they economic, political, or strategic. These concerns are not new and are in fact a throwback to the past. They give the book an added timeliness and importance.\nFor much of the Cold War, ethnic Chinese communities in non-communist parts of Southeast Asia faced the suspicion of being a possible subversive fifth column for the PRC, especially if they seemed left-leaning. Such perspectives diminished as the PRC engaged in economic reform from the late 1970s, eschewed radical revolution, and passed a nationality law in 1980 clearly demarcating non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese abroad from PRC citizens. Recent reports of PRC efforts to lobby and police opinion in foreign countries using members of local ethnic Chinese communities ranging from Europe and North America to Oceania and Southeast Asia have again brought these long-dormant issues to the fore.1 This is an issue on which Suryadinata has previously written, and he provides readers a brief reminder of these themes in Chapter 3.2 [End Page 151]\nAn Awkward Closeness\nSuryadinata organizes the book into four parts. Part I (Chapters 1\u20133) discusses the PRC's rise to prominence from the 1980s till the present, changes in ethnic Chinese communities outside the PRC, and the organization of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO). The OCAO is the government body responsible for managing official ties with ethnic Chinese communities outside the PRC, be they PRC citizens abroad or ethnic Chinese who do not hold PRC citizenship. Within these pages, Suryadinata introduces his main observation\u2014that Beijing seems to be reverting to its older policy of reducing distinctions between PRC citizens and non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese in foreign jurisdictions. The key motivation behind this move, according to Suryadinata, is PRC efforts to advance and protect its interests and concerns overseas.\nPart II (Chapters 4\u20138) examines how the PRC responds officially to events outside its borders that affect ethnic Chinese and PRC citizens. Each chapter contains a case where ethnic Chinese come under threat from developments outside China and assess the PRC position. Beijing's reaction to the 1998 anti-Chinese race riots in Indonesia and violence in the South Pacific, Middle East, and Africa indicates a willingness to evacuate PRC citizens, especially those who work for PRC state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The 2014 anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam, triggered by a Beijing-initiated escalation in its maritime dispute with Hanoi, suggests that the PRC is not above placing its citizens overseas in danger for the pursuit of more important interests.\nHowever, contrasting PRC responses to incidents involving ethnic Chinese in Malaysia and Myanmar point toward an evolution in Beijing's position. Beijing responded to alleged ill-treatment of its citizens by Malaysian police in 2005 as well as political pressure, even violence, toward ethnic Chinese Myanmar citizens in the Kokang region along the PRC border in 2015 with diplomatic entreaties. Such actions resulted from Beijing's desire to maintain positive official relations with Malaysia and Myanmar. Threats against ethnic Chinese Malaysians in 2015, in comparison, saw the then-PRC ambassador to Malaysia publicly expressing an intention to protect these co-ethnics even though this was tantamount to intervention and divided local opinion. This step appears to portend an effort by Beijing to extend influence over non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese communities overseas, even at the risk of upsetting foreign governments.\nThe next four chapters in Part III examine the ways domestic considerations in the...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57007360, "asset_id": 37056621, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

(2003\u20139), encountered failure. Its lack of success was significantly due to the rise of Islamist conservatives, who deliberately interpreted Islam Hadhari as a political instrument to impose Islamization from above in a manner not conducive to living in a spirit of peaceful coexistence in a multi-ethnic society. While on the one hand it promoted an Islam that cherishes the values of inclusivity, moderation and inter-religious tolerance, on the other hand Islam Hadhari unfortunately triggered defensive responses from Islamist conservatives. This ad hoc conservative alliance comprised religious leaders associated with the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), state religious functionaries, scholars affiliated to the opposition Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS: Parti Islam SeMalaysia) and Islamist non-governmental organizations. The rise of this Islamist conservatism aggravated ethno-religious relations during Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\u2019s premiership, leading to the setbacks experienced by his government in the general elections of 2008. By then, the death knell had been sounded for Islam Hadhari. It was steadily consigned to the graveyard of history by the administration of Najib Razak, who took over from Abdullah in April 2009.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37170580, "asset_id": 11740103, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=921027", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4979, "name": "Islamic Contemporary Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Contemporary_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 33114, "name": "Islam (Political Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_Political_Science_?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 36717, "name": "Contemporary Islamic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Islamic_Thought?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 45019, "name": "Islamic Movements and Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movements_and_Political_Islam?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 62751, "name": "Contemporary Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Islamic_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 840844, "name": "Kelemahan Pentadbiran Abdullah Ahmad Badawi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kelemahan_Pentadbiran_Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 1359431, "name": "Islam Hadhari", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_Hadhari?f_ri=921027"}]}, {"id": 32313563, "title": "Syariahization of Intra-Muslim Religious Freedom and Human Rights Practice in Malaysia: The Case of Darul Arqam, Contemporary Southeast Asia, vol. 38, no. 1 (2016), pp. 28-54.", "created_at": "2017-04-07T02:58:31.936-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32313563/Syariahization_of_Intra_Muslim_Religious_Freedom_and_Human_Rights_Practice_in_Malaysia_The_Case_of_Darul_Arqam_Contemporary_Southeast_Asia_vol_38_no_1_2016_pp_28_54?f_ri=921027", "dom_id": "work_32313563", "summary": "Islam was officially installed as the religion of the Federation of Malaya upon independence on 31 August 1957, and retained as such after the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963. Since then, political stakeholders have not shied away from making the most of Islamic symbols, practices and institutions towards achieving national economic development or regime maintenance. Driven by hegemonic considerations, they largely ignored intra-Muslim religious variations. The religious uniformity of Malays, all of whom were Muslims by law, were literally taken for granted and served as a politically expedient vehicle for Islamic-based political mobilization by the Malay-dominated regime. Pluralist conceptions of Malaysian society were accepted only insofar as they pertain to Muslim-non-Muslim distinctions. At the core of the government's efforts to infuse the Malaysian polity with Islamic alternatives for socio-political arrangements is a gradual process of syariahization. However, owing to arbitrary interpretations of the syariah (Islamic law) by Malaysia's official Islamic gatekeepers, syariahization resulted in state-manufactured denial of freedom of religious expression to non-conformist Malay-Muslims. Until today, Muslim non-conformists are not allowed to adopt, let alone to propagate, different forms of Islam that run afoul of the version upheld by an officially sanctioned version of the syariah. As reflected by the case of the Sufi-inspired Darul Arqam movement, government-imposed syariahization has resulted in the violation of fundamental human rights of Malay-Muslims, regardless of the fact that the syariah itself may not have been clear-cut in determining the boundaries between religious orthodoxy and unorthodoxy in prescribing punishments for dissent.", "downloadable_attachments":

"dom_id": "work_49563913", "summary": "This article traces the stellar accomplishments of the Sayyids, as descendants of the Prophet Muhammad are known in the field of Islamic da'wah. For the many Sayyids who excelled as torchbearers of Islam in the Malay world, propagating Islam was a lifetime vocation that passed without the stress that we find in the modern world. Their da'wah efforts encompassed such diverse undertakings as employing business acumen in confronting the challenges of colonialism and Malay court culture, immersing themselves in native communities via intermarriages and adoption of local customs, and carving a niche for themselves in local and international politics as advisors and emissaries. At grassroots level, da'wah for them was inseparable from daily chores and mundane affairs. That Western colonialism hardly made any impact in directly desacralizing the Malays is a tribute to the success of the Sayyids' da'wah efforts, which served as a buffer against the religious implications of colonial encroachment into autochthonous institutions and lifestyle. By looking at some examples of how the Sayyids interacted with local communities in selected regions of the Malay world, this article traces part of this glittering history of da'wah in the easternmost parts of the Islamic commonwealth. Most importantly, the Malay world's Islamization was distinguished by lack of violence and emphasis on educational progress more than anything else.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67887966, "asset_id": 49563913, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=921027", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 25118, "name": "Medieval Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Islamic_History?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 58293, "name": "Ahl Al Bayt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ahl_Al_Bayt?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 167916, "name": "Sejarah Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 344616, "name": "Early Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Sufism?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=921027"}]}, {"id": 1820254, "title": "Soap Opera as a Site for Engaging with Modernity Amongst Malay Women in Malaysia", "created_at": "2012-07-29T16:48:52.282-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1820254/Soap_Opera_as_a_Site_for_Engaging_with_Modernity_Amongst_Malay_Women_in_Malaysia?f_ri=921027", "dom_id": "work_1820254", "summary": "This article seeks to situate soap opera as a popular vehicle for Malay women in contemporary Malaysia to engage with an increasingly globally oriented form of transnational modernity.

Through an insight into the role of a non-Western soap opera as a privileged site for engaging with modernity amongst Malay women, this article provides a clearer understanding of television\u2019s

March 2015, Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s petition for pardon from what he claims was a politically-motivated conviction for sodomising his male aid was rejected by Malaysia\u2019s King, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. In Malaysia\u2019s Federal jurisdiction, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong exercises the prerogative power to grant clemency or pardon on advice from a specially-constituted Pardons Board, consisting of up to five members.\r\n\r\nIn this article, I describe the way in which the Malaysian Pardons Boards operate, and propose a set of plausible hypotheses explaining why the rejection of Anwar\u2019s application for pardon, submitted on his behalf by his wife and daughters, came as no surprise. Despite arguments in the Malaysian media being made in favour of the purported independence of the Pardons Board as a decision-making body and the pre-eminence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong as the final decision maker on pardon, this article demonstrates argues that through its composition and procedures, the Federal Pardons Board that disposed of Anwar\u2019s petition is open to the perception that it may be subject to significant political influence from the Barisan Nasional government in power in Malaysia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51603087, "asset_id": 15343673, "asset_type":

of the Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS: Parti Islam SeMalaysia) since capturing power in the state of Kelantan in 1990, resurfaced. Circumstances in 2014 however are markedly different. PAS is now a major partner of the People\u2019s Pact (PR: Pakatan Rakyat) opposition coalition, whose roots can be traced back to the Reformasi discontent ensuing from the dismissal of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim from the ruling  United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the government in 1998. The cooperation between PAS, Anwar\u2019s People\u2019s Justice Party (PKR: Parti Keadilan Rakyat) and the Democratic Action Party (DAP) within the PR framework has eroded support for the UMNO-led National Front (BN: Barisan Nasional), although it maintains bastions of influence among rural Malay constituencies. Long known for its espousal of a modernist version of Islam which emphasises the substance rather than the form of the religion, UMNO\u2019s conditional backing of PAS\u2019s intention to table two Private Member\u2019s bills for the application of hudud in Kelantan comes as a surprise, but the apparent turnabout may be explained by recourse to pragmatic political considerations.",

However, research shows that most countries, including Malaysia, are not on the right track. Thus, this research paper aims to examine the alternative political policies besides that of a capitalist/liberal democracy, such as ecological democracy, that the Malaysian smart urbanisation movement should follow to achieve the SDGs. This study applied the method of case study analysis in examining empirical examples related to stakeholder partnerships and environmental cases in smart urbanisation in Malaysia. This paper argues that achieving the SDGs with the current capitalist hegemony poses a significant challenge to countries. However, with environmental ethics in mind, it is possible to achieve the SDGs with the trust granted by the government in the form of participatory politics. The SDGs also need to be overhauled and rewritten under the realm of ecological democracy. The implications of the findings include creating a call for support for an emerging ecological democracy that is particularly compatible with the SDGs as well as embedded in the natural environment, social and economic developments.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68101936, "asset_id": 44437087, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58728766, "first_name": "Seng Boon", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "perak", "page_name": "SengBoonLim", "display_name": "Seng Boon Lim", "profile_url": "https://perak.academia.edu/SengBoonLim?f_ri=921027", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58728766/22859559/105401425/s65_seng_boon.lim.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2431, "name": "Urban Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Politics?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3078, "name": "Ethics & Social Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics_and_Social_Sustainability?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5107, "name": "Stakeholders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stakeholders?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 9705, "name": "Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capitalism?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 18886, "name": "Urban Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Policy?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 29209, "name": "Participatory democracy (Political Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_democracy_Political_Science_?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 46332, "name": "Public Private Partnerships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Private_Partnerships?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 94893, "name": "Smart City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Smart_City?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 856686, "name": "Ecological Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecological_Democracy?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=921027"}, {"id": 1958655, "name": "Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Development_Goals_SDGs_?f_ri=921027"}]}, {"id": 5165737, "title": "Penilaian Terhadap Kelayakan Ahli Perlimen di Malaysia Menurut Perspektif Islam", "created_at": "2013-11-20T11:13:01.211-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5165737/Penilaian_Terhadap_Kelayakan_Ahli_Perlimen_di_Malaysia_Menurut_Perspektif_Islam?f_ri=921027", "dom_id": "work_5165737", "summary": "This article is an attempt to discuss issues regarding the requirements and the qualifications of Malaysian Member of Parliament according to the Malaysian Constitution and then the requirements and the qualification are assessed according to the Islamic Perspective. The discussion is initiated with an explanation regarding the British influences towards the establishment and the operation of Malaysian Parliament system. After its independence, the Malaysian Parliament System and its procedure is a continuation from the previous governing body. In order to Islamize the Malaysian Parliament Institution, the laws regarding the institution especially Malaysian Constitution needs to be improved from time to time according to Islamic values. Furthermore, this article explains the requirements and the qualifications needed by a candidate who will be elected as a Malaysian Member of Parliament according to Malaysian Constitution. Several assessments were made towards the requirements and the qualifications either it is fitting or not with the Islamic concept. The issue of disqualification as a Member of Parliament according to Malaysian Constitution is also examined thoroughly with regards to Islamic Perspective. In short, this article argues that some of the requirements and the qualifications of Malaysian Member of Parliament which stated in Malaysian Constitution are fitting with the Islamic Concept while some others are not. Therefore, continues efforts need to be done in order to improve the Malaysian Constitution to be fitted with the Islamic concept.

Studies by scholars Chaiwat Satha-Anand (2006) and Nidhi Aeusrivongse (2006) make it difficult to imagine that anyone even superficially interested in South Thailand\u2019s geography of violence being ignorant about the details of this 3-day altercation. My motivations for writing this paper are two concerns about the project of peace research. The first  \u2013 which I will labour least  \u2013 is that despite the difficulties of access to suspicious, rural communities, there is no substitute for fieldwork. Some of the new insights provided below might be the fruit of fieldwork, but others have been in the public domain for decades. This relates to my second concern. The lack of interaction with the secondary literature capable of contextualizing the range of personalities and processes involved in past conflicts is difficult to explain, and even harder to excuse. I relate how labouring in both the field and library led to new insights about connections between Haji Mat Karae (who led the Dusun Nyoir rebellion) with Kyai Salleh of Batu Pahat. I point out similarities between these movements, in which invulnerability magic (ilum kebal) and swords (rather than guns) were employed during a time of unprecedented geo-political chaos. Although mention has been made about how political chaos in Bangkok impacted the Malay-dominated far-south, I show that these dynamics existed throughout the Thai/Malay Peninsula.",

The focus of this study is to find out why Najib is willing to exploit state institutions such as the bureaucracy-police departments, anti-corruption agency, the Attorney-General's office, and cooperate with cabinet members to ensure that he perpetually clings to power. In principle, most third-world elites are quite happy to dismantle existing institutions (parliament, elections) in the interests of continued rule. Besides that, those who are already in power are often view institutions more as obstacles and less as facilitators of effective rule. This research finds those who support and protect Najib realize that some actions of their boss are illegal, but they pretend to support him in order to fulfill their selfish desires. A leader will preserve his power when most of his supporters have become blinded by the trappings of power. They know Najib's faults but still support him. Whatever wrongs Najib has done, they still support him.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62225712, "asset_id": 42094743, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

"summary": "Women are a focal point in Malaysian politics, particularly when there are concerns about support within the electorate. The United Malays Nationalist Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party in the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, has been particularly adept at emphasizing the role of and opportunities for women in the party\u2019s early history. Since the 2008 general elections, when BN lost its parliamentary two-thirds majority, UMNO leader and Prime Minister Najib Razak has sought to \u201cwin back\u201d support. One of his strategies to do so involved manufacturing inseparable links between UMNO, BN and a progressive outlook with multicultural appeal. This strategy is most evident in how the Najib administration has approached the issue of the status of women in Malaysia. This paper will discuss how the theme of women\u2019s empowerment was developed as a platform to gather support for UMNO and BN in the run-up to the 13th general elections. By tracing the history of women\u2019s roles within UMNO party politics, this paper will firmly situate these developments in the context of the repetition of a particular pattern when it comes to women\u2019s participation and representation in politics. The paper will also argue that despite the occasional deference to the notion of gender equality, this acknowledgement has been merely perfunctory. The increasing prevalence of Malay nationalism as a masculine ethnoreligious concept in Malaysia means that Malay-Muslim women in particular will continue to be regarded as belonging primarily in supporting roles and the private realm.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32811231, "asset_id": 5792200, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 652821, "first_name": "Dahlia", "last_name": "Martin", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "DahliaMartin", "display_name": "Dahlia Martin", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/DahliaMartin?f_ri=921027", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/652821/226109/752320/s65_dahlia.martin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 645248, "name": "UMNO Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UMNO_Politics?f_ri=921027", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=921027"}]}, {"id": 30878441, "title": "New Economic Model", "created_at": "2017-01-11T09:18:09.975-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30878441/New_Economic_Model?f_ri=921027", "dom_id": "work_30878441", "summary": "By referring to an article about New Economic Model (NEM): An Analytical Perspective by Nik Mustapha Raja Abdullah stated that our Prime Minister Yang Amat Berhormat Datuk Seri Mohd Najib bin Tun Abdul Razak have introduced a new political economy policy for Malaysia which is New Economic Model (NEM).

years of the 1970s-80s, throughout their checkered experimentation in the realm of electoral politics. While admittedly encountering multiple challenges and failures, the overall scenario attests to the contributions made by Islamist civil society actors in widening democratic space in Malaysia, notwithstanding the gaps that continue to exist even among the different strands of Islamism. During the Thirteenth General Elections (GE13), apart from the participation of Islamists who have become part of mainstream political parties, new Islamist NGOs such as Hizb at-Tahrir (HT: Party of Liberation), Ikatan Muslimin Malaysia (ISMA: Muslim Solidarity Front) and the Islamic Renaissance Front (IRF) did not shy away from expressing their positions and views in political campaigns. Although hardcore support may be slow in coming, their presence in electoral politics threatens the legitimacy of fellow Islamists in the established Malay-Muslim political parties, which these new Islamists are inclined to perceive as having sold off to the vagaries, categories and structures of conventional political systems, deemed as unIslamic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56097655,

It was on the early hours of Saturday morning 8th March, 2014 when some 227 passengers with a 12-member crew of Malaysia Airlines (MAS) Boeing 777-200ER flight MH370, took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for Beijing, the Chinese capital. In just about an hour after taking off, the flight literally became invisible to the aviation radar, and mysteriously went missing. Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Najib Tun Razak immediately solicited the support of about 26 countries including Australia, Britain, China, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates (UAE), United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). A sea and air convoy from those countries embarked on what has been so far the biggest search and rescue (SAR) operation in the history of aviation in the world. Huge resources which comprised not less than 22 aircraft, 6 helicopters and 19 ships have so far been mobilized by the good-Samaritan-countries to help the Malaysian Government in the search for the missing airliner. It\u2019s now nearly one month since the SAR operations have been going on in the vast seas, oceans and continental Asia without any trace of MH370. Although Australian, Chinese, French and Thai satellites have lately picked pictures of images in the remotest parts of southern Indian Ocean thought to be debris of the missing aircraft, followed, lately by search for the flight data recorder popularly known as the black box, search is still going on inconclusively. \nSince the day the news of the tragic incidence was broken by the media, this tag: #PrayforMH370 or just #MH370 became one of the most trending hash tags on Twitter in Malaysia. Prayer sessions have been held by the Government and people of Malaysia for the recovery of the missing jet with 239 souls on board. Among about six nationals on the plane, about 152 of the passengers were Chinese with about a dozen of Malaysians, a few Americans and Indians, etc. \n\nThe editorial board therefore wishes to, on behalf of the entire UPMISA officials and indeed the entire international students\u2019 community of UPM, extends its sincere and heart-felt sympathy to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board MAS flight MH370. We hope that, as painful as the situation is, they would be able to endure the tragedy with great fortitude and sense of responsibility while, at the same time, rendering their support to the Malaysian Government in its unrelenting efforts of searching for the whereabouts of the missing aircraft carrying their loved ones on board. We also wish to sympathize with the Malaysian Government and, by and large, the management of UPM over this sad incident. Please accept the highest assurances of our humble selves in sharing with you the pains and grief of this mysterious tragedy while we keep the flames of the candles of hope burning.",

Furthermore, understanding the motivations and decisions to contribute to peace operations requires a multifocal lens that recognises the various manifestations of this commitment and identifies the salient motivations behind these decisions. This lens illustrates that both competition and cooperation co-exist in the Indonesian and Malaysian decisions to contribute to peace operations in pursuit of increased political legitimacy in the global system.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 85471, "first_name": "Alistair", "last_name": "Cook", "domain_name": "rsis", "page_name": "AlistairCook", "display_name": "Alistair D .

With the expansion of Islam in Kedah to encompass aspects of governance, a syncretic culture which combined Islamic with feudal elements emerged. From the overview of the history of Islam in Kedah, it is shown that Islam enjoys a symbiotic relationship with the culture that has fundamentally moulded the power dynamics of political praxis in Kedah. The relevant politico-cultural practitioners here include the kings and their family members, the royal inner circle, palace advisors, ruling elites, the ulama and modern politicians.

How do the social actors negotiate the education path in a gendered manner? Which strategies do the female educational migrants pursue through appropriation and allocation of certain gendered ideals and norms in transnational space?\r\nThe most important finding of the study points out that against the background of an ethnically segregated and patrilineal Malaysian society, educational migration to Singapore is the key for a transformation of femininity for Chinese Malaysian women as it implies extended scopes of action and relative independence. \r\nIn multicultural Malaysia, the Malay Malaysian population profits most from national politics. \r\nDespite cultural diversity in Malaysia, the government legitimates a cultural Malay supremacy. This is also linked to religion, as Islam has been established as the compulsory religion for the Malay Malaysians. These developments of in- and exclusion are based on colonial categorizations of \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 and the concept of multiculturalism. The ethnic segregation was introduced during British colonial times mainly through the establishment of a formal education system. \r\nDue to the social emphasis on ethnic boundaries, broad, supra-ethnic political action regarding women\u2019s and gender issues has so far been difficult to organize. The Chinese Malaysian women have been denied equal access to education and equal participation in national gender politics for the last four decades. But not only do multicultural politics hamper women-related issues, but also patrilineal Confucian elements of the Chinese population group itself contribute to the poor implementation of gender-related claims.\r\nSingapore with its multiethnic meritocratic society is the destination for the educational migration of Chinese Malaysian women who seek more equal opportunities. Its \u201amodern\u2018 neoliberal education system opens up more possibilities for the migrants. The young Chinese Malaysian women do not only migrate to the \u2018modern\u2019, but also to the Chinese-dominated Singapore. Therewith, the migration process is also a means of ethnic distinction. Through appropriations of \u2018modern\u2019, Chinese-focused discourses on femininity, the social actors distance themselves from the Muslim Malay norms concerning family constellations, sexuality and romantic love as well as the body. \r\nBy means of change in perspective, the book not only analyzes the stories and topics of young Chinese Malaysian women, but also of female Malay Malaysian students with their perspectives on the similar issues. Through this complex picture, the transnational space between Singapore and Malaysia gets analyzed as a place of social order.

snub.\" - edits by Today.\n____________\n\"Indeed, Singapore may have to accept \u2018Finlandisation\u2019 in the face of Chinese regional primacy, deferring to China on all foreign policy but keeping nominal independence. This is arguably already happening with some of its ASEAN neighbours. Under such an arrangement, Singapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be in the hands of Beijing\u2019s largesse.\" - Original\n\"One risk of Chinese dominance for Singapore over time is Finlandisation, even if many find this option unpalatable.\nSingapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be subject to Beijing\u2019s largesse; Singapore would have to defer to China under such an arrangement. The concept comes from Finland\u2019s relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, in which Helsinki kept all the formal trappings of sovereignty, but submitted to Moscow\u2019s preferences on foreign and security policy.\nSovereignty is not a dichotomous quality \u2014 it can be parsed into different components, each to varying degrees. Finlandisation is arguably already happening in South-east Asia at some level, given China\u2019s growing regional dominance.\"\n\nPlease find a link to the full piece on Today here:

For many people these changes represent 'progress' and 'development'. This book, however, focuses on the more marginalised residents of Kuala Lumpur. Among others, it considers street hawkers and vendors, refugees, the urban poor, religious minorities and a sexuality rights group, and explores how their everyday lives have been adversely affected by these recent changes. The book shows how urban renewal, the law and ethno-religious nationalism can work against these groups in wanting to live and work in the capital city of Malaysia.", "downloadable_attachments": [],
