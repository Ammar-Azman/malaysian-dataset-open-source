This study investigates the conflicts over constructing dams or water storages on cross boundary rivers for example the building of Baghliar Dam, Kishanganga Plant and Wullar Barrage by India and also investigates Pakistan's response to these projects, judgment of intercontinental Court of Arbitration, responses of both sides and confidence building measures signed regarding the issue. This study explores that the water issue would prove disastrous if it was not solved in time.

These systems consist of a minimum of three ritual families: the Buddha (headed by the Buddha \u015a\u0101kyamuni or Vairocana), the Lotus (headed by the Bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara), and the Vajra (headed by the Bodhisattva Vajrap\u0101\u1e47i). They are populated by a range of male and female deities who both effectuate practitioners' mantras and personify the physical and mental attributes of their kula leaders. The Ma\u00f1ju\u015briyam\u016blakalpa, perhaps the earliest of these kula-system texts to survive in Sanskrit, characterizes the kula goddesses as female Bodhisattvas who respond to the mantras of their respective families and simultaneously work to establish beings on the path to Enlightenment. This paper focuses on the structure of a specific ma\u1e47\u1e0dala (sacred deity diagram) that encompasses all or most of these three kulas. It examines the ritual functions of a little-studied class of mantra goddesses (vidy\u0101r\u0101j\u00f1\u012bs) including their processes of embodiment, personification, and positioning in relation to their kula leaders and male counterparts (vidy\u0101r\u0101jas). Navigating issues of erosion and absence, my analysis compares cognate forms of this early ma\u1e47\u1e0dala across mediums. Examples include: a stone relief sculpture in situ at the Pandavleni caves in N\u0101sik, Maharashtra (with figures missing), the sole remaining complete redaction of the Sanskrit Ma\u00f1ju\u015briyam\u016blakalpa, and the Mah\u0101vairocana Abhisa\u1e43bodhi Tantra (a text that survives only its Chinese and Tibetan translations). Therefore, within this process of text-image comparison, my study emphasizes methodological points of difficulty due to the decay or erasure of my primary source materials (including lost sections of manuscript, manuscripts no longer extant, and the wearing away of sculptural imagery).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48680624, "asset_id": 28347838, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15184772, "first_name": "Hillary", "last_name": "Langberg", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "HillaryLangberg", "display_name": "Hillary Langberg", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/HillaryLangberg?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15184772/6187748/75036463/s65_hillary.langberg.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6713, "name": "Tantric Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tantric_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7903, "name": "Buddhist Sanskrit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Sanskrit?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 25416, "name": "Archaeology of Ritual and Magic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Ritual_and_Magic?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 68661, "name": "Intersection of Art, Performance, Ritual and Worship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersection_of_Art_Performance_Ritual_and_Worship?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 111232, "name": "Tantric Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tantric_Buddhism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 166758, "name": "Mahayana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mahayana?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 207631, "name": "Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012bm\u016blakalpa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manjusrimulakalpa?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 257250, "name": "Mahayana Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mahayana_Buddhism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 52055363, "title": "Crab-Rangoons in Kyrat: (Re)Writing South-Asian History in Far Cry 4\u2019", "created_at": "2021-09-12T19:05:51.672-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/52055363/Crab_Rangoons_in_Kyrat_Re_Writing_South_Asian_History_in_Far_Cry_4_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_52055363", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 191147, "first_name": "Souvik", "last_name": "Mukherjee", "domain_name": "cssscal", "page_name": "SouvikMukherjee", "display_name": "Souvik Mukherjee", "profile_url": "https://cssscal.academia.edu/SouvikMukherjee?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/191147/46205/42528/s65_souvik.mukherjee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16946, "name": "Nepal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nepal?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33116, "name": "Videogames", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Videogames?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 29385488, "title": "Religion and Orientalism in Asian Studies (Bloomsbury, 2016)", "created_at": "2016-10-24T01:48:14.477-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29385488/Religion_and_Orientalism_in_Asian_Studies_Bloomsbury_2016_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_29385488", "summary": "Religion and Orientalism in Asian Studies analyzes the role of religion in past and present understandings of Asia.

performed a ritual baptism, which became controversial. This article will show how this controversy opens up two significant issues: first, questioning the egalitarian ethos of caste equality upheld by the Sikh religion, and second, with regard to authenticity of religious practice \u2013 of what is deemed Sikh and non/un-Sikh practices. The controversy became the fulcrum for questions of visuality and material practices around imageries of Sikh gurus in the domain of popular religiosity and visual culture. This historically relates to the much-debated status of images around gurus in contemporary Punjab. The image and ritual become a crucial site of conflict with regard to questions of Sikh identity, religion and caste. Questions of iconoclasm, authenticity and representation have emerged around the images\u2014largely audio-visual in nature--of the Sikh gurus. In this article I will analyse music video/s that engages with the genre of Sikhi (Sikh principles or faith) highlighting crisis in Sikh identity through lyrical and visual references, for instance to the institutions of popular religion, such as Deras. I then mainly argue that the DSS event cannot be grasped without understanding the modes of engagement and ritual practices around images of Sikh gurus. Such an analysis will not only underline contestations around the \u2018vexed\u2019 status of images comprising both Sikh and Dera gurus but will also critique the normative understanding of Sikh identity and religion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86109242, "asset_id": 77758293, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 299821, "first_name": "Koonal", "last_name": "Duggal", "domain_name": "edinburgh", "page_name": "KoonalDuggal", "display_name": "Koonal Duggal", "profile_url": "https://edinburgh.academia.edu/KoonalDuggal?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/299821/60609/64245/s65_koonal.duggal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 378, "name": "Area Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Area_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1056, "name": "Popular Music Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1760, "name": "Media Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3141, "name": "Music Video", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_Video?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26049, "name": "Sikh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikh_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 30266, "name": "Religion and Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Popular_Culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 42298, "name": "Film and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 199271, "name": "Punjab Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjab_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 411438, "name": "Popular Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Visual_Culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 971984, "name": "Gurus and Guru Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gurus_and_Guru_Movements?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 50814152, "title": "Beastly identification in India: The government of big cats in the Anthropocene", "created_at": "2021-08-10T02:12:11.356-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50814152/Beastly_identification_in_India_The_government_of_big_cats_in_the_Anthropocene?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_50814152", "summary": "How does a big cat in India come to be identified as the one guilty of preying on humans?

Whilst presenting evidence for a multifaceted \u2018Beijing Strategy\u2019, which aims to counter the US by building an alternative regional order, it also explains Japan\u2019s definitive departure from its limited military role.

The idea of analysing so many distinct insurgencies and counter-insurgency (COIN) campaigns within the covers of a single book is both ambitious and tantalising. Unfortunately, and in spite of occasional good moments, this book provides few of the answers. It has a clunky structure, is peppered with editorial and factual errors and unsupported statements. The British General Templer in Malaya argued that COIN should only be 25% shooting. The remainder should be winning \"hearts and minds\". Sadly this has all too rarely been the case in South Asia where many of the COIN campaigns have been heavy-handed and brutal. Partly this is a function of capability; effective COIN needs excellent intelligence and highly trained and equipped Special Forces. Yet it is interesting to reflect that two \"successful\" COIN operations of recent years; the Indian defeat of the Khalistan movement and President Rajapaksa's suppression of the Tamil Tigers owed little to Templer or the proponents of minimum force", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56087996, "asset_id": 36187636, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3248717, "first_name": "Tim", "last_name": "Willasey-Wilsey", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "TimWilsey", "display_name": "Tim Willasey-Wilsey", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/TimWilsey?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3248717/35046565/30554121/s65_tim.willasey-wilsey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1720, "name": "International Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9451, "name": "Insurgency/Counterinsurgency(COIN)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurgency_Counterinsurgency_COIN_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18082, "name": "Counterterrorism (CT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counterterrorism_CT_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26669, "name": "Counter terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counter_terrorism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 30456, "name": "War on Terror", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_on_Terror?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 42356, "name": "Counterinsurgency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counterinsurgency?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 45146, "name": "Insurgency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurgency?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 761870, "name": "Terrorism and Counterterrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism_and_Counterterrorism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1223682, "name": "Insurgency and counterinsurgency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurgency_and_counterinsurgency?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 75372331, "title": "\"Time to bid goodbye to AFSPA,\" Indian Express, April 4, 2022", "created_at": "2022-04-03T21:53:11.680-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75372331/_Time_to_bid_goodbye_to_AFSPA_Indian_Express_April_4_2022?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_75372331", "summary": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/time-to-bid-goodbye-to-afspa-7851548/\n\nIt's only prudent to repeal this Act now.

The research was conducted by Centre for Social Policy Studies of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and by S.K.H. Lady MacLehose Centre. Our aim was to explore the difficulties faced by the Pakistanis and delineate the macro forces shaping their lives. Through this, we see that ethnicity is one of the key dimensions of social stratification and inequality in contemporary Hong Kong society. We also hope that this research can well serve as a case to illustrate the relationship between ethnicity and social exclusion. \n\nThis research consists of a questionnaire survey and focus group interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted between February and May of 2002. We have completed 200 questionnaires through snowball sampling. The questionnaire covered five broad areas: social activities and friendship, utilization of community resources, work and employment, children's education and sense of belonging to Hong Kong. The part on focus group interviews aims to further explore the complex dynamic of life experiences that could not be described by quantitative data in the survey, as well as to develop recommendations for improving social policy and social services. Two focus groups, with a total of ten male and female participants were conducted at the end of October 2002.\n\nOn social activities, we found that the major activities of the respondents are staying at home, meeting friends and going to worship. Participation in other social activities such as going to see arts and cultural programmes, engaging in sports activities, going to the library, and joining activities in a community centre, is limited. In terms of establishing friendships, most of the respondents interact only with their own people. They reflect that it is difficult to make Hong Kong friends. Cultural and language differences are some of the major barriers to making friends with Hong Kong people and to participating in social activities. \n\nOn housing, a majority of the respondents live in private rental housing. Some of them do not know how to apply for public rental housing and some believe that they are not eligible to apply, even though they are in need. Most of the respondents have had problems in looking for private housing, and identify expensive rent or housing prices as the main one. Some of them say that they have a problem communicating with agents in Cantonese and believe that they are rejected by landlords simply because they are Pakistanis. This shows that some Pakistanis have difficulties gaining access to housing resources, both in the public and private sector. \n\nOn social security resources, in fact, few respondents are receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA). Most of them clearly state that they do not want to depend on the government or do not need to do so. \nAlmost all of the respondents were not engaged in part-time studies or in an employees retraining course. They are discouraged for various reasons, such as high course fees, the fact that the courses are taught in Cantonese, or because they do not know of any educational or social institutes nearby.\n\nOn access to social services and community resources, very few respondents have approached social workers for help on everyday needs; instead they rely almost solely on their family, relatives and friends. Some respondents do not even know of any nearby social service centres and have never brought their children there. Their poor access to various community resources is not only due to language problems, but also because many government departments, educational institutes and social service centres do not target non-Chinese.\n\nOn work and employment, many respondents encounter great difficulties. Twenty-three point nine per cent of the respondents are unemployed. About half of the respondents have been unemployed at some point in the past two years. Most of the employed respondents are engaged in elementary occupations where the working hours are generally very long. The median number of working hours is 60 per week. However, their monthly income is comparatively low. \n\nOn looking for jobs, most respondents identify not knowing Cantonese and low educational qualifications as the major difficulties. It is alarming to learn that about one-third of the respondents claimed that they are rejected because they are Pakistanis. Some employers systematically eliminate them from selection and treat them unfairly at work. In the workplace, the respondents face various difficulties including problems communicating with supervisors and colleagues, bullying by supervisors and colleagues, conflicts due to cultural and/or religious practices, and diverse forms of racial discrimination.\n\nOn children\u2019s education, the respondents encounter various difficulties including unreasonably long waiting times in finding school places, expensive school fees, conflicts due to cultural and/or religious practices, and being rejected because they are Pakistanis. The focus group participants also highlighted problems for Muslims involving food in school canteens and the dress codes of female Pakistani students.\n\nThough they face numerous difficulties in Hong Kong, about half of the respondents like Hong Kong very much and treat the place as their home. However, this does not mean that they enjoy being with Hong Kong people. Some focus group participants also held ambivalent attitudes toward Hong Kong and Hong Kong people.\n\nBased on the problems reflected in the questionnaire survey and the opinions expressed in the focus group interviews, we recommend policy changes in the following areas: employment, housing, and educational services, as well as a review of the policy on granting Hong Kong SAR passports to non-Chinese residents. To improve the general situation, we recommend anti-racial discrimination legislation to protect the right of ethnic minorities, and to promote a policy of multiculturalism in which cultural differences and ethnic diversity are respected. The aim is to build Hong Kong into a just and caring society.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51543093, "asset_id": 31107775, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41717295, "first_name": "Hok Bun", "last_name": "Ku", "domain_name": "cpce-polyu", "page_name": "HokKu", "display_name": "Hok Bun  Ku", "profile_url": "https://cpce-polyu.academia.edu/HokKu?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41717295/11331335/12640951/s65_hok.ku.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25021, "name": "Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 78695418, "title": "The Deities of Others", "created_at": "2022-05-07T11:42:46.743-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78695418/The_Deities_of_Others?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_78695418", "summary": "This is the handout for a presentation I gave  in February of 2020 in Heidelberg at the workshop \"Textual and Visual Sources on Buddhist Meditation: 56 Years after the First Publication of the \u2018Buddhist Yoga Manual.\u2019\" The talk was entitled \"The Deities of Others: Visionary meditation as inter-tradition critique in the Saddharmasm\u1e5btyupasth\u0101na-s\u016btra.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86101083, "asset_id": 78695418, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1604762, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Stuart", "domain_name": "sc", "page_name": "DanielMStuart", "display_name": "Daniel M Stuart", "profile_url": "https://sc.academia.edu/DanielMStuart?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1604762/5136784/35768051/s65_daniel.stuart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1222, "name": "Buddhist Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Philosophy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3515, "name": "Asceticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asceticism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 31699, "name": "Buddhist Sanskrit Manuscripts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Sanskrit_Manuscripts?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 149466, "name": "Visuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visuality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 252092, "name": "Gandhara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gandhara?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 298802, "name": "Buddhist Meditation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Meditation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1222263, "name": "Anthropology of visionary experiences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_visionary_experiences?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 38376975, "title": "Pregnant Males, Barren Mothers, and Religious Transvestism Transcending Gender in the Songs and Practices of \u201cHeterodox\u201d Bengali Lineages", "created_at": "2019-02-18T02:50:49.378-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38376975/Pregnant_Males_Barren_Mothers_and_Religious_Transvestism_Transcending_Gender_in_the_Songs_and_Practices_of_Heterodox_Bengali_Lineages?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_38376975", "summary": "Realizing the constructed nature of gender is often described as a twentieth-century\nWestern phenomenon.

The bracketed [art] in the title of this publication refers to participatory urban aesthetic practices which could include community, social, or relational art initiatives, but also more general claims by city residents, city workers or activists on the visible and sensible aspects of public space. Bracketing the [art] in \u2018participation\u2019 also suggests a blurring of the conventional separation between the aesthetic and the political dimensions of urban participation.\n\nThe publication has two components. The first, is an interactive platform of interviews featuring the praxes of twenty participatory urban practitioners and collectives in the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and New Delhi, India. The interviews map the multiple and disjunctive ways in which \u2018participation\u2019 is enacted\u2014from mobile performances of poetry and theater, to citizen journalism on gentrification in Sao Paulo\u2019s old city center, to radical neighborhood pedagogical initiatives in Savda Ghevra, a New Delhi resettlement colony, and in Grajau, a southern periphery neighborhood of S\u00e3o Paulo. The interviews trace how urban actors create politico-aesthetic ruptures; experience and experiment with the material and affective force of participation; and potentially reshape the urban imaginary. The interviews also speak to the limits of participatory working processes in the face of small budgets and divided spaces. The cities of S\u00e3o Paulo and New Delhi were chosen as sites for this project for the comparisons that their similar size and positions in global urban imaginations and political economy enable, and for the enduring histories of participatory urban activity in both spaces.\n\nA second element of this publication is a peer-reviewed anthology of twenty articles expanding methodological and theoretical debates around the themes of urban participation and its entanglement with state power, aesthetic praxis, racialized and queer spaces, citizenship, temporality, publics, and infrastructure. Contributions to the anthology span a broad range of disciplines and engage research from diverse geographic and temporal sites\u2013from the occupation of a theater in Athens amidst the Greek economic crisis, to agonistic politics and participatory video art in a New Delhi urban village, to the cartographic interventions of a Harlem mailman in Jim Crow-era America.

Of this population, the ten eldest members of each monastery are known as the Da\u015ba Sthavira \u0100jus (Ten Elders of the Highest Esteem). Because of their position, these \u0100jus are the ritual specialists for their communities and serve as exemplars of the monastic ideal in Newar society. This paper explores the ways in which Newar Buddhists at the Kw\u0101 Bah\u0101 monastic complex in Patan, Nepal, utilize ceremonial dress to reinforce their Buddhist identity and publicly reaffirm their ancient Buddhist heritage in Nepal. This study, the first to analyze the \u0100jus\u2019 ceremonial regalia, provides an analysis of the garments, headdresses, and ornaments worn by these figures to explain the ways in which dress embeds Buddhist iconographic symbolism into Newar visual culture. Additionally, this paper demonstrates that the ritual veneration of the \u0100jus gives their regalia agency, reinforcing their public, ritual role as living embodiments of buddhahood.

However, that 75,000 \u2018bar girls\u2019 who danced to Bollywood numbers in beer bars in Mumbai were made redundant in August 2005 following a virulent moral campaign indicates that areas of Bollywood culture exist that are by no means legitimised.

Until now, lists of eighty-four \u0101sana-s have been found in only two recently published yoga texts, namely, the Ha\u1e6dharatn\u0101val\u012b and the Jogaprad\u012bpyak\u0101.  The manuscript evidence presented in this article indicates that these published texts are not isolated accounts of mediaeval yoga systems with many complex \u0101sanas. In fact, it is clear that more than eighty-four \u0101sana-s were practised in some traditions of Ha\u1e6dha Yoga before the British arrived in India.  The majority of these \u0101sana-s were not seated poses, but complex and physically-demanding postures, some of which involved repetitive movement, breath control and the use of ropes.  When the \u0101sana-s in the sources which I shall analyse in this article are considered in their totality, antecedents can be identified for many non-seated and inverted postures in twentieth-century systems of Indian yoga.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57341297, "asset_id": 36193862, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1693590, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Birch", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "jasonbirch", "display_name": "Jason Birch", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/jasonbirch?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1693590/585419/19490315/s65_jason.birch.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4108, "name": "Yoga Meditation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga_Meditation?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 155818, "name": "Hatha Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hatha_Yoga?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 476852, "name": "Yoga Hatha Raja Ha\u1e6dha R\u0101ja Meaning of Hathayoga Rajayoga Medieval Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga_Hatha_Raja_Ha_ha_Raja_Meaning_of_Hathayoga_Rajayoga_Medieval_Yoga?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 855453, "name": "Yoga Asana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga_Asana?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 959279, "name": "Religious Studies /Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies_Indology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 980040, "name": "Modern Yoga Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Yoga_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 39087851, "title": "Terrifying Performances: Black, Brown, Queer Borrowings in Loins of Punjab Presents", "created_at": "2019-05-10T13:49:31.968-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39087851/Terrifying_Performances_Black_Brown_Queer_Borrowings_in_Loins_of_Punjab_Presents?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_39087851", "summary": "Otto and B.D.G., a black and desi gay couple in the film Loins of Punjab Presents (Manish Acharya, 2007), are an exceptional representation of interracial desire in South Asian diasporic cultural production.

This essay explores the unconventional ways through which Otto and B.D.G.\u2019s intimacies are depicted, and analyzes the performance styles they use to express critical perspectives on racism, homophobia, and Islamophobia. I argue that Otto and B.D.G.\u2019s performances offer alternative ways to think through contemporary conversations around cultural appropriation and interracial desire in ways that decenter whiteness or a white desiring subject.

In general terms, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47udharma, apparently dating to roughly the same period, likewise adapts the var\u1e47\u0101\u015brama-dharma of early Dharma\u015b\u0101stra to a sectarian religious orientation \u2014 in this case, Bh\u0101gavata rather than M\u0101he\u015bvara \u2014 but with notably different results. First, where the \u015aivadharma\u015b\u0101stra evidently presupposes the older non-sequential \u0101\u015brama model of the Dharmas\u016btras, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47udharma adopts the sequential model introduced in Manu's code (ca. 200 CE). Whereas the \u015aivadharma redirects the Sm\u0101rta guest-reception rite and madhuparka meal for the benefit of \u015aiva-bhaktas (lay \u015aaivas adhering to a formal vow), no comparable rite appears in the Vi\u1e63\u1e47udharma (where the elements of guest reception appear only as part of the ceremony of worshiping deities or ancient sages). Most notably, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47udharma (especially in chapters 24\u201325, 66, and 105) enters into sectarian polemic against the threat posed in this decadent Kali age by \" heretics \" (p\u0101\u1e63a\u1e47\u1e0das) of many stripes, including Buddhists, Jains, S\u0101\u1e43khyas, skeptics, and false ascetics. Arguments framed in foreign languages (hetuv\u0101dair \u2026 mlecchabh\u0101\u1e63\u0101nibandhai\u1e25) are singled out for condemnation (105.44), and \u015a\u016bdras who become ascetics and go about without caste-markers provoke serious concern. The \u015aivadharma\u015b\u0101stra makes no reference to \" heretics \" (and only the most circumspect allusion to other religious groups), and adopts a more inclusive social policy. In short, the Vi\u1e63\u1e47udharma's conception of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u-bhakti pointedly defends classical Sm\u0101rta status hierarchy and its prerogatives, foregoing the \u015aivadharma's modest moves toward social inclusion. This paper concludes by setting these observations in the context of later trends in the two traditions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79944252, "asset_id": 34404108, "asset_type": "Work",

Parsi Stage is the first comprehensive study of the Parsi theatre, colonial South and Southeast Asia\u2019s most influential cultural phenomenon and the precursor of the Indian cinema industry. By providing extensive, unpublished information on its first actors, audiences, production methods, and plays, this book traces how the theatre\u2014which was one of the first in the Indian subcontinent to adopt European stagecraft\u2014transformed into a pan-Asian entertainment industry in the second half of the nineteenth century. Nicholson sheds light on the motivations that led to the development of the popular, commercial theatre movement in Asia through three areas of investigation: the vernacular public sphere, the emergence of competing visions of nationhood, and the narratological function that women served within a continually shifting socio-political order. The book will be of interest to scholars across several disciplines, including cultural history, gender studies, Victorian studies, the sociology of religion, colonialism, and theatre.",

It was originally excavated in Anur\u00e5dhapura, Sri Lanka, in 1982. Professor S. PADMANABHAN of the Peredenia University, who visited my alma mater (The Tamil University of Thanjavur) a few months ago, gave us a copy of the photo (Fig. 1) which is of great importance for research pertaining to Ardhanari. The most significant feature of the image is that it accommodates the feminine part in its right side. Though the figure under study has been published and discussed around nine times, the identification does not seem to be very apt. Even though ADICEAM (1968) wrote an exhaustive account of Ardhanarisvara, the credit of bringing to scholarly attention the concept of Ardhanari with the breast on the right side as against Ardhanari with the breast on the left side goes to Professor Raju KALIDOS (1992). The report of KALIDOS (1993) was followed by brief notes of his colleagues, GOPALAKRISHNAN (1994-95) and KANDASAMY (1994). \r\nThis article is based on the hypothesis accounted by KALIDOS (1993: 68), \u201cwhen the breast happens to be on the left the emphasis lies on the Male principle and on the Female principle when the breast appears on the right\u201d. The pratimalaksana of the Silpasastras brings Ardhanarisvara under Sivatattvanidhi, thus putting stress on Siva and not on Dev\u00ef. The icon under study is depicted with the breast on the right and so here the androgyne deity is accounted under \u2018she\u2019 and not \u2018he\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30909840, "asset_id": 2955548, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1114764, "first_name": "R.K.K.", "last_name": "Rajarajan", "domain_name": "ruraluniv", "page_name": "RKKRajarajan", "display_name": "R.K.K.

Methodology: Digital databases PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PubMed, JSTOR, Science Direct, Web of sciences, and Google Scholar, were searched from 1990 to 2018 and, six studies were included for the review. Main Findings: Factors like cultural conflict, mental health issues, family relationships, and religious & other social aspects influence suicide in South Asians in the UK. Also, better family contact, culturally sensitive interventions & services, and educational pamphlets could support preventive strategies. Applications of this study: Future research needs to concentrate on the reasons behind high rates of suicide in social class 1 and disaggregation of factors in subgroups of South Asians in the UK to support the development of sound preventive strategies.

It focuses on the intense contestation over the civil-military mix of India\u2019s separation plan, the competition between the Iran\u2013Pakistan\u2013India pipeline and the nuclear deal, the role of retired nuclear scientists, and the issue of liability that has stalled the full implementation of the nuclear deal.The impact of domestic factors on issues ranging from the civil-military status of breeder reactors to the Indian insistence on no restriction on future nuclear testing in the 123 Agreement is also revealed in this book.\nAbout the Author\t\nChaitanya Ravi is an adjunct professor in environmental science and policy and biology at George Mason University, USA.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56363054, "asset_id": 36448204, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 654971, "first_name": "Chaitanya", "last_name": "Ravi", "domain_name": "flameedu", "page_name": "ChaitanyaRavi", "display_name": "Chaitanya Ravi", "profile_url": "https://flameedu.academia.edu/ChaitanyaRavi?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/654971/227102/16177775/s65_chaitanya.ravi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1166342, "name": "Environmental and Energy Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_and_Energy_Policy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28564821, "title": "Common Recruitment Process for Recruitment of Clerical cadre CWE Clerks VI Application Form Print", "created_at": "2016-09-17T22:24:13.215-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28564821/Common_Recruitment_Process_for_Recruitment_of_Clerical_cadre_CWE_Clerks_VI_Application_Form_Print?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_28564821", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48923286, "asset_id": 28564821, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53572992, "first_name": "Prashant", "last_name": "Rajpoot", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RajpootPrashant", "display_name": "Prashant Rajpoot", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RajpootPrashant?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 48978840, "title": "Review of Rafique Afzal's History of The All-India Muslim League, 1906-1947", "created_at": "2021-05-18T23:45:20.648-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48978840/Review_of_Rafique_Afzals_History_of_The_All_India_Muslim_League_1906_1947?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_48978840", "summary": "M.

At nearly 800 pages, the account is also exhaustive and provides a tremendous amount of information about the League, its inner workings, and Jinnah\u2019s leadership. There are three lessons in particular that emerge from the narrative, none of which are particularly flattering to the League. First, the League was, in organizational terms, an inconsequential entity until the 1940s. Second, during its heady ascent in the 1940s as the crisis of British imperial succession deepened, the League was plagued by factionalism and infighting. Third, barely keeping the League in balance was Jinnah and his followers at the central level.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67369332, "asset_id": 48978840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9385643, "first_name": "Ilhan", "last_name": "Niaz", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "IlhanNiaz", "display_name": "Ilhan Niaz", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/IlhanNiaz?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9385643/2994155/55008491/s65_ilhan.niaz.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 37078468, "title": "European Publisher Springer Includes Articles on Allama Mashriqi & Tazkirah in New Encyclopedia", "created_at": "2018-07-19T06:23:32.307-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37078468/European_Publisher_Springer_Includes_Articles_on_Allama_Mashriqi_and_Tazkirah_in_New_Encyclopedia?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_37078468", "summary": "European Publisher Springer Includes \nArticles on Allama Mashriqi & Tazkirah in \nNew Encyclopedia\n\n\n\nSpringer, a globally recognized and well-respected publishing company (originally founded in Germany in 1842), has included articles on Allama Mashriqi and Tazkirah in its recently published Encyclopedia of Indian Religions. The encyclopedia is a comprehensive work comprised of multiple volumes that took over 5 years to produce. The articles on Mashriqi and Tazkirah were written by Mashriqi\u2019s grandson, scholar and historian Nasim Yousaf, and are contained in the volume entitled Islam, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. \n\nSpringer is a renowned international publisher with more than 2,900 journals and 250,000 books covering a range of topics from Astronomy to Computer Science to Social Sciences. Authors and contributors to Springer\u2019s publications include highly accomplished individuals - including Nobel Prize Laureates - across multiple fields. \n\nAbout Allama Mashriqi: Mashriqi was a world-famous mathematician, Islamic scholar, and revolutionary. Mashriqi fought bravely to liberate the Indian sub-continent from British rule. As a student, Mashriqi was a genius who broke academic records at both the University of Punjab and the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom). He later became a Fellow at the most prestigious scholarly societies of Europe and also emerged as one of the most educated politicians of his time. In 1943, Indian writer Hiralal Seth wrote in his book (\u201cThe Khaksar Movement Under Searchlight and the Life Story of its Leader Allama Mashraqi\u201d):\n\n\u201cIn the Indian political field, and in this we include the [Indian National] Congress as well as the [All-India] Muslim League, there is no such leader who has had an exceptionally brilliant academic career. Allama Mashraqi is the only political leader of India who has this distinction.\u201d \n\nA talented leader like him, who completely devoted his life to uniting people regardless of faith and uplifting the masses, is born once in centuries.\n\nAbout Tazkirah: Tazkirah, authored by Mashriqi, interprets the Holy Quran from a scientific perspective. While writing this book, Mashriqi used his vast multi-disciplinary knowledge of Islam and other religions, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Mechanical Sciences, and Oriental languages (now commonly known as Asian languages). The book drew tremendous interest from both the East and the West. In 1925, intellectuals and famous personalities from British India and Europe nominated Tazkirah for the Nobel Prize in Literature. These men included Sahibzada Aftab Ahmed Khan (Vice Chancellor of Aligarh University), Sir Abdul Qadir, Sir Fazal Hussain, Professor Maison of France, and Dr. Sohaddon (Professor of Geography). Distinguished Professor Reynold Alleyne Nicholson of the University of Cambridge also translated Tazkirah and sent a copy to Mashriqi.\n\nAbout the Author: Scholar and historian Nasim Yousaf, who lives in the USA, has been conducting research on South Asian history for approximately two decades. During this time, his works have been published in books, prestigious academic journals and encyclopedias, and in newspapers around the world. Among his most valuable contributions is a digital compilation of Allama Mashriqi\u2019s historic weekly newspaper, Al-Islah. His books are available in renowned research libraries across multiple continents (from Asia to Africa to Europe to the Americas), including the Library of Congress, Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, Stanford, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, McGill, Cambridge, Oxford, SOAS, and the National Libraries of Australia, Scotland, and Sweden.

It was great to hear you to commit that \"We Indians are proud of our diversity.\" While specially addressing the Muslim youth of India you were kind enough to advise them to hold Quran in one hand and computer in the other for an all-inclusive progress and welfare.

This paper builds a new set of relationships between these variables. This chapter describes the welfare levels of construction workers and their way of managing living standards in the expansive economy during the 1860s. It contends that the existing thesis \u2013 that real wages and living standards grew in both Britain and India in the modernisation 19th-century- needs to be reassessed. Additionally, it juxtaposes workers\u2019 gains in wage income and bargaining power with their painful struggles at coming to terms with the unfavourable living standards. Consequently, the paper qualifies the growth in real wages of construction workers in the Deccan by laying out the following: The subsistence ratio of manual workers, however, mostly remained below the unity of one: their earning fell short of the cost of family subsistence. The living standards of workers in India were lower in comparison with their counterparts in Britain. The labouring poor secured the essential family consumption by increasing the supply of family labour on the labour market and agitating for wage revision. Here, women and boy coolies were far from receiving a wage rise comparable to their male counterparts. The labouring poor adopted strategies to come to terms with the meagre ratio of family subsistence. They calibrated the budget of household, thus maintaining the low levels of comfort itself. To meet the pressure of depressed living and deprivation, they entered in the labour dependency grounded on the payment of advance and loan in return of the continuous supply of labour efforts to employers. This kind of economic transaction and attendant labour institution cast an adverse impact on mobility and welfare outcome available to working peoples. It is equally noticeable in this study that the working families who collectively earned more than their subsistence wage, kept themselves from the vicious cycle of attached labour, indebtedness and low welfare levels. Thus, wokers frequently took loans and advance; as soon as possible they sought to get rid of such dependencies that limited their mobility in the labour market and their liberty at large.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79527095, "asset_id": 69422066, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 228766, "first_name": "Dhiraj Kumar", "last_name": "Nite", "domain_name": "aud-in", "page_name": "DhirajKumarNite", "display_name": "Dhiraj Kumar Nite", "profile_url": "https://aud-in.academia.edu/DhirajKumarNite?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/228766/144385/49361167/s65_dhiraj_kumar.nite.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3105, "name": "Construction Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Construction_Management?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15264, "name": "Work and Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Work_and_Labour?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 36725, "name": "Wellbeing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wellbeing?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 151327, "name": "Work and Wages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Work_and_Wages?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 41468038, "title": "Why is this Happening with Chris Hayes text+podcast", "created_at": "2019-12-30T16:56:27.503-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41468038/Why_is_this_Happening_with_Chris_Hayes_text_podcast?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_41468038", "summary": "View Online (Text and Podcast): https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/contextualizing-lockdown-kashmir-hafsa-kanjwal-podcast-transcript-ncna1069986", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61642043, "asset_id": 41468038, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24389132, "first_name": "Hafsa", "last_name": "Kanjwal", "domain_name": "lafayette", "page_name": "HafsaKanjwal", "display_name": "Hafsa Kanjwal", "profile_url": "https://lafayette.academia.edu/HafsaKanjwal?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24389132/6580164/17242886/s65_hafsa.kanjwal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55927, "name": "Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 137148, "name": "Podcast", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Podcast?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 38919810, "title": "Video: Naturgem\u00e4lde, Kulturforschung, Kolonialprogramm: die Reisen der Br\u00fcder Schlagintweit in Indien und dem Himalaya.

The main research method employed is historic one that puts all the events into the system of causes and consequences. The author finds the roots of present political instability in the ambiguous nature of Bangladesh and the conflict of the secular and the religious in its base. Bangladesh is the product of na-tionalist secession from the Islamic state of Pakistan while Pakistan is the result of Islamist secession from India.

These non-traditional threats come in the form of terrorism, extremism, drug trafficking, serious communicable diseases, piracy, illegal immigration, environmental security, economic and financial security, and information security. The aim of this paper is to highlight the areas that are critical to Pakistan's internal security and to evaluate the level of understanding of these threats and to assess the effectiveness of the measures to check these threats, to develop an academic discourse for finding ways and means to address these national security threats. Pakistan is a culturally and ethnically diverse country where a number of issues remain unresolved, thus making room for centrifugal forces for their dissenting activities against the federation. Pakistan has more internal threats than external. Some of the threats that Pakistan is facing today internally make it vulnerable for a sustainable socio-political and economic development. The internal threats to Pakistan's security are many as observed today but it is quite reassuring to note that none of these is insurmountable. The present scene in the first view appears quite disturbing but a careful examination would reveal that there are strong possibilities of curing the ailment. The internal landscape is galore with strife and scuffle but there is a need to make a careful distinction between the threats having indigenous origins and those driven internationally. Pakistan at the moment does not paint a happy picture of its internal scene. A number of internal threats have emerged posing serious challenges to the security of Pakistan. Terrorism, religious extremism, sectarianism, looming energy crisis, impending economic crisis, endemic diseases, insurgency in Balochistan, food shortages and institutional dead locks are a part of the long list. The situation in the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan although quite disturbing cannot be exactly described or categorized as internal threat. It has clear linkages with the war on terror involving many international actors. Insurgency Purely on the domestic front, the most serious threat emanates from the armed resistance by the disgruntled elements in the province of Balochistan and some settled districts of the former civil division of Swat. These threats are very real, though a few years ago when pointed out by the academia were treated as hypothetical by the decision makers. For several years now, the revolts by dissidents against the government are going on in Balochistan.

The problems of irreducibility, untranslatability, non-generalized existence of language are there as there persists always something irreducible in the interactions between the self and the other.

To account for econometric concerns of auto-correlation and heteroskedasticity, random effects with generalized least squares is used for estimation. The effect of tourism on national income is found positive. Results reveal a significant relation between national income and tourism.

It interrogates the past which materialises through multi-layered narratives on monuments and other objects that sustain cultural diversity. It seeks to understand how interpretations of \" monuments \" as \" texts \" are affected at the local level of experience, even as institutions such as UNESCO work to globalise and fi x constructs of stable and universal heritage. Shifting away from a largely Eurocentric concept associated with architecture and monumental archaeology, this book reassesses how local and regional heritage needs to be balanced with the global and transnational. It argues that material objects and monuments are not static embodiments of culture but are, rather, a medium through which identity, power and society are produced and reproduced. This is especially relevant in South and Southeast Asian contexts, where debates over heritage often have local, regional and national political implications and consequences. Reevaluating traditional valuation of monuments and cultural landscapes could help aid sustainability and long-term preservation of the heritage, this book will be useful for scholars and researchers of history, South and Southeast Asian history, heritage studies, archaeology, cultural studies, tourism studies and political history as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57392236, "asset_id": 37427011, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 675052, "name": "UNESCO world heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UNESCO_world_heritage?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 25946603, "title": "Water in British India: The Making of a 'Colonial Hydrology'", "created_at": "2016-06-07T01:09:59.358-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25946603/Water_in_British_India_The_Making_of_a_Colonial_Hydrology?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_25946603", "summary": "The environmental history of India has moved on and considerably broadened since the first studies of Indian forestry were published. This essay surveys studies on water in British India, which it has clustered into three themes. While providing a rough description of some of the most important debates and discussions on the issue of colonial rule and its hydraulic interventions, the essay argues that interest on the subject must now attempt to pursue grand questions as well. Towards to this end, it is argued that much insight and theoretical traction may be gained from pursuing the conceptual notion of a 'colonial hydrology': the attempt to characterise the British experience as comprising an altogether distinct paradigm for hydraulic interventions. Water in British India can be discussed in three overlapping but discrete clusters of concerns. The first and most substantially engaged debates have situated colonial irrigation strategies in terms of their environmental, political and economic contexts. The second cluster, closely shadowing the first, has explored aspects of 'decline', elimination and sometimes appropriation of a slew of 'traditional' water harvesting technologies. The third cluster of concerns, that is yet to achieve visibility, has aimed at identifying definitive patterns in colonial strategies towards hydraulic endowments. Put differently, the attempt is to characterise the British experience as comprising an altogether distinct paradigm for hydraulic interventions in South Asia; explanations that can perhaps be encapsulated under the broad rubric of 'colonial hydrology'. Part of this as yet incipient exercise involves, in my opinion, a departure from the emphasis on irrigation. In turn, this third cluster will explore colonial experiences with floods, drainage, wetlands, lakes, inland river navigation, traditional fisheries, urban water supply, water legislation, cultures of water use, ideologies on 'river-improvement' and Multipurpose River Valley development. In several ways, these themes listed above (indicative and not exhaustive), could then, presumably, help fill in many existing empirical gaps and thereby craft a rigorous theoretical approach to explore the relationship between colonialism and water. By a theoretical approach, I suggest that the subject of water in British India should, similar to works on forests or land policies, be able to shed light on", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46301992, "asset_id": 25946603, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29940726, "first_name": "Rohan", "last_name": "D'Souza", "domain_name": "kyoto-u", "page_name": "RohanDSouza", "display_name": "Rohan D'Souza", "profile_url": "https://kyoto-u.academia.edu/RohanDSouza?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29940726/105380745/94579845/s65_rohan.d_souza.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3126, "name": "Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4526, "name": "Water resources", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_resources?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 35420603, "title": "Review of Valuing Deaf Worlds in Urban India by Michele Friedner", "created_at": "2017-12-13T07:34:17.839-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35420603/Review_of_Valuing_Deaf_Worlds_in_Urban_India_by_Michele_Friedner?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35420603", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55281279, "asset_id": 35420603, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 761991, "first_name": "Erika", "last_name": "Hoffmann-Dilloway", "domain_name": "oberlin", "page_name": "ErikaHoffmannDilloway", "display_name": "Erika Hoffmann-Dilloway", "profile_url": "https://oberlin.academia.edu/ErikaHoffmannDilloway?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/761991/258499/17200915/s65_erika.hoffmann-dilloway.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2174, "name": "Deaf studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deaf_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 4213051, "title": "2003 Bernard Pot, Philippines\u00a0: bibliographie th\u00e9matique en fran\u00e7ais annot\u00e9e et comment\u00e9e, 180 p., 5 illustrations", "created_at": "2013-08-10T17:50:35.919-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4213051/2003_Bernard_Pot_Philippines_bibliographie_th%C3%A9matique_en_fran%C3%A7ais_annot%C3%A9e_et_comment%C3%A9e_180_p_5_illustrations?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_4213051", "summary": "Les ouvrages en fran\u00e7ais sur les Philippines sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00e0 tort peu nombreux.

I argue that the new jugaad innovation narrative offers an uplifting, potentially emancipatory discourse of mobility in a setting where even after two decades of economic reforms wealth gap and poverty stubbornly persists. Central to this shift are two processes. First, a dramatic re-signification of the aam aadmi, within a new conceptual scaffolding of India in relation to modern science and technology where the ability to innovate is portrayed as a natural gift, a deeply ingrained collective Indian trait that even the unlettered common man possesses. Second, the conditions of adversity and absence of public services for Indian citizens is turned on its head to position India as an ideal laboratory condition within which a culture of innovation takes birth. In short, jugaad enables dramatic transformation of what was once considered unchanging, static and immobile mass into a source of innovation, inspiration and ultimately socioeconomic mobility.

exploration in understanding how women home-based workers (HBWs) in South Asia have been affected by the threat and spread of COVID-19, how they are coping, and what might be needed in the near- and long-term futures to help them recover and become resilient to future shocks.  Since early 2020, the rapid and persistence spread of COVID-19 has led to a frenzy of countermeasures, completely slowing down the regular routine of people and businesses, stalling economic activity, and severely limiting movement of goods and people globally. South Asian women HBWs, already on a lower rung of the economic ladder, have suffered enormously. A sudden loss in work and earnings along with mobility restrictions resulted in a food crisis for these women and their families.  Seventy-five per cent of respondents had no work at all during the peak lockdown period of April-May 2020. Earnings dropped to less than 10 per cent of those in the pre-crisis period in six locations, while in another three locations earnings were between 10 and 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels. In July 2020, 92 per cent of respondents reported lower household income when compared to the pre-crisis levels, and 23 per cent of families were still earning nothing at all. In addition, women\u2019s household responsibilities rose sharply.  \n\nThe limited and uneven government relief couldn\u2019t help women HBWs significantly, which exposed structural weaknesses in national social protection systems. Close to 60 per cent of respondents reported receiving neither cash nor food from government. The general absence of identification of HBWs in national registers made it hard for any relief effort to be targeted specifically towards them.  However, collectives of women HBWs shone in rushing to mitigate the consequences of the crisis for their members. Without the role that organizations and networks of HBWs played in helping facilitate access to supports, far fewer HBWs and their families would have received government cash and food assistance.  \n\nAs relief fell short of covering their essential needs, over 82 per cent of women HBWs had to draw down on savings, sell or pawn assets, and borrow simply to survive increasing their vulnerability to any future shock. \n\nThough earnings have started to recover\u2014in seven study locations they had risen to between 12 and 30 per cent of pre-crisis earnings in August\u2014the relaxation of in-country mobility restrictions and the resulting spike in COVID-19 case incidence has kept stress levels high with little certainty on recovering income loss. Markets remain diminished and current expectations about \u201creturn to normal\u201d are hinged on the still uncertain availability of a vaccine.

Yet even while pointing to an apparent crisis in multiculturalism, the text of the apology, which is analyzed here, does not put the Canadian state\u2019s official multiculturalism policy into question. In seeking to offer redress, the official apology in effect functions as a tool of the state to manage the grief and grievance of racialized minorities, even as the state works toward increased surveillance of racialized minorities. Reading the apology in conjunction with two fictional remembrances of the Air India bombings, Bharati Mukherjee\u2019s 1988 short story \u201cThe Management of Grief\u201d and Anita Rau Badami\u2019s 2006 novel Can You Hear the Nightbird Call? , this essay addresses the politics of official apology/official multiculturalism.

It will explore the internal and external challenges to the relationship, especially the role of US and India. I will also analyze the options available to the two partners for improving their relationship in order to enhance its efficacy and durability. Pakistan is an Islamic country which has been influenced by the U.S. preventing the free development of her society and stabbing her political autonomy. India on the other hand is increasing her influence in the South Asian security complex by making relations with the western neighbours of Pakistan. The Indo-US strategic partnership is also polarizing the balance of power in Indian favour thus sandwiching Pakistan on the east and west and seriously jeopardizing the external security milieu of Pakistan. This paper analyzes Pakistan-Iran relationship in the context of this web of relations among the contending and cooperating powers. Introduction The border between Iran and Pakistan is the border between the Iran and Pakistan. It extends from the Indian Ocean to the south east of the Gulf of Oman, to the border triangle with the Afghanistan to the north. It crosses the historical region of Balochistan, separated between the three neighbouring States in the second half of the sixth century. At the time, the border is drawn between Persia and the British Raj. The current border regions are the Sistan and Balochistan in Iran and Baluchistan in Pakistan (Bowen, & Kidd, 2004).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56734636, "asset_id": 36786959, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 82170625, "first_name": "Manzoor", "last_name": "Ahmad", "domain_name": "awkum", "page_name": "ManzoorAhmad", "display_name": "Manzoor Ahmad", "profile_url": "https://awkum.academia.edu/ManzoorAhmad?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82170625/19876514/19692411/s65_manzoor.ahmad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43520, "name": "Middle East", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 422999, "title": "Originile monahismului oriental.

"summary": "Arundhati Roy\u2019s The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (2017) is set in India in the\nperiod spanning the 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century. It focuses on\nmany instances of state-induced violence in these times like the Gujarat pogroms in 2002, the violence in Kashmir under Indian occupation, and the aggressive snubbing of Maoists in Andhra Pradesh\u2014instances that influence the lives of the characters in many ways.\nWhile there has been considerable hesitation in the popular discourse on labelling\nHindutva politics as \u2018fascist\u2019, a host of scholarships acknowledge the legitimacy of the\nterm \u2018fascism\u2019 for Hindu nationalist state politics. Anti-fascist resistance can be taken as a lens for examining protests, organizations, and movements on a large number of issues affected by authoritarian state policies that privileges only certain social groups\u2014casteism, Islamophobia, violence on LGBTQ+ community, and so on. These issues also vary in their nature according to geographical contexts in India. I am concerned in this paper with affective anti-fascist resistance by women on problems concerning hijras and Muslims in Delhi and Gujarat and Maoists in Andhra Pradesh\u2014social and geographical coordinates that are relevant in exploring the personal documents of Anjum and Revathy.\nThe questions I want to explore in this paper are: How do the two women characters,\nAnjum and Revathy, resist fascist master narratives through affects? In what ways do\ntheir personal documents function as counter-narratives in this resistance? Through my paper, I shall contribute to the discourse on anti-fascism in India and its intersections with gender and affect studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67797270, "asset_id": 49447779, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58983912, "first_name": "Pujarinee", "last_name": "Mitra", "domain_name": "tamu", "page_name": "PujarineeMitra", "display_name": "Pujarinee Mitra", "profile_url": "https://tamu.academia.edu/PujarineeMitra?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58983912/25816024/47253607/s65_pujarinee.mitra.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17330, "name": "Affect Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Theory?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 800082, "name": "Anti Fascism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti_Fascism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 45594785, "title": "Methods, Moments, and Ethnographic Spaces in Asia (forthcoming April)", "created_at": "2021-03-22T07:11:51.631-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45594785/Methods_Moments_and_Ethnographic_Spaces_in_Asia_forthcoming_April_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_45594785", "summary": "Asia is changing. Socio-political shifts in the world economy, technological advances of monumental scales, movements of people and ideas, alongside ongoing post-colonization projects across the region have created an emerging Asia \u2013 one confident and assertive of its place in the contemporary geopolitical sphere. As political and economic powers reassert Asian sovereignty in opposition to perceived Northern dominance, and dramatic and rapid development in the region shift the relationship between the centre and the periphery, new renderings and imaginations of hierarchies of identity and power come to the fore. This changing environment leads to emerging challenges for anthropologists working in the region: both those who have been working there for years, and new scholars entering the field.\n\nThis volume considers these changes, and the implications of this on our practice. By focusing on Asia as a site of enquiry, the contributors to this book discuss tensions and opportunities arising in their ethnographic fieldwork in light of a changing Asia. Drawing on personal reflections on Asia\u2019s global positioning in this contemporary moment, the contributors consider how fieldwork is being negotiated within the changing dynamics of anthropology in the region. This book then, is a discussion on the shifting landscape of field sites and the resultant emerging research methodologies, and is aimed at those who are already deeply immersed in fieldwork as well as those who are seeking ways to undertake it.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66076698, "asset_id": 45594785, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 497627, "first_name": "Caroline", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "CarolineBennett", "display_name": "Caroline  Bennett", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/CarolineBennett?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/497627/11493965/12819856/s65_caroline.bennett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 378, "name": "Area Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Area_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4924, "name": "Fieldwork in Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fieldwork_in_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6032, "name": "Central Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 25289, "name": "Ethnographic Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnographic_Methods?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43707, "name": "Fieldwork", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fieldwork?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 55047, "name": "Ethnographic Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnographic_Research?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 112734, "name": "Asia as method", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asia_as_method?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 44381823, "title": "R\u00e1\u0155h -The Cradle of Civilization, Part 3", "created_at": "2020-10-27T11:28:04.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44381823/R%C3%A1%C5%95h_The_Cradle_of_Civilization_Part_3?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_44381823", "summary": "P. R. Sarkar described R\u00e1\u0155h, an ancient land in eastern India, as the \u201cCradle of Civilization\u201d. He claimed that it is one of the areas where human beings first appeared on Earth. Bengali, or B\u00e1\u1e3fl\u00e1, which has come from the P\u00farvii Ardha-M\u00e1gadhii language, is the language of R\u00e1\u0155h today. Within Bengali there are twelve main dialects, which are listed in the article.  R\u00e1\u0155h\u2019s dialects include Mid-R\u00e1\u0155hii B\u00e1\u1e3fl\u00e1, Kolkata B\u00e1\u1e3fl\u00e1 and several other dialects or sub-dialects. Because of the high percentage (92%) of Sanskrit-related words in the \u201ccolloquial language of the remote outpost of R\u00e1\u0155h\u201d, P. R. Sarkar suggests that Sanskrit had almost no relation with the influx of the Aryans into India, nor is Sanskrit of foreign origin. This article contains Chapters 19-28 of his book R\u00e1\u0155h\u2014The Cradle of Civilization plus a short article on the history and dialect of R\u00e1\u0155h.  P. R. Sarkar (also known as Shrii Shrii Anandamurti) (1922-1990), was the spiritual guru of Ananda Marga and a self-described master of all languages \u2013 Richard Gauthier, Santa Rosa, California, October 26, 2020.

The forest, or the \u2018waste-land\u2019, separates the shepherds from the settled communities that they interact with across the altitudinal landscape. The forest is also a dominant cultural \u2018space\u2019 in which the variegated ethos, imbibed over centuries of interaction with the \u2018settled communities\u2019, is processed to impart a new meaning to the universe of the shepherds. This is an enchanted universe where birds speak, animals help and humans are transformed, to evoke in \u2018us\u2019 the sense of the \u2018miraculous\u2019 and the \u2018marvellous\u2019. In this world, the grotesque and sublime merge into each other and conjure a unique cosmology where the sense of wonder is heightened by the \u2018super-natural\u2019 that fashions a new myth. The vibrancy of struggle between  \u2018settlement\u2019 and \u2018nomadism\u2019 is reflected in the folk-imaginary, where the \u2018elements\u2019, animals and humans  play a role in attempting to create a \u2018just-society\u2019. This is illustrated through folktales, two of which have been translated and presented here, popular among the shepherds of Chamba in Himachal Pradesh.

[...] From the early nineteenth century onwards, the domestic relations in British households in colonial India, including family and work relations, were reformed, and transformed though public debate, legislation, and, as I will show, through the powerful intervention of public schooling. The explicit agenda of many schools for the poor in the early nineteenth century, in Britain and its Empire, was 'to furnish the inferior orders with such instruction, and such only, as will be calculated to render them useful members of society, in the humble rank in which it has pleased providence to place them.' In the colonial context, the destined place of the urban poor, who shared religious, and \u2013 to some extent \u2013 ethnic ties with colonial masters and memsahibs was, so to speak, at their service. It was in public disciplinary institutions, that the future servants not only learned their place, but also acquired the orderly habits and useful skills which made them preferable candidates for European employers.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62001490, "asset_id": 41442630, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12265490, "first_name": "Jana", "last_name": "Tschurenev", "domain_name": "xn--uni-gttingen-8ib", "page_name": "JanaTschurenev", "display_name": "Jana Tschurenev", "profile_url": "https://xn--uni-gttingen-8ib.academia.edu/JanaTschurenev?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12265490/5127482/57904148/s65_jana.tschurenev.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6464, "name": "British Imperial & Commonwelath History - 19th & 20th century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Commonwelath_History_-_19th_and_20th_century?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 127636, "name": "History of domestic service", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_domestic_service?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 165254, "name": "Domestic Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Labour?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 544175, "name": "History of Indian Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Indian_Education?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 575856, "name": "Global Labour History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Labour_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 642579, "name": "Domestic Servants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Servants?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 989609, "name": "Women's Labor History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Labor_History?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 36940408, "title": "Form19 (2)", "created_at": "2018-06-29T02:16:58.226-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36940408/Form19_2_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_36940408", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56890738, "asset_id": 36940408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83624127, "first_name": "jayesh", "last_name": "kumar", "domain_name": "srapcollege", "page_name": "jayeshkumar", "display_name": "jayesh kumar", "profile_url": "https://srapcollege.academia.edu/jayeshkumar?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26, "name": "Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 35098724, "title": "COMMON GROUND #3 Where the Circles Intersect", "created_at": "2017-11-09T06:15:17.202-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35098724/COMMON_GROUND_3_Where_the_Circles_Intersect?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35098724", "summary": "The exhibition COMMON GROUND #3 brings together the works of six artists who call different places on the Indian subcontinent their home \u2013 or one of many homes: Yogesh Barve, Ragini Bhow, Nihaal Faizal, Oliver Husain, Poonam Jain and Tara Kelton. It explores the concept of \u201ccommon ground\u201d as a space of shared knowledge and basis for common understanding. The focus is on the familiar: in their works, the artists deal with the universal topic of \u201chome\u201d and play with memories of everyday situations and familiar objects from domestic life. The artists investigate constructions of privacy, home and how the medium of script may create a sense of community.\n\nThe question of \u201ecommon ground\u201c means the discursive act and the negotiation of a common knowledge space. The knowledge space that comes into being inside Kleine Humboldt Galerie brings together Hum- boldt University\u2019s institute of South Asian Studies and the institute of Art History and Visual Studies, to approach the phenomenon of the spatial turn. The advent of the digital era, with its worldwide networks, has called for a rethinking of the spatial context of artworks and their presentation. How can contemporary art be described outside the construction of national art histories, and the dichotomy of centre and periphery? How can new relationships between the local and the global be understood in times of migrating artworks and artists? How can one look at art from a translocal perspective? These questions were raised and examined in the exhibition and in the comprehensive accompanying programme.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54959879, "asset_id": 35098724, "asset_type": "Work",

Prominent observers of the global economy swiftly proclaimed the \u201cend of neoliberalism\u201d after the global economic crisis of 2008. This paper shares the experiences of two Indian ngos participating\nin a multiple-stakeholder pro-poor urban electrification programme that was designed to demonstrate a viable alternative to neoliberal models of basic service provision.\nBy 2008, close to 100,000 homes had been electrified in the city of Ahmedabad and the programme is currently being replicated in smaller cities in Gujarat and in the neighbouring state of Rajasthan. The broader findings from this research suggest that the news of neoliberalism\u2019s demise may be greatly exaggerated. The \u201calternative\u201d practices and strategies that have emerged more recently, such as the ones documented in\nthis article, may challenge certain aspects of neoliberal thinking even as they reconfigure and recalibrate others. Although this case study cannot in any way enable us to gauge if India is moving toward \u201cpost-neoliberalism\u201d, it does highlight the importance of documenting and understanding sub-national scales and actors in experimenting with and testing alternatives to market-based solutions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36575593, "asset_id": 10650070, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 92950, "first_name": "Bipasha", "last_name": "Baruah", "domain_name": "westernu", "page_name": "BipashaBaruah", "display_name": "Bipasha Baruah", "profile_url": "https://westernu.academia.edu/BipashaBaruah?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/92950/101855/42684947/s65_bipasha.baruah.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6656, "name": "Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non-Governmental_Organizations_NGOs_?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14084, "name": "Energy and Environment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Energy_and_Environment?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 78898832, "title": "Folktales and Printed Translations Across the Indian Subcontinent: The Travelling Tales of Niret Guru", "created_at": "2022-05-09T20:26:20.153-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78898832/Folktales_and_Printed_Translations_Across_the_Indian_Subcontinent_The_Travelling_Tales_of_Niret_Guru?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_78898832", "summary": "Folktales from across the Indian subcontinent have various interpretations about the structure of \u201cniti\u201d (conduct) reflected in them. The Sanskrit term niti is also a part of the regular vocabulary of almost all the languages of the Indian subcontinent, including Hindi, Sinhala, Nepali, Bengali, Tamil, and Assamese (amidst others), and can be translated as morality, correct behavioral conduct, or the rules of conduct. The notion of niti is reflected across many genres of folklore, including fables, rhymes, poems or chhara, songs, ballads, myths, and legends. It is mostly expressed through the primary emotions of jest, wit or humor, anxiety, apprehension and fear, hatred and jealousy, and sadness. A popular storyline in the region and across almost all forms of folklore is that of the \u201cfoolish\u201d teacher and his small group of followers. The original stories are centered around a teacher \u2013 Gooroo Noodle from the folktales of South India \u2013 which was written and published by Italian missionary in Chennai in the mid-eighteenth century. Within a few decades, the popularity of the Tamil book encouraged several translations. It was first translated into English by Benjamin Babington (1915), and, soon after, this led to translations into other regional languages of the region. Thus, it became Niret Gurur Kahini (The Story of Niret Guru) in Bengali and Mahadaenamutta Sinhala Katandara (The Stories of L. Maitra Bajpai (*) Symbiosis International University, Pune, India e-mail: lopamudramaitra@gmail.com \u00a9 Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 S. D. Brunn, R. Kehrein (eds.), Handbook of the Changing World Language Map, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73400-2_158-1 1 Mahadana Muththa) in Sinhala. Thus, this particular erudite teacher came to be known through his many names across the Indian subcontinent. He is known as Mahadana Muththa in Sri Lanka; Guru Paramartan, Gooroo Noodle, and Guru Simpleton across Southern and Southeastern India; and Niret Guru in and around and beyond Bengal in Eastern India. Having their origin in the folklore of Southern India, the set of stories travelled across the region and moved south and reached the shores of Sri Lanka. The stories also travelled north and moved through southeastern parts of the Indian subcontinent toward Eastern and Northeastern India. This is a story of a simpleton \u2013 a foolish teacher \u2013 who sets out to find a few students as he feels he has too much of knowledge to share. Thus, he manages to find five ardent and devoted students. The rest of the stories revolve around the many lessons that the Guru teaches these five followers; until 1 day, because of the foolishness of the students, the Guru dies. Thus, this ends the stories of the Guru and his disciples. These texts helped to create a platform of interaction between the literature of the dialects and many other mother tongues and the printed word of the English language. On the other hand, the initial text in Tamil and the subsequent prints in other regional languages also helped to initiate an important era of translations from the English language. At present, most of these versions are out of print, though the main stories live on through various forms of digital media, including animation shorts. The stories of Gooroo Noodle, Niret Guru, or Mahadana Muththa are still popular across time and media and methods of communication.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 331860, "first_name": "Dr. Lopamudra Maitra", "last_name": "Bajpai (she/her)", "domain_name": "nujs", "page_name": "DrLopamudraMaitraBajpaisheher", "display_name": "Dr. Lopamudra Maitra Bajpai (she/her)", "profile_url": "https://nujs.academia.edu/DrLopamudraMaitraBajpaisheher?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/331860/92428/19639629/s65_dr._lopamudra_maitra.bajpai.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 787, "name": "Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Folklore?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68179, "name": "Sri Lankan literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80932, "name": "Indian Oral Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Oral_Traditions?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 132813, "name": "Indian Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Folklore?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 176715, "name": "SAARC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SAARC?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 66721179, "title": "Dative subjects and the notion of subject", "created_at": "2021-12-31T08:30:42.640-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66721179/Dative_subjects_and_the_notion_of_subject?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_66721179", "summary": "The status of basic grammatical relations such as &#x27;subject-of&#x27;has been a matter of some controversy in current linguistic theory.

The traumatic suffering, the human rights abuses against the Bangladeshis, and their revolt against the Pakistani army were the subject of numerous documentary films during the period. Local and international film makers recorded the unfolding events of the war. Scrutinizing the interests and perspectives of different directors both from the local and the international arena, this paper considers how wartime films tackled and negotiated the issues of atrocity, memory, and witness. In addition, I closely analyze the film Stop Genocide (1971) by the Bangladeshi film director, Zahir Raihan (1935-72). Stop Genocide is acclaimed as the most authentic and influential visual text in shaping the cultural memories of the war. Along with its third cinema aesthetics, I look at its re-inscription of gender stereotypes of nationalist struggle. I also pay attention to the complex relationship between language, culture, ethics, identity, and other discourses related to violence and suffering.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45458525, "asset_id": 21002743, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 41958423, "asset_id": 21002743, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8779347, "first_name": "Fahmida", "last_name": "Akhter", "domain_name": "juniv", "page_name": "FahmidaAkhter", "display_name": "Fahmida  Akhter", "profile_url": "https://juniv.academia.edu/FahmidaAkhter?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8779347/10401139/17547634/s65_fahmida.akhter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3399, "name": "Documentary (Film Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film_Studies_?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6118, "name": "Women and War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_War_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12985, "name": "War Films", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Films?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 23214, "name": "Documentary Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 27813, "name": "History and film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_film?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 146907, "name": "Cultural Memory (especially in Relation to Cinema And/or Photography), Cinema/cultural Experience and Psychoanalytic Theory, Film History; Photography and Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory_especially_in_Relation_to_Cinema_And_or_Photography_Cinema_cultural_Experience_an?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 612928, "name": "South Asian Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Film_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1438181, "name": "Film In Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_In_Bangladesh?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 68583311, "title": "KASHMIR: A Conflict between India and Pakistan", "created_at": "2022-01-17T23:47:58.173-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68583311/KASHMIR_A_Conflict_between_India_and_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_68583311", "summary": "IntroductionIndia&#39;s efforts to integrate Kashmir into Indian Union did not succeed because the major Kashmiri leaders and parties resisted these efforts.

Privatisation, informality and state fragmentation are key aspects of these processes within which urban ethnographers seek to make sense of everyday urban life and practices. As urban researchers in Asian contexts, we also have to negotiate the tension between western-centric urban orientations and local practices that never quite seem to fit or come up to global aspirations and ambitions for city building. These aspirations are also predicated upon reified categories of state and nationhood as well as history which are often unsettled during ethnographic work. In order to understand the challenges posed by such a field, I examine the processes and practices of ethnographic fieldwork in terms of what they reveal about the nature of the present urban conjuncture in Karachi and it\u2019s relation to the wider region that is Asia. Central to this examination are questions of positionality, identity, reflexivity and orientation. I examine these aspects of field research as constantly shifting concepts that are interrogated and challenged during the process of fieldwork and that are related to the social and economic pressures that are driving Asian urbanisms at large.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67712388, "asset_id": 49337961, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11822993, "first_name": "Sarwat", "last_name": "Viqar", "domain_name": "johnabbott", "page_name": "SarwatViqar", "display_name": "Sarwat Viqar", "profile_url": "https://johnabbott.academia.edu/SarwatViqar?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11822993/3475669/35825247/s65_sarwat.viqar.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43893714, "title": "Mapping India: Transitions and Transformations 18th-19th Century", "created_at": "2020-08-18T22:28:06.210-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43893714/Mapping_India_Transitions_and_Transformations_18th_19th_Century?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_43893714", "summary": "This book presents an alternate history of colonial India in the 18th and the 19th centuries.

Using the judicial system of one monastic group in contemporary Sri Lanka as a case study, it argues that Buddhist judging requires more than just the internalisation of moral principles, as is often assumed. According to Buddhist (monastic) principles of judging, legal procedures\u2014similar to those used in state-legal settings\u2014are equally essential. These procedures govern everything from making legal complaints, to the structuring of trials, to determining jurisdiction and many other topics. By examining Buddhist judicial systems, this article not only casts new light on the pluri-legal landscape of Asia, it also offers new reflections on the intersection of religion-based and state-based systems of law in the contemporary world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65969975, "asset_id": 43483468, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1209113, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Schonthal", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "BenSchonthal", "display_name": "Ben Schonthal", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/BenSchonthal?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1209113/4197566/25151945/s65_ben.schonthal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 546, "name": "Comparative Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Law?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3680, "name": "Courts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Courts?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3767, "name": "Law and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Society?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6612, "name": "Legal Pluralism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_Pluralism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7554, "name": "Comparative Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Constitutional_Law?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 21987, "name": "Monasticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monasticism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 90346, "name": "Vinaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vinaya?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 507591, "name": "Buddhist monasticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_monasticism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 43020130, "title": "Russia's Interests in South Asia: From Old Geopolitics to New Strategic Alignments", "created_at": "2020-05-12T04:47:57.700-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43020130/Russias_Interests_in_South_Asia_From_Old_Geopolitics_to_New_Strategic_Alignments?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_43020130", "summary": "If we are talking about geopolitics, we must apply an integrated an complex approach that combines power (primarily hard power-military strength and economic) and a certain view on the territory issues. The key concepts in geopolitics are Land Power, Sea Power and Manpower. The first two categories relate to geographical determinism and people are more likely to adjust and adapt to environmental conditions, trying to extract from this rational use-mountains, deserts, rivers and seas can serve both as natural boundaries and as a source of well-being. Man Power refers to the field of pure politics-the human will can determine how to develop the territory, whether to use military force, what to do for development and strengthening the national economy, as well as what ideological factors can serve-religions and other forms collective identity, such as nationalism. In this article, we will look at geopolitical factors, including those numerous drivers that push the centripetal and centrifugal forces of the region. Also we will analyze the perception of South Asia from three positions. To do this, it will be necessary to understand the interests of not only the countries of the region, but also others global players. And Russia's interests cannot be understood without Western opposition, especially in the context of current international relations. At the same time, we must take into account global geopolitical turbulence and the tectonic shift from a unipolar to a multipolar world order. Global positioning of the region There are different definitions of South Asia. Some refer to this region as the territories that were previously controlled British empire. 1 According to the most common version, South Asia includes eight States: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. If we consider the region from a global position, South Asia is the Rimland zone-the coastal zone of Eurasia, characterized by active dynamics, which is confirmed by the historical facts of the presence of the centers of ancient civilizations, trade and migration routes, as well as the banality that more than 70% of the World's population lives off the banks of rivers, seas and oceans. The history of the last two centuries shows that this Rimland has become a place of intense pressure from Sea Powers-early Britain, then the United States. The logic of Land Power forced the Russian Empire, and then the Soviet Union to respond in a manner based on instruments of deterrence and then ideology. If the US had once followed the doctrine of Henry Kissinger's rollback and used the myth of the Communist threat, now Washington has a more difficult time justifying its presence in the 1 Michael Mann. 2014.

Soft Power Diplomacy: Myth or Reality? examines the Chinese version of soft power both in conceptual and operational terms, and explores its myriad implications for India, in particular, and South Asia in general. The book investigates how the institutionalization of cultural soft power would help China project its image as a benign and responsible stakeholder in order to reshape the current international system with its notion of \u201charmonious world order,\u201d based on Chinese characteristics. \n\nThis book traces the origin of China\u2019s engagement with South Asian states from historical, political, economic, and security perspectives in order to better understand the dynamics of its South Asia policy. It illuminates the core reasons to explain why China\u2019s soft power initiatives in South Asia are least appealing and convincing to India while they are welcomed by smaller nations of the region. More pertinently, the book addresses complexities and nuances of China\u2019s soft power instruments given the psycho-cultural and geopsychological peculiarities of the South Asian region. For this, it focuses on how the Sino-Pakistan axis constitutes a potential challenge to India\u2019s leadership role and influence in South Asia", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53453659, "asset_id": 33398212, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33909283, "first_name": "BM", "last_name": "Jain", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JainBM", "display_name": "BM  Jain", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JainBM?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33909283/14681366/15513326/s65_bm.jain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2839, "name": "Sinology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 30456699, "title": "(2008) Times of India, Delhi Edition, Education Times Supplement, Third College Editorial Board, February 25, Monday", "created_at": "2016-12-15T01:16:27.857-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30456699/_2008_Times_of_India_Delhi_Edition_Education_Times_Supplement_Third_College_Editorial_Board_February_25_Monday?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_30456699", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50897111, "asset_id": 30456699, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3829413, "first_name": "Arnab", "last_name": "RoyChowdhury", "domain_name": "hse-ru", "page_name": "ArnabRoyChowdhury", "display_name": "Arnab RoyChowdhury", "profile_url": "https://hse-ru.academia.edu/ArnabRoyChowdhury?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3829413/5761250/6668414/s65_arnab.roy_chowdhury.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26600675, "title": "'Where the world is/becomes one nest': Rabindranath Tagore's attitude towards imperialism and national chauvinism", "created_at": "2016-06-29T07:49:42.059-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26600675/Where_the_world_is_becomes_one_nest_Rabindranath_Tagores_attitude_towards_imperialism_and_national_chauvinism?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_26600675", "summary": "Rabindranath Tagore's opposition to imperialism and national chauvinism was manifest long before the series of lectures he delivered that came out in 1917 with a very misleading title, Nationalism.

LONG DESCRIPTION: South Asia is well known for its vibrant visual culture, with a rich artistic tradition that stretches back over two millennia. Traditional Arts of South Asia: Past Practice, Living Traditions examines the challenges of modernity to the development, understanding and practice of the traditional architecture, sculpture, textiles and paintings of South Asia in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Included are studies of nineteenth century traditional arts in India and Sri Lanka in the context of the British Arts & Crafts Movement; the production and consumption of block-printed cloth and other textiles in western India; the impact of modern technology on the mass reproduction of Hindu imagery; tradition and innovation in the practice of bronze-casting and temple painting in south India; and the patronage and design of religious architecture, both Hindu and Islamic, in modern South Asia. The papers included are by a distinguished group of eleven scholars and practitioners of traditional arts from India, Pakistan, Britain and the United States.  ABOUT THE EDITOR: Crispin Branfoot is Senior Lecturer in South Asian art & archaeology at SOAS, University of London.

Its neighbourhood includes troubled states, such as Burma and Sri Lanka, where human rights violations have led to calls for outside intervention in the recent past. As a major regional power, India has a potentially important role in resolving crises and determining the effectiveness of international efforts to protect civilians. More generally, its leadership role in the developing world, growing power-political clout, and global ambition have placed its attitude towards the emerging norm of \u2018responsibility to protect\u2019 (R2P) under the spotlight. Military intervention to halt or prevent atrocities is one of the most contentious aspects of R2P, with which India has often expressed its vocal disagreement. Yet, closer examination of the country\u2019s cumulative record reveals ambiguity and pragmatism. It also shows a willingness to acquiesce to, or rather tolerate, intervention under certain narrowly defined circumstances, as India has been nudged towards more active engagement with the new norm and adapted out of self-interest to the majority position. In the final analysis, however, India has remained a reactive rather than a proactive actor, one that has only very reluctantly and cautiously acknowledged \u2018a\u2019 responsibility to protect and that also continues to be genuinely concerned about the appropriateness of 'humanitarian intervention'. The paper opens with a historical overview of India\u2019s affinity for the principles of sovereignty, non-intervention, and non-use of force. The second section looks at the factors that have shaped its stance towards humanitarian intervention in particular. In the third section, I focus on India\u2019s response to selected cases of actual intervention in the 1990s. The fourth section examines India\u2019s rhetoric in the public conversation after Kosovo on the principle of humanitarian intervention (under the broad rubric of R2P) at the UN, while touching lightly on the experiences that have informed its arguments \u2018against\u2019 the resort to force.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53042627, "asset_id": 479305, "asset_type": "Work",

mediatization. Noting the propensity in contemporary media culture to reduce even war and violence to a spectacle, Baudrillard (1995) has famously claimed that the Gulf War actually did not take place, but was a carefully \" simulated \" media event. The very proliferation of the images of war has come to reveal the limits of visual data from conflict scenarios, eroding the epistemological privilege assigned to the visual as a reflection of the truth/ real. A controversy over a video footage 2 from the recently concluded conflict between the state military of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), fueling allegations of war crimes against both sides, attests to the power of the visual image, as well as its tenuousness in an era saturated with images. This chapter examines the visual (re)presentations of the conflict between the separatist Tamil Tigers and the government of Sri Lanka as a site that reveals the limits, cracks, and unreliability of visual data.

It also provides an overall and comprehensive prologue to the Gramsci\u2013Ambedkar encounter. Indeed, \u2018parallels are strong and very striking for two thinkers who are otherwise so different \u2013 in political experience, philosophical background, and ideas of effective strategy\u2019 (Jon Soske, personal communication). However, the moral fabric of their human and political commitment to Dalits/subalterns brings them very close, particularly when upholding and inspiring Gramsci\u2019s \u2018intellectual and moral reform\u2019 and Ambedkar\u2019s \u2018social and moral consciousness of society\u2019.\r\n\r\nGramsci and Ambedkar were contemporaries \u2013 both born in 1891 \u2013 and although operating in very different environments, the similarities of their strategies and political philosophy to empower subalterns/Dalits are indeed striking. Their activity as leaders, always combined with solid theoretical reflection, springs out of their own and others\u2019 lived experience of subalternity. Both found inspiration in Marxism, both were critical of religion, but considered religion culturally and politically relevant; both assessed the presence of subalterns through social, cultural and historical critical analysis, and sought to negotiate a rightful place within the state, society and history/historiography for these \u2018excluded\u2019 individuals. For both of them, the solution would come from the effort of the subalterns themselves, as active protagonists of their own destiny, to achieve \u2018consciousness\u2019, and \u2018collective will\u2019 aided by the role of leaders/intellectuals. Their \u2018holistic\u2019 approach \u2013 which is a global critique to culture and to the structures of subalternity \u2013 enlightens the present-day \u2018Dalit Question\u2019 as a challenge posited not simply to Dalits and concerned scholars, but to societies/states and to the international community. Gramscian studies are currently flourishing in Italy and elsewhere. Although \u2018Ambedkar has never really been taken seriously as a thinker in India\u2019, (Omvedt 2006: 438), recent studies invite us to reflect on his fundamental intuition of the Untouchable subject becoming a Dalit (A. Rao 2009; Guru ed. 2009; Omvedt 2003; Zelliot 2004).\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, following a summary of Gramsci\u2019s reception in South Asia, I briefly discuss both Gramsci\u2019s demise and Ambedkar\u2019s silencing, to then reaffirm the relevance of their being discussed in conjunction with each other. In conclusion, I offer a reflection proposing an introductory presentation of the articles offered in this volume.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36350549, "asset_id": 10265958,

The study of the afterlives of monuments encompasses how, where, when and why monuments have been re-modelled, re-used, re-sited, re-made, cast aside, destroyed or abandoned to accommodate changing political and social climates; how they survive through re-invention and transformations. Afterlives accrue through material alteration and they accumulate in representation. The diverse ways in which monuments survive, it is argued, depends on definitions and listings of monuments, practices of monument-making past and present and recent debates over history and memory. The concept is proposed to capture afterlives that co-exist as well as those occur sequentially, and to suggest a model of greater complexity and plurality than a linear or quasi-biographical trajectory. Conflicts over monuments especially over their survival, it is suggested, are as much concerned with projections of a future, as with reconstructions of the past or mnemonic recollection. Monuments \u2014 ancient, modern and contemporary \u2014 have taken centre stage as different and competing South-Asian communities claim a stake in the making of national, religious, cultural and local histories and identities. In their varied afterlives, monuments emerge as extraordinarily mobile, marked by material change, put to new uses and interpretations, and travelling through image-banks, archives, collections and exhibitions. Their afterlives, like monuments themselves, are multi-media.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73486915, "asset_id": 55014514, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 165096135, "first_name": "Deborah", "last_name": "Cherry", "domain_name": "arts-london", "page_name": "DeborahCherry", "display_name": "Deborah Cherry", "profile_url": "https://arts-london.academia.edu/DeborahCherry?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13966, "name": "History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1339135, "name": "Monuments and Memorials", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monuments_and_Memorials-1?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1433324, "name": "Imaginaries of Afterlives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imaginaries_of_Afterlives?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3654586, "name": "Afterlives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afterlives?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 5981312, "title": "Challan Form 2014", "created_at": "2014-02-06T21:36:50.955-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5981312/Challan_Form_2014?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_5981312", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32937746, "asset_id": 5981312, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8927180, "first_name": "Mudassir", "last_name": "Riaz", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MudassirRiaz", "display_name": "Mudassir Riaz", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MudassirRiaz?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8927180/10019774/11175954/s65_mudassir.riaz.jpg_oh_bc89dd1ac4d1713daefecd33fe4145a2_oe_563df456___gda___1451173530_867500b51ba3ae5a07a972d5b1028df5"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3490, "name": "Accounting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Accounting?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4738, "name": "Academic Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Writing?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 61762920, "title": "Genocide in the Liberation War of Bangladesh: A Case Study on Sreepur Genocide, Noakhali", "created_at": "2021-11-16T02:22:15.037-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61762920/Genocide_in_the_Liberation_War_of_Bangladesh_A_Case_Study_on_Sreepur_Genocide_Noakhali?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_61762920", "summary": "The Genocide of Bangladesh is one of the most brutal, pre-planned and widespread genocides of the 20 th century. Pakistani army along with their local collaborators killed 3 million people and raped more than 2 lakh women only in a period of nine months. Millions of people were injured and uprooted from their houses. Pakistani army established its control over the entire country and carried out brutal genocide in remote areas of Bangladesh. During the Liberation war of Bangladesh, Pakistani army carried out brutal genocide in Noakhali district which is a remote area of Bangladesh. The process of mass killing was going on randomly everywhere across the district. In particular, the paper chooses a case on Sreepur genocide in Noakhali. On 15 June, 1971 the Pakistani army carried out genocide and killed many people at the village of Sreepur in Noakhali Sadar upazila. Besides killing, villages were burned and crops destroyed. With the assistance of their local collaborators the Pakistani army accomplished these atrocious activities in Sreepur. The aim of this paper is to explore the genocide issues in the context of Liberation War of Bangladesh and find out how and why the Pakistani army carried out genocide in Sreepur. In this paper, we bring a case to understand the true history about genocide in the country's remote area and it would enrich the genocide studies of Bangladesh.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74716650, "asset_id": 61762920, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 71223944, "first_name": "Md Read", "last_name": "Hossain", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FahimAlRiyad", "display_name": "Md Read Hossain", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FahimAlRiyad?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/71223944/18283476/56865463/s65_md_read.hossain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 319347, "name": "1971 the liberation war of Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/1971_the_liberation_war_of_Bangladesh?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43365849, "title": "Special Issue: 'Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47avism and Modernity'", "created_at": "2020-06-17T05:07:13.880-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43365849/Special_Issue_Gau%E1%B8%8D%C4%ABya_Vai%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87avism_and_Modernity?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_43365849", "summary": "This special issue of the Journal of Hindu Studies explores Gau\u1e0d\u012bya Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava engagement with key facets of colonial modernity and its role in shaping modern Hindu discourse.

The focus of media and politics has been to analyze the influence of media on politics and how a particular political system affects the ways media function. The field of media and politics known as political communication is dominated by a strong empirical tradition in the United States and Europe, along with the existence of qualitative tradition. However, in the case of South Asia, the study of the relationship between media and politics has primarily been preoccupied by qualitative literature with a very few quantitative studies available on the subject. The field of media and politics could best be conceptualised as the study of the relationship between media actors\u2014journalists and media owners, political actors (candidates and political parties), and a diverse public. In the South Asian context, it is important to recognize the diversities that inform the relationship of media and politics at various levels: linguistic, ethnic, and regional diversities are the most prominent ones, while also taking into account the existence of subnational identities within a particular nation. For example, India has twenty-two officially recognized languages and newspapers and news television are available in almost all the official languages. These diversities make it difficult for the media to have an impact beyond the specific audience. Hence, it is not easy to study the agenda-setting power of the media when audiences are fragmented along linguistic lines and exposed to diverse sources of information. Although freedom of the press has been protected legally in most South Asian countries, repression and attacks on freedom of speech are regularly reported. The Freedom House report of 2015, which monitors press freedom globally, dubs all South Asian countries in terms of press freedom as \u201cnot free,\u201d except for India, which is labelled as \u201cpartly free.\u201d Given these backgrounds and nuances, the study of media and politics in South Asia is marked not only by complexities, but also by a lack of scholarship on the subject as compared to other regions of the world. Even within South Asia, most of the literature on media and politics deals largely with India. The reason stems perhaps from the dominant position of India within the South Asian region, but it could also be attributed to the mostly authoritarian nature of political systems in all South Asian countries except for India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52410437, "asset_id": 32175425, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2817, "first_name": "Taberez A", "last_name": "Neyazi", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "TaberezANeyazi", "display_name": "Taberez A Neyazi", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/TaberezANeyazi?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2817/1234/5739078/s65_taberez_a.neyazi.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7369, "name": "Political communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_communication?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44789, "name": "Media and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Politics?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 1312873, "title": "US Role in Bending Democracy during Cold War: A Case Study of Pakistan", "created_at": "2012-01-29T22:11:12.668-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1312873/US_Role_in_Bending_Democracy_during_Cold_War_A_Case_Study_of_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_1312873", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56748532, "asset_id": 1312873, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 437034, "first_name": "Rafida", "last_name": "Nawaz", "domain_name": "bzu", "page_name": "RafidaNawaz", "display_name": "Rafida Nawaz", "profile_url": "https://bzu.academia.edu/RafidaNawaz?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/437034/139519/30843195/s65_rafida.nawaz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11927249, "title": "Salma Bani\u2019s \u2018Immigration\u2019 sketches Canadian Diaspora life", "created_at": "2015-04-13T09:03:38.306-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11927249/Salma_Bani_s_Immigration_sketches_Canadian_Diaspora_life?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_11927249", "summary": "Salma Bani's epic creation \u2018Immigration\u2019, is one of the very few excellent novels that Bangla language has produced in the recent decades.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37292548, "asset_id": 11927249, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 366949, "first_name": "Subrata Kumar", "last_name": "Das", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SubrataKumarDas", "display_name": "Subrata Kumar  Das", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SubrataKumarDas?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/366949/151779/24996207/s65_subrata_kumar.das.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14500, "name": "Bengali Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 106029, "name": "Bengali Language & Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 116870, "name": "Bengali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 8530154, "title": "\"State of Indigenous Industries\" in the book \"History of Bangladesh 1704-1971.

It was this affluence which induced the contemporaries to describe Bengal in such terms as 'Paradise of Nations', 'the Paradise of India', or 'the realm of Paradise'. It was the same lure of wealth which also brought to the shores of Bengal a host of foreign merchants from far and wide, including a great many Europeans of diverse nationalities. Their travel accounts and descriptions were no less copious in glorifying the land which had 'a hundred open gates to enter...and not one to come away again'. \r\n\r\nThe wealth of this nation was created of course by the bounteous soil of the region which produced a wide variety of agricultural commodities like rice, wheat and other grains, sugarcane, cotton, opium, indigo, oils of different kinds and vegetables. Other economic products found in abundance were lacca, wax, long pepper, salt and saltpetre. But more than anything else Bengal was then the general storehouse of a wide variety of cotton and silk products not only for Hindustan of the Empire of the Great Mughal, but also for the Kingdom and for Europe itself. The goods so manufactured were not only known for their exquisite fineness and delicacy of workmanship but were also relatively cheap. Bengal's industrial economy during the pre-colonial period compared thus very favourably with that of any nation on earth. \r\n\r\nIn this chapter, an attempt will be made to study the state of the major indigenous industries during the colonial period. An attempt will also be made to explain the causes of their ultimate collapse. In this connection, the role of the state which could stimulate or inhibit industrial development would be looked into to ascertain the real motive of British rule. Did they create an appropriate climate for promoting and encouraging indigenous industrial enterprises? Was the destruction due to natural causes or was it deliberate? The economic policies of the colonial state in relation to industries need, therefore, also to be looked into to ascertain the total effect of such policies on the domestic manufacturing industries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34907401, "asset_id": 8530154, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17513040, "first_name": "A.

By integrating decades of specialist literature from various subfields of political science, the book models personalist behavior, its impact on the states they govern, and their future transitions. By systematizing regime behavior (coup-proofing, gatekeeping, repression and hoarding), the model identifies the mechanics on how personalist regimes establish vicious circles of personalism and explains how exactly they end up again in authoritarianism or in new personalist tyrannies after their demise, and so seldom transition to democracy.\n\nThis book will be of key interest to scholars and students of African politics, democratization and democratic consolidation, authoritarian rule and more broadly to political science, comparative politics, area studies, political leadership, peace and conflict studies and development studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65592742, "asset_id": 45041395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3955119, "first_name": "Jeroen J.

The deep division between Hindus and Muslims was one aspect of it, but within the Hindu society too, lines were drawn as a result of the mass migration of people from the areas now in Pakistan. Despite the numerous narratives that have tried to articulate the psychological, social, cultural and political fallout of partition, not many have taken up the plight of the displaced persons. The focus of my paper is on the survival strategies that the migrating Hindus adopted, leaving behind not only their homes and hearths, but also their history. The distancing of the traumatic experience is undone even now through the periodical political machinations that categorize people as \u201crefugees\u201d and the \u201clocal\u201d. The source material comes from both -- subjective assessment, since the author of these lines comes from a displaced Hindu family which is also part of a linguistic minority, and various testimonies and impersonal narratives produced by others, since it is believed that the truth must lie somewhere between history, memory and amnesia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59815548, "asset_id": 39650931, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83615012, "first_name": "Jagdish", "last_name": "Batra", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "batrajagdish", "display_name": "Jagdish Batra", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/batrajagdish?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83615012/20071474/19836866/s65_jagdish.batra.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2256, "name": "Rehabilitation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rehabilitation?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83745, "name": "Partition of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Partition_of_India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134693, "name": "Refugees and Forced Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees_and_Forced_Migration_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 77349382, "title": "Where there is no midwife: birth and loss in rural India - By Sarah Pinto", "created_at": "2022-04-23T04:51:31.694-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77349382/Where_there_is_no_midwife_birth_and_loss_in_rural_India_By_Sarah_Pinto?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_77349382", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84747207, "asset_id": 77349382, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 656867, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Pinto", "domain_name": "tufts", "page_name": "SarahPinto", "display_name": "Sarah Pinto", "profile_url": "https://tufts.academia.edu/SarahPinto?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/656867/228039/274581/s65_sarah.pinto.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 793, "name": "Medical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 954, "name": "Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2145, "name": "Sexual and Reproductive Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_and_Reproductive_Health?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7453, "name": "Rural Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Development?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15892, "name": "Caste and Untouchability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caste_and_Untouchability?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 45919, "name": "Dalit studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dalit_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 118633, "name": "Caste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caste?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 50822982, "title": "Performing Political Empathy", "created_at": "2021-08-10T16:42:13.535-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50822982/Performing_Political_Empathy?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_50822982", "summary": "The purpose of this chapter is to explore the role of performance in the relationship be tween emotions and politics. To do so it focuses on the role that empathy plays in process es of reconciliation after conflict and trauma. Emotions triggered by conflict often perpet uate existing antagonisms. They tend to reproduce the hostile attitudes that have created violence in the first place. A performative approach illuminates not only how emotions perpetuate conflict but also how they can help divided societies adopt more reflective cul tures of reconciliation. The performative dimensions of emotions are crucial because they link individual emotions with collective ones. Drawing on a range of conceptual sources the chapter shows how actively drawing on empathy can promote alternative ways of dealing with conflict. A short case study examines the roles that art, and theater in partic ular, play in peacebuilding in Sri Lanka. An active appreciation of the whole spectrum of emotions-not only fear, anger, and resentment, for instance, but also compassion-may facilitate forms of social healing and reconciliation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68689501, "asset_id": 50822982, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 263927, "first_name": "Roland", "last_name": "Bleiker", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "RolandBleiker", "display_name": "Roland Bleiker", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/RolandBleiker?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/263927/55391/27501207/s65_roland.bleiker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 813, "name": "Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Philosophy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 951, "name": "Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanities?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6729, "name": "Philosophy of the Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_the_Emotions?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7369, "name": "Political communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_communication?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 45126340, "title": "Museums in South Asia - Course Outline", "created_at": "2021-02-15T08:01:51.652-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45126340/Museums_in_South_Asia_Course_Outline?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_45126340", "summary": "This course offers a social history of the institution of the museum in South Asia, and critically examines the politics of representation through it. Here, museums are considered as a tool of cultural and political domination through knowledge production and the creation of authoritative pasts. We explore the history of museums in the context of colonial rule, the rise of independent nation-states, and the heritage and identity politics of contemporary South Asia. How did museums emerge in South Asia? What are the different museum forms in the region? Who is making them, why and when? What is their notion of heritage and whose heritage do they represent? A history of museums in South Asia is especially interesting as the region has a history, simultaneously, of a shared culture and of competing interests among its constituting national and social groups. We discuss examples of museums from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and examine the dynamic ways in which politics, identity, religion, history and heritage interact in the institution of the museum.

Invariably the indigenous elites drew upon British constitutional ideas and institutions regardless of the political conditions that prevailed in their very different lands. Many Asian nations called upon the services of Englishman and Law Professor Sir Ivor Jennings to advise or assist their own constitution making. Although he was one of the twentieth century\u2019s most prominent constitutional scholars, his opinion and influence were often controversial and remain so due to his advocating British norms in Asian form.\n\nThis book examines the process of constitutional formation in the era of decolonisation and state building in Asia. It sheds light upon the influence and participation of Jennings in particular and British ideas in general on democracy and institutions across the Asian continent. Critical cases studies on India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Nepal \u2013 all linked by Britain and Jennings \u2013 assess the distinctive methods and outcomes of constitution making and how British ideas fared in these major states. The book offers chapters on the Westminster model in Asia, Human Rights, Nationalism, Ethnic politics, Federalism, Foreign influence, Decolonisation, Authoritarianism, the Rule of Law, Parliamentary democracy and the power and influence of key political actors. Taking an original stance on constitution making in Asia after British rule, it also puts forward ideas of contemporary significance for Asian states and other emerging democracies engaged in constitution making, regime change and seeking to understand their colonial past.\n\nThe first political, historical or constitutional analysis comparing Asia\u2019s experience with its indelible British constitutional legacy, this book is a critical resource on state building and constitution making in Asia following independence. It will appeal to students and scholars of world history, public law and politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45455312, "asset_id": 25134715, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Smallholder production, which accounts for 95 percent of the total cultivated area in India, is embedded in regionally specific natural, social and cultural conditions. Today, Indian farmers have to face protracted socioeconomic and ecological crises, which two case studies from Ladakh and Wayanad exemplify. Despite the diverse configuration of agrarian questions in relation to caste, class and gender as well as the differential incorporation into markets, Indian smallholders face similar challenges that often manifest in precarisation, uncertainty and a difficult generational reproduction. For many smallholders, the future of farming remains uncertain. \r\n\r\nAbstrakt (German)\r\nW\u00e4hrend das Augenmerk der internationalen Berichterstattung auf Indiens St\u00e4dte und den Boom der IT- und Servicesektoren gelegt wird, sind mehrere hundert Millionen Menschen in Indien weiterhin von der landwirtschaftlichen\r\nProduktion auf immer st\u00e4rker fragmentierten Nutzfl\u00e4chen abh\u00e4ngig.

By focusing on what went on within the apparatus of the state during this period, this paper attempts to contribute to the study of modern time in bureaucracy. It argues that the startling inefficiencies in the effective governance and regulation of the big cat stemmed from a clash of various social times that were unfolding simultaneously. It outlines five distinct forms of social time that were in play during this period, which led to long periods of waiting and allowed for the articulation of a searing critique of the Indian state by town residents. Ultimately this paper contributes a rethinking of current theories of bureaucratic time that focus on the production of disempowered waiting, risk analysis, and anticipation. Instead it argues that a study of low-level bureaucrats and citizens shows that a central task of bureaucracy is to attempt to mediate conflicting forms of social time. Moving away from accounts of bureaucratic indifference, this paper depicts failure as an impasse arising out of attempts to bring incommensurable forms and representations of time into congruence. These failures importantly imperil the legitimacy of bureaucrats and can lead to a radical critique of the state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33484398, "asset_id": 6778493, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57428, "first_name": "Nayanika", "last_name": "Mathur", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "NayanikaMathur", "display_name": "Nayanika Mathur", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/NayanikaMathur?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57428/678669/28528537/s65_nayanika.mathur.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1625, "name": "Human-Animal Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human-Animal_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3729, "name": "Environmental Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14989, "name": "Philosophy of Time", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Time?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16766, "name": "Anthropology of Tibet and the Himalayas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Tibet_and_the_Himalayas?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19406, "name": "Human-wildlife conflicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human-wildlife_conflicts?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 22413, "name": "Wildlife Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wildlife_Conservation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 78388, "name": "Bureaucracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bureaucracy?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 6405846, "title": "Bubonic Plague in South Bihar: Gaya and Shahabad Districts 1900-1924", "created_at": "2014-03-13T20:32:12.903-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6405846/Bubonic_Plague_in_South_Bihar_Gaya_and_Shahabad_Districts_1900_1924?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_6405846", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33212794, "asset_id": 6405846, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10070306, "first_name": "Alok", "last_name": "Sheel", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AloksheelSheel", "display_name": "Alok  Sheel", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AloksheelSheel?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10070306/3106990/3657075/s65_aloksheel.sheel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60428, "name": "Medical History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 198582, "name": "British Indian Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Indian_Empire?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2948225, "title": "Oppressive pasts and desired futures: Re-imagining India", "created_at": "2013-03-10T16:30:09.392-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2948225/Oppressive_pasts_and_desired_futures_Re_imagining_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_2948225", "summary": "Univocal notions of sovereign nationality have reached a dead-end in the Indian subcontinent.

Existing theory is ambiguous. On the one hand, religiously motivated militants might target areas that vote secularists into office. On the other hand, secular party politicians, reliant on the support of violence-hit communities, may face powerful electoral incentives to quell attacks. Candidates bent on preventing bloodshed might also sort into such parties. To adjudicate these claims, we combine constituency-level election returns with event data on Islamist and sectarian violence in Pakistan (1988-2011). For identification, we compare districts where secular parties narrowly won or lost elections. We find that secularist rule causes a sizable reduction in local religious conflict. Additional analyses suggest that the result stems from electoral pressures to cater to core party supporters and not from politician selection. The effect is concentrated in regions with denser police presence, highlighting the importance of state capacity for suppressing religious disorder.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65159430, "asset_id": 44684889, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 178694094, "first_name": "Gareth", "last_name": "Nellis", "domain_name": "ucsd", "page_name": "GarethNellis", "display_name": "Gareth Nellis", "profile_url": "https://ucsd.academia.edu/GarethNellis?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/178694094/50178783/38180365/s65_gareth.nellis.jpg"}, {"id": 35501320, "first_name": "Niloufer", "last_name": "Siddiqui", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NilouferSiddiqui", "display_name": "Niloufer Siddiqui", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NilouferSiddiqui?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5847, "name": "Political Extremism/Radicalism/Populism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Extremism_Radicalism_Populism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 16211, "name": "Ethnic Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 17123, "name": "Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 72581, "name": "Islam and Secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Secularism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 198844, "name": "Security and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 44126252, "title": "Our ancestors the Gauls, the Slavs and the Dravidians V3", "created_at": "2020-09-20T07:46:37.784-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44126252/Our_ancestors_the_Gauls_the_Slavs_and_the_Dravidians_V3?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_44126252", "summary": "Abstract : this study, which first aim was to demonstrate the correspondences between the Gaulish language and the Slavic languages, between which I found 500 common words, allowed me also to demonstrate, on the basis of genetical, archaeological and religious data, that those correspondences were linked with ancient migrations linked with the diffusion of the Dravidian civilisation of the Indus Valley to Iran, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, the Caucasus, the North of the Black Sea, Danubian and Balkanic Europe, towards Gaul and Iberia, where the Neolithic agriculturalists contributed to the formation of the megalithic civilisation which developed from -5.000.

Through an extended case study of Nepali-speaking groups that are collectively known as 'Gorkhas', Middleton shows how late liberal governmentality and what he calls the 'ethno-contemporary' make and remake each other. As the postcolonial state has devised affirmative action policies to redress the historical disadvantages of socially marginalized groups, a new kind of 'ethnopolitics' has emerged to claim the loaves and fishes offered by the state. In turn, this new ethnopolitics has compelled the state to rethink its classificatory schemas and mechanisms in order to decide which groups ought to be considered as 'tribes', and hence, merit affirmative action. In most cases, the primary aim of ethnopolitics in contemporary India is to enter official lists or 'schedules' that record castes and tribes as well as other groups deemed to be 'backward' enough to warrant affirmative action. The situation with the Gorkhas was no different after their demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland went unmet a generation ago. By undertaking a fine-grained ethnographic exploration of the Gorkhas' ethnopolitics and the travails of their interlocutors within the postcolonial ethnographic state, Middleton challenges us to interrogate our received notions of ethnicity and about the place of anthropology in our world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52123485, "asset_id": 28698476, "asset_type": "Work",

Since adoption, the norm has been invoked in Libya, South Sudan, Yemen, and Syria, nonetheless, the UN refrains to respond to the genocide committed in the Jammu & Kashmir and triggering a greater sense of anxiety. In this context, the present paper elucidates the factors behind the UN failure. It asks why the UN failed to call R2P despite systematic crimes against humanity in Kashmir. What factors or forces preclude the UN to invoke R2P? The paper argues that the inability of the UN to invoke R2P is a consequence of systemic and domestic factors. The Indo-US strategic partnership, materialism, and New Delhi's influence in the international system are obstructing the UN's ability to play a decisive role. Meanwhile, the economic and military potential of India and its regional influence forbid the international community to dissuade India not to commit genocide in Jammu & Kashmir. So the high politics of materialism and national interests override the norm of human rights and humanity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66523549, "asset_id": 47424756, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6854598, "first_name": "Dr. Mehmood", "last_name": "Hussain", "domain_name": "divine-economics", "page_name": "DrMehmoodHussain", "display_name": "Dr. Mehmood Hussain", "profile_url": "https://divine-economics.academia.edu/DrMehmoodHussain?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6854598/2730472/16985170/s65_mehmood.hussain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6617, "name": "United Nations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Nations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9818, "name": "Responsibility to Protect", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Responsibility_to_Protect?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 227410, "name": "India-Pakistan Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India-Pakistan_Relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 362278, "name": "Kashmir Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir_Conflict?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 10308723, "title": "[2016] People's Participation in Local Government", "created_at": "2015-01-24T03:07:49.496-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10308723/_2016_Peoples_Participation_in_Local_Government?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_10308723", "summary": "A polity cannot be called democratic without citizen\u2019s participation in government\u2019s activities. Participation of local people is an essential precondition for any local government set up to become effective and successful. The underlying reasons are manifold: through active participation of people can express their expectations meaningfully and bring desired change in the local government system. Participation helps citizens to learn how to make changes they desire. Also participation is supportive to understand individual needs and interests of community (Bridges, 1974). Moreover, it is argued that \u2018public involvement results in better decision\u2019 (Heberlein, 1976), and at the same time, grants legitimacy to government programmes and leadership. Again, participation enhances sense of citizenship among mass people which ultimately improve the standard of political culture in a state. From these standpoints, it is imperative to examine people\u2019s participation in local government institutions (LGIs) in Bangladesh.  In this discussion, Union Parishad and Paurashava are taken into consideration for analysing the whole issue of people\u2019s participation in activities of LGIs as people has direct involvement in these two institutions in various ways. \r\nThis chapter provides a brief account of the status of people\u2019s participation in the affairs of local government from two different perspectives-namely, elected representatives and people. It has special focus on the current participation status of women and civil society. The subsequent section deals with the key challenges in ensuring downward accountability while the final section focuses on the issue of inclusion of people.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36381992, "asset_id": 10308723, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21563861, "first_name": "Shantanu", "last_name": "Majumder", "domain_name": "univdhaka", "page_name": "ShantanuMajumder", "display_name": "Shantanu  Majumder", "profile_url": "https://univdhaka.academia.edu/ShantanuMajumder?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21563861/6545423/11900802/s65_shantanu.majumder.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5102, "name": "Regional and Local Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_and_Local_Governance?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8315, "name": "Local Government and Local Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_Government_and_Local_Development?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99487, "name": "Local governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_governance?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 45167381, "title": "Review of Alpa Shah (2018) Nightmarch: among India's revolutionary guerrillas", "created_at": "2021-02-22T01:06:47.258-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45167381/Review_of_Alpa_Shah_2018_Nightmarch_among_Indias_revolutionary_guerrillas?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_45167381", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65748534, "asset_id": 45167381, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38125856, "first_name": "Jostein", "last_name": "Jakobsen", "domain_name": "uio", "page_name": "JosteinJakobsen", "display_name": "Jostein Jakobsen", "profile_url": "https://uio.academia.edu/JosteinJakobsen?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38125856/10654004/34586422/s65_jostein.jakobsen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 954, "name": "Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19672, "name": "Indian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 101570, "name": "Agrarian Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agrarian_Social_Movements?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 319943, "name": "Indian Maoists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Maoists?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 10630718, "title": "If Shakespeare Wrote an Epic -- The Genius of Kumaravyasa", "created_at": "2015-02-08T22:33:02.421-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10630718/If_Shakespeare_Wrote_an_Epic_The_Genius_of_Kumaravyasa?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_10630718", "summary": "Kumaravyasa, the 15th century author of the epic, Karnata Bharata Kathamanjari (a retelling of the famed Mahabharata) is generally celebrated as one of the two greatest poets in the millennium-plus long tradition of Kannada literature.  He is also very popular, being the favorite subject of the typically Kannada tradition of musical recitation of poetry known as Gamaka. Yet, he is unknown outside Karnataka, let alone outside India.  In this talk, intended for the general audience, I hope to convey a glimpse of the genius of Kumaravyasa and why his work should rank among the world classics.  \r\n\r\nNo comparison other than that with Shakespeare will do justice to the vastness of Kumaravyasa\u2019s genius.   I will support this admittedly tall claim with illustrations of Kumaravyasa\u2019s scale, depth, originality and creativity:  his originality and creativity in adapting a familiar story line; his deftness in interweaving cosmic themes with keenly observed minutiae of human and behavior;  insightful portrayal of human nature in its many dimensions from grandeur to evil in a vast array of memorable characters; his narrative skill in developing the plot through dramatic situations embodied in powerful dialogues and moving descriptions;  the charm, power, and evocativeness of his language;  the astounding,  almost impossible, profusion of brilliant metaphors;  his versatile command of the spoken idiom, ranging from the colloquial to the sublime; his gifted ability to  concretize and dramatize the inner workings of the mind; his creative use of multiple levels of intertextual resonance;  his employment of objective correlatives on a grand scale; his critique of social and political mores;  his sense of humor and irony;  his ability to sustain freshness and naturalness of idiom across 8500 sextets without being constrained by a peculiar rhyme scheme; and much more.  I will end with a discussion of the contemporary relevance response to this classic and the challenge of translating it into English. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36566816, "asset_id": 10630718, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2413645, "first_name": "S.

In the East China Sea (ECS), a portion of the Pacific Ocean, is a group of uninhabited islets and barren rocks which the Asian economic powers-China, Japan and Taiwan claim ownership and sovereignty over based on historical records, international legal documents and geographical fact. These islets, which China calls 'Diaoyu Islands' and Japan, 'Senkaku Islands', are close to important shipping lanes, potential hydrocarbon deposits, and good fishing areas. However, irredentism and nationalism in China, and the politics played by staunch nationalists in Japan, have from time to time led to simmering tensions between both countries. Though, China and Japan have a maritime delimitation feud over their overlapping Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), this paper solely examines the competing territorial claims of China and Japan to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the geostrategic East China Sea. For the study, the historical approach was adopted and data were garnered from secondary sources. The paper concludes that China has a rich history regarding the disputed islands. However, it has insufficient historical evidence to prove that it exercised territorial sovereignty over the islets centuries ago. For Japan, it has good historical evidence to make a case for the island's ownership. Also, it has met the international law requirement of 'effective occupation' of the islets.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65108019, "asset_id": 44637552, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50486134, "first_name": "Adeleke Olumide", "last_name": "Ogunnoiki", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AdelekeOlumideOgunnoiki", "display_name": "Adeleke Olumide Ogunnoiki", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AdelekeOlumideOgunnoiki?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50486134/13309771/20697077/s65_adeleke_olumide.ogunnoiki.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1911, "name": "International Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2556, "name": "Dispute Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dispute_Resolution?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6789, "name": "Japanese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9707, "name": "Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 24550, "name": "Contemporary China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_China?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 38204, "name": "China's foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinas_foreign_policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 220464, "name": "Politics and International relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_and_International_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 270026, "name": "International Studies and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies_and_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 313371, "name": "Diplomacy and international relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy_and_international_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 430717, "name": "The South China Sea dispute", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_South_China_Sea_dispute?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 44548259, "title": "Pakistan.

Clerk helping Malik (Chief) of Swat Ranezai tribe, place his inked thumb print as his signature on the agreement document to their accession to the government of Pakistan during Jirga (tribal assembly) for the Northwest Frontier Province. (Photo by Margaret Bourke-White/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images.) The Defiant Border explores why the Afghan-Pakistan borderlands have remained largely independent of state controls from the colonial period into the twenty-first century. This book looks at local Pashtun tribes' modes for evading first British colonial, then Pakistani governance; the ongoing border dispute between Pakistan and Afghanistan; and continuing interest in the region from Indian, US, British, and Soviet actors. It reveals active attempts by first British, then Pakistani, agents to integrate the tribal region, ranging from development initiatives to violent suppression. also considers the area's influence on relations between Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India, as well as its role in the United States' increasingly global Cold War policies. Ultimately, the book considers how a region so peripheral to major centers of power has had such an impact on political choices throughout the eras of empire, decolonization, and superpower competition, up to the so-called War on Terror.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50235437, "asset_id": 29782615, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

book argues that the dominant descriptions of the 'caste system' are rooted in a Western Christian experience of India. Thus, caste studies scholarship tells us more about the West than about India. It further demonstrates the imperative to move beyond this scholarship in order to generate descriptions of Indian social reality. The dominant descriptions of the 'caste system' that we have today are results of originally Christian themes and questions. They reflect European experiences of, and thinking about, Indian culture and society much more than the real state of society or its domestic understanding in India. The authors of this collection explore this hypothesis and show how it is applied beyond South Asia to the diasporic cultures that have made a home in Western countries. The book explores how caste studies has inherited its foundational assumptions from Christianity and how the inheritance of caste studies as structured by European scholarship impacts on our understanding of contemporary India and the Indians of the diaspora.

A combination of fears about the local Pashtun population and external invasion from Afghanistan and Russia convinced the rulers of British India that the region was the one place in the empire where Britain could suffer a 'knock-out blow.' In this cultural and political study, Brandon Marsh examines the power and influence of this belief on the Afghan frontier, India as a whole, and British imperialism between 1918 and 1948. This book explores British attempts to isolate the frontier after the First World War, the relationship between colonial nationalism and state sanctioned violence in the region, and the significant connection between British perceptions about the Afghan frontier and the collapse of the British Raj in India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65142465, "asset_id": 44669175, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49479719, "first_name": "Brandon", "last_name": "Marsh", "domain_name": "bridgewater", "page_name": "BrandonMarsh", "display_name": "Brandon Marsh", "profile_url": "https://bridgewater.academia.edu/BrandonMarsh?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49479719/13012286/38135490/s65_brandon.marsh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5357, "name": "Afghanistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afghanistan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6464, "name": "British Imperial & Commonwelath History - 19th & 20th century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Commonwelath_History_-_19th_and_20th_century?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15696, "name": "Indian nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_nationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18970, "name": "British Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperialism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 33833, "name": "History of Colonial India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 198582, "name": "British Indian Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Indian_Empire?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 797040, "name": "Anglo-Afghan Wars", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglo-Afghan_Wars?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 883045, "name": "Indian Civil Services", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Civil_Services?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 925524, "name": "Pashtuns", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pashtuns?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 957417, "name": "North West Frontier and Afghanistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/North_West_Frontier_and_Afghanistan?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 44063306, "title": "Course Outline for 'Colonial Urbanism'", "created_at": "2020-09-10T21:55:16.021-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44063306/Course_Outline_for_Colonial_Urbanism?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_44063306", "summary": "This course is offered as an elective to third semester BA-SU students in the School of Global Affairs, Ambedkar University, Delhi.

The limited US influence in Pakistan can best be understood within the framework of patron\u2013client relationship and arms dependence. If the theory suggests anything, it is that various factors including US and Pakistan's behaviour contribute in channelling the relationship towards its apparent demise. Most important within these is China's central role in helping Pakistan indigenize its military production and diversify its arms supply. In that sense, then, China has colluded with Pakistan in indirectly limiting US influence in Pakistan and the trend suggests that this collaboration will further reduce US leverage over Pakistan.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53206430, "asset_id": 33110656, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3969980, "first_name": "Ahmed", "last_name": "Waheed", "domain_name": "qmul", "page_name": "AhmedWaheed", "display_name": "Ahmed W .

The prostitution of white women in early twentieth century Southern Africa would appear at first to constitute a classic case of imperial deviance: European prostitutes not only flouted bourgeois codes of feminine respectability; by taking Africa clients they transgressed the racial boundaries that structured settler society. By making their sexual availability public, moreover, white prostitutes presented to all in Salisbury the very visible manifestation of degraded white prestige. And yet, the colonial government (in the form of the British South Africa Company) adopted a position in favour of continued white female prostitution. The colonial state preferred to supervise rather than eliminate sexual deviance: after an almost-decade long wrangle, the argument in favour of continued prostitution was won. This paper argues that the state\u2019s position was influenced in large part by its determination to keep in check a yet more grievous form of deviance: that is, sex between white men and African women. The essay challenges, then, what has become a now-settled historical consensus: that inter-racial sex involving white women presented a far more heinous transgression than that involving white men. To be sure, the underlying interests at stake remained those of racial patriarchy; but as Southern Rhodesia emerged as an embryonic settler-state it was the emergence of respectable manhood that trumped all other concerns.

Rather than approach circular migration as an instrument of development, or a human rights problem, this paper situates it within the larger, historical debates over the status of labour that emphasise questions of surplus extraction. Drawing on ethnographic research among Bangladeshi male migrants in Singapore and return workers in Bangladesh, the paper explores two crucial moments in the life of migrants\u2014of choosing overseas contract work, and of leaving. In each moment, it highlights certain mechanisms that push migrants along the porous line between free and un-free work, incrementally toward the latter.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

written the most neglected chapter in the history of the Indian freedom struggle: on Muslims who were opposed to Partition. Based on ground-breaking research, it is an outstanding contribution which should set the record straight in great measure.\u2014Dr. Ishtiaq Ahmed, Professor Emeritus, Stockholm University.\r\nThis important study on the Partition of India, based on contemporary original sources, suggests that in 1940-2 there was more support among Muslims for an undivided India than for the Pakistan option. The failure to remember voices, such as that of Allah Bakhsh, who opposed two-nation theory vehemently and paid with his life, has helped the Hindutva camp to divert attention from its own commitment to the two-nation theory.\u2014 Dr. Richard Bonney, Professor Emeritus, University of Leicester. \r\nDr. Shamsul Islam\u2019s book is a very timely intervention in the debate about the role of Muslims in India\u2019s Partition. Relying on contemporary documents, he quashes the popular myth that India\u2019s Partition was due to Muslims. He deserves all the credit for demolishing the two-nation theory.--Dr. Ram Puniyani\r\nLINK FOR BUYING:https://pharosmedia.com/books/product/9788172211066/\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is presently available in English, Urdu and Bengali too.\r\n1.

Through our research, we learn that race and ethnicity are key dimensions of social stratification and inequality in contemporary Hong Kong society. We hope that this research can well serve as a case to illustrate the relationship between race/ethnicity and employment opportunities in Hong Kong. In this research, our target groups are the Filipinos, Indians, Nepalese and Pakistanis.\n\nThis research consists of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted between March and July 2005. We have completed 200 questionnaires with the help of ethnic minority members. The questionnaire covered four broad areas: employment situation, employment difficulties, employment assistance and lastly, their sense of belonging to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the in-depth interviews aimed to further explore the complex dynamic of employment experiences that could not be described by quantitative data in the survey, as well as to develop recommendations for improving social policies in relation to their employment conditions. Twenty in-depth discussions with South Asian ethnic minority individuals were conducted from July 2005 to March 2006.\n\nOn employment situation, almost sixty percent are employed full-time and thirteen percent of the respondents are unemployed. Among the latter, around thirty percent have been unemployed for more than a year. Considering the occupational status, slightly more than one-third are engaged in elementary occupations, close to thirty percent as service workers and shop sales workers, and around thirteen percent as clerks. Those working as managers and administrators, professionals and associate professionals amount to around nineteen percent and around three percent work as plant and machine operators and assemblers. We discover that more than seventy percent have received assistance from family members, relatives and friends in getting their current or last job, followed by around twenty percent having obtained their current or last job through newspapers, magazines or internet advertisements.\n\n\fConcerning employment difficulties, close to forty percent of the respondents have experienced some form of unemployment in the past two years and approximately sixty percent report they feel it is difficult to search for a job in Hong Kong. Three-quarters of the respondents cite not knowing Cantonese and/or Mandarin as the difficulty and slightly more than one-third feel they have been rejected for not being a Chinese person. Other difficulties reported include job advertisements being written in Chinese, their qualification not being recognized in Hong Kong, having low educational qualifications, having no-one who can help introduce jobs, the cultural and/or religious differences, lack of skills, fees of job referral agency being too high, not knowing English, age discrimination, and immigration policy. Our respondents also report having some difficulties at workplace, such as communication problems with supervisors, bosses and colleagues, not being able to receive salary on time, being bullied, having conflicts involving cultural and/or religious practices, being unreasonably fired for being an ethnic minority person, and experiencing some unequal treatment at work. The respondents were asked whether they have experienced differential treatment at work when comparing themselves with Chinese workers. On chances to be employed, half of the respondents cite they have lower prospects compared to Chinese people and on promotion opportunity, forty-two percent cite less chances than Chinese. Around one-forth feel they have more workload and higher chances of being laid off first than the Chinese workers.\n\nOn employment assistance, around one-third report having sought help from the Labour Department to search for a job. Among those who have not sought help, almost sixty percent cite not having the need to be one of the reasons, while slightly more than one quarter did not know the availability of such services in Hong Kong, and close to twenty percent consider the services to be not useful as the services are provided in Chinese. For those having sought help, they report various difficulties in using the services of the Labour Department, such as the staff not being able to find a job for them, the services being provided in Chinese, the staff not being able to understand their needs, they themselves having communication problems with the staff, and the staff not being helpful or having discriminatory attitude against them. Concerning the retraining services organized by institutes in Hong Kong, slightly more than two-third have not joined any courses. For those who have joined, close to seventy percent report having participated in courses run by the Construction Industry Training Authority (CITA). Our respondents have cited various difficulties when it comes to using retraining services in Hong Kong, such as not knowing the courses, courses being conducted in the Chinese language, not being able to find any suitable courses, time of the course not being suitable for them, course fees being too expensive, their educational qualification not meeting the entry requirements, and qualification of the courses not being useful or recognized. Generally speaking, around forty-four percent of our respondents are not satisfied with their employment situation in Hong Kong.\n\nOn the sense of belonging to Hong Kong, almost two-third of the respondents identify themselves both by their ethnic origin and as a Hong Kong person, and almost half of them express that they like Hong Kong very much. Among our respondents, two-thirds have experienced racial discrimination in Hong Kong. Therefore, while discussing their attitudes towards Hong Kong people in general, most came up with examples and personal life experiences in Hong Kong to demonstrate the presence of discrimination against them by the local people. According to the statistical data, nearly half of them express they do not find Hong Kong people to be kind and helpful, whereas a higher proportion of them report that Hong Kong people are not caring and do not treat people of different races and nationalities equally. Generally speaking, eighty-one percent of them agree that most of their friends are non-Chinese people. Although fifty-five percent report having close Chinese friends, in our in-depth discussions, most interviewees report not having close Chinese friends at all. Lastly, they tend to have strong ethnic pride as more than ninety-six percent agree they are proud of their own ethnic origin.\n\nBased on the employment situation reflected in the questionnaire survey and the opinions expressed in the in-depth interviews, we recommend policy changes and improvements in the following areas: labour legislation, retraining services, accreditation of overseas qualification, legislation against racial discrimination and multicultural policy. To improve the employment conditions of South Asian ethnic minority groups in Hong Kong, we believe that improvements in these aspects are essential to assisting them in better integrating into Hong Kong society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51543146, "asset_id": 31107815, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41717295, "first_name": "Hok Bun", "last_name": "Ku", "domain_name": "cpce-polyu", "page_name": "HokKu", "display_name": "Hok Bun  Ku", "profile_url": "https://cpce-polyu.academia.edu/HokKu?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41717295/11331335/12640951/s65_hok.ku.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25021, "name": "Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 6956123, "title": "Determinants of Unemployment - Empirical Evidences from Pakistan", "created_at": "2014-05-04T04:56:59.288-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6956123/Determinants_of_Unemployment_Empirical_Evidences_from_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_6956123", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33624761, "asset_id": 6956123, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11711173, "first_name": "Scholar", "last_name": "Pakistan", "domain_name": "pu-pk1", "page_name": "ScholarPakistan", "display_name": "Scholar Pakistan", "profile_url": "https://pu-pk1.academia.edu/ScholarPakistan?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11711173/3376827/3973542/s65_scholar.pakistan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7176, "name": "Unemployment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unemployment?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11417, "name": "Population Dynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Population_Dynamics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 843705, "name": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gross_Domestic_Product_GDP_?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 81663746, "title": "150 Years of Oriental Studies at Ca\u2019 Foscari", "created_at": "2022-06-16T21:10:29.025-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81663746/150_Years_of_Oriental_Studies_at_Ca_Foscari?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_81663746", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87630523, "asset_id": 81663746, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99604, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Biagi", "domain_name": "unive", "page_name": "PaoloBiagi", "display_name": "Paolo Biagi", "profile_url": "https://unive.academia.edu/PaoloBiagi?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99604/61122/85802/s65_paolo.biagi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1271, "name": "Near Eastern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Near_Eastern_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 544806, "name": "Far Eastern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Far_Eastern_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49000703, "title": "Intimate Connections - Love and Marriage in Pakistan's High Mountains", "created_at": "2021-05-21T01:18:24.741-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49000703/Intimate_Connections_Love_and_Marriage_in_Pakistans_High_Mountains?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_49000703", "summary": "Intimate Connections dissects ideas, feelings, and practices around love, marriage, and respectability in the remote high mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan in northern Pakistan.

These gender relations are shaped by countless factors, including embodied values of modesty and honor, vernacular fairy tales and Bollywood movies, Islamic revivalism and development initiatives. In particular, the advent of media and communication technologies has left a mark on (pre)marital relations in both South Asia and the wider Muslim world. Juxtaposing different understandings of 'love' reveals rich and manifold worlds of courtship, elopements, family dynamics, and more or less affectionate matches that are nowadays often initiated through SMS. Deep ethnographic accounts trace the relationships between young couples to show how Muslim women in a globalized world dynamically frame and negotiate circumstances in their lives.

Following this, it investigates how academic perceptions and policies have evolved in the region in response to the BRI since its inception in 2013. \r\n\r\nMost countries in the region are discussed but the emphasis is on India and Pakistan. These two states provide a unique agency, in this chapter the ability to influence or resist influence, disparity in the BRI context. The region's dominant power, India, is a staunch critic that refuses to sit at the figurative BRI table. India is exemplary of the degree to which a non-partaking actor can counter, or supplement, the BRI in its region. The region's other power, Pakistan, hosts the BRI's flagship project, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and is the single largest recipient of BRI investment. Pakistan provides insight into how a deep-seated partaker's perceptions and policies on the BRI have evolved. Moreover, this chapter grants an understanding of the BRI's interplay with South Asia's various geopolitical fissures. To permit tailored data collection, the author conducted a series of interviews with leading Indian and Pakistani academics on a non-attributive basis. \r\n\r\nPart of the LeidenAsiaCentre Book: Schneider, Florian (ed.) Global Perspectives on the Belt and Road Initiative: Asserting Agency through Regional Connectivity. Amsterdam. Amsterdam University Press 2021. DOI: 10.5117/9789463727853_CH11\r\n\r\nAbout the book: \r\nThe year 2013 saw the launch of the largest, most influential investment initiative in recent memory: China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). This globe- spanning strategy has reshaped local economies and regional networks, and it has become a contested subject for scholars and practitioners alike. How should we make sense of the complex interactions that the BRI has enabled? Understanding these processes requires truly global perspectives alongside careful attention to the role that local actors play in giving shape to individual BRI projects. \r\n\r\nThe contributions in Global Perspectives on China's Belt and Road Initiative: Asserting Agency through Regional Connectivity provide both 'big picture' assessments of China's role in regional and global interactions and detailed case studies that home in on the role agency plays in BRI dynamics. Written by leading area studies scholars with diverse disciplinary expertise, this book reveals how Chinese efforts to recalibrate the world are taken up, challenged, revamped, and reworked in diverse contexts around the world.\r\n\r\nAll right in this chapter (11) are reserved and in particular further distribution is prohibited.

First, the article traces the nationalisation of Creole culture \u2013 defined in terms of African- European syncretism \u2013 from the 1950s onwards, and it describes the state\u2019s use of music competitions and educational programmes to institutionalise Carnival, calypso, and steel pan, all associated largely with African Trinidadian culture. This impacted on Indian Trinidadians by excluding them from inscriptions of national identity. The article concludes with a discussion of Indian Trinidadian cultural resurgence, tassa competitions, and the growth of public pedagogy from the 1970s that established tassa as an icon of Indianness; and all illustrating how music was used in a complex decolonisation process (relating to colonial rule and the Creole mainstream).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58372972, "asset_id": 38322948, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 304455, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Ballengee", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChristopherBallengee", "display_name": "Christopher L Ballengee", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChristopherBallengee?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/304455/75091/18852692/s65_christopher.ballengee.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1250, "name": "Latin American and Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_and_Caribbean_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13144, "name": "Indian Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 16088, "name": "Creolization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creolization?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 53334, "name": "Indian Indenture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Indenture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 160774, "name": "Calypso", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Calypso?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 261203, "name": "Impact of Steelpan in Trinidad and Tobago", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Steelpan_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 864283, "name": "Steelband", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Steelband?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2853599, "name": "tassa drumming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/tassa_drumming?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 35892357, "title": "Court.

It was the third Marathi movie within 10 years to enter the Academy Awards (Oscars) as India's representation in the category Best Foreign Language Film and got high ratings by critics. In many of the characteristics Court can be contextualized within the emerging film form of The New Marathi film that started with Shwaas in 2004 and in the bigger picture also as a hatke i.e. Multiplex film or Global Art cinema. However, Court seems to break through the new established aesthetics and modes of action with its ethnographic  approach that is reflected in a plain and unemotional realism 'on stage' as well as in its almost participatory research behind the scenes. This paper aims at exploring Court's cinematic realism with a particular focus on the movie's interaction with the tradition of Marathi Dalit poetry and the Lokshahiri (people's poets) opposing Hindu nationalist ideas and only briefly touching the depiction of the everyday life of the courtroom and the parties (individuals) that appear in it. Hence, this realism is treated as the premiere key to success of the movie. On the other hand the paper puts a question mark to what kind of reality is represented here with regard to the political realities in Mumbai and Maharashtra.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55772356, "asset_id": 35892357, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76325037, "first_name": "Anne", "last_name": "Keienburg", "domain_name": "uni-heidelberg", "page_name": "AnneKeienburg", "display_name": "Anne Keienburg", "profile_url": "https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/AnneKeienburg?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76325037/19016948/18964756/s65_anne.keienburg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2502337, "name": "Marathi Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marathi_Cinema?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26372875, "title": "Tourist Places at Kanyakumari District in Tamilnadu", "created_at": "2016-06-21T07:26:48.792-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26372875/Tourist_Places_at_Kanyakumari_District_in_Tamilnadu?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_26372875", "summary": "Tourism is a fast growing industry which has vast and inexhaustible potentials to enhance national income, foreign exchange reserves and opportunities of employment to the growing millions or the countries.

In Climate Change and the Art of Devotion, Sugata Ray shows how this place-centered theology emerged in the wake of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1550\u20131850), an epoch marked by climatic catastrophes across the globe. Using the frame of geoaesthetics, he compares early modern conceptions of the environment and current assumptions about nature and culture.\r\nA groundbreaking contribution to the emerging field of eco\u2013art history, the book examines architecture, paintings, photography, and prints created in Braj alongside theological treatises and devotional poetry to foreground seepages between the natural ecosystem and cultural production. The paintings of deified rivers, temples that emulate fragrant groves, and talismanic bleeding rocks that Ray discusses will captivate readers interested in environmental humanities and South Asian art history. \r\n\r\n'A wonderfully imaginative addition to the growing body of literature on the Little Ice Age. Sugata Ray traces the influence of climatic variations on South Asian art, architecture, and devotional practices with extraordinary interpretive skill.'\u2015Amitav Ghosh, Author, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable\r\n\r\n'The rocks, rivers, forests, plants, animals, and even the skies of the Mathura-Vrindavan region in north India come alive as historical agents acting alongside humans in Ray's pioneering and imaginative attempt to develop a geoaesthetic approach to the study of Hindu religious art and architecture over a period ranging from the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century. His impressive ability to connect events in the realm of aesthetics and religious devotion with the climatic impact of the Little Ice Age in South Asia, is bound to influence debates in art history in South Asia and beyond. A brilliant achievement.'\u2015Dipesh Chakrabarty, Lawrence A. Kimpton Distinguished Professor of History, South Asian Languages and Civilizations, University of Chicago\r\n\r\n'Sugata Ray's Climate Change and the Art of Devotion draws an unexpected and strikingly original connection between the catastrophic consequences of the Little Ice Age (c. 1550-1850) and the rise of a site-specific theology at the pilgrim centre of Braj in India. This scholarly, elegantly written art historical monograph that skillfully combines archival scholarship with theoretical sophistication, makes a powerful contribution to recent debates on the environmental crisis in the present Anthropocene epoch.'\u2015Partha Mitter, author of The Triumph of Modernism: India's Artists and the Avant-Garde \u2013 1922-1947\r\n\r\n'Sugata Ray\u2019s important book represents a bold attempt to frame a new ecology of art and to engage with local ways of thinking that have not been previously been incorporated into scholarship. It should gain a wide audience.'\u2014Thomas DaCosta Kaufmann, Frederick Marquand Professor, Department of Art & Archaeology, Princeton University\r\n\r\n'A bold and ambitious project that takes on a sweeping range of issues across both the humanities and social sciences. Ray brings core Indian material into dialogue with current conversations about the relationship between the human and nonhuman, between materiality and immateriality, and climate change and visual culture. The book serves as a challenge to future scholars to expand the range of their own conversations.'\u2015Tamara Sears, author of Worldly Gurus and Spiritual Kings: Architecture and Asceticism in Medieval India\r\n\r\nhttps://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295745374/climate-change-and-the-art-of-devotion/\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60925969, "asset_id": 40644620, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22836427, "first_name": "Sugata", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "berkeley", "page_name": "SugataRay", "display_name": "Sugata Ray", "profile_url": "https://berkeley.academia.edu/SugataRay?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22836427/6202737/7027450/s65_sugata.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10934, "name": "Vaishnavism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vaishnavism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11072, "name": "Mughal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mughal_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19091, "name": "South Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 182364, "name": "Little Ice Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Little_Ice_Age?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1027629, "name": "Braj", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Braj?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3005630, "name": "Eco Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eco_Art_History-1?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 39718962, "title": "Dog Fighting: Performing Masculinity in Rural South Punjab, Pakistan", "created_at": "2019-06-29T01:11:35.420-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39718962/Dog_Fighting_Performing_Masculinity_in_Rural_South_Punjab_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_39718962", "summary": "Dog fighting, along with other nonhuman-animal-fighting activities, is a popular pastime in rural South Punjab, Pakistan.

How can we understand a political terrain that appears crowded with the dead, heroic figures from past struggles who call the living to account and demand action? What role do these 'afterlives' play in the inauguration of new politics and the fashioning of possible futures? In this engaging and innovative analysis of anti-colonial afterlives in modern South Asia, Chris Moffat crafts a framework that takes the dead seriously - not as passive entities, ceremonially invoked, but as active interlocutors and instigators in the present. Focusing on the iconic revolutionary martyr Bhagat Singh (1907\u20131931), Moffat establishes the problem of inheritance as central to the forms and futures of democracy in this postcolonial polity. Tracing Bhagat Singh's revenant presence in India today, he demonstrates how living communities are animated by a sense of obligation, duty or debt to the dead.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

enterprises of early capitalism \u2013 the British East India Company (1600\u20131874). The study focuses on its transformation in India from a merchant corporation into a territorial power in the eighteenth century. The author underlines the Company\u2019s initial hybridism and traces the fulfilling of its hidden power potential. This fulfilling turned the trading firm into a simultaneous competitor of two types of political structures, i.e. Indian patrimonies and British state. Treats of similarity of the Company with both these types are distinguished. On their basis the article explains the causes for the Company\u2019s victory over patrimonies and its loss to the state in the nineteenth century. The author concludes that the East India Company as a monopolistic trading organization was inadequate to industrial capital and the personifier of its function, i.e. the state. The case of the East India Company\u2019s institutional mutation stresses mutual dependence and mutual transition of the political and economic spheres of life which have become especially evident in the epoch of globalization.

Raj (1952\u20132008) was one of the most important scholars of popular Indian Christianity and South Asian religion in North America. Vernacular Catholicism, Vernacular Saints gathers together, for the first time in a single volume, a series of his groundbreaking studies on the distinctively \u201cvernacular\u201d Catholic traditions of Tamil Nadu in southeast India. This collection, which focuses on four rural shrines, highlights ritual variety and ritual transgression in Tamil Catholic practice and offers clues to the ritual exchange, religious hybridity, and dialogue occurring at the grassroots level between Tamil Catholics and their Hindu and Muslim neighbors. Raj also advances a new and alternative paradigm for interreligious dialogue that radically differs from models advocated by theologians, clergy, and other religious elite. In addition, essays by other leading scholars of Indian Christianity and South Asian religions\u2014Michael Amaladoss, Purushottama Bilimoria, Corinne G. Dempsey, Eliza F. Kent, and Vasudha Narayanan\u2014are included that amplify and creatively extend Raj\u2019s work.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53183582, "asset_id": 33082423, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4117115, "first_name": "Reid", "last_name": "Locklin", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "ReidLocklin", "display_name": "Reid Locklin", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/ReidLocklin?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4117115/1593455/1926871/s65_reid.locklin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 109, "name": "Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20770, "name": "Tamil Nadu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tamil_Nadu?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 29547, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41501, "name": "Catholicism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catholicism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 32453483, "title": "Curriculum Vitae of suhaib jm", "created_at": "2017-04-17T01:20:49.722-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32453483/Curriculum_Vitae_of_suhaib_jm?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_32453483", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52643663, "asset_id": 32453483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63076711, "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Anhath", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MohamedAnhath", "display_name": "Mohamed Anhath", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MohamedAnhath?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63076711/16369902/16750622/s65_mohamed.anhath.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28540717, "title": "From the Margins: Review of Navras Jaat Aafreedi's JEWS, JUDAIZING MOVEMENTS AND THE TRADITIONS OF ISRAELITE DESCENT IN SOUTH ASIA (2016)", "created_at": "2016-09-16T12:58:13.560-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28540717/From_the_Margins_Review_of_Navras_Jaat_Aafreedis_JEWS_JUDAIZING_MOVEMENTS_AND_THE_TRADITIONS_OF_ISRAELITE_DESCENT_IN_SOUTH_ASIA_2016_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_28540717", "summary": "\"...a successful attempt at discussing the history of Jews in India, and in initiating a dialogue for introducing Indo-Judaic studies in Southasia.

"work_4752267", "summary": "Nestled in the Himalayan foothills of Northeast India, Darjeeling is synonymous with some of the finest and most expensive tea in the world. It is also home to a violent movement for regional autonomy that, like the tea industry, dates back to the days of colonial rule.\r\n\r\nIn this nuanced ethnography, Sarah Besky narrates the lives of tea workers in Darjeeling. She explores how notions of fairness, value, and justice shifted with the rise of fair-trade practices and postcolonial separatist politics in the region. This is the first book to explore how fair-trade operates in the context of large-scale plantations. \r\n\r\nReaders in a variety of disciplines\u2014anthropology, sociology, geography, environmental studies, and food studies\u2014will gain a critical perspective on how plantation life is changing as Darjeeling struggles to reinvent its signature commodity for twenty-first-century consumers. The Darjeeling Distinction challenges fair-trade policy and practice, exposing how trade initiatives often fail to consider the larger environmental, historical, and sociopolitical forces that shape the lives of the people they intended to support.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37736232, "asset_id": 4752267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Despite being ruled by the Federal Government in Karachi, and later in Islamabad, since the partition of British India, Gilgit-Baltistan\u2019s legal-constitutional status remains an ambiguous and peculiar one as Gilgit-Baltistan is not constitutionally part of Pakistan, with Islamabad historically conceptualizing Gilgit-Baltistan as a semi-autonomous region within Pakistan which legal status

"summary": "A larger game is at play with respect to the field of transgender subjectivities in India that goes beyond gender or sexuality, and enters the arena of contested cultures and historical erasures. It can be hypothesized that a contemporary transgender subject in India finds itself caught between the fading voice of precolonial and colonial history on the one hand, and the strong pull of globalization on the other, creating what can perhaps be imagined as a knotted relation of the (transgender) subject with historicity and temporality. A rather confounding gap lies between premodern conceptualizations of gender and sexuality that reside as cultural memory in the subject, carrying its own paleonymic weight, and the increasingly widening signifier transgender in the contemporary. The task of this article is to explore what can be found at this interstice, which promises a clue that is symptomatic of the shifting sands of culture, history, and memory as they play out in India, and how they may point toward a theorization of sexuality that lies away from its histories in the West.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67727386, "asset_id": 49353530, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1118635, "first_name": "Shraddha", "last_name": "Chatterjee", "domain_name": "yorku", "page_name": "ShraddhaChatterjee", "display_name": "Shraddha  Chatterjee", "profile_url": "https://yorku.academia.edu/ShraddhaChatterjee?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1118635/843832/40440966/s65_shraddha.chatterjee.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 8230, "name": "Socio-legal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socio-legal_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 72394, "name": "LGBT Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 35973356, "title": "Emergence of Separatist Movement in East Pakistan: Impact of Jinnah's Leadership", "created_at": "2018-02-20T17:47:12.449-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35973356/Emergence_of_Separatist_Movement_in_East_Pakistan_Impact_of_Jinnahs_Leadership?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35973356", "summary": "This paper offers a study of the impact of leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah on the Bengali Separatist Movement in its preliminary stage during the first year of the life of Pakistan when Quaid-i-Azam served as its first governor general. It would be examined whether the lingual, constitutional, economic and governmental issues, which later became a source of discontent that caused the Bengali Separatist Movement grow, were addressed by the Quaid-i-Azam Jinnah in a proper way and he did not found those mistakes which his successors in the leadership of Pakistan committed. It would also be observed that visionary leader of Quaid-i-Azam's rank could understand the danger to the integrity of Pakistan posed by the feelings of provincialism, communism and Hindu influence in the eastern wing of Pakistan that was remote from its western part through a distance of one thousand miles. The paper will also provide a critical analysis of the steps of Quaid-i-Azam which he took for the purpose of the solidarity of newly born state of Pakistan but which steps were allegedly used as a negative propaganda against the founder of Pakistan in order to give air to the ideas of separatism in the Bengalis. In this context the Quaid's decision for the selection of Karachi as the capital of Pakistan and his use of powers as the governor general of Pakistan would be analyzed. Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah is undoubtedly, one of the greatest politicians in the istoryh of the world. Undaunted by the huge odds presented by his political adversaries, he achieved such success that few politicians can boast of. (Siddiqui, 2009, xix) Hodson (1969, 37-38) credits him with the whole process of the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan by observing: \" Of all the personalities in the last act of the great drama of India's rebirth to independence, Mohammad Ali Jinnah is at once the most enigmatic and the most important. \" Pethick-Lawrance, who as Secretary of State for India had turned down the demand for Pakistan, acknowledged: 'He had, of course, immense powers of intellect and also of persuasive eloquence which he used with such effect that the idea [of Pakistan], which was at firs as idea only, became in the end a reality.' (Burke, 2009, l xiii) As a politician he attained world stature and won a permanent place in history. He did not only win independence from colonial rule for an existing country, but performed the extraordinary feat of bringing an altogether new independent country into existence against seemingly impossible odds.

In particular, I analyse colonial attempts to erase hijras as a visible socio-cultural category and gender identity in public space through the prohibition of their performances and feminine dress. This case study demonstrates, first, how masculinity intersected with a broad range of colonial projects, agendas and anxieties. Focusing on the problematic presence of cross-dressing and performing hijras in public space, I examine how colonial attempts to order public space and reinforce political borders dovetailed with discourses of masculinity, obscenity and contagion. Second, I argue that attempts to discipline masculinity and obscenity were uneven in practice, meaning the CTA had varying localised impacts upon hijras. The lack of interest of some British officials in regulating hijras, inadequate policing resources, and pragmatic compromises opened up gaps in surveillance that hijras grasped and expanded, frustrating colonial attempts to transform their bodies and behaviours.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39084094, "asset_id": 7223064, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12554041, "first_name": "Jessica", "last_name": "Hinchy", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "JessicaHinchy", "display_name": "Jessica Hinchy", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/JessicaHinchy?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12554041/3583056/19097470/s65_jessica.hinchy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 535, "name": "Criminal Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Law-1?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35387574, "title": "Electronic Reservation Slip IRCTC E-Ticketing Service(Agent", "created_at": "2017-12-09T12:21:20.711-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35387574/Electronic_Reservation_Slip_IRCTC_E_Ticketing_Service_Agent?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35387574", "summary": "This ticket will be valid with an ID proof in original.

In particular, masculinity and Muslimness emerge as salient performances through which sovereign attachments are harnessed.

Ultimately she designed her grand strategy according to the utmost aspirations. For acquisition of the status of a big power nuclear technology is a prerequisite. India had found U.S to get assistance in nuclear technology. Initially, it was civil nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes but in 21 st century this was turned into Indo-U.S nuclear deal. This deal was announced by Bush in 2005. This deal had a unique status in U.S nuclear history. The different quarters of non-proliferation regime criticized this deal and declare it a danger to world peace. The deal was declared as agreement of discrimination by its critics. This unprecedented nuclear cooperation between US and India would not only trigger a new arms race but also undermine strategic equilibrium in South Asian region. Specifically, Pakistan is the major victim of this deal as this deal could disturb balance of power between India and Pakistan. In this study, we will examine the history of Indo-U.S nuclear cooperation. We will discuss and analyses different perspectives of indo-US nuclear deal, flaws in the deal and criticism on the deal.

Yet, even now, the indigenous Gonds mine diamonds artisanally in a remote location in central India, largely hidden away from public vision. This article presents an exposition of artisanal diamond mining in central India from the humanistic tradition in geography to illuminate the \u201crealm\u201d of the Gonds, where magic and social relations rule imaginaries of the diamonds in the particular place. It argues that the imaginations of diamonds and their mining by indigenous miners in Panna are shaped through the prism of their particular regional history, myth, geography, and culture. Without faith in the restrictive authority of science, capital, and state, and refusing domestication, the miners dig, smuggle, and spend for the savoir vivre. They remain dynamic and rely on traditional ideas of luck, masculinity, and success. They bind themselves to work and to each other in ways that preclude the possibility of amassing wealth and direct wealth in ways that reaffirm their dependence on the miner's life. The argument is illustrated through the story of protagonist Ramu, who proudly spends the earnings from his big diamond find. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Panna, Madhya Pradesh State in central India, this article explores the magic of artisanal diamond mining, shows how place shapes such mining, and shows how informal mining shapes the context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56439927, "asset_id": 36521218, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3829413, "first_name": "Arnab", "last_name": "RoyChowdhury", "domain_name": "hse-ru", "page_name": "ArnabRoyChowdhury", "display_name": "Arnab RoyChowdhury", "profile_url": "https://hse-ru.academia.edu/ArnabRoyChowdhury?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3829413/5761250/6668414/s65_arnab.roy_chowdhury.jpg"}, {"id": 156631, "first_name": "Kuntala", "last_name": "Lahiri-Dutt", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "KuntalaLahiriDutt", "display_name": "Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/KuntalaLahiriDutt?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/156631/86903/94846/s65_kuntala.lahiri-dutt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8331, "name": "Indigenous Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Knowledge?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18496, "name": "Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mining?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 65038, "name": "Tribal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tribal_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 78133, "name": "Gondwana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gondwana?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 106363, "name": "Diamonds", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diamonds?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 161855, "name": "Artisanal and Small-scale Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artisanal_and_Small-scale_Mining?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 34990450, "title": "A Sound Bridge: Listening for the Political in a Digital Age", "created_at": "2017-10-29T09:40:58.620-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34990450/A_Sound_Bridge_Listening_for_the_Political_in_a_Digital_Age?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_34990450", "summary": "This article examines how catchy sounds (\u201cWhy This Kolaveri\u201d [\u201cWhy This Murderous Rage\u201d]) can function as sonic cues for political participation.

Suggesting that sound technologies and practices constitute vital cultural and material infrastructures on which a bridge between the popular and the political can be built, we argue that cases like #Kolaveri disclose new ways of listening for the political and new modes of participation\u2015the expression of sonic citizenship\u2015in a digital era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54855181, "asset_id": 34990450, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 338198, "first_name": "aswin", "last_name": "punathambekar", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "aswinpunathambekar", "display_name": "aswin punathambekar", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/aswinpunathambekar?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/338198/167187/4950463/s65_aswin.punathambekar.jpg"}, {"id": 1007962, "first_name": "Sriram", "last_name": "Mohan", "domain_name": "umich", "page_name": "SriramMohan", "display_name": "Sriram Mohan", "profile_url": "https://umich.academia.edu/SriramMohan?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1007962/11508182/35937323/s65_sriram.mohan.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7212, "name": "Sound studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24715, "name": "Media Convergence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Convergence?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99126, "name": "Digital Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1976556, "name": "InterAsian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/InterAsian_studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 32859673, "title": "A Prehistory of Violence?

The country's 380 million urban population as of 2011 is projected to swell to over 600 million by 2030 and almost 900 million by 2050. These processes of urbanization and urban growth are embedded in and shape complex political, social, demographic, environmental and ethno-religious contexts; and while the developmental advantages to urban modes of living are clear, urbanization in India comes with its own set of challenges. This introduction outlines the current special issue, which collects six articles that reflect on three key themes in contemporary urban India: urban governance and planning; social, economic and political exclusion and the conflicts this may engender; and climate change in Indian cities. Here we briefly contextualise some of these issues, and reflect on some of the cross-cutting themes that individual articles in this issue address. Our hope is that this volume contributes to debates on the dynamics of governance, inclusiveness, security and prosperity in today's urban India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43873475,

This process began during the First World War and the study analyses data up until the beginning of the era identified as that of mass-migration and marked by the British Nationality Act,1948. The evidence for Sheffield-area settlement challenges the current understanding of interwar Britain\u2019s non-elite Indian population as comprised almost entirely of seafaring sojourners rather than of settlers. The settlement, previously unnoticed by historians, also invites us to reconsider our understanding of \u2018race relations\u2019 during the period. Our current observations of British attitudes toward race during the interwar period tends to be through a lens distorted by the 1919-20 race riots in a number of British home-ports. In contrast, this new evidence suggests that levels of everyday inter-racial tolerance within working-class districts may have been higher, more widespread and of a different nature than has been previously assumed. This possibility is raised due to investigation using a new methodology for migration history using General Register Office data for births, marriages and deaths, particularly the many marriage records of white natives and non-white newcomers. Moreover, it appears that the Sheffield-area settlement remained unnoticed because it did not generate the hostility that produced the records migration historians have tended to rely upon as primary sources, such as Home Office documents and press reports of the \u2018problems\u2019 of \u2018miscegenation\u2019 and \u2018half-caste\u2019 children. The data examined by this study form part of my nationwide study into marriages between natives of Britain and Muslim newcomers, supporting an argument that permanent non-white settlement in Britain began in earnest well before 1948.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65737654, "asset_id": 45160255, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41112798, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Holland", "domain_name": "sheffield", "page_name": "DavidHolland", "display_name": "David Holland", "profile_url": "https://sheffield.academia.edu/DavidHolland?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41112798/12951738/14320618/s65_david.holland.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4374, "name": "Immigration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7543, "name": "Modern British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_British_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28115, "name": "South Asian Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Diasporas?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 47327, "name": "Working Class Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Class_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 62223, "name": "Working-Class History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working-Class_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 165681, "name": "Working class culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_class_culture?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 41023711, "title": "\"A Vital Mediation: The Sanatorium, before and after Antibiotics,\" Technology and Culture 60(4): 979-1003", "created_at": "2019-11-22T12:01:49.135-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41023711/_A_Vital_Mediation_The_Sanatorium_before_and_after_Antibiotics_Technology_and_Culture_60_4_979_1003?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_41023711", "summary": "As drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis spread across India, commentators have warned that we are returning to the sanatorium era.

Rather than lamenting the end of the antibiotic era, I shift the focus to ask about the sanatorium, not simply as a technology of the past, but as a technology of an imminent future. In examining late nineteenth-and early twentieth century conversations about treating tuberculosis in India, I demonstrate how the the sanatorium was figured as a therapeutic technology that mediated the relationship between the body and its colonial milieu. In this light, I argue that contemporary prophecies of a future past register not simply the loss of antibiotic efficacy, but also a desire to return to a therapeutics that foregrounds issues of vitality, mediation, and environment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61303312, "asset_id": 41023711, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3949586, "first_name": "Bharat", "last_name": "Venkat", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "BharatVenkat", "display_name": "Bharat J Venkat", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/BharatVenkat?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3949586/3927370/28753904/s65_bharat.venkat.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557, "name": "History of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Technology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13514, "name": "STS (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/STS_Anthropology_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 62235, "name": "Tuberculosis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tuberculosis?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1744493, "name": "Science and Technology Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_and_Technology_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 39303727, "title": "Histories, memories and the male gaze: The Mumbai riots in Bombay", "created_at": "2019-05-29T09:59:41.369-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39303727/Histories_memories_and_the_male_gaze_The_Mumbai_riots_in_Bombay?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_39303727", "summary": "Manufacturing dissent in the name of history, its instrumentalisation for political purposes and bloodshed over its competing versions are the hallmarks of the Hindu Muslim schism prevalent in India. A recurring feature in Indian historiography is its rupture in the form of riots leading to human casualty. In this context, through an attempt to read the 1992 Mumbai riots as a quagmire of power politics, I would like to propose that a popular film like Mani Ratnam\u2019s Bombay stabilises the secularist notion of unity in diversity amidst voices of dissent. The top down memory of trauma and hatred which percolates from the records of \u2018official\u2019 history is neutralised to a certain extent by the bottom up memory induced by an \u2018imagined\u2019 account which loiters in the popular psyche of generations. The film thus becomes a striking example of a neutraliser of memory. But a more nuanced reading shows how the director has skilfully projected the principle of equivalence from among the multiplicity of gazes to the axis of male gaze in order to conceal the play of ideologies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59826479, "asset_id": 39303727, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7044976, "first_name": "Smithi", "last_name": "Mohan", "domain_name": "keralauniversity", "page_name": "SmithiMohan", "display_name": "Smithi Mohan", "profile_url": "https://keralauniversity.academia.edu/SmithiMohan?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7044976/26188961/24795318/s65_smithi.mohan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1568, "name": "Film Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Theory?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18277, "name": "Hindi Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindi_Cinema?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 42298, "name": "Film and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 124046, "name": "Bollywood cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bollywood_cinema?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 170908, "name": "Indian Cinema, Bollywood, Film Studies, South Asia, Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Cinema_Bollywood_Film_Studies_South_Asia_Media?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 444305, "name": "Film and television studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_television_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1134374, "name": "Gender and Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Film?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33095434, "title": "'Uncertain Journeys: Return migration, home, and uncertainty for a displaced Kashmiri community' (2017) Modern Asian Studies, Volume 51(4):1099-1125", "created_at": "2017-05-19T04:43:56.504-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33095434/Uncertain_Journeys_Return_migration_home_and_uncertainty_for_a_displaced_Kashmiri_community_2017_Modern_Asian_Studies_Volume_51_4_1099_1125?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33095434", "summary": "This article explores situations in which forced migrants revisit places and homes they had fled from, drawing on research carried out among Kashmiri Hindus, better known as Pandits, who were displaced following the outbreak of conflict in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990. Due to the breakdown of law and order, selective attacks, and a climate of fear, most of the community had relocated from the Kashmir valley to the south in Jammu and to even cities such as New Delhi, constituting one of the most prominent groups of Internally Displaced Persons in the region. While there is an interest in repatriation/resettlement in scholarship and policy, the experiences of the Pandits reveal the multiple meanings \u2018return\u2019 holds for the displaced. This article will draw on the experiences of Pandit forced migrants in Jammu who have returned to visit Kashmir. Their experiences will be situated with work on return migration, the Kashmir conflict, and the political location of the Pandits in the region. The article argues that return migration is an inconclusive phenomenon that critically raises questions of home and uncertainty, and provides a way to understand how the displaced locate themselves in the world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53255670, "asset_id": 33095434, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41950820, "first_name": "Ankur", "last_name": "Datta", "domain_name": "southasianuniversity", "page_name": "AnkurDatta", "display_name": "Ankur Datta", "profile_url": "https://southasianuniversity.academia.edu/AnkurDatta?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41950820/11340737/15476811/s65_ankur.datta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14580, "name": "Forced Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 362278, "name": "Kashmir Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir_Conflict?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 381229, "name": "Jammu and Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jammu_and_Kashmir?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1755243, "name": "Kashmiri Pandits", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmiri_Pandits?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 6205534, "title": "On South Asian Diasporas", "created_at": "2014-02-25T10:52:14.907-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6205534/On_South_Asian_Diasporas?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_6205534", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33080002, "asset_id": 6205534, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 451571, "first_name": "Priya", "last_name": "Kumar", "domain_name": "du-in", "page_name": "KumarPriya", "display_name": "Priya Kumar", "profile_url": "https://du-in.academia.edu/KumarPriya?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/451571/147186/171031/s65_priya.kumar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 53076, "name": "Diaspora, Indian Writing in English, Post colonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Indian_Writing_in_English_Post_colonial_Theory?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 75584046, "title": "The Representation of LGBTQ Community in Indian Parallel Cinema and Its Audience Reception", "created_at": "2022-04-05T21:10:24.377-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75584046/The_Representation_of_LGBTQ_Community_in_Indian_Parallel_Cinema_and_Its_Audience_Reception?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_75584046", "summary": "Fairly recently in 2018, Section 377 of the Indian Constitution was scrapped by the Supreme Court of India which criminalized homosexuality. Quite unfortunately, it took India almost 160 years to abolish a law introduced by the British during the colonial rule. LGBTQ issues are comparatively new in India and to a great extent is still considered scandalous, controversial and unacceptable. Literary works are a great medium to normalize the issue in society but is extremely difficult to achieve in India, at least not in any near future. With so little opportunity of getting some basic primary education, this level of knowledge cannot be achieved and will also be deemed scandalous and highly objectionable. The only other medium available, and perhaps more popular, is media, more specifically television/movies. Visual images and motion pictures are more welcoming to most people than books. Contemporary Indian Parallel or New Wave Cinema have begun portraying the lives and voicing the issues of alternative genders which, for long, has been suppressed. The paper focuses on the authentic representation of LGBTQ community in Indian Parallel Cinema and its audience reception, how they portray these issues to educate the audience and how have they been received by the spectators. Focusing on selected films of Rituparno Ghosh, the paper investigates the films that question the beliefs, perspectives and misconceptions regarding the issues and work on how better ways they can be portrayed in cinema to leave an impact on the spectators, thus pushing towards a healthier society.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 146503664, "first_name": "Darshana",

By comparing the processes of decolonization across three of the major modern empires, from the aftermath of the First World War to the late 20th century, the authors are able to analyse decolonization as a long-term process. They explore significant changes to the international system, shifting popular attitudes to colonialism and the economics of empire. This new edition incorporates the latest developments in the historiography, as well as:- Increased coverage of the Belgian and Portuguese empires- New introductions to each of the three main parts, offering some background and context to British, French and Dutch decolonization- More coverage of cultural aspects of decolonization, exploring empire 'from below'- A new glossary, explaining key terms This new edition of Crises of Empire is essential reading for all students of imperial history and decolonization. In particular, it will be welcomed by those who are interested in taking a comparative approach, putting the history of decolonization in a pan-European framework.\r\n\r\nReviews:-\r\n\r\n'In this book, Thomas, Butler and Moore admirably accomplish the goal of combining intellectual and historiographical rigour with the breadth of discussion necessary for a textbook. As one of the few treatments of its kind, it connects the disintegration of various empires. Juxtaposing the fates of the British, French and Dutch empires, supplemented with some comparative observations about the Belgian and Portuguese experiences, the authors show that decolonization cannot be fully understood if treated within the isolation of any one of these cases. The careful balance in this volume between conceptual discussion of current historiographical debates and thorough empirical treatment of the various decolonizations makes this volume an invaluable resource for students and researchers alike.' Bart Luttikhuis, Researcher at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies, The Netherlands\r\n \r\n'An outstanding collection of essays dealing with the decolonization of the Dutch, Belgian, and Portuguese empires as well as those of the French and British. With a range from the 1940s to the 1970s and beyond, the authors guide the reader through complex conceptual issues in a way that is consistently clear and compelling. This is a book that will be mandatory reading for students and scholars of the dissolution of the European colonial empires.' Wm. Roger Louis, Kerr Professor, University of Texas\r\n\r\n'This second edition of Thomas's, Moore's and Butler's incisive, thought-provoking and generally deeply impressive synthesis is very welcome. Like the first edition, it is written in an engaging style by three experts in their respective decolonisation fields and it will prove a key launch pad for further research into the expansive literature and ever-evolving debates on the causes and consequences of European decolonisation. The sections relating to the different empires and case-studies of particular territories can be read alone. But the beauty of this book lies in its high level of comparative analysis, with commonalities and contrasts skilfully brought out in the masterful introduction and conclusion. The focus remains on the three largest empires of Britain, France and The Netherlands but the excellent section on the Portuguese and Belgian end-of-empire experiences has been significantly expanded. Throughout, the text has been updated to take account of new historiographical developments since the first edition's publication in 2008. It pulls no punches in its exploration of the often fraught and violent ending of the European empires, and the ongoing legacies and unresolved contestations of the decolonisation moment.'

The ramifications of having been a deep state for far too long have only made Pakistan a sorcerer\u2019s apprentice, severely affecting its civilians. The apparent relationship between the state and terror groups flay the negative image of the country across the world. Pakistan internationally is described as \u2018dangerous\u2019, \u2018unstable\u2019, \u2018terrorist incubator\u2019, \u2018fragile\u2019, and \u2018intolerant\u2019. These negative descriptions are based upon harsh facts which otherwise are denied in Pakistan\u2019s nationalistic discourse. Intellectual nationals raising the undesirable realities of Pakistan are often labelled anti-national and unpatriotic. Dissenters are vilified for challenging the regime covertly controlled by a nuclear-armed military. One such dissenting public figure in Pakistan is Husain Haqqani. Haqqani is a former ambassador of Pakistan to the United States and High Commissioner of Pakistan to Sri Lanka. He is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, US and the founder of the South Asians against Terrorism and for Human Rights (SAATH) Forum. He criticises Pakistan\u2019s volatile semi-authoritarian regime. He incessantly moots for an undiluted democracy. He has poignantly phrased \u201ca dysfunctional nuclear state\u201d to describe the reality of Pakistan in his seminal book Reimagining Pakistan: Transforming a Dysfunctional Nuclear State. The book resonates the outlook of Carl Schurz\u2019s phrase: \u2018My country, right or wrong; if right, to be kept right; and, if wrong, to be set right.\u2019", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65083568, "asset_id": 44617395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5193545, "first_name": "Namita", "last_name": "Barthwal", "domain_name": "jmi", "page_name": "NamitaBarthwal", "display_name": "Namita Barthwal", "profile_url": "https://jmi.academia.edu/NamitaBarthwal?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5193545/2288163/41899357/s65_namita.barthwal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45019, "name": "Islamic Movements and Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movements_and_Political_Islam?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 227410, "name": "India-Pakistan Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India-Pakistan_Relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 637349, "name": "Civil-Military Relations in Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil-Military_Relations_in_Pakistan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1007844, "name": "Muslim Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Society?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 43711383, "title": "Tantra: Enlightenment to Revolution (London: Thames & Hudson / British Museum, 2020).", "created_at": "2020-07-25T10:07:21.124-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43711383/Tantra_Enlightenment_to_Revolution_London_Thames_and_Hudson_British_Museum_2020_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_43711383", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64018291, "asset_id": 43711383, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 928821, "first_name": "Imma", "last_name": "Ramos", "domain_name": "britishmuseum", "page_name": "ImmaRamos", "display_name": "Imma  Ramos", "profile_url": "https://britishmuseum.academia.edu/ImmaRamos?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/928821/348498/35785550/s65_imma.ramos.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19091, "name": "South Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Art?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26474, "name": "Tantra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tantra?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 54355308, "title": "PARTITION AS BORDER-MAKING: East Bengal, East Pakistan and Bangladesh", "created_at": "2021-09-30T08:48:20.471-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54355308/PARTITION_AS_BORDER_MAKING_East_Bengal_East_Pakistan_and_Bangladesh?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_54355308", "summary": "This book critically analyzes the Partition experiences from East Bengal in 1947 and its prolonged aftermath leading to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971. It looks at how newly emerged borderlands at the time of Partition affected lives and triggered prolonged consequences for the people living in East Bengal/Bangladesh. The author brings to the fore unheard voices and unexplored narratives, especially those relating the experience of different groups of Muslims in the midst of the falling apart of the unifed Muslim identity. Drawing on in-depth ethnographic research and archival resources, the volume analyzes various themes such as partition literature, local narratives of border-making, smuggling, border violence, refugees, identity conficts, border crossing, and experiences of the Bihari Muslims and the Hindus of East Pakistan, among others.

Using the case of a village in Rajasthan that was dispossessed for a private Special Economic Zone, the book ethnographically illustrates the exclusionary trajectory of capitalism driving dispossession in contemporary India. Taking us into the lives of diverse villagers in \"Rajpura,\" the book meticulously documents the destruction of agricultural livelihoods, the marginalization of rural labor, the spatial uneveness of infrastructure provision, and the dramatic consequences of real estate speculation for social inequality and village politics.

Waste of a Nation offers an anthropological and historical account of India\u2019s complex relationship with garbage.\n\nCountries around the world struggle to achieve sustainable futures. Assa Doron and Robin Jeffrey argue that in India the removal of waste and efforts to reuse it also lay waste to the lives of human beings. At the bottom of the pyramid, people who work with waste are injured and stigmatized as they deal with sewage, toxic chemicals, and rotting garbage.\n\nTerrifying events, such as atmospheric pollution and childhood stunting, that touch even the wealthy and powerful may lead to substantial changes in practices and attitudes toward sanitation. And innovative technology along with more effective local government may bring about limited improvements. But if a clean new India is to emerge as a model for other parts of the world, a \u201cbinding morality\u201d that reaches beyond the current environmental crisis will be required. Empathy for marginalized underclasses\u2014Dalits, poor Muslims, landless migrants\u2014who live, almost invisibly, amid waste produced predominantly for the comfort of the better-off will be the critical element in India\u2019s relationship with waste.

one of the three wars fought by India and Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. Pakistan\u2019s incursion into the Kargil sector of Indian occupied Kashmir across the internationally recognized Line of Control led to a series of military operations that finally culminated in the withdrawal of the Pakistani forces in the face of mounting pressure from the international community. The war was fought against the backdrop of India and Pakistan\u2019s nuclear testing followed by a peace process convened to build confidence in the uneasy security context. \nThe purpose of this report is to assess the conflict in all its dimensions in order to highlight the key incompatibilities that led to the war. The report conducts a contextual and structural analysis of the conflict, along with an evaluation of the parties involved, the dynamics of the conflict and potential for conflict regulation to reach its final conclusion. The findings of the report show that the conflict was a result of Pakistani military command\u2019s aim to internationalize the Kashmir issue and design a military solution to the dispute. It is also revealed that the nuclear capacities of both the states acted as a deterrent to a nuclear war but it also elicited security concerns globally and drew out a decisive international response. \nThe report has analyzed all of the aforementioned key components of the conflict to conclude that the Kargil war was fought by Pakistan and India to gain leverage in matters of national security and interests while using the nuclear backdrop as a deterrent to escalation into an all out nuclear war.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59904341, "asset_id": 39727252, "asset_type": "Work",

Based on an analysis of Hindu religious gifts, Parry proposed a broad framework for understanding how ideologies of exchange function in different economic and cosmological contexts. 30 years later, this symposium considers the intellectual milieu in which The Indian Gift was written, and interrogates whether or not the work remains relevant to contemporary research and analysis.  The symposium opens with a short introduction that provides some background to Parry\u2019s essay and incorporates material from a recent interview with him. This is followed by critical comments on it by five influential thinkers on gift exchange:  James Carrier, Chris Gregory, James Laidlaw, Marilyn Strathern and Yunxiang Yan. It ends with a short \u2018revisionist\u2019 note by Parry in which he tries to identify some of the limits of the Maussian approach for contemporary anthropology.

While Gandhi draws upon this burgeoning corpus of liberal thought in India, his work is characterized by its typical impatience with ideas, and a method that combines random observation with apodictic statements.

Constitution of 1950, a document in English created by elite consensus, has had little influence on India\u2019s greater population. Drawing upon the previously unexplored records of the Supreme Court of India, A People\u2019s Constitution upends this narrative and shows how the Constitution actually transformed the daily lives of citizens in profound and lasting ways. This remarkable legal process was led by individuals on the margins of society, and Rohit De looks at how drinkers, smugglers, petty vendors, butchers, and prostitutes\u2014all despised minorities\u2014shaped the constitutional culture.\n\nThe Constitution came alive in the popular imagination so much that ordinary people attributed meaning to its existence, took recourse to it, and argued with it. Focusing on the use of constitutional remedies by citizens against new state regulations seeking to reshape the society and economy, De illustrates how laws and policies were frequently undone or renegotiated from below using the state\u2019s own procedures. De examines four important cases that set legal precedents: a Parsi journalist\u2019s contestation of new alcohol prohibition laws, Marwari petty traders\u2019 challenge to the system of commodity control, Muslim butchers\u2019 petition against cow protection laws, and sex workers\u2019 battle to protect their right to practice prostitution.\n\nExploring how the Indian Constitution of 1950 enfranchised the largest population in the world, A People\u2019s Constitution considers the ways that ordinary citizens produced, through litigation, alternative ethical models of citizenship.\n\nDISCOUNT CODE: P045\nhttps://press.princeton.edu/titles/13286.html", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57440292, "asset_id": 37471406, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434981, "first_name": "Rohit", "last_name": "De", "domain_name": "yale", "page_name": "RohitDe", "display_name": "Rohit De", "profile_url": "https://yale.academia.edu/RohitDe?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434981/180768/10141860/s65_rohit.de.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3767, "name": "Law and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Society?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3772, "name": "Legal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6357, "name": "Law and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7554, "name": "Comparative Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Constitutional_Law?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15702, "name": "Modern Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Indian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 16598, "name": "Social movements and revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_movements_and_revolution?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18116, "name": "Indian Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Law?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19672, "name": "Indian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 30471, "name": "Constitutionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutionalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 69711, "name": "Indian Government and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Government_and_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 153282, "name": "Indian Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Constitutional_Law?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 261030, "name": "Constitutional Courts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Courts?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 49240989, "title": "Dataset of materia medica in Sowa Rigpa: Tibetan medicine botanicals and Gaw\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9's classification system (CLICK \"Files\" for Raw Data)", "created_at": "2021-06-14T09:53:08.933-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49240989/Dataset_of_materia_medica_in_Sowa_Rigpa_Tibetan_medicine_botanicals_and_Gaw%C3%A9_Dorj%C3%A9s_classification_system_CLICK_Files_for_Raw_Data_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_49240989", "summary": "This article provides the most updated dataset of Latin botanical identifications for the materia medica in Tibetan medicine, known as Sowa Rigpa (Tib. Gso ba rig pa) or the \u201cknowledge field of healing.\u201d As one of the major scholarly Asian traditional medical systems, Sowa Rigpa is the principal health resource for populations across Tibetan regions of China, Mongolia, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and culturally-related areas of Russia. The geography represented by this medicinal plant dataset extends across the entire Tibetan plateau, its adjacent ranges, the wider transregional Himalayas, central Asia and much of the Indian subcontinent. Data collection drew from textual analysis of the seminal works of the Tibetan medical canon, including the Four Medical Treatises, Crystal Orb and Rosary among others; as well as the contemporary definitive work Stainless Crystal Mirror of Materia Medica by Gaw\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9. Study authors applied the same classification system as Gaw\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9, yet reanalyzed specimens according to a database cataloguing research on regional herbarium botanical specimens, geographic distributions and regional plant chemistry studies, and confirming proper identification with the most current modern botanical taxonomies. Subsequently, almost 700 of the most commonly used materia medica were selected for compilation. Thus, this dataset represents updated botanical identifications and confirmations from both early and contemporary sources. Botanical specimen names were entered into spreadsheet format with Gaw\u00e9 Dorj\u00e9\u2019s categories listed alongside Deumar Tendzin P\u00fcntsok\u2019s early standard. Enclosed raw data are written in Unicode Tibetan font to retain fidelity to entries in the classical texts, with parallel columns in standard Wylie Tibetan transliteration and phonetic transcription. Latin botanical names are updated for each materia medica specimen using Kew\u2019s Medicinal Plant Names Services (Kew-MPNS) with missing entries supplied by World Flora Online (WFO) and Flora of China (FoC). This dataset is the first publicly available comprehensive ethnobotanical identification of Sowa Rigpa materia medica with Latin binomial nomenclature. This dataset was developed to inform botanical and pharmacological analysis of the Tibetan medical materia medica repertoire as well as make comparative analyses of related materia medica in other Asian medical systems", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67625034, "asset_id": 49240989, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 67713789, "asset_id": 49240989, "asset_type":

China factor has been an important catalyst in visualising such scenario. Central Asian states were weak authoritarian states that faced numerous multi-scalar challenges. The birth of CICA signified the determination of the Central Asian states not to allow themselves victims of great power geopolitics. The rise of SCO was essentially a Chinese concern on its western periphery but soon found takers of the idea as it harboured security of Greater Central Asia. The economic opportunities present in Central Asia allowed a mutual win-win situation for rising China to strike a deal with Central Asian states that guaranteed them political and economic security. This reciprocal relationship benefited China in its restive province of Xinjiang. The Belt and Road strategy reveals ample imprints of China-Central Asia cooperation in the past. Most of the Central Asian economies have now aligned with this strategy. The organisations of CICA and SCO, which essentially began as a multi-tiered security framework now head towards an economic path. The idea of being landlocked appears to transform into major economic hub across Europe-Asian trade regime.

the everyday life and work of police in northern India revisits some intractable questions for the anthropologist who directly engages violence and power in the field: How do we understand violence, especially state violence? How do we understand and negotiate the vulnerabilities, responsibilities and complicities of violent agents, as well as those of the ethnographer who aims to understand the life worlds of these agents? What kinds of knowledge are produced in these ethnographic encounters, and how should they be framed and represented? And finally, how do we conduct ethnography with interlocutors who engage in violence on a routine basis, willfully, or as part of their job description, and still maintain professional ethical standards and the directionality of our moral compass? I argue that while there is no way around or out of complicity, a concept of \u201cstrategic complicity\u201d can serve as guide in navigating the murky work of \u201cdirty anthropology\u201d.

Interestingly, at the same time, the Aviation Industry is also responsible for spreading the virus globally. The immediate effect is evident as Asian, European, and American carriers\u2019 revenues are in free fall as travel restrictions mount. On 5 March, the Air Transport Association (IATA) projected a deadly hit on the global aviation industry up to $113 billion in 2020 which is one-fifth of 2019\u2019s total revenues and four times higher than IATA estimates in February 2020. This research attempts to highlight the magnitude of the Aviation Industry's loss employing South Asia as a case study, and it contrasts the situation with certain other Asian regions by illustrating secondary data and information accessible till November 18, 2020. This paper applies a systematic review of the literature and descriptive statistics as the methodology to achieve the objective. The analysis revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected the revenues, personnel, and flying capacity of key airline companies in South Asia. South Asia lost more aviation capacity than the region of North-East Asia, but less than Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80977122, "asset_id": 71771233, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 215052928, "first_name": "MD.

Originally from Bengal, Ati\u015ba was a tantric Buddhist master during Vajrayana Buddhism\u2019s flowering in India and traveled extensively, eventually spending the remaining twelve years of his life revitalizing Buddhism in Tibet. Revered by all the schools of Tibetan Buddhism, Ati\u015ba and his students founded what came to be known as the Kadam school, whose teachings have influenced countless Buddhist masters. These teachings, cherished by all major traditions, are preserved by the Geluk in particular, the school of the Dalai Lamas.\n       \nAlthough Ati\u015ba was an influential practitioner and scholar of Tantra, he is best known for introducing many of the core Mahayana teachings that are widely practiced throughout the Tibetan Buddhist world, including the Stages of the Path to Awakening and Mind Training (lojong), as well as having contributed to highly influential commentaries on Madhyamaka that synthesize various schools of thought. This succinct biography of Ati\u015ba\u2019s life, together with a collection of translations, represents for the first time the full range of Ati\u015ba\u2019s contribution to Buddhism. As the most comprehensive work available on this essential Buddhist figure, this book is an indispensable resource for scholars and Buddhist practitioners alike.\n", "downloadable_attachments":

is the study of human interaction with and activity at sea. It covers a broad thematic element of history that often uses a global approach, although national and regional histories remain predominant. As an academic subject, it often crosses the boundaries of standard disciplines, focusing on understanding humankind's various relationships to the oceans, seas, and major waterways of the globe. Nautical history records and interprets past events involving ships, shipping, navigation, and seafarers. When I wrote my Books on THE LIGHTHOUSE AT ALEXANDRIA I became fascinated by the Sea. What followed was my next book on LIGHT HOUSES them VAYU or HARNESSING OF the WIND. Off and on in many books and papers I have delat with merchqnt associations of Southern India and how they dared to cross the seas in search of Trade and Commerce to Srilanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Japan and even China.Whcih brings me naturally to this book because I have amassed quite a bit of information to write about these daring maritime actors-those from Tamil speaking lands and from Odisha(Orissa). Maritime history is the broad overarching subject that includes fishing, whaling, international maritime law, naval history, the history of ships, ship design, shipbuilding, the history of navigation, the history of the various maritime-related sciences (oceanography, cartography, hydrography, etc.), sea exploration, maritime economics and trade, shipping, yachting, seaside resorts, the history of lighthouses and aids to navigation, maritime themes in literature, maritime themes in art, the social history of sailors and passengers and sea-related communities. According to the Ministry of Shipping, around 95 percent of India's trading is by volume and 70 per cent by value is done by maritime transport. India has 12 major ports and 187 non-major ports. Cargo traffic, which is recorded at 1.052 million metric tonnes (MMT) in 2015, is expected to reach 1,758 (MMT) by 2017. The Indian ports and shipping industry plays a vital role in sustaining the growth in the country's trade and commerce. India is the sixteenth largest maritime country in the world, with a coastline of about 7,517 km.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64574698, "asset_id": 44209640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51406646, "first_name": "Dr. Uday", "last_name": "Dokras", "domain_name": "su-se", "page_name": "DrUdayDokras", "display_name": "Dr. Uday Dokras", "profile_url": "https://su-se.academia.edu/DrUdayDokras?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51406646/13620232/106880260/s65_dr._uday.dokras.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3776040, "name": "Maritime history of Tamils", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_history_of_Tamils?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43399425, "title": "Review of Writing Pakistan - Newsline", "created_at": "2020-06-21T09:40:57.884-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43399425/Review_of_Writing_Pakistan_Newsline?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_43399425", "summary": "Nusrat Khawaja reviewed \"Writing Pakistan: Conversations on Identity, Nationhood and Fiction\" for Newsline: https://newslinemagazine.com/magazine/book-review-writing-pakistan/\n\nSince 2019, Newsline has sadly seized publication.

As a result of this successful teamwork the general reader--even those readers with little awareness of Sikh traditions-will surely feel the powerful appeal of being led along the very same paths trodden by the founding Gurus of Sikhism.\n     The immediacy and presence of history is all around us as we read this book, particularly because history inheres within the Sikh 'relics' or heirloom heritage objects from throughout the Punjab and beyond, in ways that few, if any other, authors could more authentically describe.\n     As the authors note, many of the families who own the heirloom artefacts most directly associated with the earliest founders of the Sikh faith have made them available for publication here for the first time, for which historians and the public owe a debt of gratitude to these families, to the authors and to the many others who have helped bring this book to print.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56726775, "asset_id": 36776471, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 116, "name": "Sikhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikhism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2986, "name": "Material culture of religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_culture_of_religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 16226, "name": "Materiality (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materiality_Anthropology_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19091, "name": "South Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 24047, "name": "Indian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26049, "name": "Sikh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikh_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 456871, "name": "Sikhs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikhs?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 34956159, "title": "The Significance of the Kathina Robe Offering Ceremony", "created_at": "2017-10-25T08:29:35.930-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34956159/The_Significance_of_the_Kathina_Robe_Offering_Ceremony?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_34956159", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54818341, "asset_id": 34956159, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57706741, "first_name": "Dipen", "last_name": "Barua", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "DipenBarua", "display_name": "Dipen Barua", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/DipenBarua?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57706741/15573801/62508054/s65_dr._dipen.barua.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25051, "name": "Theravada Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theravada_Buddhism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 346267, "name": "Tipitaka Pali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tipitaka_Pali?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34131147, "title": "IRCTCs e-Ticketing Service Electronic Reservation Slip (Personal User", "created_at": "2017-08-04T07:39:41.510-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34131147/IRCTCs_e_Ticketing_Service_Electronic_Reservation_Slip_Personal_User?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_34131147", "summary": "1.

contain vedic metrological terms,names of vedic ornaments,names of people, places and gods etc. My perception is that only a comprehensive study of ancient vedic  metrology can decipher the script symbols satisfactorily. A significant find herein is the existence of the Kalinga malla mana system during Harappan times challenging  the common perception of its origin from the later  Kalinga kingdom(Orissa).The unicorn is identified as the pala/nishka/soma/agni.Signs of intersecting circles, fish , crab,bud,tower etc. also indicate pala.The six locks of hair indicate  the paNameTa weight of six barley grains.Roots  and nuts indicate viira bhadra/ Drupada/ varaha/pala.We have located Lord Krishna\u2019s Mathura and Dvaraka in the Indus valley scripts.\nWe have confirmed Mohenjodaro as the first Dvaraka\non the basis of the inscription on the copperplate B7C2 from there and textual evidences from the Rgveda, Mahabharata etc.We have located PadmakuuTa,one of the\npalaces of Krishna there.Also we have identified the Sindhu(Indus) as the Vedic Sarasvati river.We have gone through the symbols  identifying the Bharadvajas,the clan of composers of the earliest vedic texts.In Krishna\u2019s Dvaraka we gathered more details from the script on Lord Krishna\u2019s Dvaraka and Sindhu/Sarasvati. We have looked into the\nindications of the Harappan jar symbol with three forks on each edge.We have located  the Kasyapas in Hastinapura \ntrading with Sumeria.We have decoded the Mari Standard,went deeper into the meanings of several Sumerian images and confirmed Meluhha as Vedic Harappa/Indus valley. We have located Janaka,the king of Mithila,father-in-law of Rama, in the Indus script.We have identified the names of copper in the Indus script and located  the Asvins,Yama and Skanda  in the Indus script.In A Model For Indus Script Decipherment\nwe have identified the deity in the seal M-1181 and built a model for complete decipherment of the Indus script.\nWe have seen how  Brahmi and Kharoshthi evolved from the Indus Script and how the Indus script was in use along with Brahmi/Kharoshthi even into the  first centuries CE.We have seen how the coins of the ancient world,including the Roman coins evolved from the Indus valley money.\nWe have looked for  and located a Rosetta Stone for the Indus script, in the varaha/gadyanaka coin form.\nWe have gone into the relation of the Druids to the Indus valley civilisation and the role of their  Gundestrup cauldron\nin the evolution of Christianity.\nWe have explored the relation of the Anau seal to the Indus Valley Civilisation.\nWe have gone into the relationship of the Egyptian and Harappan deities.\nWe have looked into a beautiful story from the New Testament \ninvoving  the vedic soma sacrifice in A Veiled Visvamitra Soma Sacrifice In The New Testament.\nWe have studied  the indications of some of the Indus script symbols with particular reference to their use on ancient coins of India .\nWe have looked into symbolism of the overflowing vase on the Sumerian statue of Gudea and through it we identified the indications of several Indus symbols including the Harischandra vaajapeya sacrifice.\nWe have seen how the Harappan glyphs served as goodluck symbols .\nThe identification of the right vedic soma has two important \naspects:First, it ends the long quest for the mysterious soma. Second,it confirms the Indus valley civilisation as vedic ,beyond any doubt.\nWe have studied the vedic Daksha Yaaga  and its relation to the soma yaaga.Also we have located  D\u0101\u015bar\u0101j\u00f1\u00e1 and  Dasaratha in the Indus seals.\nWe have explored the application of the palm seals as further rosetta stones of the Indus script .\nWe have looked into the claim of mlecca as the language of the Indus valley civilation and concluded that Bharata,not mlecca, was the language of the Indus valley civilisation.\nWe have gone into the shift of the vedic Yadava clans from the Ghaggar-Hakra(Yamuna) to the Sarasvati(Sindhu) basin.\nIn another article we have confirmed the river Sindhu as the vedic river Sarasvati and Mohenjodaro as Krishna\u2019s Dvaraka.\nIn this article we are going into a majestic bull seal.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51163089, "asset_id": 30714814, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Of The Vedas,              Vedic Roots Of Ancient Egyptian Religion  -\nI have shown that several seals contain vedic metrological terms,names of vedic ornaments,names of people, places and gods etc. My perception is that only a comprehensive study of ancient vedic  metrology can decipher the script symbols satisfactorily. A significant find herein is the existence of the Kalinga malla mana system during Harappan times challenging  the common perception of its origin from the later  Kalinga kingdom(Orissa).The unicorn is identified as the pala/nishka.Intersecting circles, fish , crab,bud,tower signs also have the same indications.The six locks of hair indicate  the paNameTa weight of six barley grains.Roots  and nuts indicate viira bhadra/ Drupada/ varaha/pala.We have located Lord Krishna\u2019s Mathura and Dvaraka in the Indus valley scripts.\nWe have confirmed Mohenjodaro as the first Dvaraka\non the basis of the inscription on the copperplate B7C2 from there and textual evidences from the Rgveda, Mahabharata etc.We have located PadmakuuTa,one of the\npalaces of Krishna there.Also we have identified the Sindhu(Indus) as the Vedic Sarasvati river.We have gone through the symbols  identifying the Bharadvajas,the clan of composers of the earliest vedic texts.In Krishna\u2019s Dvaraka we gathered more details from the script on Lord Krishna\u2019s Dvaraka and Sindhu/Sarasvati. We have looked into the\nindications of the Harappan jar symbol with three forks on each edge.We have located  the Kasyapas in Hastinapura \ntrading with Sumeria.We have decoded the Mari Standard,went deeper into the meanings of several Sumerian images and confirmed Meluhha as Vedic Harappa/Indus valley. We have located Janaka,the king of Mithila,father-in-law of Rama, in the Indus script.We have identified the names of copper in the Indus script and located  the Asvins,Yama and Skanda  in the Indus script.In A Model For Indus Script Decipherment\nwe have identified the deity in the seal M-1181 and built a model for complete decipherment of the Indus script.\nWe have seen how  Brahmi and Kharoshthi evolved from the Indus Script and how the Indus script was in use along with Brahmi/Kharoshthi even into the  first centuries CE.We have seen how the coins of the ancient world,including the Roman coins evolved from the Indus valley money.\nWe have looked for  and located a Rosetta Stone for the Indus script, in the varaha/gadyanaka coin form.\nWe have gone into the relation of the Druids to the Indus valley civilisation and the role of their  Gundestrup cauldron\nin the evolution of Christianity.\nWe have explored the relation of the Anau seal to the Indus Valley Civilisation.\nWe have studied  the vedic soma and its importance  in the life of the Harappans.\nWe have gone into the relationship of the Egyptian and Harappan deities.\nIn this article we are looking into a story from the New Testament which will help us understand the nature of the Indus symbols even better.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48911313, "asset_id": 28506800,

It examines accounts of a large number of incidents described in Indian language newspapers, the colonial archive, and hunting literature published between the 1870s and 1940s, in which British and other sportsmen clashed with villagers in India while hunting. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century the colonial sports-hunting obsession was in its heyday, but opposition to hunting across India was also mounting. Rural villagers, in particular, were often willing to lock into physical combat with hunters, apparently in order to protect local wildlife. Sportsmen often assumed that it was religious fanaticism that made Hindus defend the lives of what they saw as game animals, trophies, and specimens. The article provides evidence that in addition to religion, a mixture of other motivations explains Hindu interest in the conservation of certain species. Anti-colonial consciousness, assertions of local authority and territoriality, and an environmental ethic can all be identified as being at work. The end result was the increased conservation of certain species of wildlife.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35797241, "asset_id": 6363876, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7284244, "first_name": "Ezra", "last_name": "Rashkow", "domain_name": "montclair", "page_name": "EzraRashkow", "display_name": "Ezra Rashkow", "profile_url": "https://montclair.academia.edu/EzraRashkow?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7284244/2928271/3807425/s65_ezra.rashkow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2809, "name": "Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3535, "name": "Biocultural Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biocultural_Diversity?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5381, "name": "Religion and Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Ecology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5459, "name": "Cultural Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6735, "name": "Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7649, "name": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Ecological_Knowledge?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7651, "name": "Wildlife Ecology And Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wildlife_Ecology_And_Management?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19406, "name": "Human-wildlife conflicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human-wildlife_conflicts?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 22413, "name": "Wildlife Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wildlife_Conservation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 23979, "name": "Endangered Species", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endangered_Species?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 25837, "name": "Hunting (Human Animal Relations)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunting_Human_Animal_Relations_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 29225, "name": "Anthropology of Hunting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Hunting?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 113579, "name": "Wildlife", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wildlife?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 133572, "name": "Wildlife Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wildlife_Management?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 217392, "name": "Food Taboos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Taboos?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 257435, "name": "Environmental philosophy, religious studies, anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_philosophy_religious_studies_anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 754495, "name": "Ahimsa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ahimsa?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 864826, "name": "Protected Animals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protected_Animals?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 35977300, "title": "East India Bill", "created_at": "2018-02-21T04:00:36.215-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35977300/East_India_Bill?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35977300", "summary": "emperor and started to control the whole Indian subcontinent in the reign of their rule.

East India Company was getting richer by exploiting the people. Some of the brutalities of the British upon the Indian are as follows-The British established the law of sunset for feudal tax. The feudal class of the subcontinent had to give tax for their own land. And if someone missed the timeline to give tax, then his land would be confiscated by the East India Company. And also if anyone from the feudal class had died and left any orphan of him who is not enough mature, then all his land would be confiscated. To save their own land, the feudal class wanted a high tax from the farmers. Our farmers could not grow their own food, but they were bound to harvest blue. The Indian people forgot the minimum liberty of life. After the death of the last Mughal emperor the Indians lost the complete political freedom of their own life. During the range of East India Company the law and order were totally collapsed. All the Indian wealth was taken to England. We had to buy our own food by paying an abnormal price. The educational condition of the India was not so high. The British took no step to educate the Indian people. The condition of women was also no so safe. The British took the widows in any restricted area where they made sexual relationship with that girl. Thus the girls became mistress of the British. Edmund Burke never visited India.

precisely a century since the institution of monarchy was anchored in 1907 upon the signing of the genja (contract). The genja brought to an end the theocratic rule established by the Zhabdrung in the 17th century. Besides, the social contract theory proposed by the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes has significant bearing on the genja of 1907 in particular and the political history of Bhutan in general. Thus, this paper will look into the three striking paths traversed by Bhutan between 1705 and 2008 in the context of the relevance of the Hobbesian social contract theory on the genja; it entails the period prior to the signing of the genja, the state-of-affairs surrounding the signing of the genja, and the period after the genja has been signed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37871092,

This book is divided into four chapters, each of which examines different moments in Indian cinema's history.

Through the COP processes, national governments have committed to a wide variety of mitigation and adaptation actions through their NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) to emissions reduction. While actions are to be primarily taken at national level, it is made clear that \u2018parties may use internationally transferred mitigation outcomes to achieve NDCs\u2019 (Article 6 of the Paris Agreement). This opens a path for such things as carbon-market development, biofuels production and other forms of green energy and green economy development. While national actions plans and programs are intended to yield multiple benefits to humans and nature \u2013 i.e. 'climate security' \u2013 failure to adapt to or mitigate the hypothesized effects of climate change is forecast to result in dramatic social and environmental instability, including mass migration and resource-related violent conflict. While effects will be felt unevenly both within and among states and regions, the overall outcome is anticipated to be negative\nIn this chapter we introduce \u2018the boomerang effect\u2019, defined here as the emergence of largely unanticipated and unintended negative consequences of climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and programs on domestic non-state actors that result in negative feedbacks on the state. By 'state', we mean government actors taking decisions as representatives of the state. The chapter has three objectives. First, to contribute directly to theory by articulating a framework for analysing one particular aspect of maladaptation, that is 'the boomerang effect'. Second, to present an overview of the chapters in this collection reflecting on the real and potential unanticipated and unintended negative effects at the local level (local level side effects - LLSEs) and at the state level (state level boomerang effects - SLBEs). Third, to draw lessons from the cases for research, policy and practice.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56325385, "asset_id": 36413262, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 122642, "first_name": "Larry", "last_name": "Swatuk", "domain_name": "uwaterloo", "page_name": "LarrySwatuk", "display_name": "Larry Swatuk", "profile_url": "https://uwaterloo.academia.edu/LarrySwatuk?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/122642/32793/56154/s65_larry.swatuk.122642"}, {"id": 8766049, "first_name": "Larry", "last_name": "Swatuk", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LarrySwatuk", "display_name": "Larry Swatuk", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LarrySwatuk?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8766049/4147457/4832284/s65_larry.swatuk.jpg"}, {"id": 2523461, "first_name": "Lars", "last_name": "Wirkus", "domain_name": "bicc", "page_name": "LarsWirkus", "display_name": "Lars Wirkus", "profile_url": "https://bicc.academia.edu/LarsWirkus?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2523461/21928857/21195344/s65_lars.wirkus.png"}, {"id": 268824, "first_name": "Florian", "last_name": "Krampe", "domain_name": "sipri", "page_name": "FlorianKrampe", "display_name": "Florian Krampe", "profile_url": "https://sipri.academia.edu/FlorianKrampe?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/268824/56055/20201221/s65_florian.krampe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1041, "name": "Forestry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forestry?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3255, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3707, "name": "Climate change policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_change_policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4524, "name": "Sustainable Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Development?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 14469, "name": "Sustainable Water Resources Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Water_Resources_Management?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 14966, "name": "Big Dams", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Dams?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 49028283, "title": "RSS As A Terror Outfit: Based on its Archives in KANNADA", "created_at": "2021-05-23T21:08:38.131-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49028283/RSS_As_A_Terror_Outfit_Based_on_its_Archives_in_KANNADA?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_49028283", "summary": "\noriginal in English entitled \n\u201cRSS as a Terror Outfit\u201d\nby SHAMSUL ISLAM \n\nTranslated to Kannada\nby Suresh Bhat Bakrabail\nRSS \nOndu Bhayotpaadaka Tandavaagi\nA dossier on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,\n\n\n\nThis e-book is copyright free.

But in reality the Indus civilisation is vedic and the vedic people were in the Indus Valley at least from 6000BCE as seen from the excavations.\nIf an unknown script can explain the known myth and known history of a nation,what more proof is required to show that the script belongs to the same people.The script of Egypt explains\ntheir myth and history.The script of Sumer,Akkad or Elam does the same.So it is natural for the Indus script to denote the myth\nand history of the Hindu/Sindhu / Sarasvati/ vindu/vipra/sura/ bhuusura/bhudeva/bharata/kuru/pancala/Somaka  people.Hence we shall try to understand a bit of Indian history through the Indus script.We shall presently see  evidences pointing to the existence of the Aryans in the Indus Valley several millennia prior to the so called Aryan\narrival in the Indus valley.\n\nIn the last  articles we have looked into the writing of the Harappans in the early Ravi/Kot Diji phases and concluded that they are the same vedic people of the mature Harappan phase;we have  compared an inscribed  Ravi sherd showing  presence of the Pancalas/ Bharatas in the Indus valley before 3300BCE and a Taxila coin showing their presence in Taxila around 200 BCE confirming the continuity of the vedic civilisation in the Indus Valley from the early Harappan days;we have seen how an indus seal\nportray the story of Ahalya described in later literature;\nwe have explored the universal idea of the mount of the dead Concept In The  Worship Of The Sun God .\nOne of the reasons for the hesitation of scholars  to accept\nthe Indus valley civilisation as vedic is that the Rg veda has\nseveral passages referring to Asva-the horse and the veda\nitself states that its horse has 34 ribs whereas modern horse\nusually has 36 ribs.\nIn the last article we have gone into the issue of the vedic\nhorse and the number of its ribs. Interestingly many of the Harappan Inscriptions refer to the Asvamedha itself as we will see in the present article.There was no horse,but they are speaking of asvamedhas!\n",

Listening to electronic music genres, hip hop and punk from the US and UK opened up spaces to engage with war and terror, racism and media. Much of this music refers directly to Muslim peoples, places and structures of feeling. Yet music that isn't explicit about the Muslim is also conscripted for life during wartime in which some of us feel wary about articulating those Muslim parts of our garbled selves.

This course charts a global history of Gandhi's thought about non-violence and its expression in civil disobedience and resistance movements both in India and the world. Organized in three modules, the first situates Gandhi through consideration of the diverse sources of his own historical and ideological formation; the second examines the historical contexts and practices through which non-violence acquired meaning for him and considers important critiques; the third explores the various afterlives of Gandhian politics in movements throughout the world. We will examine autobiography and biography, Gandhi's collected works, various types of primary source, political, social, and intellectual history, and audiovisual materials. In addition to widely disseminated narratives of Gandhi as a symbol of non-violence, the course will closely attend to the deep contradictions concerning race, caste, gender, and class that characterized his thought and action. By unsettling conventional accounts of his significance, we will grapple with the problem of how to make sense of his troubled legacy.

Thematically, the seven chapters of the dissertation may be categorized in three broad divisions. Taking a longue dur\u00e9e perspective, the first two chapters situate the Ganga and its plain in the wider cultural and geographical framework of the Indian subcontinent. While Chapter 1 is concerned with the central role of the Ganga in Indian culture and civilization since the first millennium BC, Chapter 2 discusses early migration and the settlement pattern along the Ganga by paying close attention to the environmental predispositions of the region. The second broad division relates to the Ganga as connecting and feeding the political economy of northern India during the early modern period. The Ganga linked the region with the maritime economy, facilitated navigation, transportation of merchandise and also facilitated political control. Thus, Chapters 3 to 6 examine the political economic processes along the Ganga in eastern India, the integration of the regional commercial economy with the maritime global economy, bullion flows and production processes of such merchandise as saltpeter, opium and textiles. As Bihar offered these commodities, its economy pulled the maritime traders who approached the region through the Ganga highway. The inflows of specie boosted the economy and the agricultural and craft-productions kept pace with the increasing demands in overseas markets. Benefitting from the expanding economy of Bihar, the zamindars (warlords-cum-gentry) asserted their control over the Ganga and chocked the flow of resources to the Mughal imperial coffers and thus paving the way for Mughal decline in the eighteenth century. The third and last thematic division in Chapter 7 focuses on the decline of the Mughal Empire, zamindar-led regional centralization, and the political transition to EIC rule.

Eleven key essays debate the linkages between the religious and worldly aims of different movements and the continuity and change in their ideologies, social bases, and organizational structures over time. They present divergent views on important issues such as the relationship between caste and the sect, the idea of renunciation, the role of the Sufis in the conversion to Islam in medieval India, and the ways in which many South Asian popular movements emerged and gathered force. \n\nIn an insightful introduction by David Lorenzen, each debate is discussed in its historical and theoretical context. The influence of Dumont, Engels, and Weber on our understanding of the nature of religious movemtns in and beyond the South Asia is also analysed. Part of the pr estigious Debates in Indian History and Society series, this volume will be useful for students, scholars and teachers of medieval and early modern India, as well as those interested in religious studies, comparative religion, sociology, and anthropology. \n\nReadership: students, scholars and teachers of medieval and early modern India, as well as those interested in religious studies, comparative religion, sociology, and anthropology.\n\nMore Info: ISBN 0195664485\nPublisher: Delhi: Oxford University Press India\nPublication Date: 2004\nhttp://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780195678765.do", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57406006, "asset_id": 16496142, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 192961, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Lorenzen", "domain_name": "colmex", "page_name": "DavidLorenzen", "display_name": "David N Lorenzen", "profile_url": "https://colmex.academia.edu/DavidLorenzen?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/192961/10275483/11467039/s65_david.lorenzen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 96460, "name": "Indian religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_religions?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 12524590, "title": "Memorial Stones of Sindh, Pakistan: Typology and Iconography", "created_at": "2015-05-22T05:18:22.230-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12524590/Memorial_Stones_of_Sindh_Pakistan_Typology_and_Iconography?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_12524590", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37707268, "asset_id": 12524590, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 678814, "first_name": "Zulfiqar", "last_name": "Ali Kalhoro", "domain_name": "pide", "page_name": "ZulfiqarAliKalhoro", "display_name": "Zulfiqar  Ali Kalhoro", "profile_url": "https://pide.academia.edu/ZulfiqarAliKalhoro?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/678814/1075754/20948883/s65_zulfiqar.ali_kalhoro.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8516, "name": "Funerary Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funerary_Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 57161, "name": "Funerary Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funerary_Practices?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 338024, "name": "Archaeology of the Funeral Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_the_Funeral_Ritual?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 539232, "title": "Writing Difference: Nationalism, Identity and Literature", "created_at": "2011-04-20T13:30:40.982-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/539232/Writing_Difference_Nationalism_Identity_and_Literature?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_539232", "summary": "Since the nineteenth century, Nationalism has remained one of the most potent forces in the history of ideas both for celebratory and polemical reasons, having been hailed as much as an ideology of emancipation and integration as a spectre of fragmentation and belligerence. It has given birth to some most impassioned writings in world literature, both creative and theoretical.\n      Postcolonial/Postmodern engagement has meanwhile brought up more issues for critical negotiations, especially those thrown up later against the glocal scenario, for example, minority, culture, ethnicity, community, gender, caste, migration, diaspora and so on. At any rate, it has proved to be a plural and a highly contested site, requiring constant reconceptualisation and renegotiation.

The number of Dalit migrants is also rising rapidly. There is a growing body of research on international labour migration from Nepal. So far, however, research has not looked in sufficient depth at inter-caste relations, and in particular at old institutions of patron-client (balighare) relations, or at how economic and socio-cultural relations may be changing as a result of labour migration. Based on household and individual surveys, combined with ethnography, conducted in a cluster of six villages located to the west of Pokhara in Kaski and their migration destinations, particularly Pokhara and Chitwan, this paper seeks to explore some of these issues, particularly the following question: does mobility from one place to another, particularly international migration, help change people\u2019s behaviour in terms of everyday caste relations?\n\nThe preliminary results from the study show that most patron-client balighare relationships (what in India are usually referred to as jajmani relationships) have either been abandoned or substantially transformed. Some old caste-based taboos have been broken and roles redefined. While some traditional non-cash-based occupations have been completely abandoned or are practised on a much-reduced scale, others have largely adapted to the new cash- and market-based economy. Due to insufficient labour, farming is in decline. With respect to commensality, 70 per cent of international labour migrant respondents have had Dalit (or non-Dalit, in the case of Dalits themselves) work- or house-mates in the country where they have gone for work. With rare exceptions, caste was no barrier to commensality. However, up to 60 per cent of these same respondents say that they would not be able to continue the same level of relations with Dalits in the private domain once they are back in Nepal. This illustrates the shifting and contextual nature of caste relations; it also highlights the importance of distinguishing public and private domains.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64551139, "asset_id": 44181407, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7682042, "first_name": "Krishna", "last_name": "Adhikari", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "KrishnaAdhikari", "display_name": "Krishna Adhikari", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/KrishnaAdhikari?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7682042/2755985/3211930/s65_krishna.adhikari.jpg"}, {"id": 694866, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Gellner", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "DavidGellner", "display_name": "David Gellner", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/DavidGellner?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/694866/18239713/18215093/s65_david.gellner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16946, "name": "Nepal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nepal?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19051, "name": "Transnational Labour Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Labour_Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 118633, "name": "Caste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caste?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 146119, "name": "Dalits", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dalits?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 964161, "name": "Mobile and Internet Use on Marginalised Cultures; Relationship Between Caste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_and_Internet_Use_on_Marginalised_Cultures_Relationship_Between_Caste?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 19865187, "title": "Physical Education, Sport and the Intersection and Articulation of \u2018Modernities\u2019:  Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal.

We now know some of the details of this formula from the article of the American journalist, Steve Coll which he had published in New Yorker in March 2009 and the book of Mr.Khursheed Mahmud Kasuri, 'Neither a Hawk nor a Dove' which was published in 2015. Prior to this Mr.Musharraf and Mr.Kasuri had already claimed in their TV interviews and press talks that by March 2007 India and Pakistan were very close to resolving the Kashmir conflict. This paper takes the details of that non-paper agreement and tries to study what exactly that agreement holds for the future resolution of the Kashmir conflict. The basic understanding is whenever the Pakistani and the Indian governments will take up the negotiations on the Kashmir conflict in future, this agreement is bound to come up in the talks as a starting reference point. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully look at this agreement and discuss what it entails for the resolution of the Kashmir conflict. ____________________", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66764612, "asset_id": 47855770, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4442650, "first_name": "Saeed Ahmed", "last_name": "Rid", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "SaeedAhmedRid", "display_name": "Saeed Ahmed  Rid", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/SaeedAhmedRid?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4442650/1813901/24380599/s65_dr._saeed_ahmed.rid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 55927, "name": "Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 224426, "name": "Peace Process", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Process?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 227410, "name": "India-Pakistan Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India-Pakistan_Relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 362278, "name": "Kashmir Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir_Conflict?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 381229, "name": "Jammu and Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jammu_and_Kashmir?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 12134101, "title": "Women's movement's in the global South", "created_at": "2015-04-28T02:22:45.176-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12134101/Womens_movements_in_the_global_South?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_12134101", "summary": "This encyclopedia entry underscores the politics and ethics of scale in reading women\u2019s movements in the global south \u2013 how they have always been simultaneously regional, national and transnational in scale (materially if not always imaginatively) and consequently, read through the twin lens of the global and the local.

The authors shift the emphasis from understanding heritage in its local context to discussing it across the waters of   the Arabian Sea. The relationship between the sea and the land underlines the centrality of the coast; the communities who inhabited the space between the ocean and the hinterland; their histories and attempts at constructing their cultural environment. An important component of this cultural landscape is monumental architecture and archaeological sites, as also their inter-linkage with travelling groups who moved both across the sea, as well as on routes into the interior. \nA common concern that all papers share is with definitions of maritime heritage; different articulations of social and political power; and regional and local nautical traditions. One of the objectives of this volume is to underscore the important role of World Heritage, especially sites and monuments located along the coasts that have already been identified as national treasures by individual Nation States. The objective is to bring these coastal monuments and structures into dialogue with those located across the Ocean for a holistic understanding of maritime cultural heritage of the western Indian Ocean. It is suggested that this dialogue across the seas, would help in the protection and preservation of a maritime heritage known for its \u2018outstanding universal value\u2019.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48368529, "asset_id": 28055995, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19755, "name": "World Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 675052, "name": "UNESCO world heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UNESCO_world_heritage?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 15221467, "title": "\u2018Rice Mafias\u2019, Presidential Campaigning, and the Moral Economy of Grain Access in Contemporary Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2015-08-27T03:44:38.274-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15221467/_Rice_Mafias_Presidential_Campaigning_and_the_Moral_Economy_of_Grain_Access_in_Contemporary_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_15221467", "summary": "Using Sri Lanka\u2019s iconic presidential elections of January 2015 as a backdrop, we engage with how elite patrimonial politics and everyday moralities around grain access and distributive justice come to intersect with one another.

The consensual understanding in Washington was that hurdles that prevented India from transforming its latent capability into an operational one were normative and not technical or organizational. New evidence shows that India lacked technical means to deliver nuclear weapons reliably and safely until 1994-95. Further, until the outbreak of the Kargil War in the summer of 1999, India lacked coordinating protocols to organizationally deploy nuclear weapons militarily. The causes of India\u2019s lack of technical operational capabilities well into the 1990s are traceable to organizational dysfunction that grew out of a regime of secrecy that prevented information sharing and coordination among the relevant actors. The absence of an operational capability to launch a nuclear strike, on the other hand, was the consequence of risk-aversion among Indian decision-makers who feared the negative fallout of this potential discovery by the United States. \n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37884166, "asset_id": 12927645, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31794379, "first_name": "Gaurav", "last_name": "Kampani", "domain_name": "utulsa", "page_name": "GauravKampani", "display_name": "Gaurav Kampani", "profile_url": "https://utulsa.academia.edu/GauravKampani?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31794379/9440569/10519604/s65_gaurav.kampani.jpg_oh_7a6899e82f2ab10eb249fd2aa7904ebb_oe_5603c130___gda___1443631099_200f512df16033bd8cf0300496b41d0c"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1911, "name": "International Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4507, "name": "Nuclear Weapons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nuclear_Weapons?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19672, "name": "Indian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 20881, "name": "History of Nuclear Weapons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Nuclear_Weapons?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28009, "name": "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 10356261, "title": "Between Identity and Equity: An Agenda for Affirmative Action for Muslims ", "created_at": "2015-01-27T21:13:39.823-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10356261/Between_Identity_and_Equity_An_Agenda_for_Affirmative_Action_for_Muslims?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_10356261", "summary": "For the Muslims of India, both identity and equity are intensely contested concepts that impinge upon political mobilization as much as policy initiatives.

We talk about his latest work of non-fiction, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable (University of Chicago Press, 2016) and why he thinks it has proven so difficult to bring climate change into literature. We discuss the worldview of the novel and how its emphasis on creating believable narratives has excluded precisely the kinds of unlikely anthropocenic encounters that are becoming increasingly frequent across the world. Amitav argues that before an alternate world can become a reality, it needs to become an imaginative reality and this is why the arts are so crucial to coming to terms with the Anthropocene. We also discuss \" serious \" art's fear of being deemed merely \" illustrative \" and how this may be linked to a Cold War aversion to the aesthetics of socialist realism. Now, Amitav warns, the world has risen up as a protagonist even as our means of representation aren't up to engaging it. He predicts that the mansions of serious fiction will suffer a similar fate to the mansions of Miami beach as our waters rise. We talk about what is really being denied in climate change denial and how the privileges and comforts of a carbon-fueled lifestyle is something which neither the West nor Asia is prepared to give up. We close with Amitav's own next novel project and how climate change inspires him personally and artistically.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49926149, "asset_id": 29485801, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 303157, "first_name": "Cymene", "last_name": "Howe", "domain_name": "rice", "page_name": "CymeneHowe", "display_name": "Cymene Howe", "profile_url": "https://rice.academia.edu/CymeneHowe?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/303157/61137/2654134/s65_cymene.howe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2587, "name": "The Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Novel?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3255, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7888, "name": "Literary Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Theory?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 8153, "name": "Theory of the Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_the_Novel?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 36172, "name": "Amitav Ghosh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amitav_Ghosh?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 149474, "name": "Anthropocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropocene?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 44669973, "title": "\"Film and Cinephilia in Pakistan: Beyond Life and Death\"", "created_at": "2020-12-09T11:09:46.243-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44669973/_Film_and_Cinephilia_in_Pakistan_Beyond_Life_and_Death_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_44669973", "summary": "This volume is a carefully curated selection of recently published academic research, critical essays, translations, and interviews on Pakistani cinema.

The prabandha as a musical meta-genre has occupied the attention of musicologists from Mata\u1e45ga (8 th c. AD?) to Ve\u1e45ka\u1e6damakhin (16 th c. AD). There is much variety in the number, description and details of the various types of prabandha songs found in the musicological sources, and it is fortunate that there are a few examples of prabandha-s available, even if they are from the late medieval period. Here, a specific sub-category \u2013 the \u015ar\u012bra\u1e45ga Prabandha is considered, its genealogy through the musicological literature studied and also an example to understand the life trajectory of the concept of a prabandha is examined. By studying the structural, textual and musical content of the two songs, it is tried to sketch the identity of the musical prabandha vis-\u00e0-vis its literary namesake, its literary sources, and its successors in the history of musical genres. Also, the essay explores the overlapping yet distinct spheres of production, reception and circulation of the musical and literary prabandha-s. The available examples are used to discuss the methodological issues of studying genres that straddle the categories of the literary and the performative.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45088333, "asset_id": 24757902, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8854285, "first_name": "Naresh", "last_name": "Keerthi", "domain_name": "ashokauniversity", "page_name": "NareshKeerthi", "display_name": "Naresh Keerthi", "profile_url": "https://ashokauniversity.academia.edu/NareshKeerthi?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8854285/51557063/39634668/s65_naresh.keerthi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 945, "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performing_Arts?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2466, "name": "Indian Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Music?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 58850, "name": "Historical Musicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Musicology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 487323, "name": "Genre Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre_Criticism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 74492260, "title": "Sacrificial Skins: The Value of Pakistan\u2019s Eid al-Azha Animal Hide Collection", "created_at": "2022-03-24T14:30:28.787-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74492260/Sacrificial_Skins_The_Value_of_Pakistan_s_Eid_al_Azha_Animal_Hide_Collection?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_74492260", "summary": "In Pakistan, one of the most significant celebrations on the Muslim calendar, Eid al-Azha (Feast of the Sacrifice), is marked by two major rituals. At the center of the festival is the animal slaughter remembering the prophet Abraham\u2019s willingness to sacrifice his son. The second, dating to Pakistan\u2019s earliest days as a nation, is the collection of animal hides from the sacrifice. NGOs, political parties, and madrasas annually compete to collect and auction the sacrificial skins. This paper examines how Alkhidmat Foundation\u2013the social welfare branch of the Islamist party Jama\u2019at-e-Islami\u2013invests in a risky fundraising ritual that animates the value of sacrifice in their humanitarian work. While historically the auction of animal hides has been lucrative, over the last decade, the income has come under threat due to the rise of synthetic leathers on the global market, inflation, and climate change, which have left Pakistan\u2019s leather commodity in peril and, with it, the fate of a major source of income for the country\u2019s social services. Pakistan\u2019s skins collection offers insight into a fundraising practice that instantiates sacrifice writ large: of time, safety, and resources, and sometimes, of intimate relations. Sacrifice is the motivating value that underpins dedication to the annual hide collection and articulates Alkhidmat\u2019s humanitarianism through the human capability of sacrifice.

Banu Subramaniam\u2019s book Holy Science: The Biopolitics of\nHindu Nationalism embarks on filling a gap in scholarly work \u201cby exploring the\nenduring relationship of science and religion in India as both forged practices\nand ideologies that resist gender and caste transformations.\u201d Packing seven\nwell-rounded chapters, accompanied by a prologue and an epilogue, the author\nends up achieving a lot more than the aforementioned objective within the\ncourse of 250 pages. The book is placed at the crossroads of many important and timely issues around religion, science, gender, and significantly contributes to each one of them and is an important book for each of these fields, but also for anyone interested broadly in the study of ideology, colonial studies, Asian studies and issues of identity politics and inequality in general.\n", "downloadable_attachments":

"dom_id": "work_36617254", "summary": "This thesis focuses on everyday contemporary campus politics in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi. My central argument is that institutional territories of new social and ideological experimentation, such as this elite and predominantly social sciences and humanities campus, create the conditions for the reproduction of alternative political cultures, pertaining to the historical formation of such institutions. Current scholarship tends to discuss political choices\nof educated Indian youth in a context of caste, class, community and gender cleavages, as a result of parental upbringing or as a creative interpretation of phenomena such as liberalisation. The original contribution to knowledge of this work is to show that specific campus-based cultures need to be considered as distinct factors of politicisation, in particular when they are the training ground for under-represented political traditions. Through engaging critically with one\u2019s social\nstandings in light of contending left ideologies, young people in the JNU campus exhibit political activities and preferences that gradually distinguish them both from other youth and older generations. Consequently, features of political life are not only influenced by biographical components, but are renegotiated in light of selective political socialisation, carried on by one generation of activist to the next. Exposure to the Marxist-dominated activist culture of JNU fosters student politicisation and contributes to the widening of a political divide between conformist and heretic youth. The study is based on sixteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in JNU premises. Results obtained are complemented by a textual analysis of pamphlet discourses written by student organisations and a survey of political attitudes on campus. These contribute to the debates on student politics and the political participation of the educated youth in India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56547196, "asset_id": 36617254, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2830188, "first_name": "Jean-Thomas", "last_name": "Martelli", "domain_name": "csh-delhi", "page_name": "JeanThomasMartelli", "display_name": "Jean-Thomas Martelli", "profile_url": "https://csh-delhi.academia.edu/JeanThomasMartelli?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2830188/926366/13607969/s65_jean-thomas.martelli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1197, "name": "Digital Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Humanities?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5780, "name": "Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 17123, "name": "Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28090, "name": "Political Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Representation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 69256, "name": "Generations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 89389, "name": "Party Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Party_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 134138, "name": "Political Socialisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Socialisation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 164380, "name": "Student Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 957582, "name": "Jawaharlal Nehru University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jawaharlal_Nehru_University?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33136654, "title": "CARTOGRAPHICAL STUDY OF THE PARTITION OF COLONIAL PUNJAB", "created_at": "2017-05-22T01:14:29.287-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33136654/CARTOGRAPHICAL_STUDY_OF_THE_PARTITION_OF_COLONIAL_PUNJAB?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33136654", "summary": "Post  Lahore  Resolution  (1940)  events  rapidly  went  in  favour  of  theMuslims  of  the  Indian Subcontinent.

While the former is unconcerned with a person\u201fs religious or cultural identity, the latter imagines the nation as an exclusive community of Hindus. From the time of Independence till now, this distinction has never been in doubt.\nBut today there is a move by flag-bearers of Hindu nationalism to equate it with Indian nationalism. What exactly is the provenance of these two nationalist ideologies? Who were their earliest proponents? What role did either play in India\u201fs freedom struggle? These are some of the questions that author and dramatist Shamsul Islam dwells on in Hindu Nationalism and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , a fine primer on the history and dynamics of Hindu nationalism.\nIslam cites extensively from the works of historians and thinkers who themselves are part of the Hindu nationalist canon, such as R.C. Majumdar and V.D. Savarkar, to interrogate many of its claims. For instance, he shows how Majumdar contradicts the Hindu nationalist claim of India being a \u201eprimordial nation\u201f, given the historian\u201fs observation that the idea of India \u201chad no application to actual politics till the sixties or the seventies of the nineteenth century.\u201d\nIndian nationalism was born in opposition to British colonial oppression. Its most significant moment of resistance was the 1857 mutiny, in which Hindus and Muslims battled together against foreign rule. Islam cites Thomas Lowe, a British army commander, who observed that \u201cthe cow-killer and the cow-worshipper, the pig-hater and the pig-eater\u201d fought together.\nBut this nascent Indian nationalism that was composite in nature underwent a process of bifurcation in the \u201cthird quarter of the nineteenth century\u201d, notes Islam. Two things played a role in this: a \u201edivide and rule\u201f policy adopted by the British, and the bickering between the elites of the two communities \u201cfor securing a favourable place in the eyes of the victor\u201d. Together they created a \u201cscenario in which only competitive Hindu and Muslim varieties of nationalism could flourish.\u201d\nIslam\u201fs book also raises interesting questions: If Indian civilisation is more than 3,500 years old, why is it that only a period of 500 years (the period of so-called Muslim rule) is closely scrutinised by Hindu nationalists? What about the period before?\nIt might be interesting to read Islam\u201fs book alongside his primary sources: V.D. Savarkar\u201fs The Indian War of Independence of 1857 and R.C. Majumdar\u201fs Three Phases of India\u2019s Struggle for Freedom.\n[Hindu Nationalism and Rashtriya Swayamsevakm Sangh by Shamsul Islam. Publisher: MEDIA HOUSE, DELHI.

The character of Maula Jatt and other similar characters in Punjabi films are approached here as constitutive of a specific male cultural type. Films, it should be noted, are studied as sources through which to understand wider cultural discourses of masculinity that are compelling at a particular historical juncture. It is stressed here that in critically engaging with masculinity one has to discard notions of natural, fixed or unitary notions of maleness. Not only is masculinity in itself a relational construct, there are also numerous codes of masculinity that co-exist in a particular context. Hence, this paper is attentive to ways in which Punjabi films present a series of actions and qualities as being the sole domain of manly men as well as to the celebration of a particular code of masculinity over others and its presentation as the standard to judge the worth of all men by. For instance, the ability to protect one\u2019s izzat (honour), which is vested in the body and chastity of women (who are under the guardianship of men), openly display arms and ammunition, exact revenge and rise against the state\u2019s law and order machinery are heralded as markers of masculinity. Beyond examining the presentation of men in relation to women, this paper asserts the importance of examining masculinity in terms of caste identities. Approaching gender in relational terms entails the study of how hegemonic masculinities function by demonstrating their superiority not only over women but also \u2018other\u2019 men. In the films studied here, the Jatt protagonist is portrayed as representing the hegemonic masculinity. Other caste groups are measured according to their ability to live up to this form of masculinity. In turn, the Jatt\u2019s superior masculinity is itself reified by the very fact that other caste groups are valued according to characteristics that are supposed to mark out a manly Jatt.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34688324, "asset_id": 8272267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3272933, "first_name": "Iqbal", "last_name": "Sevea", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "IqbalSevea", "display_name": "Iqbal Sevea", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/IqbalSevea?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32448, "name": "History of Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59094, "name": "History of Punjab", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Punjab?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 72532, "name": "Palestinian Cinema, Lebanese Cinema, Arab Cinema, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Cultural Studies, Ethnology, Cultural Production, Film, Art, Theatre, Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palestinian_Cinema_Lebanese_Cinema_Arab_Cinema_Palestine_Lebanon_Syria_Palestine_Iran_Afghan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 134234, "name": "Punjabi Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 170908, "name": "Indian Cinema, Bollywood, Film Studies, South Asia, Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Cinema_Bollywood_Film_Studies_South_Asia_Media?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 199271, "name": "Punjab Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjab_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 302461, "name": "Pakistani Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistani_Politics?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 49060252, "title": "G.

Im Selbststudium erwarb er sich ausgedehnte Kenntnisse in Pharmazie, Medizin und Botanik. Schon 1816 brach er zu seiner ersten Weltreise auf. Nach einem achtj\u00e4hrigen Aufenthalt im Vorderen und Mittleren Orient gelangte er an den Hof der indischen K\u00f6nige von Lahore (heute Pakistan). Dem damaligen Indien, das Honigberger als seine zweite Heimat bezeichnete, sollte der siebenb\u00fcrgisch-deutsche Forscher und Weltb\u00fcrger den Gro\u00dfteil seines Wirkens widmen. Er unternahm ausgedehnte Forschungsreisen bis zum Fu\u00dfe der Himalaja-Gebirge, errichtete in Lahore und Kalkutta aus eigenen Mitteln die ersten Armenkrankenh\u00e4user des Fernen Orients, k\u00e4mpfte gegen Pest- und Choleraepidemien und entwickelte eine neue Heilmethode gegen diese heimt\u00fcckische Krankheit. Auch die erste Beschreibung und Anwendung von Heilpflanzen-Rezepten bei der Behandlung von neurophysiologischen Krankheiten sowie die Bekanntmachung der Yoga-Kunst der Inder in Europa geh\u00f6ren zu seinen Leistungen. Die Ergebnisse seiner Forschungen ver\u00f6ffentlichte Honigberger in seinem Hauptwerk Fr\u00fcchte aus dem Morgenlande. Die Schrift enth\u00e4lt auch ein medizinisch-botanisches W\u00f6rterbuch, das in neun Sprachen (arabisch, deutsch, englisch, franz\u00f6sisch, lateinisch, persisch, pendschabi- und kaschmirisch, t\u00fcrkisch) verfasst ist. Honigberger konnte n\u00e4mlich in zw\u00f6lf Sprachen sprechen, lesen und schreiben \u2013 ein Polyglotte von Seltenheitswert!\r\n\r\nPionierarbeit leistete Honigberger auch auf einem anderen Gebiet: In seinem Buch \u00fcber die Cholera (Cholera, Its Cause and Infaillible Cure and on Epidemics in General), das 1857 in Kalkutta, Wien, London und Paris in englischer, deutscher und franz\u00f6sischer Sprache herauskam, stellte der Kronst\u00e4dter Forscherarzt die sich sp\u00e4ter bewahrheitete Hypothese auf, dass die Cholera durch spezifische Bakterien hervorgerufen werde. Honigberger ist somit auch ein Vorl\u00e4ufer der modernen Bakteriologie, die 20 Jahre sp\u00e4ter durch Pasteur und Robert Koch begr\u00fcndet wurde. Zudem war Honigberger der erste Arzt, der die von Samuel Hahnemann eingef\u00fchrte hom\u00f6opathische Heilweise im Orient anwandte und bekannt machte. Nicht zuf\u00e4llig also ehren die Inder ihn als einen Mitbegr\u00fcnder der wissenschaftlich fundierten Medizin ihres Landes.\r\n\r\nJohann Martin Honigbergers Schaffen war erstaunlich vielseitig: Er war forschender Arzt und Apotheker, Botaniker und Ethnograpf, Numismatiker und Arch\u00e4ologe, Sprachforscher und Weltreisender (er reiste insgesamt f\u00fcnf Mal nach Indien und durchwanderte Europa, Asien und Afrika) in einer Person. Aber nicht nur in den Annalen der Wissenschaft geb\u00fchrt Honigberger ein Ehrenplatz. Auch als Mensch zeigt er \u00fcberragende Gr\u00f6\u00dfe. Sein weltoffenes, menschenfreundliches, opfermutiges und fortschrittliches Wesen machten ihn zu einem verdienstvollen Humanisten und Kulturpionier seiner Zeit, einen Albert Schweitzer in Lahore und Kalkutta des 18. Jahrhunderts. Johann Martin Honigberger starb, nur einige Monate nach seiner R\u00fcckkehr in die alte Heimat, am 18. Dezember 1869 in Kronstadt und wurde dort am Innerst\u00e4dtischen Friedhof begraben.\r\n\r\n\r\nDie Leistung des Herausgebers\r\n\r\nDer junge Historiker Dr. Eugen Ciurtin, der an der Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Geschichte der Universit\u00e4t Bukarest lehrt, hat in m\u00fchevoller und bewundernswerter Forschungsarbeit \u00fcber Leben und Wirken des J. M. Honigberger so viel neues und authentisches Faktenmaterial zusammengetragen wie noch kein anderer vor ihm. Er ist nicht nur Herausgeber und \u00dcbersetzer, sondern hat auch eine F\u00fclle neuer Details entdeckt, sowohl biografischer Natur als auch \u00fcber die Zeitumst\u00e4nde und das Umfeld, die es bei Honigberger zu \u00fcberwinden galt, \u00fcber die Effektivit\u00e4t der Leistung und deren Wahrnehmung in der damaligen und sp\u00e4teren Fachwelt. Dazu geh\u00f6ren unz\u00e4hlige neue Informationen und Referenzen au\u00dferhalb der deutschgsprachigen Literatur, vorwiegend der englischsprachigen und der franz\u00f6sischen. Ciurtin hat auch Honigbergers Briefwechsel im Britischen Museum ausfindig gemacht und ausgewertet. Diesem Museum hatte Honigberger zahlreiche seiner arch\u00e4ologischen und numismatischen Funde \u00fcberlassen. Seine Korrespondenz mit den indischen Beh\u00f6rden fand der Herausgeber in den staatlichen Archiven Indiens vor. Schier unbekannt waren auch die unz\u00e4hligen Nachrichten \u00fcber den weltreisenden Dr. Honigberger, die Ciurtin in den Zeitungen des damaligen Altreichs entdeckte. Mircea Eliade spielte dabei eine besondere Rolle. Denn aus der Feder des rum\u00e4nischen Schriftstellers und Religionswissenschaftlers stammt die Novelle Secretul doctorului Honigberger. Die von Eliade 1940 in Bukarest ver\u00f6ffentlichte Novelle wird denn auch auf 77 Seiten abgedruckt und vom Herausgeber ausgiebig kommentiert. \u00dcberhaupt nehmen die zahlreichen ausf\u00fchrlichen Fu\u00dfnoten, Anmerkungen, Erg\u00e4nzungen und Literaturhinweise samt Einf\u00fchrung und Vorworten mehr Raum in Anspruch als das Werk des J. M. Honigberger selbst. Das wirkt stellenweise beinahe erdr\u00fcckend und beeintr\u00e4chtigt die \u00dcbersicht und den Blick auf das Wesentliche. Nichtdestotrotz hat Eugen Ciurtin eine umfangreiche und hervorragende Arbeit geleistet, die zu kollegialem Respekt und Dank verpflichtet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Da muss was getan werden\"\r\n\r\nHonigbergers Buch Thirty Five Years in th Orient von 1852 ist mehrfach neu aufgelegt worden. Die erste Neuauflage erschien 1905 in Kalkutta, 1986 und 1993 folgten weitere Auflagen in New Delhi sowie 1995 in London und New Delhi/Madras. Dies erkl\u00e4rt auch, weshalb Honigberger in der englischen (aber auch franz\u00f6sischen) Fachliteratur vielfach zitiert wird, in der deutschsprachigen Literatur jedoch beinahe vergessen wird.\r\n\r\nWozu das f\u00fchren kann, hat Eugen Ciurtin in einer Fu\u00dfnote festgehalten: Da Siebenb\u00fcrgen seine staatliche Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit \u00f6fters wechseln musste, wird er als Ungar \u201eJanos Marton Honigberger\u201c vereinnahmt; f\u00fcr die franz\u00f6sischen Hom\u00f6opathen ist er der \u201eJean-Martin\u201c, w\u00e4hrend die Briten und selbst die meisten indischen Autoren, den Siebenb\u00fcrger Sachsen, der meistens auf Englisch ver\u00f6ffentlichte und dessen Vornamen John und Martin im Angels\u00e4chsischen oft vorkommen, f\u00fcr einen Engl\u00e4nder halten.\r\n\r\nUnd was tun seine eigenen Landsleute, um solche Irrt\u00fcmer erst gar nicht aufkommen zu lassen? Sie vergessen es sogar, Johann Martin Honigberger ins Lexikon der Siebenb\u00fcrger Sachsen aufzunehmen! Eine Fahrl\u00e4ssigkeit, die unentschuldbar ist. Zudem auch unverst\u00e4ndlich. Denn in dem vom Verfasser dieser Zeilen herausgegebenen Band Von Honterus zu Oberth, aus dem die meisten Lexikon-Beitr\u00e4ge \u00fcber bedeutende siebenb\u00fcrgisch-s\u00e4chsische Naturwissenschaftler, Techniker und Mediziner entnommen sind, ist Honigberger ein ganzes Kapitel gewidmet!\r\n\r\nDa ist Wiedergutmachung geboten. Und die kann ich mir besser nicht vorstellen, als dass Die Fr\u00fcchte aus dem Morgenlande baldm\u00f6glichst als Reprint-Ausgabe ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden. Den Rahmen daf\u00fcr gibt es: Dieses bedeutende Werk eines Siebenb\u00fcrger Sachsen eignet sich ausgezeichnet f\u00fcr die Reihe Siebenb\u00fcrgisches Archiv, die im Auftrag des Arbeitskreises f\u00fcr Siebenb\u00fcrgische Landeskunde herausgegeben wird. Und eine F\u00f6rderung durch die Siebenb\u00fcrgisch-S\u00e4chsische Stiftung w\u00e4re sowohl im Sinne des Stiftungsgr\u00fcnders als auch in dessen Auftrag: Als ich n\u00e4mlich Ernst Habermann 1986 zweimal auf seinem Wohnsitz bei Lugana besuchen durfte, unterhielten wir uns haupts\u00e4chlich \u00fcber bedeutende siebenb\u00fcrgisch-s\u00e4chsische Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten. Nachdem wir \u00fcber Leben und Wirken des Johann Martin Honigberger gesprochen hatten, war Habermann von dessen Leistung hoch begeistert, aber auch entt\u00e4uscht, dass diese so wenig bekannt sei.

Using Bollywood/film studies alongside area and postcolonial studies and architectural history, I consider how theme parks work as manifestations of the fantastic, suturing cultural entertainment and racialized violence by proxy in a built space. In this, bpd is a site of culturally co-optive consumption and mediation between the orientalist, or re-orientalized, differences of Asian subjects to the exclusion of the occident(als). Focusing on its patrons and its film-based rides, and through research in the digital humanities, such as studies of first-person shooter games, I demonstrate how bpd serves as a mediascape that thrives on the reorientalized fantasy of Indian cinema. bpd thus provides a simulacral space in which patrons may vicariously test the limits (and possibilities) of South Asian-Middle Eastern multiculturalism, as well as Indian caste mores, against the backdrop of neoliberal globalization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71828204, "asset_id": 56444384, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7335653, "first_name": "R.

You give them names like \u2018terrorists\u2019, or even names of animals, start referring to them as a cancer in the body politic, you talk about them as a disease that must be somehow dealt with.\u201d\n\u2022\tThe fifth stage was creating an \u201corganization\u201d to commit the genocide: the role played by the \u201cIndian army in Kashmir and the census takers in Assam\u201d. \n\u2022\tThe sixth stage was \u201cpolarization\u201d, which is achieved by propaganda. \n\u2022\tThe seventh stage was \u201cpreparation\u201d\n\u2022\t\uf0a0The eighth \u201cpersecution\u201d, where Assam and Kashmir currently were. \n\u2022\tThe ninth stage is \u201cextermination\u201d and;\n\u2022\tThe tenth stage is \u201cdenial\u201d.\n[With thanks to Sabrang]", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61516768, "asset_id": 41304437, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 315452, "first_name": "Shamsul", "last_name": "Islam", "domain_name": "du-in", "page_name": "ShamsulIslam", "display_name": "Shamsul Islam", "profile_url": "https://du-in.academia.edu/ShamsulIslam?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/315452/132752/36110387/s65_shamsul.islam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5782, "name": "Neo-Fascism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neo-Fascism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19672, "name": "Indian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51753, "name": "Genocide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 82140, "name": "Hindu nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_nationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 92458, "name": "Hindutva", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindutva?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 92732, "name": "Hindutva Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindutva_Terrorism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 101355, "name": "Ethnic Cleansing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Cleansing?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 135856, "name": "Religious Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Violence?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 149792, "name": "Neo Nazism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neo_Nazism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 257542, "name": "Hindu Nationalism in Modern India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_Nationalism_in_Modern_India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 268445, "name": "Indian Constitution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Constitution?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 281484, "name": "Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 295479, "name": "Neofascism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neofascism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 960598, "name": "Religious and Political Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_and_Political_Violence?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 961046, "name": "Neonazism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neonazism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1329160, "name": "Hindutva Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindutva_Nationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2994831, "name": "Hinduism/Hindutva", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism_Hindutva?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33668787, "title": "The Story of 'Chota Hazri'", "created_at": "2017-06-27T01:41:14.356-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33668787/The_Story_of_Chota_Hazri?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33668787", "summary": "Merriam Webster's dictionary defines this term Chota Hazri as 'a light meal eaten very early in the morning'. In Hindi-Urdu Chota (\u091b\u094b\u091f\u093e) means 'small (adjective)' and Hazri is from Hindi-Urdu Hazri = Haziri (\u0939\u093e\u093f\u095b\u0930\u0940) meaning 'presence/attendance'. Since Haziri is a feminine noun in Hindi-Urdu, proper phrase would be ' Choti Haziri'. It can be presumed that this phrase could have originated among the Indian servants of British colonial officers, who had to give an early morning call to their masters. John Beames in his 'Memoirs Of A Bengal Civilian' (1960) notes that an early morning meal was served between 5.30 to 6.00 in the morning , and consisted of tea, eggs (boiled or poached), toast & fruit. According to Hobson-Jobson Dictionary, Chota Hazri was largely practiced in Bengal Presidency of British India. It also informs us that the Dutch Colonials in Java (now Indonesia) also practiced this custom of early breakfast with a large cup of tea served with a large piece of Cheese.

Some two decades back I wrote a paper on feminist methodology with a sub-title: \u201cCan Mohilas Speak?\u201d (1995). Apart from re-addressing Gayatri Spivak\u2019s earlier query (\u201cCan the Subaltern Speak?\u201d [1988]), the paper flagged the limits of positivism in understanding woman\u2019s state of insecurity in a world informed and dictated by masculinity or what could be referred to as the purush jat. The follow-up contribution to the critique, albeit with the avowed task of transforming woman\u2019s dismal condition, was done by taking recourse to dialectics, indeed, of a kind that had its roots in the works of Hegel and Marx. A penchant for causality \u2013 \u201ceverything is caused; whenever this, then that\u201d \u2013 could not be avoided (Chenshan Tian, 2005). And that is where, now after two decades, I see the limits of the effort, particularly when it comes to addressing the dialectic of gender relationship and the disempowered status of women in South Asia. And this not because Western dialectical method is at fault (which surely has a tendency of harbouring determinism) or because the utopias put forward by the Hegelians and the Marxists, although qualitatively different in nature, have foundered and transformed into living dystopias but more because of a serious appreciation of the diversity in dialectics, including the contributions of the Chinese and Indian dialectics over the centuries. While the former upheld the dialectics of yin-yang relationship (i.e. balancing the opposites) with \u2018continuity through change\u2019 as a style of thought, the latter \u201cdeveloped what is known as the prasangika method, \u2014 the method of examining all possible alternative interpretations of the opponent\u2019s proposition, showing the absurdity of the respective consequences and thus refuting it\u201d (Esther Solomon, 1978). Put differently, approaching woman\u2019s state of insecurity from the standpoint of yin-yang relationship and/or prasangika can make a far more meaningful contribution to the task of demystifying masculinity and ensuring women\u2019s rights. Engendering security in South Asia otherwise requires not only re-imagining dialectics in the light of its diversity but also making the methodological quest local, indeed, related to the lived experience of the South Asians.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37613622, "asset_id": 12352079, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 280507, "first_name": "Imtiaz", "last_name": "Ahmed", "domain_name": "univdhaka", "page_name": "ImtiazAhmed", "display_name": "Imtiaz Ahmed", "profile_url": "https://univdhaka.academia.edu/ImtiazAhmed?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/280507/68909/75650/s65_imtiaz.ahmed.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1138, "name": "Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1221, "name": "Indian Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Philosophy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2065, "name": "Research Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_Methodology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4370, "name": "Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 11304339, "title": "Review of  \"Exploring the Bhagavad gita\" by Arvind Sharma", "created_at": "2015-03-06T04:25:00.990-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11304339/Review_of_Exploring_the_Bhagavad_gita_by_Arvind_Sharma?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_11304339", "summary": "This is a review of my book \"Exploring the Bhagavad gita;

This is due to the affiliated commonalities between the two nations in terms of culture and commerce. Common cultural and shared economic interests would be instrumental in the effort toward rebuilding strategic relations. The benefits of strategic cooperation could emerge in the form of enhancement in bilateral trade, and increased stability in Afghanistan. This paper explores how the nuclear agreement between Iran and P5+1 has prepared the grounds for improvement in bilateral cooperation. It is recommended here that effective border management would be the relevant CBM to establish post-nuclear deal tactical coordination. This could result in the revival of strategic ties between Iran and Pakistan based on economic integration and defense cooperation. \uf020", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55726587, "asset_id":

They are considered to be adivasi (aboriginal people) which are scheduled in the tribes of India also.  They are habitat in various parts of  Rajasthan as well as the country, but they are mainly found in the districts of Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, Kota, Bundi, Jhalawad, Udaipur, Alwar, Dausa, Jaipur, Tonk and some part of Bharatpur and Dholpur; there is also a small population living in Sikar, Jalore and Ajmer districts. See details in Appendix A, for a map of the Mina (Meena) Language survey region. The Mina (Meena) language area is situated between 28\u00b0 4\u2019 and 30\u00b0 10\u2019 north latitude and between 72\u00b0 30\u2019 and 75\u00b0 30\u2019 east longitude. In the past, the region was arid and barren, but today it is well watered and fertile due to irrigation.  Scheduled Castes are low\u2013caste groups that have been officially recognised by the Government of India and listed in the Constitution. They are therefore eligible for certain types of government assistance. Based on the linguistic features found during the survey, eastern Rajasthan Sawai Madhopur Karauli, western part of Bharatpur, eastern part of Tonk, Bundi, one third of Kota, two-third of Baran and Jhalawar district are its linguistic areas. \nTribes of Rajasthan constitute almost 14% of the total population of the state. The main tribal communities of Rajasthan are Bhil tribe and Meena tribe. The major concentration of these tribes of Rajasthan is found mainly in the foothill of Vindhya, Aravalli mountain ranges. The tribes of Rajasthan are very different from each other and represent a very distinct heritage from the rest of the civilized population.

Her contributions and her impact on the Suffrage Movement is often overlooked in favor of continued dominant white narratives. Sophia\u2019s celebrity status as Princess of the British Punjab region and goddaughter of Queen Victoria, turned her into an invaluable asset to Emmeline Pankhurst and her group, the Women\u2019s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Already a media darling prior to her involvement with the movement, Sophia\u2019s celebrity status was used as a tool to garner more press for the often mocked and ridiculed cause for women\u2019s votes. This study focuses on the press attention Sophia gained for the British Suffrage Movement and her pivotal role as celebrity ally to Emmeline Pankhurst\u2019s inner circle of suffragettes. Princess Sophia Duleep Singh\u2019s active contribution to the campaign for women\u2019s votes is analyzed through the use of her image.

Ravi, Ph.D.\nGeorge Mason University, 2014\nDissertation Director: Dr. Hugh Gusterson\nOn July 18, 2005, US President George W. Bush reversed three decades of non-proliferation policies and offered to allow Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) holdout India to buy nuclear reactors, uranium and dual use technologies on the international market. In return, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh undertook to separate India\u2019s civilian nuclear facilities from its military ones and to place the civilian ones under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. The US-India nuclear deal was heralded as the centerpiece of a transformed US-India relationship and the key initiative that would pave the way for a long-term strategic partnership with profound implications for the Asian and global balance of power.\nThe rather unexpected announcement of a grand nuclear bargain with significant implications for India\u2019s hitherto isolated nuclear program and its overall foreign policy posture led to a comprehensive three-year debate in India. The actors included India\u2019s political, scientific, strategic and media communities. Independent researchers, anti-nuclear activists and civil society also played an important albeit underreported role.\nGiven the techno-politico-strategic implications of the nuclear deal, the debate in India focused on a variety of issues including the contours of the separation plan to partition India\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, the civilian or military status of the fast-breeder reactors in the plan, the impact of the nuclear deal and the US-India rapprochement for the Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline and Iran-India relations, the implications of the initiative for India\u2019s energy security and the constraints imposed by US domestic legislation on India\u2019s ability to obtain nuclear fuel, reprocess foreign fuel and test nuclear weapons.\nA wider discussion also ensued on the impact of the nuclear deal and the US-India strategic partnership for India\u2019s foreign policy. The intensity of the opposition to the nuclear deal from both the political Right and the Left nearly toppled the government of Prime Minister Singh and threatened to end his political career.\nThe dissertation is a qualitative study that aims to understand the multifaceted debate over the nuclear deal in India. I rely on newspaper articles, foundational references, leaked American diplomatic cables, government documents and critiques by independent researchers and anti-nuclear activists. The theoretical framework consists of concepts from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Political Science.\nChapter 1 provides a brief history of US-India relations since India\u2019s independence in 1947 and consolidates the various \u2018birth stories\u2019 attempting to explain the origins of the nuclear deal. Chapter 2 reconstructs the 8 month long debate in India (July 2005 to March 2006) over the contours of its nuclear separation plan and the safeguarded civilian or unsafeguarded military status of the fast breeder reactors. The\ntheoretical framework consists of Bijker\u2019s concept of relevant social groups, the modified concept of relevant social individuals and the notion of boundary objects by Star and Griesemer.\nChapter 3 also concentrates on the same period as Chapter 2 and chronicles the intersection of the debate over the Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) pipeline and the nuclear deal using the modified concepts of relevant social individuals and a technopolitical frame. The idea of a technopolitical frame is obtained by combining Bijker\u2019s notion of a technological frame with literature from political science and international relations. Chapter 4 analyzes the important role played by Indian nuclear scientists in the debate over the nuclear deal from March 2006-August 2007. I deploy Bijker\u2019s concept of relevant social groups and relevant social individuals, Hecht\u2019s idea of a technopolitical regime, the notion of experimenter\u2019s regress by Collins and Pinch and the abstraction of hyperconstruction by Gusterson. Finally, Chapter 5 summarizes the key insights gained from the aforementioned chapters and contrasts the claims made in 2005 by the nuclear deal\u2019s proponents with the current state of US-India relations as of July 2014.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51686706, "asset_id": 31287468, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 654971, "first_name": "Chaitanya", "last_name": "Ravi", "domain_name": "flameedu", "page_name": "ChaitanyaRavi", "display_name": "Chaitanya Ravi", "profile_url": "https://flameedu.academia.edu/ChaitanyaRavi?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/654971/227102/16177775/s65_chaitanya.ravi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5218, "name": "Iranian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5412, "name": "Energy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Energy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25123, "name": "Nuclear Energy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nuclear_Energy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28009, "name": "Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 22101299, "title": "Book Review_China and India: Cooperation or Conflict by Waheguru Pal Singh Sidhu and Jing Dong Yuan", "created_at": "2016-02-17T08:07:25.896-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22101299/Book_Review_China_and_India_Cooperation_or_Conflict_by_Waheguru_Pal_Singh_Sidhu_and_Jing_Dong_Yuan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_22101299", "summary": " ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42771324, "asset_id": 22101299, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6225751, "first_name": "Mohd Tahir", "last_name": "Ganie", "domain_name": "dcu", "page_name": "MGanie", "display_name": "Mohd Tahir Ganie", "profile_url": "https://dcu.academia.edu/MGanie?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6225751/2718382/40348631/s65_mohd_tahir.ganie.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1483, "name": "Foreign Policy Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Policy_Analysis?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12787, "name": "Chinese foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_foreign_policy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 124363, "name": "India's Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indias_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 13437182, "title": "Songs of Life in Calcutta: Protest and Social Commentary in Contemporary Bengali Popular Music", "created_at": "2015-06-30T00:20:26.477-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13437182/Songs_of_Life_in_Calcutta_Protest_and_Social_Commentary_in_Contemporary_Bengali_Popular_Music?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_13437182", "summary": "This article deals with the construction of local identity in Calcutta (Kolkata) through the reappropriation of Western forms of popular music.

A widespread problem faced by the discipline at present is the reluctance to raise \u2018big questions\u2019. Quite apart from the problem of \u2018Euroschauism\u2019 which imposes partial views as the universal view, it is necessary for sociologists in a country like India to raise the issue of social change in India and the rest of the world as a theoretical issue that demands adequate conceptualisation. \r\nSuch a task demands a critical perspective. It is possible to be critical of one\u2019s culture while being rooted in it. The first step to take is to study the concerns of the average person and to look at one\u2019s society critically, not as an outsider who finds the country of his birth difficult to take but as an insider who chooses to live in his country and undergoes what everyone else is going through. Along with this is the ability to step outside one\u2019s own society, not to go away but to return.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n*This is a revised version of the paper presented at the seminar on \u2018Global Challenges and Local Responses: Trends and Developments in Society and Sociologyin Asia and Beyond\u2019, Singapore, March 14 to 16, 2004.

This manuscript seeks to understand how the religious\r\naspect influenced regional identity-building under conditions of colonial rule in\r\nIndia. The paper draws on a project concerning itself with the political implications\r\nof regional identities during the twenties and thirties of the 20th century. The\r\nproject compares the movements of the Sikhs, the Tamil \"Non-Brahmans\" and\r\nthe Pakhtuns.\r\nIt is intended to outline the evolution of the religious aspect in these movements\r\nthrough three major stages of political mobilisation: revivalism, loyalism\r\nand radicalism. The issue seems to be of particular interest in the Indian case\r\nfor two reasons:\r\n- Was there any common pattern behind the influence of religion on group\r\nidentity? What were the similarities and the differences in the role of religion\r\nin the three movements?\r\n- Was there any peculiarity in the Indian case under colonial rule as compared\r\nto the time of independence?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56637047, "asset_id": 2401345, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3118529, "first_name": "Dietrich",

In this process, the children of those migrants are the worst affected whether they accompany their parents or are left behind in the villages. The present paper explores the impact of temporary labour migration of parent(s) on school attendance of the children between 6\u201314 years and their dropping out from the school through an analysis of the cases from both the ends of migration stream in India. Data was collected from thirteen construction sites of Varanasi Uttar Pradesh and nine villages of Bihar by applying both qualitative and quantitative techniques. It is evident from the study that the migrants through remittances improve school accessibility for the left behind children and bridge gender gap in primary school education. However, among the accompanying migrant children of construction workers, many remain out of school and many are forced to drop out and some of them become vulnerable to work as child labour due to seasonal mobility of their parents. Thus, mainstreaming these children in development process is a big challenge in attaining the goal of universal primary education and inclusive growth in the country like India. \r\nKey words: School dropout, seasonal labour migration, left behind children, caste system, poverty, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37356567, "asset_id": 12022057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5430084, "first_name": "Journal Space and Culture, India", "last_name": "Open access Journal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JournalSpaceandCultureIndiaOpenaccessJournal", "display_name": "Journal Space and Culture, India Open access Journal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JournalSpaceandCultureIndiaOpenaccessJournal?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5430084/9707629/28902891/s65_journal_space_and_culture_india.open_access_journal.jpg"}, {"id": 30030291, "first_name": "PAPPU", "last_name": "SINGH", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PAPPUSINGH4", "display_name": "PAPPU SINGH", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PAPPUSINGH4?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30030291/9045203/10090707/s65_pappu.singh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 733490, "name": "Migration Rural-To-Urban", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Rural-To-Urban?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 26945915, "title": "Passenger name redBus ticket #

Therapies like Ras\u0101yana, that have been out of fashion for some time, were revived and adapted to modern needs in the 20th century. In spite of this ability to change and adjust to new circumstances, representatives of modern Ayurveda often prefer to emphasize and even exaggerate the old age and originality of their science.",

According to Fauq, Ganai was a title, which in Persian means \"a literary person or scholar\". So, Ganais were a celebrated scholarly class, which has given Kashmir such renowned people of learning and erudition as Sheikh Yaqoob Sarfi Ganai and Sheikh Baba Dawood Khaki Ganai. \nFauq categories Ganais into four sub-groups: one, those who\u2019re from the children of Hazrat Aasim bin Hazrat Umar Farooq (RA). Second, those people who were Syed or Mughal or Pathan or Qureshi and were bestowed this [Ganai] title and later their progenies were also called Ganai.

Is the display of devotion in a cinema hall the same as devotion in a temple? How do we understand cinema\u2019s compelling power to mesmerize people?\nUnlike Hindi cinema, mythological and devotional films remained popular genres in Telugu (and Tamil too) until quite recently. The political success of film star N.T. Rama Rao, well-known for his portrayal of gods and kings, posed afresh the problem of cinema\u2019s power to enthral. To what extent viewers were persuaded of his divinity became a matter of debate. In later decades, the figure of another kind of viewer haunted the discourses around cinema, that of the female viewer who got possessed during screenings of goddess films. \nUsing questions around viewership as the focal point, this book studies the intersections between popular cinema, religion, and politics in South India. The first full-length study of Telugu mythological and devotional films, it combines an account of the history and politics of these genres with an anthropology of film-making and viewership practices.

Since the inception of SAARC in 1985, concerns over terrorism have been showed and realization for collective regional mechanism is prominently highlighted in its agenda as the terrorism is threatening political stability and mutual understanding in the region. Owing to increased threats, terrorism was high on agenda during the 3rd summit of SAARC at Kathmandu in 1987. All the seven members signed \u2018SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression of Terrorism and were agreed to take effective measures. The Convention warned the member countries against this menace and its dangerous effects towards regional security. In 1988, the convention came into force but did not control the terrorist activities by taking any effective measure. Several other initiatives have also been taken from this forum but the desired results are not achieved. The paper is to examine the counterterrorism initiatives taken by this forum and to explore impediments blocking the path of cooperation for an effective and joint strategy as well as suggestions for countering terrorism and securing regional peace and stability.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33609301, "asset_id": 6937381, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11711173, "first_name": "Scholar", "last_name": "Pakistan", "domain_name": "pu-pk1", "page_name": "ScholarPakistan", "display_name": "Scholar Pakistan", "profile_url": "https://pu-pk1.academia.edu/ScholarPakistan?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11711173/3376827/3973542/s65_scholar.pakistan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1720, "name": "International Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5847, "name": "Political Extremism/Radicalism/Populism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Extremism_Radicalism_Populism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26669, "name": "Counter terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counter_terrorism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 63483, "name": "Extremism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extremism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 95854, "name": "Critical Terrorism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Terrorism_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 176715, "name": "SAARC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SAARC?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 178435, "name": "Saarc Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Saarc_Region?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 663867, "name": "Regional Peace and Stability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_Peace_and_Stability?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 717029, "name": "Stability and Chaos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stability_and_Chaos?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 3888510, "title": "Sinhala Purism: The Works of R.

In part, this oversight is due to so few libraries (both in Pakistan and around the world) having copies of the Journal of the Sind Historical Society. There are no reprints of these articles in any other book, nor has anyone reprinted them in their entirety since the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe articles in this book not only deepen knowledge about Sindh but also the history of Pakistan and the diversity of its people. They represent, like most research printed in the Journal of the Sind Historical Society, \u2018forgotten\u2019 chapters in both Sindhi and Pakistani history.

"summary": "A large number of religious monuments from this period are spread across the state (Choudhury 2013). However, nothing is known of firstly, the neighbouring habitation sites. Secondly, the regional network of such sites. Much of the archaeological research in Assam is mainly single-site oriented, and art historical methods are often used for to study such sites. As a result the early medieval structures or monuments remain isolated features in the landscape sans context in regards to its immediate surroundings. Documentation of more settlements of this period and studying their characteristics and their connection to other neighbouring sites is the key to comprehensively understanding the early medieval history of Assam. Having felt such a need, this small scale, independent, surface survey project was carried out across nine modern villages around the archaeological site of Sri Surya Pahar (SSP) in Goalpara district, western Assam. The main aim of this project was to explore the immediate surroundings of Sri Surya Pahar site (SSP site) and document the visible archaeological features and examine the potential of this area for future projects.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55426184, "asset_id": 35560648, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6883273, "first_name": "Bratatee", "last_name": "Barman", "domain_name": "fu-berlin", "page_name": "BratateeBarman", "display_name": "Bratatee Barman", "profile_url": "https://fu-berlin.academia.edu/BratateeBarman?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6883273/2772336/40477629/s65_bratatee.barman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77301, "name": "Assam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assam?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2854955, "name": "Brahmaputra River Valley", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brahmaputra_River_Valley?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 17568814, "title": "[Steve Coll] Ghost Wars The Secret History of the", "created_at": "2015-11-01T04:17:07.092-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17568814/_Steve_Coll_Ghost_Wars_The_Secret_History_of_the?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_17568814", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39585970, "asset_id": 17568814, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37378328, "first_name": "Maqsood", "last_name": "Shaheen", "domain_name": "aiou", "page_name": "MaqsoodShaheen", "display_name": "Maqsood Shaheen", "profile_url": "https://aiou.academia.edu/MaqsoodShaheen?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49497409, "title": "Yoga, Nationalism, and Bio-Political Resistance: Understanding the Resurgence of Ha\u1e6dha Yoga During India\u2019s Independence Movement", "created_at": "2021-07-01T10:09:39.613-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49497409/Yoga_Nationalism_and_Bio_Political_Resistance_Understanding_the_Resurgence_of_Ha%E1%B9%ADha_Yoga_During_India_s_Independence_Movement?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_49497409", "summary": "For evidence of resistance taking root within the container of a religious tradition, look no further than to India in the first half of the 20th century\u2014and to the meteoric revival of ha\u1e6dha yoga.

How might the conceptions and experiences of time offered by the s\u016btras challenge our assumptions about time and history? Are we able to imagine a form of historiography that does not require the imposition of a single temporal framework?

It explores how queer identities are formed in virtual spaces and how the existence of such spaces challenge and critique \u2018Indian\u2019-ness. It also looks at the role of class and intimacy within the discourse. This work argues that new media, social networking sites (SNSs), both web and mobile, and related technologies do not exist in isolation; rather they are critically embedded within other social spaces. Similarly, online queer spaces exist parallel to and in conjunction with the larger queer movement in the country.\n\nThis book will be of great interest to scholars and researchers of gender studies, especially men's and masculinity studies, queer and LGBT studies, media and cultural studies, particularly new media and digital culture, sexuality and identity, politics, sociology and social

significance of political revolutionaries in the history of Indian anti-colonialism is indisputable and yet it is difficult to describe a singular 'Indian revolutionary tradition'. During this course, which will survey the half-century before independence in 1947, we will explore a variety of radical or revolutionary politics, searching as much for intellectual disjuncture as commonalities. We will focus on reading personal narratives that demonstrate the ways in which key figures thought and wrote about their journeys towards a political identity \u2013 reading, for instance, M. K. Gandhi's revolt against history and liberalism, Hind Swaraj; Lala Har Dayal's memoirs of his world-crossing revolutionary circuits; and the young revolutionary self that emerges from Bhagat Singh's Jail Notebook. We will pay attention throughout to themes of violence, travel, and the often-times ambivalent relationship between revolutionaries and the nation. We will complement our focus on texts with reflection on the importance of images of the revolutionary and the nature of popular memory in the Indian context.

"The base texts of most of the philosophical systems of ancient India are in the form of a collection of aphorisms (s\u016btra-s). The aphorisms are so brief and tersely worded that their significance can seldom be understood without the help of a commentary or commentaries. Sometimes, the literal meaning of an aphorism needs to be qualified or modified by an explanation found in the commentary. If a reader relies exclusively on the literal meaning of the aphorisms in the base text without having recourse to any commentary or disregards all commentaries, he or she may miss the point. Contrariwise, if a reader relies exclusively on a commentary and disregards the literal meaning of an aphorism, he or she will commit another kind of blunder. Ideally, equal attention should be paid to the base text as well as the commentary or commentaries.

Drawing on Iyengar literature and interviews with Iyengar yoga teachers, the paper suggests that women-oriented practices are considered by Iyengar members as rooted in ancient knowledge which was illuminated by the Iyengars. Also, women-oriented Iyengar yoga practices manifest what might be considered as the distinct attributes of Iyengar yoga teachings. Women-oriented practices' are perceived as a distinct, yet inseparable segment of Iyengar yoga practices. While Iyengar teachers express diverse standpoints regarding specialized practices' necessity and usage, they are an inherent element of the contemporary Iyengar teaching tradition.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59026661, "asset_id": 38926033, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10006692, "first_name": "Agi (Agnes)", "last_name": "Wittich", "domain_name": "huji", "page_name": "AgiWittich", "display_name": "Agi (Agnes) Wittich", "profile_url": "https://huji.academia.edu/AgiWittich?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10006692/4592185/68761722/s65_agi_agnes_.wittich.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4104, "name": "Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoga?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 17902, "name": "Gender and religion (Women s Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_religion_Women_s_Studies_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 71223, "name": "Caste and Gender Issues in Indian Culture and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caste_and_Gender_Issues_in_Indian_Culture_and_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 112362, "name": "Women in India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_in_India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 124434, "name": "Religion and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Gender?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 189201, "name": "Gender and religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_religion?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 336804, "name": "Body and culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Body_and_culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 980040, "name": "Modern Yoga Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Yoga_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1131450, "name": "Antropology of Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antropology_of_Religions?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 11616735, "title": "Syed Ameer Ali", "created_at": "2015-03-23T13:17:19.691-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11616735/Syed_Ameer_Ali?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_11616735", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37087441, "asset_id": 11616735, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28365885, "first_name": "Awamiawaz", "last_name": "sunday mag", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Awamiawazsundaymag", "display_name": "Awamiawaz sunday mag", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Awamiawazsundaymag?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28365885/8011926/8973626/s65_awamiawaz.sunday_mag.jpg_oh_a483e78ed1c7c59f94d07e8e2a696e11_oe_557150fd"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44291217, "title": "Ethnomusicology and the Indian Ocean: On the Politics of Area Studies.

It highlights a shift in the scholarship, from investigations of the imperial sciences to the study of colonised subjects as practitioners and participants in global scientific modernity. South Asians' encounter with European sciences altered precolonial epistemologies and social hierarchies, defined the image of authoritative knowledge in colonial society and came to shape desirable collective futures and individual aspirations. By the early twentieth century, science emerged as a distinctly Indian vocation. This essay studies these historical transformations through emblematic figures: the pandit, the daktar and the engineer, and the everyday reader and consumer of science. Social groups in colonial society had starkly different access to specialist education and expertise, and this differential access structured their recruitment and participation in scientific publics. This essay extends the critique of science as colonial power to reveal how science reshaped public authority, cultural archetypes, social aspirations and professional vocations, and became a technology of caste and nationalist power in colonial and postcolonial India.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67917299, "asset_id": 44633217, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11101580, "first_name": "Charu", "last_name": "Singh", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "CharuSingh", "display_name": "Charu Singh", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/CharuSingh?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11101580/3282325/56013524/s65_charu.singh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557, "name": "History of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Technology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7611, "name": "Sociology Of Scientific Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_Of_Scientific_Knowledge?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 36188108, "title": "Vernacularization of Islam and Sufism in South Asia: A Study of the Production of Sufi Literature in Local Languages", "created_at": "2018-03-17T17:59:28.046-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36188108/Vernacularization_of_Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia_A_Study_of_the_Production_of_Sufi_Literature_in_Local_Languages?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_36188108", "summary": "Vernacularization of Islam is the process through which the message and teachings of Islam adjusted and adapted in local regional environments outside Arabia.

Navigating the lanes of Calcutta/Kolkata, sensory memoryscapes evocatively reframe the history of this minor transnational community.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55703429, "asset_id": 35825989, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31951075, "first_name": "Mara", "last_name": "Matta", "domain_name": "uniroma1", "page_name": "MattaMara", "display_name": "Mara Matta", "profile_url": "https://uniroma1.academia.edu/MattaMara?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31951075/18950125/18898474/s65_mara.matta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 947, "name": "Theatre Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9547, "name": "Minority Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 10099, "name": "History of Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religions?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13954, "name": "History of the Jews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Jews?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 23325, "name": "Indian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2883660, "name": "Baghdadi Jews in India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baghdadi_Jews_in_India?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 34141759, "title": "Interview, \"Poetry as 'an effort to understand': An interview with Gieve Patel.\"  Journal of Postcolonial Writing, 53.1/2, 2017. pp 25-32\r\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17449855.2017.1294647", "created_at": "2017-08-05T11:37:29.377-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34141759/Interview_Poetry_as_an_effort_to_understand_An_interview_with_Gieve_Patel_Journal_of_Postcolonial_Writing_53_1_2_2017_pp_25_32_http_www_tandfonline_com_doi_full_10_1080_17449855_2017_1294647?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_34141759", "summary": "In this interview, conducted in Bombay in June 2015, Gieve Patel reflects on his career as a poet, playwright, publisher, artist and educator, from his first arts show in 1966 (a year which also saw the publication of his first collection of poems) to the present.

It has empowered Shi'is, who form about 20 percent of the country\u2019s population, to advance alternative conceptions of their religious hierarchy while claiming the support of towering grand ayatollahs in Iran and Iraq. \r\n\r\nFuchs shows how popular Pakistani preachers and scholars have boldly tapped into the esoteric potential of Shi'ism, occupying a creative and at times disruptive role as brokers, translators, and self-confident pioneers of contemporary Islamic thought. They have indigenized the Iranian Revolution and formulated their own ideas for fulfilling the original promise of Pakistan. Challenging typical views of Pakistan as a mere Shi'i backwater, Fuchs argues that its complex religious landscape represents how a local, South Asian Islam may open up space for new intellectual contributions to global Islam.

Singh's book on the rani of Jhansi is a most fascinating account and discussion that configures both narrative and history through a feminist, post-colonial and literary lens. The book analyses gender, sex-uality, race and religion in India through a persistent and a deeply-committed historical method that articulates a theory of power, wielded through the body of public women and the 10 representation of their public lives. The Rani of Jhansi is divided into five chapters. The first chapter ('Introduction') begins with an exploration of the rani as a central figure in the Hindutva politics that define the 1857 rebellion, the annexation of princely states such as Jhansi, and the fall of Delhi as a point of departure in the nationalist writing of Indian history. Singh outlines the representation of the 15 1857 upsurge in colonial and missionary writing as a racialised discourse of religious difference , contextualising the rani's biography and the massacre at Jhansi in an analysis of colonial policy concerning Indian women, gender, and the representation of women in literature. The rani was remembered in nineteenth-century British literature about India's 'first war of inde-pendence' as a dangerous and brutal figure; Singh identifies British colonialism as a narrative 20 that was entrenched by a 'rape script'. The second chapter ('Enslaving Masculinity: Rape Scripts and the Erotics of Power') explores this 'rape script' by demonstrating how the narrative production of vulnerable British domesticity and the docile Indian woman were used together to justify colonial British masculinity as saviour from the rani. Singh looks at novels written in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to analyse British images of the rani who 25 was alternately produced as a whore or as a rapist seeking to dominate British virility. She locates the rani at the interstice of colonial tropes that simultaneously produced Indian masculinity as effeminate and the sexual female warrior as brutal, and as vanquished subjects of British colonial and masculine triumph. Chapter 3 ('India's Aryan Queen: Colonial Ambivalence and Race in the Mutiny') documents the rediscovery of the rani as a Brahmin in 30 hagiographic writings that attempt to smooth over anti-colonial sentiment towards her by positioning her as a heroic and saintly spirit comparable with Joan of Arc. While such writings diverted attention from the rani's revolt against the British and were contextualised in the emergence of the notion of an Aryan race in Europe, they elevated her status (though still lower than Europeans) while disconnecting her from regional and national alliances. Chapter 35 4('Coherent Pasts in Hindi Literature and Film') and Chapter 5 ('Unmaking the Nationalist Archive: Gender and Dalit Historiography') are connected in their exploration of post-colonial narratives. Chapter 4 explores how Hindi-language poetry, fiction and film in India produce the rani as a warrior goddess whose grandeur and dominion is reflected in India's national anthem. She becomes seamlessly entwined with the nationalist cause, thereby allow-40 ing Hindi language and literature to create a representational politics of the nationalist cause in India. Chapter 5 explores the question of Dalit feminist writing since it uses folklore, memory and a multiplicity of narratives to theorise the boundary of mainstream discourse, making it non-patriarchal and counter-hegemonic.

The reprehensible act of brute force to prevent the purported Indian sedition from spreading, and the blatant justification of General Dyer's cold blooded killings in the British Parliamentary Debates can well expose and render a true picture of the Empire's deep rooted racism and colonial prejudice. A reconstruction of the same is perhaps inevitable and revisiting the same might allow us comprehend how no amount of denouncement and censure of General Dyer's idiosyncratic act of can wipe out the

In the early nineteenth century, an imperial civil society movement promoted modern elementary 'schools for all'. This movement included British, American and German missionaries, and Indian intellectuals and social reformers. They organised themselves in non-governmental organisations, which aimed to change Indian education. Firstly, they introduced a new culture of schooling, centred on memorisation, examination, and technocratic management. Secondly, they laid the ground for the building of the colonial system of education, which substituted indigenous education. Thirdly, they broadened the social accessibility of schooling. However, for the nineteenth century reformers, education for all did not mean equal education for all: elementary schooling became a means to teach different subalterns 'their place' in colonial society. Finally, the educational movement also furthered the building of a secular 'national education' in England. Studying these trajectories and developments in detail, this book contributes to a sharpening of the concept of \u2018colonial education\u2019 as one version of the modern nineteenth century grammar of schooling.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59377513, "asset_id": 39009541, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12265490, "first_name": "Jana", "last_name": "Tschurenev", "domain_name": "xn--uni-gttingen-8ib", "page_name": "JanaTschurenev", "display_name": "Jana Tschurenev", "profile_url": "https://xn--uni-gttingen-8ib.academia.edu/JanaTschurenev?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12265490/5127482/57904148/s65_jana.tschurenev.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5035, "name": "Comparative & International Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_and_International_Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8495, "name": "History of Missions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Missions?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15702, "name": "Modern Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Indian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 225334, "name": "Colonial Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Education?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1394452, "name": "Monitorial System of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monitorial_System_of_Education?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 35892116, "title": "Chapter -2 Water Disputes in South Asian Sub-Continent", "created_at": "2018-02-11T02:30:22.674-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35892116/Chapter_2_Water_Disputes_in_South_Asian_Sub_Continent?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35892116", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55772042, "asset_id": 35892116, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76321961, "first_name": "muzaffar", "last_name": "hussain", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "muzaffarhussain36", "display_name": "muzaffar hussain", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/muzaffarhussain36?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34435907, "title": "Online Romeos and Gay-dia: Exploring Queer Spaces in Digital India", "created_at": "2017-09-01T07:22:29.182-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34435907/Online_Romeos_and_Gay_dia_Exploring_Queer_Spaces_in_Digital_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_34435907", "summary": "This chapter refocuses attention on the subversive potential of digital queer spaces in India. Academic discourses on queer sexuality in contemporary India have so far concentrated on textual, cinematic, and sociological representations, with little scholarship on the digital landscape and the various ways in which it shapes the construct of the queer male identity in India. This chapter examines how Internet and digital technologies, the media industry, and sociohistorical contexts provide a subversive space within which queer male identity is negotiated. The chapter offers an overview of media development in India and then discusses queer representations in mass media and digital queer spaces in India, which are a consequence of the shifting political and socio-scape of urban and suburban India. Finally the chapter also reviews key debates in digital culture and queer studies, situating the Indian queer digital space within the intersection of globalization and postcolonial praxis.",

It is argued that precisely the absence of such a theory should encourage us to draw lessons from varied backgrounds. Gandhi\u2019s role gives credence to some of the most innovative management ideas on leadership. These ideas can only become richer if the full range of Gandhi\u2019s achievements can be adequately comprehended.

It foregrounds the dangerous and deviant heroes, who recur within Madurai as a cinematic space, in films such as Kadhal (Love, 2004), Veyil (Torrid Sun, 2005), Paruthiveeran (Cotton Champ, 2007), and Subramaniapuram (2008). They contest the cinematic construction of the homogenous \u2018ethno-specific\u2019 Tamil nation. If the First Wave interrupted the \u2018Indian\u2019 cinema\u2019s project of discursively constructing a national people, the Third Wave offers a version of the Tamil country that is caste-infected and criminal prone. At the same time, it deconstructs the urbane cosmopolitan address that a Second Wave constructed in the 1990s. These films not only go beyond \u2018neo-native\u2019 imaginations to critique the First and Second waves, but also spatialize caste and criminality as conscripts of cinema.

In this paper, we investigate whether the partisanship of incumbent politicians affects the incidence and severity of local ethnic violence. Using a novel application of the regression-discontinuity design, we show that as-if random victory by candidates representing India's Congress party in close state assembly elections between 1962 and 2000 reduced Hindu-Muslim rioting. The effects are large. Simulations reveal that had Congress lost all close elections in this period, India would have experienced 11 percent more riots. Additional analyses suggest that Congress candidates' dependence on local Muslim votes, as well as apprehensions about religious polarization of the electorate in the event of riots breaking out, are what drive the observed effect. Our findings shed new light on parties' connection to ethnic conflict, the relevance of partisanship in developing states, and the puzzle of democratic consolidation in ethnically divided societies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65159431, "asset_id": 44684890, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 178694094, "first_name": "Gareth", "last_name": "Nellis", "domain_name": "ucsd", "page_name": "GarethNellis", "display_name": "Gareth Nellis", "profile_url": "https://ucsd.academia.edu/GarethNellis?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/178694094/50178783/38180365/s65_gareth.nellis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 16211, "name": "Ethnic Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 951122, "name": "Political Parties and Party Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Parties_and_Party_Politics?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 43642847, "title": "Delhi Minority Commission's gut-wrenching fact-finding report on February-March 2020 violence in Delhi", "created_at": "2020-07-16T21:26:41.957-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43642847/Delhi_Minority_Commissions_gut_wrenching_fact_finding_report_on_February_March_2020_violence_in_Delhi?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_43642847", "summary": "GUT-WRENCHING FACTUAL REPORT ON THE ANTI-MUSLIM VIOLENCE [FEBRUARY-MARCH 2020] IN DELHI BY DELHI MINORITY COMMISSION, A STATUTORY BODY SHOWS HOW INDIAN STATE HAS COMPLETELY DISCARDED DEMOCRACY-SECULARISM WHILE DEALING WITH THE ANTI-MUSLIM VIOLENCE.

about the practices of the gaze enacted in tourist sites. It draws on ethnographic research carried out in the Indian sacred city of Varanasi, on the bank of the 'holy' Ganges, to suggest alternative, non-Western ways of conceptualizing and performing sight and the visual. The case study focuses on the Ganga Aarti, a popular Hindu ceremony performed daily on the city's riverfront. Celebrating the sacred vision of the Ganges, this ceremony can be considered as an expression of the 'host' gaze. At the same time, the Ganga Aarti and the quaint city's riverscape constitute the focus of the tourist gaze, and draw together, in fact, diverse visual traditions and practices. Indeed, I argue that tourist places are to be understood as sites of multiple, situated gazes, where different gazing subjects negotiate different visions, meanings and practices and co-construct, both visually and physically, the tourist space.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56660284, "asset_id": 36719227, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 82176466, "first_name": "Cristiana", "last_name": "Zara", "domain_name": "bham", "page_name": "CZara", "display_name": "Cristiana Zara", "profile_url": "https://bham.academia.edu/CZara?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 988293, "name": "Social and Cultural Geography; Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Geography_Identity?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 567331, "title": "Lokman, Chholeman and Manik Pir: Multiple Frames of Institutionalising Islamic Medicine in Modern Bengal", "created_at": "2011-05-05T23:10:28.394-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/567331/Lokman_Chholeman_and_Manik_Pir_Multiple_Frames_of_Institutionalising_Islamic_Medicine_in_Modern_Bengal?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_567331", "summary": "As a Muslim-majority region, Bengal is conspicuous by its absence from histories of the institutionalisation of Islamic medicine in South Asia.

To understand how distorted information is being used to gain and maintain unchecked and unaccountable power in Asia and the Pacific, USAID/Asia Bureau\u2019s Technical Services requested, under the Asia Emerging Opportunities mechanism, an analysis of how information disorder affirms authoritarianism and destabilizes democracy in Asia and the Pacific. In discussing the scope of work with the USAID/Asia Bureau, the research team received guidance that\nthe analysis should present a series of in-depth country case studies that examine if and, if so, how information disorder affirms authoritarianism and destabilizes democracy in Asia and the Pacific. The team approached this question through a series of in-depth country case studies that concentrated on identifying supply- and demand-side factors that contribute to information disorder at the national and subnational levels in four countries in Asia and the Pacific. The case study countries are the Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand. The countries represent regime types ranging from relatively democratic political systems to de facto military dictatorships.

Yet often these objects carry additional, deeper meanings that can only be understood when we take into account the artists and patrons who contributed to their creation. Drawing on new research, this paper focuses on particular artists who created works for display and use in Bhutanese ritual environments, with special attention paid to objects created in the early post-Zhabdrung era.\r\n\r\nThe study takes as its point of departure one of the foremost artists in Bhutanese history: Tsang Khenchen Palden Gyatso (gtsang mkhan chen dpal ldan rgya mtsho; 1610-1684), who arrived in Bhutan in the second half of the 17th century. Tsang Khenchen\u2014and the Bhutanese students he trained\u2014constitute a major foundation of what can be termed \u2018Bhutanese art\u2019 on a national scale, and this paper analyses the impacts of Tsang Khenchen and his atelier in highlighting important Vajrayana Buddhist rituals, practices, and lineage masters through their artistic output.\r\n\r\nDue to the comparative political and social stability of Bhutan over the centuries, works attributable to Tsang Khenchen and other important artists survive intact to the present. These works constitute the core of this paper, which hopes to offer evidence of the ways Bhutanese art evolved to fit a new nation in 17th century Bhutan, and how resulting works employed Vajrayana Buddhist imagery to reflect a distinctly \u2018Bhutanese\u2019 identity and artistic style. This paper is one facet of a larger, longer term research project undertaken in collaboration with the National Library and Archives of Bhutan that seeks to identify, examine and analyze those individual artists whose creations provide key touchstones to Bhutanese art history. \r\n\r\n**A version of this paper appeared in Orientations 48/3 (May/June 2017)\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61909214, "asset_id": 34730270, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 783733, "first_name": "Ariana", "last_name": "Maki", "domain_name": "virginia", "page_name": "ArianaMaki", "display_name": "Ariana Maki", "profile_url": "https://virginia.academia.edu/ArianaMaki?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/783733/265520/12065468/s65_ariana.maki.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52021, "name": "Himalayan Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Himalayan_Art?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 106646, "name": "Bhutan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhutan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10744944, "title": "\u201cBollywood 101\u201d   The Visual Culture of Bollywood Film Posters ", "created_at": "2015-02-12T12:34:52.311-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10744944/_Bollywood_101_The_Visual_Culture_of_Bollywood_Film_Posters?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_10744944", "summary": "The Indian film industry is the world\u2019s largest producer of films, releasing more than a thousand movies a year in multiple languages since the early 1900s. By the 1980s, Hindi language cinema generally came to be known as Bollywood. These films have a spectacular blend of romance, melodrama, fantasy, song, and dance extravaganza. This exhibition explores the visual history of Bollywood film posters and their influence on popular culture, religion, politics, and art. \r\nThe brightly colored Bollywood film poster has an aesthetic idiom of its own which dates back to the paintings of the artist Raja Ravi Varma (1848-1906). He developed a distinct style of representing Hindu gods and goddesses by merging academic western realism with traditional Indian art forms. In 1894, Ravi Varma set up his printing press in Mumbai (Bombay), mass-producing his paintings in the form of oleograph prints. Characterized by sensuous feminine forms, frontal compositions, and vibrant colors, Ravi Varma\u2019s style influenced consumer art forms such as calendar art and film posters.\r\nD.J. Phalke (1870-1944), a photographer who worked as a draughtsman for Ravi Varma\u2019s press, began making films in 1913. He produced the first silent Indian film, Raja Harishchandra, a story of a righteous king recounted in Hindu epics. The film drew upon Indian painting, Parsi theatre, music, oral performance, and the popular images of Ravi Varma to create a cinematic idiom. As the industry grew, posters, photographs, pamphlets, lobby cards, and song-synopsis booklets circulated as publicity materials. Gradually, film posters became the visual focal point for advertising films. \r\n\r\nFrom the black and white poster of Shree 420 (1955), to the dramatic nationalist renditions in Mother India (1957), to the color saturated high intensity composition of Sholay (1975), the film poster has undergone thematic and stylistic changes during the 20th century. The tradition of hand painted posters is one of the most striking features of Indian film publicity. Not recognized as an art form in India, the film poster artists have largely remained anonymous. Notable among them are the stage backdrop artist, Baburao Painter, and the celebrated contemporary Indian artist, M.F. Husain, who began as a movie billboard painter but gained international recognition for his oil paintings. \r\n\r\nAlthough the film poster began with the intent to launch the film and film stars to a mass audience, it circulates in unintended ways acquiring a life of its own. From being displayed outside cinemas as advertisement, to inspiring contemporary art, to being enshrined as sacred images in temples dedicated to Bollywood film stars, to customized Bollywood wedding posters, and more recently being globally showcased in museum spaces as objects of art, the Bollywood film poster operates in multiple domains. This exhibition presents these different sites to demonstrate how the Bollywood film poster becomes a highly charged yet malleable object of consumption.  \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

My dissertation explores the creative and regenerative capacities of how different human collectives practice and form community in our time of emerging climate catastrophe. I begin by constructing the concept of anticipatory community and the practice of anticipation through engagement with scholars and activists from the fields of religious studies, history of religion, ecological ethics, and ecological justice. I particularly focus on constructing the theopoetic practice of anticipation as the practice of resistance against climate totalitarianism and the theopoetic practice of anticipation as the practice of regenerative ecology. I especially argue that the framework of anticipation is absolutely necessary as a regenerative bulwark against the rising tide of climate totalitarianism and ecofascism.\nIn the following chapters I construct a comparative study of religion and ecology which explores the critical, creative, and constructive tensions between Franciscan scholars of religion and ecology who propose a living, integral matrix of ecology with South Asian strands of the bhakti tradition which enhance our understanding of the affect of devotion to practice and experience anticipation. My dissertation draws on case-studies of anticipatory community such as the Govardhan Eco-Village in Maharashtra, India, the Seminary Hill Farm at the Methodist Theological School of Ohio, and the Institute of Earth and Spirit at Iona College, NY. My ethnographic study of these communities expands upon and concretizes the critical, creative, and constructive tensions of my comparative study, establishing the regenerative potential of anticipatory communities and the practice of anticipation. \n\nThe outline of my monograph is as follows:\n\nChapter 1: I construct a theoretical frame for my wider project, which draws upon Hindu and Christian textual, historical, and cultural sources, to further develop an understanding of what Rasmussen describes as Earth-honoring faith, ethics, and justice and what Berry describes as The Great Work. \nChapter 2: I construct the concept of anticipatory community through theoretical and pragmatic modalities of resiliency, regenerative ecology, ecological justice, and the nature of prophetic engagement in the time of climate catastrophe. I elucidate the practice of anticipation through intersectional engagement with scholars from the fields of totalitarian studies, regenerative ecology, climate science, and ecological justice. \nChapter 3: I construct an ecological reading of the Caitanya Vaishnava Hindu bhakti tradition, My ecological reading of the Caitanya Vaishnavism emerges through three primary elements: experience of panentheism as the primary root system for dharmic Earthy flourishing, the regeneration of our relationship with the sacred personhood and agency of living beings and living systems, and the liberatory ethics of the exchange of dharma and justice which emerges from the personal example of the tradition\u2019s founder Caitanya Mahaprabhu (1486-1534 CE). \nChapter 4: I construct a comparative study of the Caitanya Vaishnava tradition with the Franciscan tradition of Christianity. Through this dialectical exchange I explore how each tradition critiques and enhances the elements of panentheism, sacred personhood, and the exchange of dharma and justice at the core of my project. This chapter is an explicit exercise in comparative theology/religious studies in an ecological key. \nChapter 5: This chapter contains my primary case-study of the Govardhan Eco-Village. Drawing upon my ethnographic research with the community\u2019s residents, I frame the community\u2019s symbiotic development framework as a prominent model of anticipatory regenerative ecology and ecological justice\nChapter 6: I examine Christian-rooted models of anticipatory community, focusing on case-studies of the Seminary Hill Farm project, the Methodist Theological School in Ohio, the Institute for Earth and Spirit at Iona College, NY, the Agape Community, MA, and the online ecological community Sequoia Samanvaya. I place their models and practices of ecological education in comparative exchange with the Govardhan Eco-Village\u2019s models of dharmic ecological education. The theoretical frameworks of my comparative study in Chapter 4 are applied and explored in this chapter through pragmatic frameworks of ethics, historical studies, and pedagogy. \n",

Through the examples of these Persian-language storytellers, I will show that individuals who told romances were almost never valued exclusively for their storytelling abilities, though this ability was the specific cultural competence of their profession. Rather, they all filled several other roles that made them valuable to their patrons, to their contemporaries, and to those who remembered them in histories and tazkirahs. While the value of storytelling as an activity is nonisolable from other activities performed by storytellers, it nevertheless often had a central role in storytellers\u2019 efforts to advance themselves. The telling of tales appears as a key strategy in a broader effort to increase storytellers\u2019 worth, whether as storytellers or as performers of other activities. After discussing the problems that arise when we try to isolate storytellers\u2019 strategies to increase both their worth and that of their stories, I will look in passing at three strategies that allowed storytellers to convince the consumers of their stories of the worth of their storytelling: emphasis on the romance genre\u2019s political exemplarity, the capture of youthful patrons, and the presentation of stories as models of linguistic and rhetorical excellence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58486384, "asset_id": 38426836, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 444341, "first_name": "Pasha M.", "last_name": "Khan", "domain_name": "mcgill", "page_name": "PashaMKhan", "display_name": "Pasha M.

Built on a journey of learning and sharing about the Pakistan Movement for 40 years, sikandar Hayat, a Distinguished Professor of History and Public Policy, provides a platform for close introspection of the past to learn lessons for the future. Historiographies of south Asia must be used to build consciousness for future solidarity and to develop pathways for stability, as the study of history and sociology of development are inseparable. it is both a strength and limitation of this book that it focuses on six Muslim separatist leaders who were 'prominent, influential, and decisive' (p. 18) forerunners in creating Pakistan. Few past works have focused specifically on the function, impact and individual and collective role of leadership in this regard. The book mainly traces events and developments from 1857 to 1947, but also provides some background context on Muslims in the subcontinent from 711 to 1857. Hayat especially highlights the sacrifices and devotion of these eminent leaders, showing how they struggled for unity, but in the end believed that separatism would lead to more sustained progress in the region. indirectly, this book strongly asks south Asians to consider which aspects bind them or not, irrespective of boundaries and differences. Chapter 1 highlights the 'conscious and careful efforts of the Muslim rulers' (p. 24) to maintain solidarity in the indian subcontinent prior to British rule. examples discussed include the early coexistence of sultanates with Hindu rulers (p. 25), allocation of civil, military and government responsibilities to Hindus during the rule of Muhammad bin Qasim, Mahmud of Ghazni and islam shah (p. 26), the absorption of Persian and Arabic in northern indian languages (p. 26) and the inclusion of Hindus as top officials and the abolition of jizya (poll) tax during Mughal emperor Akbar's rule (p. 27). However, peaceful coexistence did not last. Revolt and uprising against the Mughal rule, across south india by Marathas and in North india by Jats, Rajputs and sikhs, led to the battles of Panipat and Balakot, and also extremist demands that Muslims must either leave india or convert to Aryanism (p. 39). opportunities for reassembling common ground were weakened by the advent of the soUTH AsiA ReseARCH", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79523394, "asset_id": 69415902, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2680724, "first_name": "Dr. Sara", "last_name": "Rizvi Jafree", "domain_name": "fccollege", "page_name": "DrSaraRizviJafree", "display_name": "Dr. Sara  Rizvi Jafree", "profile_url": "https://fccollege.academia.edu/DrSaraRizviJafree?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2680724/855746/45893537/s65_dr._sara.rizvi_jafree.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48523, "name": "Book Reviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_Reviews?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51411, "name": "Sociology of Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Development?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 66293477, "title": "India-Bangladesh Relationship (1975-1990)", "created_at": "2021-12-28T21:07:21.916-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66293477/India_Bangladesh_Relationship_1975_1990_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_66293477", "summary": "India\u2019s links with Bangladesh are civilization, cultural, social and economic.

"https://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_6419.ahtml \nThe book is written for researchers interested in the study of Kerala\u2019s language, literature, history, and culture. It outlines the grammar of Malayalam in consideration of up-to-date theoretical linguistics alongside grammatical categories developed by Malayalam grammarians in the 19th century and based on Old Tamil and Sanskrit grammars. The book approaches Malayalam from a holistic perspective in referring to regional language variations, while describing the standardized linguistic register. The sample sentences demonstrating grammatical categories and rules are mostly drawn from actual speech samples. Reading practices draw upon Vaikom Muhammad Basheer\u2019s Pattuma\u2019s Goat and Sooranad Ravi\u2019s prose adaptation of The Story of Niliyamma\u2019s Apotheosis, aiming to expose the learners to various aspects of Kerala culture.\nAdditionally, the book includes three chapters on Old Malayalam morphology, demonstrated by verses from classical compositions such as the U\u1e47\u1e47un\u012blisande\u015bam and the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47ag\u0101tha, as well as regional literary traditions\u2013a Teyyam song, Arabic- and Jewish-Malayalam verses, and Syriac Malayalam prose\u2013for exposing the learners to the literary traditions in Malayalam dialects and religiolects. Ten indices follow with charts of kinship terms, verbal and nominal forms, a glossary, and bibliographical references. The book is thus an invitation for an in-depth engagement with the study of Kerala\u2019s lush linguistic landscape and diverse literary culture past and present.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62317741, "asset_id": 42176099, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10079548, "first_name": "Ophira", "last_name": "Gamliel", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "OphiraGamliel", "display_name": "Ophira  Gamliel", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/OphiraGamliel?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10079548/3108486/3658964/s65_ophira.gamliel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12292, "name": "Malayalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayalam?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 135334, "name": "Kerala", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kerala?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 38676109, "title": "Creating the Universe: Depictions of the Cosmos in Himalayan Buddhism", "created_at": "2019-03-31T11:30:11.908-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38676109/Creating_the_Universe_Depictions_of_the_Cosmos_in_Himalayan_Buddhism?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_38676109", "summary": "Winner of the 2018 Edward Cameron Dimock Jr. Prize in the Indian Humanities\r\n\r\n\"A profoundly innovative and engaging study of cosmological thinking in texts, rituals, imagery, and architecture across the Buddhist world of the Himalayas.\"\r\n-Catherine Becker, author of Shifting Stones, Shaping the Past: Sculpture from the Buddhist Stupas of Andhra Pradesh\r\n\r\n\"Offers a new perspective on the depictions of cosmological imagery.

While many of these questions remain unanswered, we struggle with them because, at their heart, they are the questions of Mumbai itself. With vacant land being non-existent, the demolition of the chawls is going to redefine the skyline of south and central Mumbai. The chawls make up around 16,000 structures, located in the heart of Mumbai. Yet, for many of us these structures are unfamiliar, as this city of extremes is often understood through only its slums and its mansions. In this book we have tried to trace the past, present and future of the city, as told through and within the chawl. These conversations are meandering and circular, at times overlapping and repetitive. Like a walk through the chawl neighbourhoods themselves, each chapter leaves the impression, Haven t I walked down this lane before? This is both intentional and unavoidable. How is the chawl defined? What makes it unique among the various building typologies located throughout the city? How have cultural formations emerged through the constraints imposed by such limited living space? These are not easy questions to answer, but this multi-genre book, with the help of an assemblage of visuals - from floor plans, photographs and drawings to screenplay and cinematic representations - attempts to consider the ways in which the chawl emerges as a distinct symbol of the city of Mumbai, holding not only the history of the city s transformation but also its unique social identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36514729, "asset_id": 10510039, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9085934, "first_name": "Maura", "last_name": "Finkelstein", "domain_name": "muhlenberg", "page_name": "MauraFinkelstein", "display_name": "Maura Finkelstein", "profile_url": "https://muhlenberg.academia.edu/MauraFinkelstein?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9085934/4312055/5011075/s65_maura.finkelstein.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29, "name": "Industrial And Labor Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_And_Labor_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 146932, "name": "Mumbai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mumbai?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 9527913, "title": "\u8ad6\u8ff0\u8c9d\u8449\u7d93\u6574\u7406\u8207\u7de8\u76ee\u5de5\u4f5c =A Study of the Cataloging of the Palm Leaves Manuscripts \u8449\u6dd1\u6167 Shu-hwei Yeh", "created_at": "2014-11-27T08:46:16.960-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9527913/%E8%AB%96%E8%BF%B0%E8%B2%9D%E8%91%89%E7%B6%93%E6%95%B4%E7%90%86%E8%88%87%E7%B7%A8%E7%9B%AE%E5%B7%A5%E4%BD%9C_A_Study_of_the_Cataloging_of_the_Palm_Leaves_Manuscripts_%E8%91%89%E6%B7%91%E6%85%A7_Shu_hwei_Yeh?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_9527913", "summary": "Palm leaves\u2019 unique binding and scribed style are attracted our attention to research it in the aspect of civilization, and relics preserved.

interrelationship is a twenty-first-century discourse. It grabbed international limelight after terrorists struck United States on September 11, 2001, in one of the most audacious attacks ever leaving around 3000 people dead. The resultant outrage brought international attention to the Muslim lands with Muslim lives being scrutinized and categorized as the \u201cother.\u201d The Islamic educational institutions like madrasas came under intense international scrutiny being variously accused as perpetuating and nurturing \u201cantiwestern\u201d attitudes among the peoples leading to radicalism in Muslim lands. It was the Taliban fighter holding a Kalashnikov in Afghanistan as United States invaded that country subsequently in October 2001 that became a defining portrait of a Muslim \u201cother\u201d in the western mainstream media. The media trail of the madrasas conveniently overlooked the multiple socio-economic functions that these schools play in a Muslim public sphere by providing impoverished peoples\u2019 basic education and instead created a false imagery of all the madrasas being dens of terrorists, factories of terror along with a host of other accusations. Since the discourse of putative links between madrasas and extremism started from South Asia towards the end of cold war, this chapter, therefore, makes an attempt to provide a holistic account of these schools by locating them in the socio-religious spaces of Muslims, dissecting what these teach in their curriculum and then deliberate on the interrelationship, if any, between madrasas and extremism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66012507, "asset_id": 44970046, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30591099, "first_name": "Mohmad Waseem", "last_name": "Malla, PhD", "domain_name": "jnu", "page_name": "MMWaseem", "display_name": "Mohmad Waseem Malla, PhD", "profile_url": "https://jnu.academia.edu/MMWaseem?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30591099/21886952/42873512/s65_mohmad_waseem.malla.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1720, "name": "International Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 25025, "name": "Religious Extremism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Extremism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 32425, "name": "Madrasa education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madrasa_education?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 46322, "name": "Muslim", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 63483, "name": "Extremism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extremism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 120972, "name": "Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 817021, "name": "Socio Economic and Educational Issues of Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socio_Economic_and_Educational_Issues_of_Muslims?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 963655, "name": "Contemporary Muslim Societies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Muslim_Societies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 978936, "name": "Madrasas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madrasas?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1223711, "name": "Contemporary Muslim society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Muslim_society?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 48916718, "title": "\u201cCultured Women\u201d do not act in films: Tracing Notions of Female Stardom in Bombay Cinema (1930s\u20131950s)", "created_at": "2021-05-14T06:20:01.901-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48916718/_Cultured_Women_do_not_act_in_films_Tracing_Notions_of_Female_Stardom_in_Bombay_Cinema_1930s_1950s_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_48916718", "summary": "Women were absent from the archives and rendered as invisible within the film business that was changing the urban landscape of Bombay city in the 1930s through talkies. Questions were raised about female sexuality and respectability primarily due to a morality discourse closely associated with women acting in films. Tension, moral panic and distress had emerged from the dominant stigma regarding films making industries being a heterosexual and hybrid workspace.Moreover, an economy that capitalizes on voyeuristic pleasures of its male audience by objectifying women\u2019s bodies. So, even though it offered women higher\nsalaries unlike other professions, it was deemed as \u201cdangerous\u201d for women. Therefore, \u201ccultured women\u201d, essentially from the upper class, were discouraged from being a part of the studio film industry situated in the cosmopolitan Bombay city. Taking forward Neepa Majumdar\u2019s (2009) dialogue on the denial of agency to women in Indian cinema, this paper traces the incorporation offeminist agenda into film making. This paper is limited to studying the biographical, autobiographical details and picturization of three eminent actresses: Nargis, Kanan Devi and Durga Khote. Further, I would elaborate on the struggles undertaken by them and the roles they played in films in order to deconstruct the notion of female stardom and an \u201cideal Indian woman\u201d picturized in Bollywood from the 1930s\u20131950s. This period holds relevance in film historiography due to the ideological construction of female stardom that had its pros and cons which I would be discussing in depth through the paper.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67321581, "asset_id": 48916718, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14592853, "first_name": "Priyam", "last_name": "Sinha", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PriyamSinha", "display_name": "Priyam Sinha", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PriyamSinha?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14592853/7714628/84391916/s65_priyam.sinha.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42298, "name": "Film and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55926, "name": "South Asian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Cinema?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1019146, "name": "Visual Anthropology and Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Anthropology_and_Sociology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 45368298, "title": "From Disciples to Missionaries: The Trans-Continental Trajectory of the Khoja Shia Ithna-Asheri Community from South Asia to Latin America", "created_at": "2021-03-05T00:19:45.918-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45368298/From_Disciples_to_Missionaries_The_Trans_Continental_Trajectory_of_the_Khoja_Shia_Ithna_Asheri_Community_from_South_Asia_to_Latin_America?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_45368298", "summary": "This brief article provides an overview of the development of the Khoja Shia Ithna-Asheri community from its emergence in mid-19th century colonial India, via the beginnings of its missionary activities in East Africa\na century later, to its current role in Shia proselytization in Latin America.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65898181, "asset_id": 45368298, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26648094, "first_name": "Philipp", "last_name": "Bruckmayr", "domain_name": "univie", "page_name": "PhilippBruckmayr", "display_name": "Philipp Bruckmayr", "profile_url": "https://univie.academia.edu/PhilippBruckmayr?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 76590, "name": "Twelver Shi'ism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twelver_Shiism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 571509, "name": "Arabic and Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arabic_and_Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33589716, "title": "Revisiting The Political Economy of Development in India", "created_at": "2017-06-21T06:59:41.978-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33589716/Revisiting_The_Political_Economy_of_Development_in_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33589716", "summary": "This is the introduction to Elizabeth Chatterjee and Matthew McCartney (eds) Class and Conflict: Revisiting Pranab Bardhan's Political Economy of India (Oxford University Press, 2020).

Stressing on academic activism that is grounded in scholarship, the book attempts to generate critical debate and reflection in the field of Queer Studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58653605, "asset_id": 38580390, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43217, "first_name": "Rohit K", "last_name": "Dasgupta", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "RohitKDasgupta", "display_name": "Rohit K Dasgupta", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/RohitKDasgupta?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43217/13944/19381808/s65_rohit_k.dasgupta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 378, "name": "Area Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Area_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 8994, "name": "Social Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Activism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9517, "name": "Protest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protest?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 10871, "name": "Regionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regionalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41634, "name": "Queer of Color Critique", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_of_Color_Critique?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41733, "name": "Homosexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homosexuality?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 76967, "name": "Homonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homonationalism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 7886609, "title": "MOSQUE ARCHITECTURE IN DELHI : CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN ITS MORPHOLOGY", "created_at": "2014-08-05T16:33:44.176-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7886609/MOSQUE_ARCHITECTURE_IN_DELHI_CONTINUITY_AND_CHANGE_IN_ITS_MORPHOLOGY?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_7886609", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34373658, "asset_id": 7886609, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 274294, "first_name": "Dr. Asif", "last_name": "Ali", "domain_name": "amu-in", "page_name": "AsifAli", "display_name": "Dr. Asif Ali", "profile_url": "https://amu-in.academia.edu/AsifAli?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/274294/56803/4690935/s65_asif.ali.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 73412686, "title": "ROLE OF MUSLIMS IN FORMATION OF THE ASSAMESE SOCIETY", "created_at": "2022-03-09T09:15:29.709-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73412686/ROLE_OF_MUSLIMS_IN_FORMATION_OF_THE_ASSAMESE_SOCIETY?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_73412686", "summary": "A large number of people in Assam are followers of Islam.

It was after this event that the Muslims started migrating to the region. The Muslims entered Assam at different time due to different reasons. They entered the region as invaders, travelers, traders, Sufis, etc. Most of them settled in the region and localized themselves while others returned to the places from where they came. The Muslims who settled in the region mixed with the local people and contributed towards the growth of the Assamese society in various ways.

In reality, the status of Women represents the standard of culture of any age. The social status of the women of a country symbolised the social sprit of the age. However to draw a conclusion about the position of women is a difficult and complicated problem. It is therefore , necessary to trace this position in the historical prespective. In the course of Indian history from prehistoric to modern times, there were distinct stages of the rise and fall in the status and role of women. A study of Ancient literature reveals that during peace time the position of women was not satisfactory. The status of women was considered to be equal to that the Sudras and killing of women was also not considered as a disgraceful act. The information on the traditional status and role of women is derived from historical accounts and classic texts. For the purpose of depending a brief history of the changing position and role of women in India. The literature on Indian history abounds with countradictory conflicting views on the status of women. It can properly be understood within the socio cultural condition of the society. Women is the companion of the man gifted with equal mental capacities. She has the right to parcipate in the minuest details of the activities of man, and she has the same right of freedom and liberty as he. The contradictory view about women \" s status is a cause of the emergence of the ideals of womanhood at different times. The concept of \" Ardhangini \" suggest that there was equality between men and women ,neither of the two being superior to the other. There are recorded evidence to show that for many centuries position of women continued to be one in which she did not have either legal or social rights to make her independent of the family into which she was born or married. Therefore, it may be concluded that the status of women is a complex question and has to be studies as an integral part of the socio-economics structure in which women live.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54835551, "asset_id": 34972169, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8518670, "first_name": "International Res Jour", "last_name": "Managt Socio Human", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IRJMSH", "display_name": "International Res Jour Managt Socio Human", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IRJMSH?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1138, "name": "Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 93257, "name": "Hindu Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33618268, "title": "Soldiers of Empire Indian and British Armies in World War II--Book Flyer", "created_at": "2017-06-23T03:14:40.310-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33618268/Soldiers_of_Empire_Indian_and_British_Armies_in_World_War_II_Book_Flyer?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33618268", "summary": "How are soldiers made?

The second part focuses on the major debates in precolonial Indian history such as periodization, the Indo-Aryan problem, state formation, and the Indian Ocean trade.

However, one of the earliest fantasy role\u2010playing games, which left a lasting impact on the industry, was the brainchild of Muhammad Abd al\u2010Rahman (Phillip) Barker (1929\u20102012), a professor of South Asian Studies, an expert in Native American languages, and an American convert to Islam. Like Tolkien, Barker created an enormous fantasy world; however, unlike Tolkien, his world was redolent with Native American and South Asian cultural and religious influences. Through this world, he shared with his fans a nuanced understanding of non\u2010Western societies, cultures, and beliefs \u2013 the facets of the human experience that truly constitute multiculturalism. While fictional religion in role\u2010playing games has been feared and condemned, fictional religion (and occultism) plays a pivotal role in Barker's work; an exploration of his approach towards fictional religion also sheds more light on the question of why fantasy role\u2010playing games came across as competitors towards religion. Barker's fantasy world brought people of diverse backgrounds together in a beautiful demonstration of how fantasy and science fiction can bring about intercultural and interreligious tolerance in an otherwise intolerant world. Given the centrality of games such as Dungeons & Dragons to American popular culture, an exploration of Barker's legacy can also be seen in the light of the study of the history and contributions of Muslims in America.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59609192, "asset_id": 37489376, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 214843, "first_name": "Amina", "last_name": "Inloes", "domain_name": "exeter", "page_name": "AminaInloes", "display_name": "Amina Inloes", "profile_url": "https://exeter.academia.edu/AminaInloes?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/214843/1107218/40267832/s65_amina.inloes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5802, "name": "J.

For the Indian elite and the British, these sports served as symbols of power and displayed different forms of overlapping and contesting masculinities. Later, in the late colonial era, the elites withdrew their support from these activities and adopted \u201cgentlemanly\u201d sports like cricket, tennis and hunting. The common people, whose limited contact with the British meant that they could practise many \u201cbanned\u201d activities with few repercussions, enthusiastically adopted pigeon flying, cockfighting, and dogfighting. This paper examines the socio-historical transformation of these three pursuits and explains how they canvas a plurality of masculinities that evolved since the sixteenth century. Till present times, many rural people continue to practise these animal related sports in ways similar to those of the Mughal elites as a means of fulfilling their enthusiasm, demonstrating their domination over others, achieving status among peers, and reproducing masculinities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59893780, "asset_id": 39719001, "asset_type": "Work",

for a model of political economy capable of meeting the national objectives of industriali- sation and accumulation of sufficient military power to deter India. It contends that the period of promise (1950s and 1960s) was made possible through heavy subsidies drawn from East Pakistan and the West. The resultant hubris blinded Pakistan\u2019s rulers to growing discontent in the eastern wing of the country while encouraging them to take serious strategic risks against India. The unravelling of this strategy plunged Pakistan into a permanent crisis of its national political economy characterised by underdevelopment, internal and external fiscal imbalances, and a failure to mobilise national resources on a scale commensurate with its national goals. Experiments with socialism (1970s) and neo-classical economics- inspired structural adjustments (since the 1980s) have failed to deliver the desired outcomes and, in fact, entrenched Pakistan\u2019s crisis of political economy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67636394, "asset_id": 47785779, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9385643, "first_name": "Ilhan", "last_name": "Niaz", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "IlhanNiaz", "display_name": "Ilhan Niaz", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/IlhanNiaz?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9385643/2994155/55008491/s65_ilhan.niaz.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 724, "name": "Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 24562584, "title": "State of Stateless People: The Plight of Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh", "created_at": "2016-04-19T11:42:52.465-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24562584/State_of_Stateless_People_The_Plight_of_Rohingya_Refugees_in_Bangladesh?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_24562584", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51665223, "asset_id": 24562584, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 310950, "first_name": "Nasir", "last_name": "Uddin", "domain_name": "chittagong", "page_name": "nasiruddincu", "display_name": "Nasir Uddin", "profile_url": "https://chittagong.academia.edu/nasiruddincu?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/310950/955675/12180698/s65_dr._nasir.uddin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2835, "name": "Refugee Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5321, "name": "International Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 17126, "name": "Citizenship And Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_And_Governance?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43798, "name": "Statelessness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Statelessness?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 290534, "name": "Stranded Pakistanis/Biharis/Stateless in Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stranded_Pakistanis_Biharis_Stateless_in_Bangladesh?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 37523018, "title": "Political Parties and Participation in Bhutan", "created_at": "2018-10-03T07:26:06.649-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37523018/Political_Parties_and_Participation_in_Bhutan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_37523018", "summary": "In Bhutan, socio-political setbacks such as corruption, human right\nviolations, poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, lack of political awareness, lack\nof representation of youth and women, racial/ethnic discrimination etc. could\nbe seen clearly.

This article discusses, among other things, the dating, authorship, sectarian affiliation, and unique features of the text, its relationship to other yoga texts, and its significance for the history of modern yoga. The most remarkable feature of this text is its section on \u0101sana (yogic posture), which contains six groups of postures, many of which are unusual or unique among yoga texts. Another unique feature of this section is that the postures appear to be arranged into sequences intended to be practised in order. A manuscript of the text exists in the Mysore Palace; this (possibly along with other texts) was the basis for the illustrated \u0101sana descriptions in Mysore\u2019s famous book, the \u015ar\u012btattvanidhi.

glance. Who are the agents and agencies controlling this process? What is chosen as representative and seminal? Which ends are serviced and achieved thereby? Taking Delhi as its case and Shahjahanabad as its site, this chapter examines the affective linkages girding literary and planning imaginaries of this area. Closely reading a cross-section of novels, memoirs, and tour guides and juxtaposing these against key policy documents and project reports on the redevelopment of Shahjahanabad, this chapter argues that nostalgia is a significant qualitative component of planning visions for the future of this precinct. Mediated by and large by this literary corpus on Mughal grandeur, this nostalgia forges socio-cultural continuities out of sync with Shahjahanabad\u2019s recent history of deeply unsettling political and communal ruptures. In seeking to selectively restore the area\u2019s lost glory as the cultural centre of Mughal India, the redevelopment of Shahjahanabad prioritizes heritage tourism and trade over the civic and infrastructural requirements of the area\u2019s residences and its many commercial establishments. Evaluating the discursive prevalence of nostalgia as an affective determinant of public planning and policy in the case of Shahjahanabad, this chapter advocates therefore more grounded critiques of planning, heritage, and affect in South Asian cities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63492966, "asset_id": 43223872, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2372431, "first_name": "Anubhav", "last_name": "Pradhan", "domain_name": "iitbhilai", "page_name": "AnubhavPradhan", "display_name": "Anubhav Pradhan", "profile_url": "https://iitbhilai.academia.edu/AnubhavPradhan?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2372431/18529209/18496429/s65_anubhav.pradhan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23325, "name": "Indian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38429, "name": "Global South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_South?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42042, "name": "Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43883, "name": "Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 49549, "name": "Urban Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Heritage?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 59104, "name": "Urban Redevelopment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Redevelopment?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 135911, "name": "Delhi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Delhi?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 609618, "name": "Urban Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Gentrification?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 636934, "name": "Shahjahanabad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shahjahanabad?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 886280, "name": "Old Delhi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Old_Delhi?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1259818, "name": "Delhi heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Delhi_heritage?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1962991, "name": "Master Plan of Delhi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Master_Plan_of_Delhi?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 32073651, "title": "India, Modernity and the Great Divergence: Mysore and Gujarat (17th to 19th C.)", "created_at": "2017-03-27T10:51:42.267-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32073651/India_Modernity_and_the_Great_Divergence_Mysore_and_Gujarat_17th_to_19th_C_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_32073651", "summary": "''India, Modernity and the Great Divergence is an original and pioneering book about India\u2019s transition towards modernity and the rise of the West.

It the oldest art in the world and has its origins in remote antiquity. Indian art is visual art that, weather ancient or modern, originated in or is practiced in India and by Indian artists. Various civilizations often developed in separate, many people gradually came together and had made the innovations of their societies. The human figure assumed greater importance, and landscape painting acquired a new vitality. The surface of the paintings, especially the style and variety of brush strokes, became important. Still \u2013 life compositions came into greater prominence, especially Miniature Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Textile, Craft Works, Enamel etc. got an importance in the courts of periods after periods. Also the development in the field of religion, folk art and language in India and during the medieval times have been important milestones in the evaluation of the composite culture of India. New religions movements like Islamism and Buddhism along with Bhakti movement contributed to this process. The composite culture characteristic of the medieval period is amply witnessed in these fields. A new style of architecture known as the Indo \u2013 Islamic style was born out of this fusion.

It then explores the tensions between the twin processes of magical production and rational debunking set against the framework of the discourse of nation building in contemporary India as it seeks to be and sustain a global power.

People were told\nthat globalization would bring a significant boost in transportation, communication, and information, which would\ncontribute to the foundation of the \u201cglobal village\u201d. Many predictions came true. One new trend was evident to\nsupport all the new innovations\u2014most leaders wanted to integrate English in their own educational system. Around\nthe world, schools promoted English in order to meet the competitive market that globalization had created. In fact,\nsome linguists predicted that English was going to take over other languages, and that it could actually take some\nindigenous languages to their eternal rest. Today, there is a new trend that shows more and more countries\npromoting mother tongue-based education (MTBE). Due to the fact that this is a fairly new paradigm shift, it is\ncatching a lot of government and educational leaders off-guard. Based on careful survey of a number of countries\npromoting mother tongue education and recent research studies on MTBE, this presentation synthesizes common\nfactors that either promote or hinder MTBE. It concludes with recommendations of what must be in place for\nsuccess to happen when switching to MTBE, especially in the Asian context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37657273, "asset_id": 12422223, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2728616, "first_name": "Safary", "last_name": "Wa-Mbaleka", "domain_name": "bethel", "page_name": "SafaryWaMbaleka", "display_name": "Safary Wa-Mbaleka", "profile_url": "https://bethel.academia.edu/SafaryWaMbaleka?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2728616/880652/34139723/s65_safary.wa-mbaleka.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5470, "name": "East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9379, "name": "Asia Pacific Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asia_Pacific_Region?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 9918, "name": "Teaching of Foreign Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_of_Foreign_Languages?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15439, "name": "Teaching English As A Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_As_A_Foreign_Language?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 17617, "name": "Native Languages of the Americas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_Languages_of_the_Americas?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19011, "name": "First Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 50569, "name": "Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 99517, "name": "English as a Foreign Language (EFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_a_Foreign_Language_EFL_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 150730, "name": "Mother-Tongue Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother-Tongue_Literacy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 178059, "name": "Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 827606, "name": "English As a Second Language (ESL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_As_a_Second_Language_ESL_?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 8260058, "title": "A Brief History of Religions in India", "created_at": "2014-09-09T10:08:04.860-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8260058/A_Brief_History_of_Religions_in_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_8260058", "summary": "in Religions of India in Practice, edited by Donald S.

However, these powers are quite limited to a few dozen while the remainder of the countries, which correspond to the \u2018weak states\u2019, total more than a hundred. How is the distribution of power configured within the periphery? In what way is the international performance of each state conditioned by its endowment of national power?

This research generates a theoretical-methodological framework for the study of the rise and fall of the peripheral states. With the support of quantitative techniques, the size and composition of its national power are determined, and four new categories of states are discovered: Subregional Powers, Middle Peripheral States, Minor Peripheral States and Subperipheral States.

This is indeed the aim of this book, in which the Author probes the essence of \u201cthe mother of all feasts\u201d: the great New Year festival. The Author\u2019s investigation, based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork, focuses on the Winter Solstice festival of the Kalasha people of the Birir valley (Chitral, Pakistan), a small group of mountain people of special interest not only to anthropologists, but also to historians of religion and to scholars in Indo-European studies. They are the only speakers of an Indo-European language who still practice an ancient form of polytheism that, for centuries, has almost miraculously escaped the deadly embrace of the great historical religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam. The study of this unique religious system can offer an important contribution to a better understanding of beliefs that lay at the roots of our own civilization: from Greek, Celtic and Germanic polytheisms to Vedic religiosity. The interpretation of the Winter Solstice Festival of the Kalasha can therefore provide a privileged key for the comprehension of a once widely spread cosmological vision. After the analysis of the Kalasha symbolic system to enucleate the values that stand and at its foundations, the Author, in the last section of the volume, sets out on a long comparative journey that leads him to compare the Kalasha ritual complex to the New Year celebrations of the European and Indian worlds, seeking also connections with the Indo-European cultural universe as reconstructed by linguists and archaeologists: a complex itinerary from which the universal message of the \u201cgreat feast\u201d seems in the end to emerge.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52316816, "asset_id": 32056582, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12582709, "first_name": "Augusto", "last_name": "Cacopardo", "domain_name": "unifi", "page_name": "AugustoCacopardo", "display_name": "Augusto S Cacopardo", "profile_url": "https://unifi.academia.edu/AugustoCacopardo?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12582709/15930338/16435977/s65_augusto.cacopardo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5237, "name": "Indo-European Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-European_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 54678, "name": "European folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_folklore?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 142468, "name": "Ritual Feasting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual_Feasting?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 668594, "name": "Hindu Kush-Himalayan Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_Kush-Himalayan_Region?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 38166933, "title": "Manto: Narrativising Saadat Hasan Manto's  Life and Times through the Literary Biopic Genre.pdf", "created_at": "2019-01-17T00:19:31.824-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38166933/Manto_Narrativising_Saadat_Hasan_Mantos_Life_and_Times_through_the_Literary_Biopic_Genre_pdf?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_38166933", "summary": "This paper probes into the genre of the highly acclaimed biographical film on the noted Urdu writer, Saadat Hasan Manto, directed by Nandita Das as Manto (2018).

During the nearly two centuries of British political and military domination of South Asia, the institutional basis for India\u2019s and Pakistan\u2019s colonial democracies was laid. For varied reasons, South Asian elites have been reluctant to engage with the history of British India as a state that was very much the successor of the Timurid (Mughal) Empire and the precursor to the republics of contemporary South Asia. This study argues in favour of re-engagement with the processes of institutional development in South Asia and the manner in which the arbitrarily run estates of the pre-British Indian periods were gradually converted into the form, and to a limited extent, imbued with the substance, of a modern constitutional state as a direct result of British rule. Given that the crisis of governance in South Asia arises in part from the inability of Indian and Pakistani elites to operate the institutional frameworks bequeathed to them and reform them further, it is hoped that this study will provide historical context to discussions about crises of governance in South Asia.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59957540, "asset_id": 39773895, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9385643, "first_name": "Ilhan", "last_name": "Niaz", "domain_name": "qau", "page_name": "IlhanNiaz", "display_name": "Ilhan Niaz", "profile_url": "https://qau.academia.edu/IlhanNiaz?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9385643/2994155/55008491/s65_ilhan.niaz.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5167, "name": "Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Governance?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12047, "name": "Regional development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_development?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 78388, "name": "Bureaucracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bureaucracy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 74784423, "title": "Cultural Heritage and Extremism in Pakistan: Re-focusing on the Kalasha of (Chitral) Pakistan", "created_at": "2022-03-28T05:04:51.804-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74784423/Cultural_Heritage_and_Extremism_in_Pakistan_Re_focusing_on_the_Kalasha_of_Chitral_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_74784423", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82809317, "asset_id": 74784423, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 397783, "first_name": "Muhammad Kashif", "last_name": "Ali", "domain_name": "universityofgujrat", "page_name": "MuhammadKashifAli", "display_name": "Muhammad Kashif Ali", "profile_url": "https://universityofgujrat.academia.edu/MuhammadKashifAli?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/397783/31377407/28828354/s65_muhammad_kashif.ali.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32448, "name": "History of Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Pakistan?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 169415, "name": "Article", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Article?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 447193, "name": "Indian and South Asian Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_and_South_Asian_Historiography?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 619549, "name": "Dardic Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dardic_Languages?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1642080, "name": "Kalash Valley Myths.

As the prime manifestation of China\u2019s ambition to play a greater role in the global digital sphere, the DSR has led to questions concerning whether Beijing might use it as a conduit to export its political system or approach to digital governance, as well as concomitant values, to gain a greater role in global digital standard setting processes, and what its competitive impact is for Western governments and technology companies.\n\nThe answer to these questions is, however, often not borne by detailed empirical analysis. Nevertheless, the perspective of DSR-affected and recipient countries is crucial, for several reasons. First, the DSR potentially covers dozens of nations, with significant variation in economic development levels, foreign policy, regime type, ethnicity and religion, geography and many other parameters. As such, the DSR cannot be a onesize-fits-all initiative but will inevitably be shaped by the different environments it will face. Second, while the DSR is often framed through the lens of Sino-US great power competition, the dozens of countries affected by it have significant agency. They may have their own strategic visions and approaches that seek to leverage China\u2019s stated munificence to their own benefit.\n\nThis report provides an initial step in this direction, by providing four country-level studies of perceptions of the DSR. While the four countries, Cambodia, Ethiopia, India, and Iran, obviously differ considerably on numerous counts, it is nevertheless possible to derive the following general findings with regard to their perspectives on the DSR. First, in none of the four countries has the notion of the \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d entered the domestic political discourse. Second, the DSR is not considered to be a comprehensive, multilateral programme. Even so, the question how to engage with China on digital issues is an important one in domestic policymaking. Unsurprisingly, all governments surveyed intend to develop strategies in pursuit of their own perceived national interest.\n\nThese conclusions have important implications for observers and policymakers. First and foremost, they should move away from the Beijing-centric model that has dominated the debates so far, and take the agency and interests of affected countries into greater consideration. Second, they should take note that the DSR is not simply a competition between the US and China fought out in neutral territories. Third, even though the DSR may well be less of a national strategy than advertised, it nevertheless is the case that China\u2019s digital footprint does pose competitive challenges to Western governments, for local governments\u2019 favour, and for Western businesses, for their markets.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68080860, "asset_id": 49891914, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13215980, "first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Ghiasy", "domain_name": "leidenuni", "page_name": "RichardGhiasy", "display_name": "Richard Ghiasy", "profile_url": "https://leidenuni.academia.edu/RichardGhiasy?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13215980/38231500/32062777/s65_richard.ghiasy.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2985, "name": "Ethiopian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethiopian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5218, "name": "Iranian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7240, "name": "Silk Road Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13725, "name": "China Going Global", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_Going_Global?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 30947, "name": "The Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Internet?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 298455, "name": "Digitalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digitalization?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2255438, "name": "\"Belt and Road\" Initiative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/_Belt_and_Road_Initiative?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2559813, "name": "Fourth Industrial Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fourth_Industrial_Revolution?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 44750974, "title": "The Indian Civil Service and Indian Foreign Policy, 1923-1961 - Introduction", "created_at": "2020-12-21T13:14:48.654-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44750974/The_Indian_Civil_Service_and_Indian_Foreign_Policy_1923_1961_Introduction?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_44750974", "summary": "This book provides an authoritative account of the first significant overseas diplomatic missions and forays made by Indian civil servants.

Rich in archival material, it looks at official files, correspondences and diaries documenting the terms served by the pioneers of Indian diplomacy, Girja Shankar Bajpai, K.P.S. Menon and Subimal Dutt, in Africa, China, the USSR and other countries and their relationship with the Indian political leadership. The book also analyses and pieces together the activities, strategies, worldviews and contributions of the first administrators and diplomats who shaped India\u2019s approach to foreign policy and its relationship with other political powers.\n\nAn essential read for researchers and academics, this book will be a useful resource for students of international relations, foreign policy, political science and modern Indian history, especially those interested in the history of Indian foreign affairs. It will also be of great use to general readers who are interested in the history of politics and diplomacy in India and South Asia.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65238731, "asset_id": 44750974, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53972386, "first_name": "Amit Das", "last_name": "Gupta", "domain_name": "unibw", "page_name": "AmitDasGupta", "display_name": "Amit Das Gupta", "profile_url": "https://unibw.academia.edu/AmitDasGupta?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53972386/20499557/20140616/s65_amit_das.gupta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9707, "name": "Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35802, "name": "Cold War history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War_history?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60924, "name": "Indian foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_foreign_policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 229104, "name": "Interwar period, 1919 - 1939", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interwar_period_1919_-_1939?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 436431, "name": "Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi and Indian nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jawaharlal_Nehru_Mahatma_Gandhi_and_Indian_nationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 561766, "name": "Colonial and Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_and_Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 883045, "name": "Indian Civil Services", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Civil_Services?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1403635, "name": "Overseas Indians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Indians?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 41174105, "title": "Ebrahim Alkazi's Six Artists in Black and White", "created_at": "2019-12-03T18:51:31.533-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41174105/Ebrahim_Alkazis_Six_Artists_in_Black_and_White?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_41174105", "summary": "Published in the book 'Ebrahim Alkazi: Directing Art | The Making of a Modern Indian Art World' (2016), this essay is part of my ongoing research on exhibition histories of South Asia 'Around Exhibitions: Circles of Engagement'.\n\nThe essay pursues the curatorial imaginary of Ebrahim Alkazi, theatre practitioner and patron of art, through exhibitions that were actualised, while also looking at other meta-exhibitions and their recurrences in varied forms, as much their missing versions. It reads exhibitions in their tentativeness, in their potential to fall out from the historical narrative or get easily lost without trace, and in their entanglements with their own time that gives them the currency for determining that is yet to come. This essay is, then, a poetic descant to histories of exhibitions. The first section focuses on an exhibition that barely took place, setting up cues for the trajectory taken by Alkazi. In the second section, I highlight parallel exhibitions from the 1970s in New Delhi involving the Lalit Kala Akademi and several artist groups that offer us a broad context to understand Alkazi's curatorial initiatives. And the last section discusses the exhibition history of the Art Heritage gallery, and examines the theatrical aspects of exhibition space in concert with its inherent potential for restaging certain acts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61414017, "asset_id": 41174105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25429817, "first_name": "Akansha", "last_name": "Rastogi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RastogiAkansha", "display_name": "Akansha Rastogi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RastogiAkansha?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25429817/7980718/8939299/s65_akansha.rastogi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13606, "name": "Museums and Exhibition Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums_and_Exhibition_Design?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19091, "name": "South Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 19161, "name": "Curatorial Studies and Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Studies_and_Practice?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 51875, "name": "Contemporary South Asian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_South_Asian_art?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 66598, "name": "Patronage and collecting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patronage_and_collecting?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 66926, "name": "Patronage of Arts and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patronage_of_Arts_and_Education?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 253545, "name": "Curatorial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 341695, "name": "Exhibition Histories", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exhibition_Histories?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 7143489, "title": "\u09ae\u09c1\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf\u09af\u09c1\u09a6\u09cd\u09a7\u09c7\u09b0 HIS-STORY, \u0987\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09a4 \u0993 \u09b2\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be", "created_at": "2014-05-24T02:15:15.144-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7143489/%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%95_%E0%A6%A4%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AF%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%A6_%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0_HIS_STORY_%E0%A6%87%E0%A6%9C_%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%A4_%E0%A6%93_%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%9C_%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_7143489", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63964321, "asset_id": 7143489, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 37247934, "asset_id": 7143489, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 300060, "first_name": "Sayema", "last_name": "Khatun", "domain_name": "uwm", "page_name": "SayemaKhatun", "display_name": "Sayema Khatun", "profile_url": "https://uwm.academia.edu/SayemaKhatun?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/300060/60659/13848258/s65_sayema.khatun.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41875, "name": "Bangladesh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63231, "name": "Rape as a Weapon of War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rape_as_a_Weapon_of_War?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 319347, "name": "1971 the liberation war of Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/1971_the_liberation_war_of_Bangladesh?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 508748, "name": "Feminist History;

role of performance in the relationship be tween emotions and politics. To do so it focuses on the role that empathy plays in process es of reconciliation after conflict and trauma. Emotions triggered by conflict often perpet uate existing antagonisms. They tend to reproduce the hostile attitudes that have created violence in the first place. A performative approach illuminates not only how emotions perpetuate conflict but also how they can help divided societies adopt more reflective cul tures of reconciliation. The performative dimensions of emotions are crucial because they link individual emotions with collective ones. Drawing on a range of conceptual sources the chapter shows how actively drawing on empathy can promote alternative ways of dealing with conflict. A short case study examines the roles that art, and theater in partic ular, play in peacebuilding in Sri Lanka.

Sanskrit sources tend to emphasize special dignities belonging tof particular statuses according to a divinely ordained class hierarchy (var\u1e47a-dharma), but in some contexts we hear of universally shared aspects of the human condition. Ascetic and devotional movements found ways to call into question special dignities tied to ascriptive rank. Sanskrit texts on good governance and legal process formulate general standards of justice and equity that could cut across or by-pass rank. Thus, Hindu sources illustrate how ethical and legal orders find ways to compartmentalize: to recognize that all people can share basic capacities and aspirations does not automatically sweep the field clear of status dignity. This essay draws on Jeremy Waldron\u2019s concept of human dignity as a status claim that \u201clevels up\u201d by attributing to all people a dignity once reserved for a privileged few. We note Hindu examples of a similar approach, as well as examples of \u201cleveling down\u201d by pointing out the hypocrisy of elites while extolling the virtues of which the lowly are capable.

This article argues that contrary to existing scholarly and popular belief, the adoption of a written constitution with a bill of rights and judicial review transformed the relationship between the citizen and the state and emerged as a new field of practice. It does so by mapping the growth of judicial review of executive action through a series of similar challenges under Articles 32 and 226. Examining the trial of rebels and malcontents in Bengal, Hyderabad, Bombay, and Saurashtra during the early years of the postcolonial republic, it teases out how colonial governmentality responds to the institution of a written constitution. The article demonstrates that the constitution came to be utilized as a resource and a venue to challenge the continuation of the colonial practice of special tribunals and exceptional procedures. Judicial remedies made constitutional governance a two-way process, where citizens could insert themselves into a conversation on state practice. Constitutional law became grounded in uncertainty as the results in very similar cases varied widely. However, it was this uncertainty about constitution law that gave it legitimacy and attracted widespread participation by the state and citizens.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35870889,

"The War in Vietnam was the largest military commitment made by the United States (US) since the Second World War. The American perspective of the Vietnam War is voluminous in the historiography, which is understandable given the distressing experience the War had on US domestic politics.  \r\n\r\nYet, analysis of the British perspective has been much more limited, with only a handful of major studies specifically focusing on the Anglo-American relationship in the context of the Vietnam War, with Peter Busch and Sylvia Ellis making notable contributions to the subject. \r\n\r\nThis study will attempt to add to our current historical understanding of Britain\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam War by taking a thematic approach in analysing the balancing act of the major issues facing Britain with the demands of the Anglo-American \u2018special relationship\u2019 in Vietnam between 1960 and 1968, based primarily on previously unused archival sources and existing memoirs. \r\n\r\nThe period starts at the end of Eisenhower\u2019s tenure, when escalation begins in earnest, and finishes at the start of 1968, when the Vietnam War reaches its peak in the Tet Offensive. Much of the historical literature on Anglo-American relations, in the context of British foreign policy towards Vietnam, either mentions Vietnam in passing, isolates Vietnam from other foreign policy considerations, or has a narrow focus. \r\n\r\nThere are currently no thematic studies which assess British foreign policy towards Vietnam, in the context of the special relationship, and its wider effects from 1960 to 1968. \r\n\r\nThis study aims to serve as a bridging of the gap in historical understanding of this period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 25561790, "asset_id": 1833598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 867153, "first_name": "Joshua", "last_name": "RJ", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "JRJ", "display_name": "Joshua RJ", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/JRJ?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1911, "name": "International Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5214, "name": "Cold War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 10318, "name": "British Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13355, "name": "Vietnam War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam_War?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 27915, "name": "Anglo-American Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglo-American_Relations?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33385973, "title": "The Sacred and The Secular: Complementary and/or Conflictual?", "created_at": "2017-06-08T20:46:32.333-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33385973/The_Sacred_and_The_Secular_Complementary_and_or_Conflictual?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33385973", "summary": "The Sacred and The Secular: Complementary and/or Conflictual, edited by John P. Hogan and Sayed Hassan Akhlaq, (Washington, DC: Council for Research in Values and Philosophy, 2017) 793 pages, $17.50.\nThe issue of the relation of the sacred to the secular has become paramount in virtually every country in the world. From church-state relations in the US, with the debates around abortion and same-sex marriage, to the vitriolic discussions in France over the veil (hijab) \u2013 sacred-secular, faith-reason, transcendence-imminence -- impacts every aspect of personal, social, and political life. Indeed, the questions often asked are whether Huntington\u2019s, Clash of Civilizations is today\u2019s reality? Is clash and conflict inevitable? \nThis volume collects papers from scholars from all around the globe and digs into that question. Do the sacred and the secular necessarily end in conflict? Building on scholars such as Charles Taylor, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jurgen Habermaus, and John Rawls, as well as the world\u2019s great religious traditions, the authors assembled here respond with a nuanced, but resounding, NO. A deeper read demands the possibility, indeed, necessity, of complementarity. It has become ever more urgent to discover the proper and complementary relation between the two so that both can be promoted through mutual collaboration. The deeper implications of the discussion can be perceived in many current global problems: cultural identity, multiculturalism, pluralism, nationalism, economic inequality, race, terrorism, migration, public education, and climate change.\nThe volume unfolds in seven sections: Foundations; Sacred and Secular; Complement or Conflict; Hermeneutics; African traditions; South Asian Traditions; Chinese Traditions; and Islamic Traditions. It is fascinating to observe how the various authors grapple with unfolding the relation of sacred/secular, faith/reason, church-mosque/state, transcendence/imminence.\n The section on Islam illustrates this. These chapters deal with the thorny, usually misunderstood debate between the scholars and those, westerners refer to as \u201cfundamentalists\u201d or \u201cradicals.\u201d In the latter, there is no space left to reason, interpretation, or historical criticism. This ugly divide usually emerges in the hot-button issues like the treatment of women and religion-related terrorism. However, these oversimplifications betray the intellectual roots of Islamic tradition. Here the argument is advanced that there are common and multiple meanings of rationality in the Islamic primary sources and that doctrine, the Qur\u2019an, and the Sunnah, open considerable space for the rational and the secular in Islamic teachings. Unknown to most in the West, the grappling within Islam goes on. Moreover, the grappling seems to be heating up in all traditions. We are all called to the discussion.

Through this, we see that race and ethnicity are key dimensions of social stratification and inequality in contemporary Hong Kong society. We also hope that this research can well serve as a case to illustrate the relationship between race/ethnicity and educational opportunities as well as attainment in Hong Kong. In this research, our target groups are Filipino, Indian, Nepalese and Pakistani students who are studying in Form 4, Form 5, Form 6 and Form 7. \n\nThis research consists of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews. The questionnaire survey was conducted between May and July 2004. We have completed 200 questionnaires with the help of ethnic minority students. The questionnaire covered five broad areas: education/school life, cultural aspects, aspirations and parental expectations, linguistic needs and interest in Chinese and mother-tongue, and lastly, their sense of belonging to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the in-depth interviews aim to further explore the complex dynamic of educational experiences that could not be described by quantitative data in the survey, as well as to develop recommendations for improving social policies in relation to their educational situation. Twenty in-depth interviews with individual students were conducted from December 2004 to April 2005.\n\nOn education and school life, more than half of the students think they do not have the same educational opportunities as local Chinese students in Hong Kong due to limited school choices while the chances for further education beyond senior secondary education are restricted. With respect to their teachers in school, one-quarter of the students disagree that their teachers treat students of different ethnicity or race equally. More than one quarter also feel some of their teachers may punish ethnic minority students more severely than Chinese students, care about Chinese students more than non-Chinese students, and dislike teaching ethnic minority students. Through elaboration, it is discovered that some teachers have stereotypes of ethnic minority students as being useless, misbehaving and impolite. At other times, ethnic minority students feel some teachers tend to pay more attention to Chinese students than to ethnic minority students.\n\nConcerning Chinese schoolmates, nearly half of the ethnic minority students reported they seldom have communication with their Chinese schoolmates. Moreover, one-fifth of them point out that Chinese schoolmates dislike them because of their race or ethnic origin. At discussions, students mentioned language problems and cultural differences as major barriers in communicating with their Chinese schoolmates. Majority of the students do not seem to have encounters with the school social workers, as ethnic minority students say they would not turn to a school social worker if they have problems. Regarding the general learning atmosphere in school, among 200 respondents, nearly one-third think drug abuse among students is a problem in their school and nearly half of the respondents consider bullying among student to be a problem in their schools. Some students have complained that the learning atmosphere in classroom is noisy and they cannot focus on their studies. For some students who are migrants, they have difficulties adjusting to the local school curriculum as the syllabuses of certain subjects in Hong Kong are different from those in their home country.\n\nOn cultural aspects, more than half of the students reported their schools respect their cultural and religious values and practices as they are allowed to wear scarves and salwar, grow beard and put on signs of religion. However, probing into the issue at discussions, it is discovered that certain practices may not be allowed by individual schools or in other instances the environment of the school does not foster the practicing of their religion, with some Muslim students mentioning that they were denied a room for the special purpose of prayers. In certain schools, students said growing beard is forbidden. Religious values and practices are more easily accepted by schools than those that were cultural in nature. Other than this, Muslim and vegetarian students find it hard to meet their special dietary needs in school, or outside school. In school canteens, they can hardly find food suitable for consumption. In other instances, lunch boxes ordered by schools for students mostly contain meat, thus they cannot order them.\n\nOn aspirations and parental expectations, we found majority of students disagree they have no reason to work hard in school, and slightly more than half believe they will complete college or university level. Moreover, three-quarter are optimistic about their future as they are confident they will have good career prospects upon completion of studies. However, despite such optimism in statistical data, at discussions we found that students have some worries about their future. They foresee some difficulties in achieving their ambitions, particularly in reference to achieving them in local society. For most of them, difficulties are mainly due to their incapability in Chinese language as they cannot speak the language while for those who can speak, they cannot read and write Chinese. \n\nOn linguistic needs and interest in Chinese and mother-tongue, more than three-quarter students have expressed interest in learning Chinese language in school. Reasons for wanting to learn Chinese include the usefulness of the language for further study and future employment in Hong Kong, as well as its helpfulness in communicating with Chinese people and in everyday life. Among those who do not want to learn Chinese, majority of them reported it is too difficult a language to learn. Other reasons include Chinese not being an international language, not being practical as they are not going to stay in Hong Kong for good, not having enough Chinese lessons in school, and not having anyone outside school to help them with Chinese schoolwork. With respect to their mother-tongue, nearly half of them want to learn their mother-tongues in school. One possible reason as to why some students dislike learning mother-tongue in school is that they are already fluent in their mother-tongues. Some consider having the speaking and listening skills in mother-tongue as more than enough. For those who have spent a number of years in their home countries, and for the Nepalese in particular, they are already fluent in both written and oral skills of Nepali, and thus expressed in our research that they find it unnecessary to learn it in school now. \n\nOn sense of belonging to Hong Kong, majority of the respondents identify themselves both by their ethnic origin and as a Hong Kong person, and almost half of them expressed that they like Hong Kong very much. A majority of our respondents have experienced racial discrimination in Hong Kong. Therefore, while discussing their attitudes towards Hong Kong people in general, the ethnic minority youngsters have ambivalent feelings about them. In statistical data, nearly half of them express they do not find Hong Kong people to be kind and helpful, whereas a higher proportion of them report that Hong Kong people are not caring and do not treat people of different races and nationalities equally. Generally speaking, almost ninety percent of them agree that most of their friends are non-Chinese people and only forty-two percent report having close Chinese friends. Lastly, they tend to have strong ethnic pride as more than ninety percent agree they are proud of their own ethnic origin. In addition, nearly eighty percent of them report having special qualities or abilities that local Chinese students do not have. \n\nBased on the educational situation reflected in the questionnaire survey and the opinions expressed in the in-depth interviews, we recommend policy changes and improvements in the following areas: educational opportunities, role of teachers and social workers, curriculum, cultural aspects as well as Chinese language and mother-tongue. To improve the educational situation of ethnic minorities, we believe that improvements in these aspects are essential to helping ethnic minority students progress in their academic performance and attainment in Hong Kong society.

During the Renaissance, the discovery and translation of lost texts brought back this knowledge of the cycle of ages, even if only to a small circle of initiates.  \r\n\r\nPlato and Aristotle, and later Leonardo da Vinci and Giordano Bruno, along with many others, shared this worldview. Later, a few English Romantic poets were inspired by the same vision. According to Percy Shelley, \u201cHistory is a cyclic poem written by time upon the memories of man.\" \r\n\r\nThe movements that tried to bridge Eastern and Western metaphysics had their source in the legacy of the ancients, especially in the spiritual traditions of India and Egypt. In India, the understanding of the eternal cycle was never completely lost, even though it branched into a number of different approaches. The basic concepts, however, remained contained within the very fabric of life and thought and in the spiritual beliefs of the people.\r\n\r\nToday the cyclic view of history has appeared in other contexts; it is no longer the exclusive property of mystics and yogis. Still, inner stability and mental silence continue to be the means for understanding and assimilating its deeper aspects.\r\n\r\nWe\u00b4ve been hearing a lot lately about the Maya calendar and other models based on the precession of the equinoxes, which ancient civilizations used to mark the ages. It is in the field of cosmology, however, that the cyclic view is reemerging with the greatest force. Initially restricted to specialized publications, the subject has now entered mainstream media as an alternative to the Big Bang theory.\r\n\r\nThe cyclic perspective is being revised and is considered by some theorists to be a model that explains unsolved scientific paradoxes. In this theory, the universe\u2019s clock has no beginning or end but is nonetheless finite and recurring. Issues involving gravitational singularities\u2014hypothesized locations where gravity and heat become infinite and the laws of physics break down\u2014disappear. In the words of one theorist, it is as if \u201cevents are always diverging or evolving away from a potential singularity.\u201d The philosophical implications of this view are still more fascinating.   \r\n\r\nWe live in an amazing time when the secrets of the natural world and the dimensions beyond are being unveiled. Despite crises and uncertainties, we have reached a point of transition.\r\n                                                      \r\nThe cycle is but the history of the human soul and its journey through birth and rebirth. It is also the story of our connection with the Source\u2014with God as the Supreme Alchemist. It\u00b4s his presence and energy that transforms iron into gold, eternally inspiring and perfecting human consciousness, and in this way renewing life itself.   \r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62078059, "asset_id": 41955015, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 144236881, "first_name": "Simone", "last_name": "Boger", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SimoneBoger", "display_name": "Simone Boger", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SimoneBoger?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/144236881/39822045/74690341/s65_simone.boger.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 130, "name": "Ancient History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 902, "name": "Philosophy Of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3024, "name": "History of India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12349, "name": "Spirituality & Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality_and_Mysticism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 104719, "name": "Esoterica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Esoterica?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 187903, "name": "Civilization Collapse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civilization_Collapse?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 207866, "name": "Sanatana Dharma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanatana_Dharma?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 419692, "name": "Eternal Return", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eternal_Return?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 448906, "name": "Ancient civilizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_civilizations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 628120, "name": "Eternal Recurrence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eternal_Recurrence?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 830451, "name": "Yugas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yugas?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 973514, "name": "Bharat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bharat?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1008562, "name": "Cyclic Time", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyclic_Time?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1219215, "name": "Philosophy of Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Yoga?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1756012, "name": "Lost Civilizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lost_Civilizations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3257666, "name": "Spirituality and Yoga", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality_and_Yoga?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3566681, "name": "Arcane Knowledge ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arcane_Knowledge?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 36339675, "title": "Origin and Development of Indian Scripts: A Positional Study", "created_at": "2018-04-05T10:34:16.076-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36339675/Origin_and_Development_of_Indian_Scripts_A_Positional_Study?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_36339675", "summary": "Scripts have their own distinct function. Several authors have mentioned that the early development of all Indian scripts were either from Br\u0101hm\u012b or Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b. The Br\u0101hm\u012b script was developed under Semitic influence around 7th c. BC and was originally written from left to right. Whereas the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b script whose direction of writing is in Aramaic, from right to left, came into being under Persian rule during the 5th c. BC in northwest of India. In the later centuries, Br\u0101hm\u012b gave rise to eight varieties of scripts from early Mauryas to Gupta ruling period which were employed for writing during 4th c. BC to the 6th c. AD. We know that the ancientness of the Indian language is being proved from its soil which says about two types of language form, i.e. spoken and written. The spoken form of language is expressed in two ways. One preserved through folk forms and the other preserved through cave and rock paintings. The songs sung at the time of birth, death and work conditions are preserved; stories were painted through cave paintings which represent the creativity of literature. The inhabitant of this land stated to drawn this language at about forty thousand years back in Upper Palaeolithic Period. There is a need to evaluate the new trend towards assigning a later date of origin for the Indian scripts in the light of broader historical and cultural prospective. After the discovery of extensive urban civilization in Indus Valley, some scholars indicate that the Indian Script is established around 2500 BC. Recent analyses of the signs available in the inscriptions have led several scholars to view that the language is not belong to Indo-European family, nor it is close to the Sumerians, Hurrians, or Elamite, nor it can be related to the structure of the Munda languages of modern India.

Historical chronicles show its emergence in the tenth century for religious ceremonies. Colorful penari topeng, such as Bapak I Made 'Cat' Suteja, are invited to perform at Balinese Hindu ceremonies as a part of ritual work or socio-religious service known as ngayah. In the Indian yogic traditions, this mindset is paralleled in the yajna spirit or 'spirit of selfless service', as termed by Swami Chinmayananda. Previous scholarship showed that topeng and wayang theater bring mythical history and folklore alive to contemporary audiences, gently conveying ancestral teachings, cultural, and ethical values. These seniman, or traditional artists, are steeped in a background of folklore, philosophy, religious practice, and artistry underlying their performances. This memoir-like report aims to show that tari topeng and traditional mode of instruction are also rich modes of embodied wisdom. Masked dance is a Balinese form of yogic practice, and the teachings and teacher can result in the personal growth of the practitioner. Its practitioners know the value of learning to unite 'menyatukan' his or her body and mind. Through expansion of awareness, the dancer practices harmonizing with the 'world' as the stage, musicians, audience, and God. Observing the similarities of Balinese culture with the darshana 'views' of Yogic Tantric, Vedantic, and Buddhist thought, Monali Varaiya studied tari topeng with I Made 'Cat' Suteja in Batuan, Bali, translated folklore depicted through this performance mode, began study of Old Javanese literature, and researched Balinese Hindu religion as a participant-observer during field research from June 2019-May 2020. In her observation, Balinese masked dance is a laboratory of karma yoga, yadnya, and tantric visualization practice where the practitioner learns to unite his or her body, antahkarana (inner instruments), or bayu-sabda-idep (broadly energy/movement, voice, and thought). He or she learns to purify the mind and work in a spirit of offering (yadnya or ngayah) for Divinity and people. Finally, the dancer practices embodying various roles, which parallels Hindu thought about playing roles in life with objectivity. Themes of samadhi, yadnya, yoga, and the niskala world which appear in Topeng Panca plays about Bali's kings of old are also paralleled in earlier Sanskrit and Old Javanese literature. This report will show similarities between the Indic yogic traditions Balinese performing arts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66272441, "asset_id": 46882886, "asset_type": "Work",

\u2018Mawsim\u2019 refers to the season when ships could sail safely in the Indian Ocean and these seasonal monsoon winds underwrote both a shared culture in the past, as also the continued survival of maritime regions into the present. \u2018Maritime cultural landscape\u2019 was used by Olof Hasslof, the Swedish maritime ethnologist in the 1950s to indicate an understanding of the use of the sea by humans and included attendant coastal structures and cultural identifiers. \n\nThe papers in this book examine the development of coastal settlements and architectural remains from the third millennium BCE Bronze Age to almost the present across a large part of the Indian Ocean extending from Arabia to Vietnam. A second objective of the book is to relate this understanding of the past with that of the present and to highlight the extent to which indicators of historical cultural networks provide building blocks for contemporary societies, as they work towards universal values and trans-border groupings \u2013 both of which underwrite UNESCO\u2019s 1972 World Heritage Convention. The Convention encourages the identification, protection and preservation of cultural and natural heritage around the world considered to be of outstanding value to humanity, thereby focussing on the universal, rather than the local or regional. The book will appeal to readers of maritime history, as well as those involved in heritage studies.    \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46610396, "asset_id": 26296826, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12381, "name": "Indian ancient history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_ancient_history?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 23582217, "title": "BACKWARD FUTURES AND PASTS FORWARD Queer Time, Sexual Politics, and Dalit Religiosity in South India", "created_at": "2016-03-22T14:33:56.572-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23582217/BACKWARD_FUTURES_AND_PASTS_FORWARD_Queer_Time_Sexual_Politics_and_Dalit_Religiosity_in_South_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_23582217", "summary": "What are the possibilities of being out of sync with the linear time of historical progress?

In historical terms, India originated in the Indus River Valley, today on Pakistani territory. In cultural and religious terms, India was home to Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism among others, and sheltered the Zoroastrians from the Persian lands to the west, as well as the place where Islam flourished since the 7th century through Gujarat and Sindh in northwest India. In geographical terms the country since 1947 is bordered to the north with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and China. With ex-Burma, today Myanmar, to the east. Also the proximity to the island of Sri Lanka to the south. Or would India be its enormous diaspora community in the world estimated at more than 30 million? Is India simply Hindu that makes up almost 80% of its population? If so, would the Hindus be only the Brahmins, followers of Vaishnavism or Shaivism, or other popular currents? And the large Hindu communities in Nepal, Mauritius, Bali and other parts of the world? Are they India as well? And the approximately 14% of the Indian population claiming to be Muslims, around 180 million people, the second largest Muslim community in the world, are not they also Indians? And the Buddhists, Sikhs, Jains and Christian community in India? In linguistic terms, India has more than 20 official languages, more than 1,500 dialects and ethnic groups. Who would be more Indian than the others? \nThe concept of India, therefore, is much more complex than it seems to be at first glance. In order to understand this stunning and kaleidoscopic country, we must seek its history that may give us some insight into how India has formed, consolidated, influenced and assimilated its policies, identities, values and cultures.

In this chapter, I will define language in the following four interrelated ways:\n1)\tLanguage is a semo-genic system: it helps in both construing and representing meanings;\n2)\tLanguage is a socio-semiotic inheritance: under normal circumstances, we develop language in our homes and in engagement with people around us;\n3)\tLanguage is science: it includes all the taxonomies and the ways of classifying and categorising the world, which, at its core, is science; and \n4)\tLanguage is a complex dynamic system: it changes all the time, is unpredictable, and operates on fractals. \n\nThe four definitions (see Mahboob, in press, for a detailed discussion of each of these definitions) together can help us in: \na)\tunderstanding what language is; and, \nb)\tidentifying potential consequences of interfering with the linguistic ecology of a region. \n\nIn this chapter, we will discuss the relevance of each of these definitions of language in relation to the past, present and future of English in Pakistan. For example, we will discuss how altering the language ecology of a region alters the knowledge, the categories, and the approaches that people use to interact with each other and to make sense of the world around them. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62543983, "asset_id": 42382898, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44164, "first_name": "Ahmar", "last_name": "Mahboob", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "AhmarMahboob", "display_name": "Ahmar  Mahboob", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/AhmarMahboob?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44164/14123/13204/s65_ahmar.mahboob.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 101, "name": "Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 10632, "name": "World Englishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Englishes?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 182179, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis_CDA_?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 6416341, "title": "Faptul magic \u0219i faptul mistic.

access to the Indian Ocean is often seen through a highly securitised lens. Strategic actors have long sought to use geographical constraints to maintain the region as a relatively enclosed strategic space. It has only a few narrow maritime entrance points and the littoral is not well connected to the interior of the Eurasian continent. These factors have contributed to the historical domination of the Indian Ocean by a succession of extra-regional maritime powers and the virtual exclusion of Eurasian land powers such as China and Russia. This paper considers how the physical geography of the Indian Ocean has contributed to its control by some powers and the exclusion of others. It then discusses China's Maritime Silk Route/One Belt One Road initiative, which includes growing interests in Indian Ocean ports and plans to build new overland pathways to connect China with the Indian Ocean. The paper concludes that while China's growing maritime interests in Indian Ocean are strategically important, it is the new overland routes connecting the Eurasian hinterland with the ocean that have the potential to change the entire geostrategic character of the region. \n\nA summary of this paper is available for download.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48453263, "asset_id": 28137914, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1832368, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Brewster", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DavidBrewster", "display_name": "David Brewster", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DavidBrewster?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1832368/3871427/4528464/s65_david.brewster.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 268, "name": "Political Geography and Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Geography_and_Geopolitics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32854, "name": "Popular Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Geopolitics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 59858, "name": "Geopolitcs and Geostrategy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitcs_and_Geostrategy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 88661, "name": "Eurasian Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eurasian_Geopolitics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 128622, "name": "International Relations of East Asia, Asian Security, China's Foreign Policy, International Relations Theory, Space Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_of_East_Asia_Asian_Security_Chinas_Foreign_Policy_International_Relation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 194144, "name": "Indian security studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_security_studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 368193, "name": "China's Energy Policy, Energy Security, China's Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinas_Energy_Policy_Energy_Security_Chinas_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 718844, "name": "Geopolitics of Central Asia and Indias Enery Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics_of_Central_Asia_and_Indias_Enery_Security?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1923340, "name": "\u2018one Belt, One Road\u2019", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/_one_Belt_One_Road_?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 13177341, "title": "Reflections on the Commentary Tradition in India", "created_at": "2015-06-22T09:07:32.912-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13177341/Reflections_on_the_Commentary_Tradition_in_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_13177341", "summary": "This essay proposes to share with the readers some of the experiences of using commentaries on Sanskrit texts, particularly philosophical texts. No Sanskrit work can be\nunderstood properly or adequately without the help of commentaries yet the commentators were not and could not be omniscient. After providing an overview of how ancient texts in India were taught by the gurus and how in course of time commentary writing side by side oral instruction\ncame into being, it is shown that all commentaries cannot be reliable on all occasions. The time lag between the base text and the commentaries thereon often disables the commentators to be certain about the collocation of the words, especially technical words in the base text. Secondly,\nlack of historical sense often makes the commentators opt for untenable significations of certain terms occurring in the base text. Thirdly, the personal philosophical affiliation of the\ncommentators often misleads them to interpret the text in a way inconsistent with the intention of the original author. All this has been shown with examples selected from various texts, philosophical and otherwise, and their commentaries. The essay concludes that commentaries are doubtless necessary and helpful and should be made use of wherever available; nevertheless it\nmust be kept in mind that ancient commentators were no less, if not more, fallible than we are and their works should be treated with caution, not regarding them as the last word, as some students and scholars still do.\nKeywords Commentaries \u00b7 Guru-sishya parampara \u00b7 Nyaya \u00b7 Philosophical texts \u00b7 Reliability \u00b7 Smrti.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37970499, "asset_id": 13177341, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14623268, "first_name": "Ramkrishna", "last_name": "Bhattacharya", "domain_name": "pavlovinstitutekolkata", "page_name": "RamkrishnaBhattacharya", "display_name": "Ramkrishna  Bhattacharya", "profile_url": "https://pavlovinstitutekolkata.academia.edu/RamkrishnaBhattacharya?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14623268/3980206/10791604/s65_ramkrishna.bhattacharya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3654, "name": "Textual Scholarship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textual_Scholarship?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4178, "name": "Textual Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textual_Criticism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27073, "name": "Textual criticism (Classics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textual_criticism_Classics_?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48945, "name": "Commentary Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commentary_Traditions?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 49055, "name": "Commentary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commentary?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 62083, "name": "Textual Criticism and Editing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textual_Criticism_and_Editing?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 5101873, "title": "Dreaming the Nation", "created_at": "2013-11-14T07:06:30.928-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5101873/Dreaming_the_Nation?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_5101873", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32314797, "asset_id": 5101873, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2019458, "first_name": "Sheena", "last_name": "Malhotra", "domain_name": "csun", "page_name": "SheenaMalhotra", "display_name": "Sheena Malhotra", "profile_url": "https://csun.academia.edu/SheenaMalhotra?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2019458/666444/827274/s65_sheena.malhotra.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 170908, "name": "Indian Cinema, Bollywood, Film Studies, South Asia, Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Cinema_Bollywood_Film_Studies_South_Asia_Media?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 6042055, "title": "The Use and Misuse of History and Archaeology in the Ayodhya Dispute", "created_at": "2014-02-11T22:40:10.748-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6042055/The_Use_and_Misuse_of_History_and_Archaeology_in_the_Ayodhya_Dispute?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_6042055", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32975680, "asset_id": 6042055, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1652775, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Van Damme", "domain_name": "antwerp", "page_name": "ThomasVanDamme", "display_name": "Thomas Van Damme", "profile_url": "https://antwerp.academia.edu/ThomasVanDamme?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1652775/573982/54995017/s65_thomas.van_damme.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5459, "name": "Cultural Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 3891029, "title": "\u09ae\u09bf\u09b2\u09bf\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b6\u09cd\u09a8, \u0985\u09a8\u09c1\u09ac\u09be\u09a6\u0995 -

But much like her earlier novel Palace of Illusions, an adaptation of Mahabharata, this is not simply another retelling of the celebrated epic. Apart from the fact that Forest is Sita\u2019s perspective of the whole story, the novel also differs from the original epic and its many later adaptations in its treatment of different characters, especially female characters. While not completely deviating from their original temperament, as portrayed in the epic, Divakaruni has simply provided the readers with vantage points to help them see the apparently evil characters in much more humanly light and understand their inner turmoil and motives behind their seemingly evil acts.

Feroz Rather takes a daring plunge into the macabre realm of violence and death in his debut novel \"The Night of Broken Glass.\" Spanning 13 stories-predominantly set in southern part of Indian-administered Kashmir-it is a tale told with a certain Conradian sensibility, where the tragic landscape and vagaries of the Kashmir conflict are sketched in all their ghoulish details. It is a composite bundle of haunting stories with surrealistic turns in them; it is a book that pulsates with savage ironies and moral dilemmas; it is a narrative that speaks as much for the dead as for the living.

Chatterji, Pankaj Mishra, Arundhati Roy\n\nKashmir is one of the most protracted and bloody occupations in the world\u2014and one of the most ignored. Under an Indian military rule that, at half a million strong, exceeds the total number of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, freedom of speech is non-existent, and human- rights abuses and atrocities are routinely visited on its Muslim-majority population. In the last two decades alone, over seventy thousand people have died. Ignored by its own corrupt politicians, abandoned by Pakistan and the West, which refuses to bring pressure to bear on its regional ally, India, the Kashmiri people\u2019s ongoing quest for justice and self- determination continues to be brutally suppressed. Exploring the causes and consequences of the occupation, Kashmir: The Case for Freedom is a passionate call for the end of occupation, and for the right of self- determination for the Kashmiri people.\n\nhttp://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233330/kashmir-by-arundhati-roy/9781844677351/", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44719704, "asset_id": 24384742, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40376840, "first_name": "Angana", "last_name": "Chatterji", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChatterjiAngana", "display_name": "Angana  Chatterji", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChatterjiAngana?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40376840/11033148/12312493/s65_angana.chatterji.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55927, "name": "Kashmir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 362278, "name": "Kashmir Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir_Conflict?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 385746, "name": "Political Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Conflict?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31055326, "title": "Dipa Ma -\u00ad An extraordinary female Buddhist master in the twentieth century", "created_at": "2017-01-23T19:51:00.653-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31055326/Dipa_Ma_An_extraordinary_female_Buddhist_master_in_the_twentieth_century?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_31055326", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51489346, "asset_id": 31055326, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57706741, "first_name": "Dipen", "last_name": "Barua", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "DipenBarua", "display_name": "Dipen Barua", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/DipenBarua?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57706741/15573801/62508054/s65_dr._dipen.barua.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 298802, "name": "Buddhist Meditation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Meditation?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33604125, "title": "The Indian Portrait - V: Colonial Influence on Raja Ravi Varma and his Contemporaries", "created_at": "2017-06-22T04:48:10.680-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33604125/The_Indian_Portrait_V_Colonial_Influence_on_Raja_Ravi_Varma_and_his_Contemporaries?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33604125", "summary": "This catalogue details the journey of the academic realism and colonial influence that impacted Raja Ravi Varma\u2019s works and his contemporaries like Rustom Siodia, Pestonji Bomanji, Abalal Rahiman, M V Dhurandhar, A X Trindade, M F Pithawalla, Fyzee Rahamin, Ravi Shankar Raval, Ghasiram Sharma and many others.

These three-masted barques built at the Goa Shipyard and used by the Indian Navy are very different from wooden sailing vessels that traversed the Indian Ocean in the premodern period prior to the development of steamship navigation in the nineteenth century. Nonetheless, these distinctions have often been blurred as these modern naval ships have been utilised to recreate historical 'expeditions' such as the much-celebrated Chola invasion of Srivijaya in the Indonesian archipelago. Nor is India the only country to be involved in promoting this 'popular history' for contemporary geopolitical interests, as is evident from China's efforts to rebuild ships used in the Voyages of Admiral Zheng He across the Indian Ocean.

Thus has begun an uneasy and fragile peace, punctuated by harsh rhetoric, proxy war and unsuccessful attempts  at stability in the Indian subcontinent. Pakistan continues to use terror as a form of state policy while instigating the 'Generation Next' in the troubled paradise of Jammu and Kashmir. Of late, a disturbing trend, that of targeting camps and garrisons of security forces has emerged, intermediate-level attacks that seem to propagate the notion of an insurgency while keeping the level and nature of damage to a level which is not considered incentive enough to start an Indian mobilisation. However, Uri became an exception and a way for the Indian government to start applying holistic coercive diplomacy measures, termed in the field of International Relations as compellence. What has been the result? How credible have the efforts been? Is there a case for improving upon existing measures or are alternative options available?

This crisis owes its origin and development mainly to over development of non-representative institutions of civil and military bureaucracy and recurrent experience of military authoritarian regimes. In such a restrictive political atmosphere there rose to the political scene a leader who had will, guts and popular acclaim to challenge Ayub Khan when Ayub's grip on power was yet firm. This leader was Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who established his political party\u2014Pakistan People's Party\u2014and developed it into a mass movement during the anti-Ayub campaign which culminated into the downfall of Ayub and his resignation from power in 1969. Bhutto gave his nascent party new heights and was able to successfully contest elections of 1970 with securing 81 National Assembly seats but all from the West Pakistan. The party that won 1970 elections was the Pakistan Awami League which got overall simple majority but almost all seats from East Pakistan (160 out of 162). However, the crisis of transfer of power deepened when Yahya Khan showed unwillingness to transfer power and the political movement in East Pakistan developed into a separatist movement culminating into secession of East Pakistan in December 1971. The Pakistan People's Party, in comparison to Awami League, was a new entrant but its meteoric rise was, in fact, due to the charisma of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who galvanized the party and achieved stunning success. However, Bhutto's downfall was also as meteoric as was his rise. There were many factors but his political behaviour\u2014the way he exercised power\u2014 contributed enormously in his downfall. This article outlines, first, his formative influences and the process through which he assumed leadership role and was able to leave an indelible imprint on the history of country. Second, while in power he carried out reforms not only those he had pledged in his election manifesto but more: in this way he resorted to broaden his powerbase in transactional and transformational leadership paradigm. Third, having entrenched himself in the power spectrum of Pakistan he started behaving like a typical Sindhi wadera. He resorted to exercising power in a very arbitrary manner and this political behavior, the details of which ensue in this paper, explains his downfall and ouster from power.

So, logically it also explains what Kamalist secularism or its individuality from the Western concept of secularism is.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64706776, "asset_id": 44318924, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21276746, "first_name": "Mohammad Jashim", "last_name": "Uddin", "domain_name": "nub", "page_name": "MohammadJashimUddin", "display_name": "Mohammad Jashim  Uddin", "profile_url": "https://nub.academia.edu/MohammadJashimUddin?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21276746/16469477/18418244/s65_mohammad_jashim.uddin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35113389, "title": "\u0420\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c \u044f\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0410\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e-\u0422\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043e\u043a\u0435\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435 (Regional Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime in the Asia Pacific)", "created_at": "2017-11-10T17:37:44.453-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35113389/%D0%A0%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BC_%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE_%D0%A2%D0%B8%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC_%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5_Regional_Nuclear_Non_Proliferation_Regime_in_the_Asia_Pacific_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_35113389", "summary": "The chapter deals with peculiarities of establishment of the regional\nnuclear nonproliferation regime in the Asia Pacific as well as its condition in the modern period.

Special attention is paid\nto the pressing problems of nuclear nonproliferation, NWFZs in the region and their functioning and role of the nuclear factor on the agenda\nof the regional organisations. In spite of certain legal discrepancies intrinsic to the nonproliferation regime in the APR, states of the region\nmake a significant contribution to nonproliferation of nuclear weapons\nand

While exploring the historical developments of the region within Tibet and Bhutan during the 16th and 17th centuries, this book examines how the region, also known simply as Mon, was incorporated into Tibet via an edict issued in 1681 and the subsequent reiterating edict in 1731 by the Lhasa\u2019s Tibetan Government. The book also provides an analysis of the term Mon, its etymology and not least its usage on a broader scale. The monograph is based on critical textual research, investigating Tibetan legal documents and the historical texts including auto-/biographies. A number of those sources are presented along with their annotated translations and the facsimile editions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57231077, "asset_id": 37276525, "asset_type": "Work",

plurality is generally defined as when a speaker or writer alternates between two or more languages, or language varieties, in the context of a single conversation or prose or poetry. As a student of history, in this paper, I have tried to critically analyze the role of linguistic pluralism incorporated by various bhakta-kavis and the Sufis in the vibrant traditions of Bhakti and Sufi movements. The paper also seeks an answer to the question why the Bhakti and Sufi ideologues tended to use the \u2018local\u2019 and \u2018vernacular\u2019 languages rather than Sanskrit or Persian in their proses and poetries. Finally, the paper tries to verify whether these socio-religious traditions were multilingual or not.

Drawing on A. D. Smith's ethno-symbolic approach, Gurharpal Singh and Giorgio Shani use a new integrated methodology to understanding the historical and sociological development of modern Sikh nationalism. By emphasising the importance of studying Sikh nationalism from the perspective of the nation-building projects of India and Pakistan, the recent literature on religious nationalism and the need to integrate the study of the diaspora with the Sikhs in South Asia, they provide a fresh approach to a complex subject. Singh and Shani evaluate the current condition of Sikh nationalism in a globalised world and consider the lessons the Sikh case offers for the comparative study of ethnicity, nations and nationalism.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67812585, "asset_id": 49468341, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 74221660, "asset_id": 49468341, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27810077, "first_name": "Gurharpal", "last_name": "Singh", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "GurharpalSingh", "display_name": "Gurharpal Singh", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/GurharpalSingh?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27810077/19234226/19175297/s65_gurharpal.singh.jpg"}, {"id": 1160612, "first_name": "Giorgio", "last_name": "Shani", "domain_name": "icu", "page_name": "GiorgioShani", "display_name": "Giorgio Shani", "profile_url": "https://icu.academia.edu/GiorgioShani?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1160612/1326590/18677454/s65_giorgio.shani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116, "name": "Sikhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikhism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 10372, "name": "South Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 26049, "name": "Sikh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikh_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 28115, "name": "South Asian Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Diasporas?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 32878, "name": "Nationalism and religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_and_religion?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 133048, "name": "Religion and international relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_international_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 3664930, "name": "Sikh nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikh_nationalism?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 50319793, "title": "Ajanta Paintings. 2nd edition (Baroda: Hari Sena Press, 2019).", "created_at": "2021-07-28T03:45:45.534-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50319793/Ajanta_Paintings_2nd_edition_Baroda_Hari_Sena_Press_2019_?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_50319793", "summary": "This is the second edition of earlier title of the same name (2013).

Ever since the establishment of the formal diplomatic relationship in October 1975, Bangladesh and China continued to be closer friends and development partners. Their relationship is often termed as 'trusted friendship' or 'all weather friendship'. Successful bilateral cooperation between Bangladesh and China has been attained in a number of sectors, including politics, economy, military and culture. Over the years, they have signed quite a lot of bilateral treaties, agreements, and memoranda of understandings on mutual economic engagement, cultural sharing, infrastructure development, educational exchange and military support. Mutual reciprocity based on shared interests has largely contributed to keep Bangladesh-China bilateral relations sustainable over time. In this milieu, the objective of the present study is to offer a comprehensive approach to Bangladesh-China bilateral relations at the dawn of the twenty-first century. It elucidates the historical development of this bilateral relationship; goes through its various dimensions; identifies major challenges; and suggest a bunch of policy imperatives to foster this friendship.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53026979, "asset_id": 32885272, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63959606, "first_name": "Dr. Noor Mohammad", "last_name": "Sarker", "domain_name": "univdhaka", "page_name": "NoorMohammadSarker", "display_name": "Dr. Noor Mohammad Sarker", "profile_url": "https://univdhaka.academia.edu/NoorMohammadSarker?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63959606/16609089/72690158/s65_dr._noor_mohammad.sarker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10871, "name": "Regionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regionalism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12785, "name": "History of International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 34405, "name": "Economic Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Diplomacy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 40331, "name": "Power Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Power_Politics?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41875, "name": "Bangladesh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh_Studies?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 64833, "name": "Realism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Realism?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 79323, "name": "Foreign Affairs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Affairs?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 305899, "name": "India Bangladesh relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India_Bangladesh_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 313371, "name": "Diplomacy and international relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacy_and_international_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 368545, "name": "Bangladesh Foreign Affairs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh_Foreign_Affairs?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 579383, "name": "Bangladesh-China relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh-China_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 583257, "name": "Military and Security assistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_and_Security_assistance?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 41746618, "title": "Karna-Kunti Dialogue: Representations by Different Hands | by Chandanashis Laha", "created_at": "2020-01-26T21:30:15.540-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41746618/Karna_Kunti_Dialogue_Representations_by_Different_Hands_by_Chandanashis_Laha?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_41746618", "summary": "Ciderpress, Hardback 2017.

Amidst such fundamental changes, Paul Collier and his team offer the greed or grievance theory \u2013 a pioneering quantitative research to explain the Byzantine complexities of the risks and processes of civil war onset. The most digested model of the theory examines global data on civil war against three empirical proxies for greed and four for grievance claiming that the material motivation (i.e. greed) holds more explanatory power than ideational motivation (i.e. grievance) in the context of civil war onset. This paper critically examines their claim, comparing and contrasting it with other relevant theories of civil war. It argues that the primacy of economic motivation in civil war does not necessarily imply that the notion of greed and grievance to be juxtaposed; instead, both greed and grievance remain inherently indivisible in civil war. The interplay of greed and grievance in civil war is dynamic and reflects a symbiotic relationship. They are often the shades of same problem and can mutate into one another such as into political greed and economic grievance. The paper substantiates its arguments by highlighting the increasing trend of internationalized civil conflicts where various external actors, exploiting the regional conflict complex and the opportunity structures, can contribute to trigger and or prolong civil wars. Finally, the paper highlights the issues of power and wealth distribution in society and argues that inequality plays a central role in conflict as postulated in the horizontal inequalities (HIs) theory. It contends that the inclusiveness offered in the HIs model to account for group inequalities in economic, political, cultural and social dimensions incorporating both greed and grievance makes this model better poised to explain the incidence of civil war onset.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54043201, "asset_id": 34112408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5339123, "first_name": "Mohammad", "last_name": "Khan", "domain_name": "reading", "page_name": "ZahidKhan", "display_name": "Mohammad Z I Khan", "profile_url": "https://reading.academia.edu/ZahidKhan?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5339123/2344937/10903429/s65_mohammad.khan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6225, "name": "Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_War?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1312510, "name": "State Fragility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Fragility?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1687425, "name": "Greed and Grievances", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greed_and_Grievances?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 33776365, "title": "Housing Society: Life in a New Nation State", "created_at": "2017-07-05T00:35:29.640-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33776365/Housing_Society_Life_in_a_New_Nation_State?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_33776365", "summary": "Abstract\nIt is a novella by Qurratulain Hyder that examines the lives, loves and struggles of clueless\nrefugees from India\u201fs Ganga-Yamuna plains in the strange city of Karachi in Sindh, hemmed\nin by sea and sand of a sprawling desert.

It is mediated by a different set of vernacular languages, conceptual repertoire, and regional cultures.Certain scholars have pointed out that it involves a complex process of postcolonial translation that is ongoing. However, this recognition has not come together with a close examination of the texts that are involved in the process, for example, a critical reading of the translated works of Marx and broadly Marxism in the different languages, especially contexts where they became powerful.This essay will offer such a reading in the context of late colonial Bengal and later West Bengal. The \ufb01rst part of the essay will outline a background of the early translations and adaptations,their experiments as well as the setting down of certain rules of discourse on Marxism in the Bangla language. The second part of the essay will offer a close reading of the vernacular translations of Marx\u2019s Capital, especially volume one. We will discuss a certain edition at length, published in the late twentieth century by a communist intellectual, who fell out of favor with the new party leadership. It is the \ufb01rst unabridged Bangla translation of Capital, published in seven volumes. For a close reading of the different dimensions of translation involved in such a process, we are going to look at speci\ufb01c passages from the section on commodity fetishism, which follow in the Bangla edition under the heading PanyaPouttalikata Ebang tar Rahasya. The essay will conclude with some remarks on the comparative strategies of translation and the shifting nature of Marxist discourse in the postcolonial period and its broad relations with politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61795620, "asset_id": 41641349, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3290417, "first_name": "Rajarshi", "last_name": "Dasgupta", "domain_name": "an", "page_name": "RajarshiDasgupta", "display_name": "Rajarshi Dasgupta", "profile_url": "https://an.academia.edu/RajarshiDasgupta?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3290417/1093214/41902612/s65_rajarshi.dasgupta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1698, "name": "Marxism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44169831, "title": "CALL FOR PAPERS: SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL WRITING ON BANGLADESHI LITERATURE IN ENGLISH", "created_at": "2020-09-26T06:34:20.391-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44169831/CALL_FOR_PAPERS_SPECIAL_ISSUE_OF_THE_JOURNAL_OF_POSTCOLONIAL_WRITING_ON_BANGLADESHI_LITERATURE_IN_ENGLISH?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_44169831", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64528587, "asset_id": 44169831, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

In order to analyse these problems, this chapter begins by providing a brief narrative outline of the rise and decline of the Mughal Empire along with its structure and institutions. It will then turn to an examination of the broader context for South Asian notions of kingship and sovereignty and Mughal imperial ideology as it developed during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The chapter further elaborates the most important Mughal imperial practices, their antecedents and innovations.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at a public psychiatric hospital in Srinagar, Kashmir, one of the institutions selected to be a future ''Centre of Excellence,'' this article focuses on how these reforms have affected psychiatric institutions themselves. Efforts at modernizing and increasing access to mental health care\u2014that is, emphasizing shortened stays, increasing outpatient treatment, and providing care in the ''community''\u2014depend on quarantining stigmatized, chronically ill, long-term patients who reside in custodial conditions with fewer resources and limited attention from providers. Psychiatrists have a radically different vision for redressing manpower shortages than the MGMH and Indian state, revealing contradictions in the reform process. This paper demonstrates how modernizing mental health care splits mental institutions spatially, ontologically, temporally, and epistemologically, so that the process of modernizing the institution is neither seamless nor complete.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54027222, "asset_id": 34094791, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 60792421, "first_name": "Saiba", "last_name": "Varma", "domain_name": "ucsd", "page_name": "SaibaVarma", "display_name": "Saiba Varma", "profile_url": "https://ucsd.academia.edu/SaibaVarma?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/60792421/15823232/54013505/s65_saiba.varma.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 635, "name": "Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychiatry?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6384, "name": "Critical Medical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Medical_Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20175, "name": "Global Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Mental_Health?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 211039, "name": "Deinstitutionalisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deinstitutionalisation?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 41984782, "title": "Mahabharata Brahmins, Kings, and the South Asian Social World", "created_at": "2020-02-15T15:51:24.563-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41984782/Mahabharata_Brahmins_Kings_and_the_South_Asian_Social_World?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_41984782", "summary": "From  A Companion to World Literature, and the Publisher John Wiley & Sons Inc.  https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118635193", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62109357, "asset_id": 41984782, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6062587, "first_name": "Luther", "last_name": "Obrock", "domain_name": "berkeley", "page_name": "LutherObrock", "display_name": "Luther Obrock", "profile_url": "https://berkeley.academia.edu/LutherObrock?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6062587/17520246/17589873/s65_luther.obrock.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 658, "name": "World Literatures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Literatures?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6921, "name": "Sanskrit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 17365, "name": "South Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 20058, "name": "Epic poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epic_poetry?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 58909, "name": "Mahabharata", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mahabharata?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 40916169, "title": "Rohingya Crisis: Genesis and Foreshadowing Prospects", "created_at": "2019-11-13T07:41:49.092-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40916169/Rohingya_Crisis_Genesis_and_Foreshadowing_Prospects?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_40916169", "summary": "This paper mainly deals with the Rohingya crisis from a historical\npoint of view.

Climate translations are required to give visible form to the diverse climate imaginaries that proliferate in the world, but currently remain unexamined. FollowingWalter Benjamin, translation is here conceptualized as a movement across domains wherein the translated version needn\u2019t literally adhere to the original, but should rather aim to carry its echo. Climate translators are required for four broadly interlinked reasons. In the first, it remains important to challenge the conceit of much (Eurocentric) climate science that assumes there is only one modality \u2013the supposedly-rationalized work of legitimized Science \u2013 that can illuminate the crisis that faces humanity. Beyond the elitism and hegemony of climate science, climate translations are important to confront climate skeptics, denialists, and conspiracists who continue to dispute the facticity of climate change. Perhaps most importantly, climate translations are required in order to better conceptualise what climate change is actually about; to build up a richer array of climate imaginaries. Finally, climate translations can help overcome problems intrinsic to the concept of the Anthropocene: it\u2019s domination by the Natural Sciences and the neglect/lower position of the Humanities, as well as the lack of awareness of the sharp power distinctions withinthe Anthropos. An instance ofthe form potential climate translations might assume is provided through an ethnographic account of human-animal relations in the Indian Himalaya. This climate translation compares and contrasts mainstream scientific accounts of animal endangerment/extinction and conflict to embedded but distinct Himalayan stories of multispecies relationality. I suggest that these seemingly different accounts share a recognisably similar consciousness of human impact, inter-species entanglements, and climatic change. The task I set myself here as a climate translator is of being attuned to distinct stories; giving them an expressive form that doesn\u2019t reproduce existing hierarchies of knowledge; and, therein, bringing out diverse imaginaries of the Indian Anthropocene.

Nargis was a niece to Ali Akbar Khan - a friend to veteran Communist Muzaffar Ahmad and well wisher of Kazi Nazrul. With Ali Akbar Khan Nazrul went to Daulatpur in Comilla and stayed there for about two months and a half. There he fell in love with Nargis, a beauty. Their marriage was settled. The date of marriage was Ashar 3,1328 B.S or middle of June, 1921. About their marriage Karunamaya Goswami says, \u201c\n\nSome of the biographers of Nazrul Islam have doubted whether at all the marriage was solemnized. But it appears from various sources including some letters of Kazi Nazrul Islam that the wedding between Kazi Nazrul Islam and Sayda Khatun might have been solemnized, but unfortunately their wedded relations did not last long. For some reasons, not yet very clearly known, Nazrul is said to have left Sayade Khatun and Daulatpur in the very night of the day of marriage and never accepted Sayada as his wife. \n\n(Kazi Nazrul Islam : A Biography, Nazrul Institute, Dhaka, 1996, P-30 )\nNargis waited for Nazrul for long seventeen years. But after the following letter she understood that there were no hopes at all. In the language of Nargis \n\nOn 4 November 1937 with the help of my uncle\u2019s friend Prof. Helaluddin of Mymensing I met Nazrul for the last time at Shialdah Hotel in Calcutta with my cousin Nowajesh Mohammad Khan and Wazed Ali. Seeing me Nazrul became unprepared. At first none of us could speak. Coming out of torpidity Nazrul told, \u201cYou do go, I\u2019m coming to Dhaka immediately and will make a solution\u2019; Nazrul told about his familial future-distresses. He told, \u2018Promila [Nazrul\u2019s wife] or her mother won\u2019t tolerate you. So you do stay in Dhaka. Thus he asked us to leave. But his \u2018immediately\u2019 never came again. \n\nAfter some years of her marriage\uf02daffairs Nargis took admission into Kamrunnessa Girls\u2019 College, Dhaka. She had some literary attempts also. She wrote three novels Tahmina, Dhumketu and Pathik Haowa along with some textbooks.\nAbout Nargis\u2019 love for Nazrul what Azharuddin Khan, a noted Nazrul-researcher in his book Bangla Sahitye Nazrul ( Nazrul in Bangla Literature ) wrote may be quoted: \n\nIn all her three novels Nargis had only one target that is Nazrul. Her novel Tahamina is about the story of Sohorab Rustam. Rustam\u2019s wife was Tahmina. There is a great similarity between the lives of Nargis and Tahmina. As Rustam the hero left Tahmina and went for battle, Nazrul also left Nargis. Both of their lives are sorrowful since their birth\uf02d-always bereft of love. The eagerness that Tahmina expresses in every line of the novel is nothing but the agony of Nargis herself. \n   (First Supreme Edition, Calcutta, 1997, P-79) \n\nLater on Nargis was married to poet Azizul Hakim.

examination of Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s ideas on nationalism and his rhetoric of cosmopolitanism. It critically analyses the poetics and the politics of his works and specifically responds to Tagore\u2019s three lectures on nationalism delivered during the early years of the twentieth century, and later compiled in his book Nationalism (1917). \n\nThis volume: \n\n\u2022\tDiscusses Tagore\u2019s perception of nationalism \u2014 the many-sidedness of his engagement with nationalism; the root causes of his anathema against the ideology; ambiguities and limitations associated with his perception; and his alternative vision of cosmopolitanism or global unity;\n\n\u2022\tCross-examines an alternative view of cosmopolitanism based on Tagore\u2019s inclusivist ideology to \u2018seek my compatriots all over the world\u2019.\n\n\u2022\tExplores how his ideas on nationalism and cosmopolitanism found myriad expressions across his works \u2014 in prose, fiction, poetry, travelogue, songs \u2014 as well as in the legacy of cinematic adaptations of his writings;\n\n\u2022\tInvestigates the relevance of Tagore\u2019s thoughts on nationalism and cosmopolitanism in relation to the contemporary rise of religious, nationalist and sectarian violence in the 21st century.\n\nA key study on the relevance of Tagore\u2019s political philosophy in the contemporary world with contributions from eminent Tagore scholars in South Asia as well as the West, this book will be of great interest to readers and researchers in the fields of literature, political science, cultural studies, philosophy and Asian studies. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61718965, "asset_id": 41560570, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

It is scattered across a large area and connected through a trans-local network of preachers, pilgrims, institutions, print, and religious commodities. Most Matua followers are found in West Bengal; in southern Bangladesh, where the movement emerged in the 19th century; and in provinces where refugees from East Bengal have resettled since the 1950s, especially Assam; Tripura; the Andaman Islands; Uttarakhand; and the Dandakaranya area at the border of Orissa, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh. Building upon an older Vaishnava devotional stream, the religious community initiated by Harichand Thakur (1812\u20131878) and consolidated by his son Guruchand Thakur (1847\u20131937) developed hand in hand with the Namashudra movement for the social upliftment of the lower castes. Rebelling against social marginalization and untouchability, and promising salvation through ecstatic singing and dancing, the Matua community triggered a massive mobilization in rural East Bengal. Partition and displacement have disrupted the unity of the Matua movement, now scattered on both sides of the hastily drawn Indo-Bangladesh border. The institutional side of the Matua community emerged as a powerful political subject, deeply entangled with refugee politics, borderland issues, and Hindu nationalism. In the 21st century, the Matua community represents a key element in electoral politics and a crucial factor for understanding the relation between religion, displacement, and caste, within and beyond Bengal.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62245286, "asset_id": 42112763, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1310549, "first_name": "CAROLA ERIKA",

Suryamukhi Devi of Imphal, Manipur. The diachronic examination of her performing and non-performing life, aids in exploring the key moments when ritual-dances of the Meitei community came to be known as Manipuri in the landscape of performing arts in India and what did the dances entail. The core pedagogy of Manipuri dance was primarily developed with the help of dancers like her. Besides that, Thiyam's self-examination of identity, femininity, ideas of stage-choreography and ritual efficacy of movements is reflective of how dance histories journey beyond neat continuities; they are constructed despite ruptures, differences, ambiguities. What this paper does is trace the deep interdependencies of performer, performance, oral history, life narrative and ethnography to seek the formalised definitions of a dance. Alongside, this paper attempts to place these interdependencies and definitions within the context of oral-performative history of early modern Manipur.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81220152, "asset_id": 72195376, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2776296, "first_name": "Debanjali", "last_name": "Biswas", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "DebanjaliBiswas", "display_name": "Debanjali Biswas", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/DebanjaliBiswas?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2776296/905100/1131269/s65_debanjali.biswas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1556, "name": "Dance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86950, "name": "Manipur", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manipur?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 182230, "name": "Indian Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Dance?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184241, "name": "Life Story; Biographic Narrative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Life_Story_Biographic_Narrative_Research?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1435885, "name": "Manipuri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manipuri?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 32768323, "title": "The Absence of Freedom.

They represent both an important case study for investigating the systems of dependence and debt-relationships that characterize Southern Asian capitalism, and a big challenge to creating sustainable, international standards for human labor. One aspect largely overlooked in the literature concerns the ideas of freedom that emerge in situations of bondage. Based on ethnographic research conducted in brick kilns in the areas of Gujrat, Islamabad and Rawalpindi in 2015 and 2016, my analysis focuses on workers' narratives and their perceptions of freedom and its absence.

After completing the lesson plan, students should have an enhanced understanding of the learning goals listed below: 1. The similarities between different types of internal and external migration, and the effects migration has on individuals and their senses of identity;  2. Why nativism is so prevalent, the negative impact it has on humanity, and how it can be overcome by shared experiences between people;  3. How authorities such as governments and mass media corporations use technology to deter immigration, via both force and influencing the public, in ways that dehumanize immigrants;  4. How the narrative voice's level of omniscience with respect to both the thoughts of characters and time can be altered to emphasize different perspectives and opinions; and 5.

In it we have The Authorized Version of the Bible, the perfection of the English language. It is the language with which Shakespeare held the \"mirror upto nature\" to show \"virtue her image and vice its own countenance\"; the language with which Milton tried to assert eternal providence, \"And justify the ways of God to men\", the language through which Darwin expounded his \"theory of evolution\", \"struggle for existence\" and \"survival of the fittest\". Through it, Mill preached the gospel of liberty and Bentham, the theory of the 'greatest good of the greatest number'. Arnold used it for the spared of 'sweetness and light' and Newman for putting forward his theory of 'knowledge its own end', Shaw for speaking of 'socialism' and Wells showing for the 'Shape of Things to Come'. With it Burke carried on his campaign of 'no taxation without representation' and Morley warned the bureaucracy that: 'bulling is no governing'. Thus English language has given expression to great social ideas and great political ideas. In the same language has been written literature by indian authors and the recognition of their writings has evolved a term \"Indo-Anglian Literature\"-but recently the Indianans in such writings has come finally\" to be known as \"Indian Writing in English.\" There is unanimity among literary historians and scholars that Indian creative writing in English had begun even before Macaulay \" s Minute on Indian Education (1835) was accepted and edorsed by Lord William Bentick, the Governor-General of Indian at that time 1. Yet there is considerable disagreement, often verging on confusion, as to the term one should employ in describing and identifying this area of writing. As one reviews the development of this literature. one becomes keenly aware of the necessity to agree on a comprehensive descriptive term for it, thus assisting in giving credibility to this literature.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47755517, "asset_id": 27498984, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9989691, "first_name": "International Research Journal", "last_name": "Commerce arts science", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CASIRJ", "display_name": "International Research Journal Commerce arts science", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CASIRJ?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9989691/3092882/3643390/s65_cas.irj.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 6270301, "title": "South Asian English", "created_at": "2014-03-03T02:30:22.850-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6270301/South_Asian_English?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_6270301", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33122509, "asset_id": 6270301, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9675756, "first_name": "Kamal", "last_name": "Sridhar", "domain_name": "sbsuny", "page_name": "KamalSridhar", "display_name": "Kamal Sridhar", "profile_url": "https://sbsuny.academia.edu/KamalSridhar?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 48836260, "title": "Hijras, Lovers, Brothers: Surviving Sex and Poverty in Rural India", "created_at": "2021-05-07T13:55:40.003-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48836260/Hijras_Lovers_Brothers_Surviving_Sex_and_Poverty_in_Rural_India?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_48836260", "summary": "Hijras, one of India\u2019s third gendered or trans\npopulations, have been an enduring presence in\nthe South Asian imagination\u2014in myth, in ritual,\nand in everyday life, often associated in\nstigmatized forms with begging and sex work.\nIn more recent years hijras have seen a degree\nof political emergence as a moral presence in\nIndian electoral politics, and with heightened\nvulnerability within global health terms as a\nhigh-risk population caught within the AIDS\nepidemic.\nHijras, Lovers, Brothers recounts two years living\nwith a group of hijras in rural India. In this\nriveting ethnography, Vaibhav Saria reveals not\njust a group of stigmatized or marginalized\nothers but a way of life composed of laughter,\nstruggles, and desires that trouble how we read\nqueerness, kinship, and the psyche.\nAgainst easy framings of hijras that render them\nmarginalized, Saria shows how hijras makes the\nnormative Indian family possible. The book also\nshows that particular practices of hijras, such as\nrefusing to use condoms or comply with\nretroviral regimes, reflect not ignorance or\nirresponsibility but rather a specific idiom of\nerotic asceticism arising in both Hindu and\nIslamic traditions. This idiom suffuses the\ndensely intertwined registers of erotics,\neconomics, and kinship that inform the\neveryday lives of hijras and offer a repertoire of\nself-fashioning distinct from the secularized\naccounts within the horizon of public health\nprograms and queer theory.\nEngrossingly written and full of keen insights,\nthe book moves from the small pleasures of the\neveryday\u2014laughter, flirting, teasing\u2014to\nimpossible longings, kinship networks, and\neconomies of property and of substance in\norder to give a fuller account of trans lives and\nof

Bielefeld: Columbia University Press|Transcript Verlag, 215-231. \r\nThis chapter focuses on the commercial dynamics of contemporary literary culture as they play out in recent South Asian fiction written in English by cosmopolitan authors. The focus of my analysis rests on literary texts which have emerged as sites where experiences, desires, transitions and anxieties related to the profound social and structural changes that are shaping the socioeconomic landscape of the world are drawn on and negotiated. The main argument of this chapter is that, even though these narratives of (dis)possession problematise cap-italism's logics of asymmetrical distribution of power and wealth, the high profile of their authors within the global circuits of production and reception of postcolonial texts is generated by the same logics. In fact, the ways these narratives are made to circulate within the global market at times counteract the expressed agenda of their authors. Altogether, I will approach recent South Asian fiction as a current central paradigm of postcolonial literature marketing, one that can be applied to other contexts. For instance, this paradigm resonates with the appropriation by British publishers of the process of canon-formation of postcolonial Anglophone African writing since the 1960s (cf. Davis 2013). Before elaborating on recent economic and social developments in South Asia and their repercussions in fiction contemporaneous with them, I will therefore develop a conceptual perspective on postcolonial literature marketing, mainly using ideas from the methodology of the 'new sociology of literature'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63687378, "asset_id": 21293681, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35412, "first_name": "Ana Cristina", "last_name": "Mendes", "domain_name": "lisboa", "page_name": "AnaFMendes", "display_name": "Ana Cristina  Mendes", "profile_url": "https://lisboa.academia.edu/AnaFMendes?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35412/82151/1997884/s65_ana.mendes.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13144, "name": "Indian Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14614, "name": "Sociology of Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Literature?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 41435, "name": "Indian Writing in English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Writing_in_English?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 1005698, "title": "Housing in the Urban Age:  Inequality and Aspiration in Mumbai", "created_at": "2011-10-13T00:18:53.626-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1005698/Housing_in_the_Urban_Age_Inequality_and_Aspiration_in_Mumbai?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_1005698", "summary": "In scholarly and popular texts, Mumbai is invoked as an iconic example of the problem of urban informal settlements in the twenty-first century.

The tea industry filled the imperial coffers and offered the colonial state a chance to transform a jungle-laden frontier into a cultivated system of plantations. Claiming that local peasants were indolent, the British soon began importing indentured labor from Central India. In the twentieth century, these migrants were joined by others who came voluntarily to seek their livelihoods. In Empire\u2019s Garden, Jayeeta Sharma explains how the settlement of more than one million migrants in Assam irrevocably changed the region\u2019s social landscape. She argues that the racialized construction of the tea laborer catalyzed a process in which Assam\u2019s gentry sought to insert their homeland into an imagined Indo-Aryan community and a modern Indian political space. Various linguistic and racial claims allowed these elites to defend their own modernity while pushing the burden of primitiveness onto \u201cnon-Aryan\u201d indigenous tribals or migrant laborers. As vernacular print arenas emerged in Assam, so did competing claims to history, nationalism, and progress that continue to reverberate in the present.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32778556, "asset_id": 462472, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 32778562, "asset_id": 462472, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 32778566, "asset_id": 462472, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 32778560, "asset_id": 462472, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 292677, "first_name": "Jayeeta", "last_name": "Sharma", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "JayeetaSharma", "display_name": "Jayeeta  Sharma", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/JayeetaSharma?f_ri=3558", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 16944, "name": "Northeast India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Northeast_India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 35165, "name": "History of the British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_British_Empire?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 77301, "name": "Assam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assam?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 74084381, "title": "Heterogeneity Amidst Orthodoxy: A Relook at the Multi-referenced Architecture of Sringeri's Vidyashankara Temple", "created_at": "2022-03-19T11:49:37.807-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74084381/Heterogeneity_Amidst_Orthodoxy_A_Relook_at_the_Multi_referenced_Architecture_of_Sringeris_Vidyashankara_Temple?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_74084381", "summary": "Easily the grandest example of temple architecture in the hills of Malnad, 1 the Vidyashankara temple of Sringeri stands out even in the wider Karnataka region, thanks to its unusually heterogeneous form (Figs. 1, 2 and 3).

In 1950s Madras, an international team of researchers demonstrated that antibiotics were effective in treating tuberculosis. But just half a century later, reports out of Mumbai stoked fears about the spread of totally drug-resistant strains of the disease. Had the curable become incurable? Through an anthropological history of tuberculosis treatment in India, Bharat Jayram Venkat examines what it means to be cured, and what it means for a cure to come undone. At the Limits of Cure tells a story that stretches from the colonial period\u2014a time of sanatoria, travel cures, and gold therapy\u2014into a postcolonial present marked by antibiotic miracles and their failures. Venkat juxtaposes the unraveling of cure across a variety of sites: in idyllic hill stations and crowded prisons, aboard ships and on the battlefield, and through research trials and clinical encounters. If cure is frequently taken as an ending (of illness, treatment, and suffering more generally), Venkat provides a foundation for imagining cure otherwise in a world of fading antibiotic efficacy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68676427, "asset_id": 50811019, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3949586, "first_name": "Bharat", "last_name": "Venkat", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "BharatVenkat", "display_name": "Bharat J Venkat", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/BharatVenkat?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3949586/3927370/28753904/s65_bharat.venkat.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 793, "name": "Medical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 13514, "name": "STS (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/STS_Anthropology_?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 62235, "name": "Tuberculosis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tuberculosis?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 39513512, "title": "The world of Premchand: Interview with Prof. M Asaduddin", "created_at": "2019-06-11T04:34:20.080-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39513512/The_world_of_Premchand_Interview_with_Prof_M_Asaduddin?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_39513512", "summary": "Premchand: The Complete Short Stories, published in four volumes is a collaborative enterprise of around 70 translators working on 300 stories, the project boasts of several short stories being presented in English for the first time.

The prime objective of this study is to give a brief account of the political and development role of Akkaraipattu Municipal Council since it was established. Meanwhile, it scrutinizes the decisionmaking process along with the achievements which have been gained through democracy in the area. The council, in turn, has become marginalized and insignificant in the public eye. The fundamental questions of this research are the following: under what conditions does a local body generate the capabilities that transform it into successful democratic governance; how are they generated; and what role can the municipality play in promoting democratic governance at the local level? Several approaches are employed to analyze and interpret social phenomena. This study is based on an interpretive approach. The data were collected from both primary and secondary sources. In addition to primary sources, qualitative interviews were conducted with all representatives of council and a particular number of voters.

Colonial officials claimed that prostitutes and eunuchs sexually \u201ccorrupted\u201d girls and boys, respectively, and hired them out as child prostitutes. British administrators proposed to register and remove children who resided with prostitutes and eunuchs and to appoint \u201crespectable\u201d guardians. In India, unlike Australia, the removal of children was not a general technique of colonial governance. These projects for the removal and reform of children who lived in brothels and with eunuchs were thus somewhat unusual colonial attempts at child rescue. Although a small number of children living with eunuchs were removed under the Part II of the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, the proposal to register children who lived with prostitutes never eventuated. The proposed rescue of children in brothels and hijra households is a story of failed plans and small experiments. Yet this case study highlights the tensions and limits of government-directed child rescue projects in colonial India and illuminates the relationship between the colonial government and the missionary project.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35930996, "asset_id": 9748077, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12554041, "first_name": "Jessica", "last_name": "Hinchy", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "JessicaHinchy", "display_name": "Jessica Hinchy", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/JessicaHinchy?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12554041/3583056/19097470/s65_jessica.hinchy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26478193, "title": "China pak india nexus pdf.", "created_at": "2016-06-24T21:46:45.693-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26478193/China_pak_india_nexus_pdf?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_26478193", "summary": "While China's friendship with a number of countries has waxed and waned over the decades, Sino-Pak relationship is said to have withstood the vicissitudes of larger international politics as well as changes in regional and domestic currents. Pakistan, one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China, thus providing China with a corridor into the energy rich Muslim states which was reciprocated with a continual stream of no-strings-attached military hardware and defense-related assistance from Beijing. The joint enmity towards India also provided the initial thrust to a burgeoning Sino-Pak friendship. This paper intends to provide a profound analysis of the strategic relation between China-Pakistan and examine India as a determining factor. The Pakistan-China strategic relationship has been conventionally viewed by India as a zero sum game, wherein any gains accrued by Pakistan or China through their partnership is seen as a direct detriment to the evolution of India-Pakistan or India-China relation. The paper evaluates various factors which were crucial for the synthesis of such a strong relation and presents a comprehensive study of the various policies and programs that have been undertaken by the two countries to tie India to South Asia and reduce its sphere of influence. The geographic dynamics is said to breed a natural coalition, dominating the strategic ambitions of both Beijing and Islamabad hence directing their relationship. In addition to the obvious geopolitical factors, there are several dense collaborations between the two nations knitting a relatively close partnership. Moreover an attempt has been made to assess the irritants in China-Pak relations and the initiatives taken by the two to further strengthen it. Current trends in diplomatic, economic and defense cooperation \u2013 along with the staunch affinity rooted in history and consistent geo-strategic interests \u2013 points to a strong and strengthening relationship, significant in directing India's foreign and security policies. This paper seeks to analyze the changing power dynamics of the China-Pak nexus with external actors such as US and India with an ulterior motive of their own and predict the change in power dynamics between the four countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46773324, "asset_id": 26478193, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26342598, "first_name": "Riddhi", "last_name": "Chopra", "domain_name": "ipmg", "page_name": "RiddhiChopra", "display_name": "Riddhi Chopra", "profile_url": "https://ipmg.academia.edu/RiddhiChopra?f_ri=3558", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26342598/7286213/19443711/s65_riddhi.chopra.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=3558", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60924, "name": "Indian foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_foreign_policy?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 120188, "name": "Pakistan - China Relation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_-_China_Relation?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 121162, "name": "India-China relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India-China_relations?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1103882, "name": "String of Pearls", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/String_of_Pearls?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 1378827, "name": "PAKISTAN-CHINA NEXUS AND ITS SECRUTY IMPLICATIONS TO INDIA", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PAKISTAN-CHINA_NEXUS_AND_ITS_SECRUTY_IMPLICATIONS_TO_INDIA?f_ri=3558"}, {"id": 2030532, "name": "China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_Pakistan_Economic_Corridor_CPEC_?f_ri=3558"}]}, {"id": 15725046, "title": "Changes in Late Anglo-Indian Phraseology", "created_at": "2015-09-15T06:56:41.858-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15725046/Changes_in_Late_Anglo_Indian_Phraseology?f_ri=3558", "dom_id": "work_15725046", "summary": "Anglo-\u00ad\u2010\u2011Indian loan vocabulary is reflective of a slow evolutionary process spanning more than two centuries of linguistic exchange between two very diverse cultures. The last period was one of a self-\u00ad\u2010\u2011imposed isolation of the British ruling class, when the gulf between the rulers and the native population was the widest. The British minority were intent on preserving their identity. As a result the Anglo-\u00ad\u2010\u2011Indian community became a tight-\u00ad\u2010\u2011knit, artificial social group. Against this background, Anglo-\u00ad\u2010\u2011Indian words started reflecting the changing attitude of the \u2018Sahibs\u2019. Although fewer new words were borrowed in the nineteenth century than in the earlier times, the existing loan words were used in novel ways, often as hybrid-\u00ad\u2010\u2011combinative structures. Some English words and phrases developed into Anglo-\u00ad\u2010\u2011Indian idioms, adding a contextual richness to period records and became distinctly condensed codes of experience of the ruling community. It is of a significant socio-\u00ad\u2010\u2011linguistic importance that the later developments in the Anglo Indian vocabulary be acknowledged for a fuller understanding of the intricacies of historic and literary texts.

As a result, this monograph analyzes the current security challenges in Asia in its broader i.e. Indo\u2013Pacific meaning, aiming at capturing major shifts in the balance of power which involve regional actors. Through the lenses of IR theory, we have sought to provide insights into the consequences of the transition of power from the United States to China. By presenting case studies of regional security challenges from a multidimensional perspective, we analyze both the stages of the maturity of powers and their satisfaction within the existing system. Therefore we find it significant to discuss the role of regional actors who are hedging their bets between the United States and China, as well as different security dimensions and problems reshaping

Some Reflections on the Politics of Beauty and Body Shapes' in Aesthetic Labour: Rethinking Beauty Politics in Neoliberalism, ed by\nRosalind Gill, Christina Scharff, and Ana Sofia Elias, London: Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nThis chapter examines some negotiations that self-identified feminist women with daughters engage in the process of mothering. It draws on research conducted in the early 21st century among educated, upper middle class, urban women and asks what it means to be a feminist mother in post-globalisation India.
