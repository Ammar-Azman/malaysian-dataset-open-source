This paper focuses on the Babas and Nyonyas of Chinese descent,  and seeks to deconstruct presentist notions and definition of \u201cPeranakan.\u201d Also known as the \u201cStraits Chinese,\u201d as many Babas and Nyonyas lived on the Straits Settlements, \u201cPeranakan\u201d was chosen to contest the geography of cultural identity. \n\nResearch on the Peranakans is largely based on The Straits Chinese Magazine  (1897-1907). By comparing it with other English and Romanised-Malay publications, this paper questions if Peranakans have always been as Anglicised as perceived to be. Academic attention on the SCM and the Straits Chinese Reform Movement has led to a domination of the Straits Chinese British Association dominating historiographical impressions of \u201cPeranakan\u201d socio-political identity.\n\nBesides the mixture of languages used, Chinese classics and English literature were adapted in these texts. Debates found in these texts ranged from the opium debate, gambling, to schooling. Schools were an avenue for the Methodist movement, \u201cAnglicization,\u201d and socio-economic improvement. The backdrop for these debates was the 1911 Chinese Republican movement that revitalised debates on \u201cChineseness,\u201d strong Victorian-English pride, and the development of writing and translation in the Malay literary sphere. Using the long-running theme of what was \u201cproper\u201d behaviour amongst the Nyonyas, this paper seeks to argue that Peranakan cultural identity was ever-changing. An attempt to \u2018define\u2019 Peranakan culture would be redundant and historicist as it fixates what Peranakan culture is today, rather than recognizing its organic form.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47622537, "asset_id": 27367843, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28498921, "first_name": "Shin Mun", "last_name": "Ng", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "ShinMunNg", "display_name": "Shin Mun  Ng", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/ShinMunNg?f_ri=225333", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28498921/9831947/10957309/s65_shin_mun.ng.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 7543, "name": "Modern British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_British_History?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 225333, "name": "Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaya?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 310595, "name": "Peranakan Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_Culture?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 886587, "name": "Peranakan In Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan_In_Singapore?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 968791, "name": "Straits of Malacca", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_of_Malacca?f_ri=225333"}]}, {"id": 32232954, "title": "The Forgotten Jewish community in Penang \r\nJews of British Malaya", "created_at": "2017-04-03T18:05:13.169-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32232954/The_Forgotten_Jewish_community_in_Penang_Jews_of_British_Malaya?f_ri=225333", "dom_id": "work_32232954", "summary": "The story of the Jewish community in Penang has hitherto remained hidden within the footnotes of local history, known only to the few who have been acquainted with its past due to hatred, radical racist ideology and persecution by the dictatorship government passed down to the new generation. \n\nSadly enough the Gaza-Israeli war is barely political cause and yet being politicize and canonized as religious war.

They make up our most powerful memories. The school experience is like an enjoyable and exhilarating boot camp that helps prepare us for adulthood. School is where we discover our talents and develop our interests. It is where friendships are formed and leaders nurtured. It is perhaps where we even met our first love. \n\nAs Singapore crossed into the 21st century, the education system too evolved, moving in tandem with the changing needs of society, shifting attitudes, new mindsets and focus. With technological advancements, school infrastructure is enhanced and redeveloped. Although many of our pre-independence schools are no more, the lived experiences of pupils who call them alma mater are by no means easily erased or diminished from their memories. Two of these schools were named in honour of Southeast Asia\u2019s historic personalities: Sang Nila Utama (the founder of Singapura) and Tun Seri Lanang (Grand Vizier and esteemed literary figure). These premier secondary schools paved the way for pupils in the Malay stream to pursue a fulfilling secondary education, something which they would not otherwise have been able to do for want of resources. In fact, these schools were so outstanding that they attracted top students from Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei to study in Singapore. \n\nThis is the story of Singapore\u2019s last Malay schools.\n\nISBN 978-981-14-3298-9\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67360778, "asset_id": 48967758, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 446951, "first_name": "Hidayah", "last_name": "Amin", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "HidayahAmin", "display_name": "Hidayah Amin", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/HidayahAmin?f_ri=225333", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/446951/144735/49987227/s65_hidayah.amin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22198, "name": "Secondary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secondary_Education?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 225333, "name": "Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaya?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 319000, "name": "Education System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_System?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 3978877, "name": "Malay Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Schools?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 3978878, "name": "Sang Nila Utama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sang_Nila_Utama?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 3978879, "name": "Tun Seri Lanang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tun_Seri_Lanang?f_ri=225333"}]}, {"id": 74484019, "title": "Malezya\u2019da \u0130slami \u0130limler Alan\u0131ndaki Akademik Dergilerden Journal Afkar\u2019\u0131n \u0130ngilizce ve Arap\u00e7a Makalelerinin Bibliyografik Taramas\u0131", "created_at": "2022-03-24T11:50:36.576-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74484019/Malezya_da_%C4%B0slami_%C4%B0limler_Alan%C4%B1ndaki_Akademik_Dergilerden_Journal_Afkar_%C4%B1n_%C4%B0ngilizce_ve_Arap%C3%A7a_Makalelerinin_Bibliyografik_Taramas%C4%B1?f_ri=225333", "dom_id": "work_74484019", "summary": "It is possible with a qualified literature review that researchers who make studies in a particular branch of science can have a panoramic view of the study area. Literature reviews are important for the successful conclusion of the research adventure, as the knowledge of what is written in the field will give clues about what can be written. Bibliographies are the most practical way of looking at the general studies on the field. Bibliographic efforts virtually map the field of study and assist the researcher in their progress. In this study, a general introduction will be made about the Malaysian theology/Islamic studies journals. The assumption of this study is that the topics that will attract the attention of Turkish researchers may have been discussed in these journals and that findings that could serve as a source for new studies have been reached. With this article, it is aimed that a literature review in the field of Islamic studies will also include Malaysian theology journals, and it is hoped that such a study will contribute to the originality of new studies. In the study, it was aimed to put a map of Malaysian origin studies in front of those who do academic research in the field of Islamic studies. It has been noticed that there are highly qualified international journals in terms of Islamic studies in Malaysia, which is quite far from our country in terms of geography and culture, and the bibliography information of the English and Arabic articles published by Journal Afkar, which stands out with its prestige among these journals, are listed chronologically with their Turkish translations. Although Journal Afkar is the academic publication of the University of Malaya, it accepts at least one-third of English and Arabic publications. In the introduction, information about the importance of literature review was given, and then a brief introduction was made about the academic journals in Malaysia in the field of Islamic studies scanned by ESCI and AHCI indexes. It has been observed that there is a remarkable intensity of comparative studies in English and Arabic articles published in the journal. It has been noted that Malay researchers have a tendency to bring together the different interpretations of Islamic scholars with different sectarian views on a single subject.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82620711, "asset_id": 74484019, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40739210, "first_name": "Do\u00e7.

Through these methods, it was found that Tok Ku Paloh employed the methods of teachings and writings as one of the forms of Jihad in injecting and instilling as well as strengthening the religious belief amongst the Pahang fighters. Once the religious belief had been strengthened and appreciated, he then shouted the slogan of Jihad Sabil at the second series of the struggle.

Their main purpose was to dominate the field of journalism and press printing to gather people's support in their war campaigns. The government also exploited newspapers and magazines to obtain cooperation from people in all plans they wished to implement. To dominate the field of journalism, MMA had instructed that all efforts related to the publication must obtain prior authorization. Although the printed media in Malaya then was made the propaganda tool by the Japanese administrators, the Look-To-The-East idea was propogated through various newspapers and magazines such as Berita Malai, Semangat Asia and Fajar Asia. This study explores the existence of the Look-To-The-East idea that can be found in Fajar Asia magazine.

I pay special attention to changes in the crop's perceived food value during the inter-war years, a facet overlooked by earlier scholarship. Five different migrant groups in Malaya - planter households, Asian cooks, colonial officials, government chemists, and estate labourers - played critical roles in transforming palm oil into a crop purely for industrial purposes, rather than subsistence. The peculiarities of Malaya's social context are further sharpened by comparisons with Latin America and West Africa, where different groups of migrants propagated the oil palm's subsistence cultures,

Forum re-printed by Today.\nFull disclosure: Please note some changes from the original apart from the title.\n___________\n\"Beijing apparently snubbed Singapore by not inviting its prime minister to the inaugural Belt and Road Forum. \" - Original\n\"Beijing did not invite Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to the inaugural Belt and Road Forum, prompting speculation as to whether it was a deliberate snub.\" - edits by Today.\n____________\n\"Indeed, Singapore may have to accept \u2018Finlandisation\u2019 in the face of Chinese regional primacy, deferring to China on all foreign policy but keeping nominal independence. This is arguably already happening with some of its ASEAN neighbours. Under such an arrangement, Singapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be in the hands of Beijing\u2019s largesse.\" - Original\n\"One risk of Chinese dominance for Singapore over time is Finlandisation, even if many find this option unpalatable.\nSingapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be subject to Beijing\u2019s largesse; Singapore would have to defer to China under such an arrangement. The concept comes from Finland\u2019s relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, in which Helsinki kept all the formal trappings of sovereignty, but submitted to Moscow\u2019s preferences on foreign and security policy.\nSovereignty is not a dichotomous quality \u2014 it can be parsed into different components, each to varying degrees. Finlandisation is arguably already happening in South-east Asia at some level, given China\u2019s growing regional dominance.\"\n\nPlease find a link to the full piece on Today here:

"summary": "Decolonisation often involved picking from competing nationalist visions for the shape of the postcolonial nation-state. The visions which lost out are no less important for their impact on decolonisation and the nation-state, but they are often poorly understood. In Singapore, the rise of Singapore\u2019s progressive left gave the opportunity and drove the timing for the merger of Federation of Malaya and Singapore in 1963, before its leadership was removed by Operation Coldstore. However, the nature of the progressive left \u2013 their values, motivations, and goals \u2013 has never been adequately understood. It is usually attributed to some degree of Communist subversion, and Operation Coldstore presented as the solution to a security problem. Using vernacular sources and newly declassified documents, this article analyses Singapore\u2019s progressive left. It deconstructs the origin of the progressive left as a generational unit, reconceptualises the events of merger from their perspective, and re- evaluates their role and impact on the process of merger. In resituating the progressive left in the narrative of merger, it expands our understanding of Singapore\u2019s decolonisation.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 380793, "first_name": "Pingtjin", "last_name": "Thum", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "PingtjinThum", "display_name": "Pingtjin Thum", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/PingtjinThum?f_ri=225333", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/380793/118176/2411453/s65_pingtjin.thum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=225333", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 225333, "name": "Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaya?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 614845, "name": "Singapore Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Political_History?f_ri=225333"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=225333"}]}, {"id": 654523, "title": "Inventing Malayanness: Race, Education and Englishness in Colonial Malaya", "created_at": "2011-06-09T03:59:08.358-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/654523/Inventing_Malayanness_Race_Education_and_Englishness_in_Colonial_Malaya?f_ri=225333", "dom_id": "work_654523", "summary": "This dissertation focuses on late nineteenth and twentieth century Orientalized representations of British Malaya in the work of Joseph Conrad, Somerset Maugham and Anthony Burgess.

The setting for writing was from 1905 when the Straits and Federated Malay States Government opened the medical school in Singapore, till 1957 when Malaya gained its independence (Merdeka). However, a few doctors were born before the turn of the 19th Century (late 1800s). Their fathers either came to Malaya or Singapore or they were born in Malaya or Singapore.
