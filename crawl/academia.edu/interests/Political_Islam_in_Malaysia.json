Even though Iran has reversed by Islamic revolution Malaysia is on a speedy downhill towards secular self annihilation. What can we generalize about the Muslim political and social landscape from Malaysian analysis? We can establish the following observations: a) Muslims are disunited on petty feuds, envy, jealousy and greed. b) Muslim societies are existing on major sins and Allah's mercy is withheld from them as per the proclamations in various Hadiths c) The Muslim political and social landscape is dominated by hypocrites and hostile infidels who do tahreef (twisting) of Islamic texts to marginalize Islam and realize major sins. d) Muslim psychology is being designed to accept a sinful society as normal and to make sins light. e) Muslim psychology is being engineered to abandon jihad. f) Muslim legal systems are being actively sustained to reject the Islamic legal system and Islamic philosophical, judicial, and logical protocols. g) Muslims have no strong intellectual defense against liberalism, even though liberalism is intellectually weak. h) Muslims have no long term plan to fight for Islamic revival.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 94753119, "asset_id": 66831880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 65477450, "first_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr", "last_name": "Rahman", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "MohammadMushfequrRahman", "display_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr Rahman", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/MohammadMushfequrRahman?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/65477450/17054831/63991740/s65_mohammad_mushfequr.rahman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 153914, "name": "Malaysia education system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_education_system?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 301193, "name": "Malaysian Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Law?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 403234, "name": "History of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 36662927, "title": "Islamisme dan Bahananya: Cabaran Besar Politik Malaysia Abad Ke-21 (Islamism and its Discontents: A Major Challenge to Twenty-first Century Malaysian Politics), Siri Syarahan Umum Pelantikan Profesor (Penang: Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018).", "created_at": "2018-05-18T03:28:55.207-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36662927/Islamisme_dan_Bahananya_Cabaran_Besar_Politik_Malaysia_Abad_Ke_21_Islamism_and_its_Discontents_A_Major_Challenge_to_Twenty_first_Century_Malaysian_Politics_Siri_Syarahan_Umum_Pelantikan_Profesor_Penang_Penerbit_Universiti_Sains_Malaysia_2018_?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_36662927", "summary": "Syarahan ini menyelusuri perkembangan perbahasan dan wacana tentang Islam dan kedinamikan politiknya dalam masa enam puluh tahun (1957-2017), yakni semenjak Malaysia mencapai kemerdekaan sebagai sebuah entiti berdaulat dengan cita-cita untuk mendirikan sebuah negara bangsa. Elemen yang sangat penting dalam wacana ini ialah kedudukan rasmi Islam sebagai \u2018agama persekutuan\u2019 dalam Perlembagaan Persekutuan Malaysia dan pada masa yang sama memberi jaminan kebebasan beragama kepda agama-agama lain yang dianuti oleh hampir empat puluh peratus daripada jumlah penduduk Malaysia. Wajah demografi Malaysia menjadi semakin rencam dari sudut etnik dan agama dengan kemasukan Sabah, Sarawak, Singapura bersama Malaya ke dalam Persekutuan Malaysia pada 16 September 1963. Berkait rapat dengan wacana \u2018Islam politik\u2019 atau \u2018Islamisme\u2019 di Malaysia ialah konsep-konsep \u2018agama\u2019 dan \u2018sekularisme\u2019 yang saling berinteraksi dan mengalami evolusi makna sebagai lanjutan daripada perbahasan umum yang melibatkan pelbagai pihak seperti para sarjana, ahli politik, birokrat, ulama, aktivis sosial, pengamal media dan pengkomentar media sosial. Hujahan yang dikemukakan di sini ialah makna \u2018Islam\u2019 yang difahami oleh pemegang-pemegang taruh (stakeholders) telah mengalami perubahan pesat hasil daripada interaksi aktif semua pihak berkepentingan termasuk organ-organ negara dan masyarakat sivil dengan Islam. \u2018Islam\u2019 dalam Artikel 3 (1) Perlembagaan Persekutuan pada 31 Ogos 1957 tidak lagi sama kefahamannya dengan \u2018Islam\u2019 dalam dokumen yang sama pada tahun 2017. \u2018Islam\u2019 dan \u2018Islamisme\u2019 berhadapan dengan konflik atau percampuran maksud. Pergolakan politik yang dialami Malaysia semenjak tiga dekad kebelakangan ini, iaitu sejak kesan kebangkitan Islam menampakkan impaknya dalam landskap politik, ekonomi dan sosial. Situasi ini boleh dikesan susur galurnya kepada kefahaman keagamaan yang lebih tegar yang menggariskan sempadan ketat tentang apa yang disifatkan sebagai \u2018Islamik\u2019 berbanding apa yang \u2018tidak Islamik.\u2019 Kemasukan elemen tegar dalam wacana Islamisme ini diarus perdanakan di bawah projek-projek Islamisasi pemerintah, dengan reaksi-reaksi berbeza daripada pelbagai kelompok masyarakat. Penularan elemen tegar dalam dasar Islamisasi yang diabsahkan melalui kerangka politik rasmi membawa implikasi mendalam kepda politik Malaysia dalam arena hubungan Muslim dengan bukan Muslim, malahan antara sesama Muslim yang berbeza corak pemikiran dari aliran arus perdana.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56596577, "asset_id": 36662927, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 540, "name": "Islamic Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Law?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 5674, "name": "Islamic Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Philosophy?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 16171, "name": "Islamic Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Political_Thought?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 25399, "name": "Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 45019, "name": "Islamic Movements and Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movements_and_Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 403575, "name": "Pendidikan Agama Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pendidikan_Agama_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 469642, "name": "Jihadism and Radical Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jihadism_and_Radical_Islamism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 638772, "name": "Islamist Political Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_Political_Parties?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 734186, "name": "Islamism & Post-Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism_and_Post-Islamism?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 60559324, "title": "Political and Legal System of Islam", "created_at": "2021-10-31T08:10:41.867-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/60559324/Political_and_Legal_System_of_Islam?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_60559324", "summary": "Political and Legal System of Islam gives a broad and indepth view of Islamic governance and legal system on which further Islamic developments can be achieved.

The purpose of this paper is to explain how first of these three could be used to revive Islam among Muslims in Muslim majority countries. The discussion has been analytical in nature while applying psychological principles and theories from a wide range of psychological studies to understand and design Islamic revival. The paper focuses on five core psychological and psychosocial areas: early childhood development, adulthood, social relationship, marriage and unity. These are crucial foundations for any people, society and it's worldview and even more so for Muslims and Islamic revival. The readers must not in anyway, get the idea that this paper proposes Islam vs West conflict, rather the paper establishes the uniqueness and independence of the Islamic society through the Islamic religion while revealing Islam as a broader system. The paper truly establishes human diversity on independent values and laws through Islam as an example. The paper reveals that psychology is a workable science and not just theory and as such Muslim psychologists should continue to study and use psychology to evolve and mature the Islamic self-concept, Islamic conscience and Islamic society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 96767158, "asset_id": 67640847, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 65477450, "first_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr", "last_name": "Rahman", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "MohammadMushfequrRahman", "display_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr Rahman", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/MohammadMushfequrRahman?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/65477450/17054831/63991740/s65_mohammad_mushfequr.rahman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 223, "name": "Applied Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Psychology?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 236, "name": "Cognitive Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Psychology?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 248, "name": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 252, "name": "Developmental Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Developmental_Psychology?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 13132, "name": "Social Developmental Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Developmental_Psychology?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 14705, "name": "Islamic Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Psychology?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 153914, "name": "Malaysia education system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_education_system?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 330987, "name": "Islamic psychology Vs modern psychology comparative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_psychology_Vs_modern_psychology_comparative?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 45251176, "title": "Political Islam: Theory and Function", "created_at": "2021-02-28T05:37:33.434-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45251176/Political_Islam_Theory_and_Function?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_45251176", "summary": "Islam is a political religion as evidenced from the five pillars of Islam as Sunni brothers have accepted.

Operating within a newly formed organization, the Pertubuhan IlmuwanMalaysia (ILMU) and the newly augmented United Malays National\r\nOrganization\u2019s (UMNO) young ulama wing, Salafi scholars play a key role in providing Islamic legitimacy to the government and defending it against the opposition Islamist party, the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). The decision by Salafi scholars to support the Malaysian government is striking given their hardline views on the implementation of Islamic laws and their opposition to democracy. This paper seeks to understand the reasons for the Salafi ulama\u2019s support for UMNO. It argues that the Salafi ulama\u2019s involvement in UMNO is due to a convergence of interest between the two groups and as part of a strategy by the Salafi ulama to expand their influence at both the state and societal levels. The paper examines the religious-political positions of the Salafi ulama on issues such as the Islamic state, the implementation of Islamic laws and democratic political system, and argues that they are opposed to the current state of religious affairs and the political structure of the Malaysian state. Nevertheless, the\r\nulama are working within UMNO to change the political system. For  UMNO leaders, the Salafi ulama form an important group that could defend the party against religious attacks from PAS and provide the party with greater religious credence.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36226672, "asset_id": 10107039, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 245699, "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Nawab", "domain_name": "berkeley", "page_name": "MohamedNawab", "display_name": "Mohamed Nawab", "profile_url": "https://berkeley.academia.edu/MohamedNawab?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/245699/262590/310283/s65_mohamed.nawab.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88513, "name": "Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafism?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 110268, "name": "Salafi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafi?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 169060, "name": "Salafi-Jihadi Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafi-Jihadi_Ideology?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 252364, "name": "Contemporary Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Salafism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 393006, "name": "Islamic Party of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Party_of_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 640416, "name": "Islam In Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_In_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 38543574, "title": "The Islamist Factor in Malaysia's Fourteenth General Elections, The Round Table, vol. 107, no. 6 (2018), pp. 683-701.", "created_at": "2019-03-13T06:33:10.233-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38543574/The_Islamist_Factor_in_Malaysias_Fourteenth_General_Elections_The_Round_Table_vol_107_no_6_2018_pp_683_701?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_38543574", "summary": "Malaysia\u2019s 14th general election witnessed three different yet related Islamist models offered by three competing coalitions, namely the Barisan Nasional (BN) headed by Prime Minister Najib Razak, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) led by former Premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad, and the Gagasan Sejahtera led by Haji Abdul Hadi Awang of the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS).

A crucial element in this discourse is the official position of Islam as the \u201creligion of the federation\u201d in the\nMalaysian Constitution, which simultaneously guarantees the freedom of other religions embraced by almost half of the country\u2019s population. The population became even more diverse ethnically and religiously upon the formation of the Federation of Malaysia, which replaced Malaya, on September 16, 1963. Closely related to the discourse of political Islam in Malaysia, the evolving concepts of \u201creligion\u201d and \u201csecularism\u201d in Malaysia\u2019s Islamic context have undergone considerable shifts as a result of constant public engagement by an assortment of politicians, commentators, scholars, bureaucrats, and civil society activists. As the argument develops, Malaysia\u2019s interaction with Islam has been essentialized by political interests such that boundaries are hardened between what is considered Islamic and un-Islamic. The increasingly rigid positions adopted by Islamic stakeholders have arguably worsened both interreligious and intra-Muslim relations, with progressive Muslim voices increasingly finding themselves marginalized in the state-controlled political environment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58083643, "asset_id": 38059065, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Its lack of success was significantly due to the rise of Islamist conservatives, who deliberately interpreted Islam Hadhari as a political instrument to impose Islamization from above in a manner not conducive to living in a spirit of peaceful coexistence in a multi-ethnic society. While on the one hand it promoted an Islam that cherishes the values of inclusivity, moderation and inter-religious tolerance, on the other hand Islam Hadhari unfortunately triggered defensive responses from Islamist conservatives. This ad hoc conservative alliance comprised religious leaders associated with the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), state religious functionaries, scholars affiliated to the opposition Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS: Parti Islam SeMalaysia) and Islamist non-governmental organizations. The rise of this Islamist conservatism aggravated ethno-religious relations during Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\u2019s premiership, leading to the setbacks experienced by his government in the general elections of 2008. By then, the death knell had been sounded for Islam Hadhari.

Such an eventuality poses a grave threat to the pluralistic landscape of Southeast Asian societies. Surveys over the past few years have worryingly indicated a rise in the level of extremist tendencies among Southeast Asian Muslims, albeit these tendencies are still at a comparatively low level. The internalization since the 1970s of the Wahhabi brand of Salafism among Southeast Asian Muslims is the major factor behind this apparent shift towards a more radical worldview. The relatively low level of concern over rising Islamist extremism among Indonesian and Malaysian Muslims indicates a worrying institutionalization of radical interpretations of Islam in the general Islamic landscape of both countries. Countering Salafization is rendered difficult by the fact that influential Muslim personalities and elements within Muslim-majority states have themselves embraced aspects of Wahhabism. Between Wahhabism and ISIS, which is but its violent manifestation, lies a short and slippery slope.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45658130, "asset_id": 25357558, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1660, "name": "Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1720, "name": "International Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Terrorism?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4979, "name": "Islamic Contemporary Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Contemporary_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5686, "name": "Political Violence and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence_and_Terrorism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 5847, "name": "Political Extremism/Radicalism/Populism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Extremism_Radicalism_Populism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 8284, "name": "History of Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Terrorism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 11336, "name": "Cyber Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyber_Terrorism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 26669, "name": "Counter terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counter_terrorism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 37193, "name": "Islam in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Indonesia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 80195, "name": "Salafi-jihadist groups", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafi-jihadist_groups?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 88513, "name": "Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 95854, "name": "Critical Terrorism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Terrorism_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 162527, "name": "Wahhabism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wahhabism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 260218, "name": "Wahabi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wahabi?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 397817, "name": "Islamist movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_movements?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 597977, "name": "Religion and Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Terrorism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 761870, "name": "Terrorism and Counterterrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terrorism_and_Counterterrorism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 1002993, "name": "Islamic Terrorism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Terrorism?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 28566722, "title": "\"When 'PAS is HAMAS' and 'UMNO acts like Israel' - Localized Appropriations of the Palestine Conflict in Malaysia\", in Petru, Tomas (ed.)

Malaysia on 16 September 1963. Since then, political stakeholders have not shied away from making the most of Islamic symbols, practices and institutions towards achieving national economic development or regime maintenance. Driven by hegemonic considerations, they largely ignored intra-Muslim religious variations. The religious uniformity of Malays, all of whom were Muslims by law, were literally taken for granted and served as a politically expedient vehicle for Islamic-based political mobilization by the Malay-dominated regime. Pluralist conceptions of Malaysian society were accepted only insofar as they pertain to Muslim-non-Muslim distinctions. At the core of the government's efforts to infuse the Malaysian polity with Islamic alternatives for socio-political arrangements is a gradual process of syariahization. However, owing to arbitrary interpretations of the syariah (Islamic law) by Malaysia's official Islamic gatekeepers, syariahization resulted in state-manufactured denial of freedom of religious expression to non-conformist Malay-Muslims. Until today, Muslim non-conformists are not allowed to adopt, let alone to propagate, different forms of Islam that run afoul of the version upheld by an officially sanctioned version of the syariah. As reflected by the case of the Sufi-inspired Darul Arqam movement, government-imposed syariahization has resulted in the violation of fundamental human rights of Malay-Muslims, regardless of the fact that the syariah itself may not have been clear-cut in determining the boundaries between religious orthodoxy and unorthodoxy in prescribing punishments for dissent.", "downloadable_attachments":

authority but rather always saw It as a tool. Since the first monarchy in Islam, as established by Muwaiyah and Yazid by usurpation and massacre, Islam came to be under the firm grip of tyrannical royalties. Over a long period, the Muslim Arab monarchies resulted in the reemergence of the tribalistic leadership in Prophetic Arabia known as Sheikhdom which has also maintained the core features of royalty. Colonial European powers supported the royalties and their respective Arab jurisdictions creating modern gulf states. So modern Arab states of Gulf thus in no way represent an Islamic creation neither in maps nor in political structure but Islam remains as a symbol. Arab royalties being a product of European colonialism and current American neocolonialism have acquired an unIslamic western psychology more than an Islamic one. Of course, no western political academic will study these royalties in this perspective because it does not suit their interests, but it is paramount for Muslims to understand the misguidance of their rulers. This psychological unfiltered unchecked western inclination can be seen in their personal lives, in their spending, economic, foreign and cultural policies. The following discussions will focus on their westernized psychology and how this has been destroying Islam and Muslim Islamic development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76368628, "asset_id": 61419652, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 65477450, "first_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr", "last_name": "Rahman", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "MohammadMushfequrRahman", "display_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr Rahman", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/MohammadMushfequrRahman?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/65477450/17054831/63991740/s65_mohammad_mushfequr.rahman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2714, "name": "Gulf Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gulf_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16171, "name": "Islamic Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Political_Thought?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24585, "name": "Political Islam in Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Turkey?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40114, "name": "Muslim Brotherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Brotherhood?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41658, "name": "Foreign Policy of Saudi Arabia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Policy_of_Saudi_Arabia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 52211, "name": "United Arab Emirates", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Arab_Emirates?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 52385, "name": "Uyghurs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uyghurs?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 83981, "name": "Arabian/Persian Gulf Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arabian_Persian_Gulf_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 105460, "name": "Iranian Islamic Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_Islamic_Revolution?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 119922, "name": "Iranian politics and history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranian_politics_and_history?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 216864, "name": "Islamic Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Revolution?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 362278, "name": "Kashmir Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kashmir_Conflict?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 560987, "name": "Imam Khomeini", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imam_Khomeini?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 30228984, "title": "The Islamic conservative turn in Malaysia: Impact and Future Trajectories", "created_at": "2016-12-03T00:16:48.387-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30228984/The_Islamic_conservative_turn_in_Malaysia_Impact_and_Future_Trajectories?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_30228984", "summary": "In contrast to the allegedly puritan, \u2018intolerant\u2019 Islam practiced in the Middle East, Islam in Malaysia has always been portrayed especially in Western media as rather moderate.

The transfer of power from the Islamic-educated Abdullah Badawi to the Western-educated Najib Razak in April 2009 raised the instrumentalization of Islamic education as a political tool. The Malaysian government has undermined the civilizational qualities of a strand of moderate Islam, even as the government claims to uphold it under the tagline of wasatiyyah in many international meetings.

Diharap tulisan ini menjadi titik tolak penambahbaikan berterusan supaya IPZ terus\nmaju demi kebaikan ummah Islam di Malaysia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51524321, "asset_id": 31089527, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13064071, "first_name": "Muhsin", "last_name": "Nor Paizin", "domain_name": "zakat", "page_name": "MuhsinNorPaizin", "display_name": "Muhsin Nor Paizin", "profile_url": "https://zakat.academia.edu/MuhsinNorPaizin?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13064071/4585127/43860869/s65_muhsin.nor_paizin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34496, "name": "Zakat Accounting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakat_Accounting?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89075, "name": "Zakat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakat?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90653, "name": "Islamic Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Management?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 92942, "name": "Laws of Zakah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laws_of_Zakah?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 138101, "name": "Zakah Accounting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakah_Accounting?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 161135, "name": "islamic accounting, zakat, Shariah audit, islamic banking and finance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/islamic_accounting_zakat_Shariah_audit_islamic_banking_and_finance?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 243168, "name": "Teori Pengurusan Dan Pentadbiran", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teori_Pengurusan_Dan_Pentadbiran?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 268764, "name": "Zakat on Income", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakat_on_Income?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 282466, "name": "Mengkaji Mengenai Pendekatan Pengurusan Sumber Manusia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mengkaji_Mengenai_Pendekatan_Pengurusan_Sumber_Manusia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 394333, "name": "Zakah in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakah_in_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 413308, "name": "The Effect of Zakat Payment on Finance Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Effect_of_Zakat_Payment_on_Finance_Performance?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 443528, "name": "Zakat and Taxation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakat_and_Taxation?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 631297, "name": "Zakat on Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zakat_on_Business?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 34897819, "title": "Gerakan Islam Dalam Pilihan Raya Umum ke-13 (Islamic Movements in the 13th General Elections), in Mohamad Takiyuddin Ismail and Sity Daud (eds.), Pilihan Raya Umum ke-13: Refleksi Politik Perubahan (Bangi: UKM Press, 2016), pp. 125-144.", "created_at": "2017-10-19T05:27:07.667-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34897819/Gerakan_Islam_Dalam_Pilihan_Raya_Umum_ke_13_Islamic_Movements_in_the_13th_General_Elections_in_Mohamad_Takiyuddin_Ismail_and_Sity_Daud_eds_Pilihan_Raya_Umum_ke_13_Refleksi_Politik_Perubahan_Bangi_UKM_Press_2016_pp_125_144?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_34897819", "summary": "Penulisan ini akan memberi tumpuan kepada gerakan Islam yang merangkumi NGO Islam atau dakwah yang merupakan antara yang terawal memainkan peranan dalam masyarakat sivil pasca merdeka.

Banned in 1994, Arqam members survived state repression by reconfiguring themselves as successful businessmen operating under the banner of Global Ikhwan, whose steady expansion outlived the demise of its controversial chairman, Ashaari Muhammad, in May 2010. Spreading its wings transnationally even to Haramayn\u2014the hub of Islamic worship in Saudi Arabia\u2014Global Ikhwan was distinctively helmed by a woman, Khadijah Aam, one of Ashaari's widows. An analysis of the business experience of Global Ikhwan adds a fresh perspective to understanding Muslim economic norms. Global Ikhwan has carved out a philosophy for its members that is spiritual and traditional, yet at the same time enterprising and innovative. Global Ikhwan attributes its phenomenal success directly to its endeavour to apply Sufi doctrines to the economic realm, despite a common taxonomy of knowledge in Islam which discusses spirituality and business as if they were separate worlds. While Islam does outline moral guidelines for regulating business, whether intra-Muslim or between Muslims and non-Muslims, it has been unusual for the ulama or Muslim religious scholars and Muslim entrepreneurs to ascribe Muslim success in business to Islamic precepts, let alone Sufi principles. Global Ikhwan is an instructive exception.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53338150, "asset_id": 33269480, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

The concept of an \u2018Islamization policy\u2019 is contested, open to various interpretations since it is not officially defined in any government blueprint. This paper highlights the perspectives of a number of religious groups on Islamization policy. The study covered the period from 1981 until 2009, which includes the Mahathir Mohamed and Abdullah Ahmad Badawi administrations. Using a policy analysis lens, the paper focuses on the perspective of the groups regarding the idea of Islamization as a public policy; the meaning and status of Islamization policy. The patterns indicate that the views are more complex than just \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018against,\u2019 although the patterns of perception are based on two divergent views: those who support the policy (the proponents) and those who oppose it (the opponents). This diversity is significant in that it helps to provide a better understanding of some multi-religious perspectives towards Islamization policy, as well as highlighting the different interests and concerns of both Muslim and non-Muslim communities towards the policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47688623, "asset_id": 26390762, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

profiles four prominent detractors of Islam's politicisation in contemporary Malaysia. While much ink has been spilt profiling the promulgators of politicised Islam, whether in Malaysia or elsewhere, comparatively little has been written about those who oppose it. This article is a modest attempt to rectify that deficiency. It begins, however, with a brief history of that politicisation process as it has occurred in Malaysia, with particular reference to Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS) and Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (ABIM). This brief overview traces Malaysia's unique form of politicised Islam to late twentieth-century intercommunal tensions driven by Malay poverty and cultural anxiety. These enabled long-standing ethno-religious associations to facilitate a blending of Islamist ideology with issues surrounding Malay rights. It is within this context that we then examine the social and educational backgrounds, principal publications, records of activism, and ideological positions of four prominent critics of Malaysian Islam's politicisation, namely: Chandra Muzaffar, Zainah Anwar, Marina Mahathir, and Siti Kasim. The article concludes that all four figures differ from their counterparts in PAS and ABIM by possessing Western-orientated backgrounds, a long-standing dedication to multiculturalism, and a desire to orientate their work around human rights-based issues. The article concludes by suggesting how (or if) these detractors can impact the future direction of Malaysian politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67831384, "asset_id": 49490899, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1158737, "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Wain", "domain_name": "st-andrews", "page_name": "AlexanderWain", "display_name": "Alexander Wain", "profile_url": "https://st-andrews.academia.edu/AlexanderWain?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1158737/663557/15960198/s65_alexander.wain.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4979, "name": "Islamic Contemporary Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Contemporary_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9281, "name": "Pan-Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pan-Islamism?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16171, "name": "Islamic Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Political_Thought?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 16802, "name": "Islamic feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_feminism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 25399, "name": "Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 45019, "name": "Islamic Movements and Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movements_and_Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 788577, "name": "Parti Islam Semalaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parti_Islam_Semalaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 1918831, "name": "Sisters in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sisters_in_Islam?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 44800885, "title": "Secularized Self-Destructive World", "created_at": "2020-12-30T05:19:34.029-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44800885/Secularized_Self_Destructive_World?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_44800885", "summary": "Secularism is the worst thing happened to humans.

The relatively short time frame between BN\u2019s by-election wins and its historic electoral defeat in May 2018 convinced UMNO\u2019s leadership that its party recovery strategy was fruitful. This strategy entailed the forging of a political cooperation around the theme of Malay unity with its long-time Islamist rival, the Parti Islam Se Malaysia, and the instrumentalisation of Malay fears over the loss of constitutional birth rights under the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition government. A number of ethno-religious controversies at the national level also contributed to a polarised social and political context that exacerbated inter-ethnic distrust and benefitted BN in the by-elections. Both Malays and ethnic minorities perceived the PH\u2019s government\u2019s disjointed responses to these controversies as ineffectual. Malaysians across the ethnic divide also experienced little improvement on their cost of living woes. The PH government\u2019s attempts to boost the economy saw it re-establish large-scale projects with China. Yet the pragmatic realities of Malaysia\u2019s economic interests constrained its new foreign policy approach of positioning itself as a leader in the Muslim world. This was evident in Malaysia\u2019s muted response to China\u2019s treatment of the Uyghurs at the inaugural Kuala Lumpur Summit on Muslim issues. This contrasted with the organised protests by Malay groups at the Chinese embassy in the nation\u2019s capital as the year came to a close. These factors cumulatively contributed to an overall citizenry disillusionment with the PH government.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64001135, "asset_id": 43696798, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32519496, "first_name": "Saleena", "last_name": "Saleem", "domain_name": "liverpool", "page_name": "SaleenaSaleem", "display_name": "Saleena  Saleem", "profile_url": "https://liverpool.academia.edu/SaleenaSaleem?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32519496/11319359/12627903/s65_saleena.saleem.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1492, "name": "Racial and Ethnic Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_Ethnic_Politics?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 44894372, "title": "Injecting God into politics: Modelling Asma\u2019ul Husna as a Sufi-based panacea to political conflict in contemporary Malaysia, in Sarwar Alam (ed.), Cultural Fusion of Sufi Islam: Alternative Paths to Mystical Faith (London and New York: Routledge, 2020), pp. 201-227.", "created_at": "2021-01-13T02:04:35.499-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44894372/Injecting_God_into_politics_Modelling_Asma_ul_Husna_as_a_Sufi_based_panacea_to_political_conflict_in_contemporary_Malaysia_in_Sarwar_Alam_ed_Cultural_Fusion_of_Sufi_Islam_Alternative_Paths_to_Mystical_Faith_London_and_New_York_Routledge_2020_pp_201_227?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_44894372", "summary": "Since Malaysia\u2019s independence and emergence as a nation state, fierce political battles have characterized domestic competition between opposing forces vying to capture the hearts and minds of its citizens, both Muslim and non-Muslim.

years of the 1970s-80s, throughout their checkered experimentation in the realm of electoral politics. While admittedly encountering multiple challenges and failures, the overall scenario attests to the contributions made by Islamist civil society actors in widening democratic space in Malaysia, notwithstanding the gaps that continue to exist even among the different strands of Islamism. During the Thirteenth General Elections (GE13), apart from the participation of Islamists who have become part of mainstream political parties, new Islamist NGOs such as Hizb at-Tahrir (HT: Party of Liberation), Ikatan Muslimin Malaysia (ISMA: Muslim Solidarity Front) and the Islamic Renaissance Front (IRF) did not shy away from expressing their positions and views in political campaigns. Although hardcore support may be slow in coming, their presence in electoral politics threatens the legitimacy of fellow Islamists in the established Malay-Muslim political parties, which these new Islamists are inclined to perceive as having sold off to the vagaries, categories and structures of conventional political systems, deemed as unIslamic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56097655,

At ten, he saw a beheading in his backyard, he too, an accomplice. He roamed his village, sometimes barefoot, wading through streams, backyards of his neighbors\u2019 houses where young men were high, smoking ganja. He once saw a group of men in red headbands with Arabic words on them, ready to march to the capital city to slaughter many. He fought demons, cried when the family dog died battling a cobra. He saw men in a trance, munching on broken glasses and hibiscus petals, high on Javanese trancedance music, turning into horses. A spaceship landed on the school field. He thought he died, shot by Martians.\n\nHe was saved from being a Taliban. Saved by music of the American Hippies. He saw a boy who would be a jihadist later, in green robe and white turban, preaching jihad\nagainst music. He chased the young mullah out of the school. This is his story, told in the language of the sixties. Of Beat poetry. Of rap, seemingly. A story of a boy in a Malay village whose memory of his grandma's gangsta chicken curry and the Hippie Sixties saved him from being another jihadist out to destroy humanity.

texts toward collective Muslim empowerment. This will, in turn, change and guide the system and the personal. Islamization of Muslim majority societies starts with two categories of policies: policies of persuasion and motivation and policies of realization. This is meant to change social psychology, and the basic building blocks of social psychology are two main categories: the internal and the external. To change the Muslim majority societies toward Islam, we must change its members' social acts and behavior, and we need to change the behavior through social programs and institutions. To achieve this, Islamisation must aim at controlling and modeling the social and cognitive schema by various psychological means. Islamization should create social interaction to instill a sense of community based on Islamic values, disregard negative emotions and promote positive ones. We need to create group norms in political and social groups, which must earn admiration by piety, morality, and ability to govern. We must create norms in the political institutions, academic institutions, public institutions, and legal institutions. The jurists and theologians should scan through Islamic texts, biographies, and history to extract relevant values to be applied in these institutions, thereby achieving group norms. Psychologists and sociologists must guide how media and entertainment impart their contents. To create group norms, we need to develop models of persuasion, achieve conformity, create social support for Islamic values, suppress contradictory values, cease social distractions and form close relationships among Muslims. \r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 90749381, "asset_id": 49065358, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 65477450, "first_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr", "last_name": "Rahman", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "MohammadMushfequrRahman", "display_name": "Mohammad Mushfequr Rahman", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/MohammadMushfequrRahman?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/65477450/17054831/63991740/s65_mohammad_mushfequr.rahman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6546, "name": "Islamic Education & Islamic Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education_and_Islamic_Schooling?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24585, "name": "Political Islam in Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Turkey?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 40114, "name": "Muslim Brotherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Brotherhood?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 45019, "name": "Islamic Movements and Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movements_and_Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 73650, "name": "Islamic Social Sciences (esp.

This study discusses the establishment of of the Anjuman-i-Islam during the early twentieth century, as a response to the British growing influence in Malaya. The British administrators were cautious in their treatment of the Muslim matters, which were and still are regarded as very sensitive issues. At the same time, they were suspicious of any activity, which could potentially undermine their position in Malaya.. After covering the history of the foundation of the Anjuman-i-Islam, it describes the major activities of this association especially in printing. Moreover, it analyses the major achievements as well as challenges facing this Islamic accociation. It also examines the membership and leadership structure of the Anjuman-i-Islam. Finally, it analyses the attitude of the Anjuman-I-Islam towards the issue of the Caliphate.

Commentary IN LATE August this year Prime Minister Najib Razak announced a proposed amendment to Malaysia's Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976. The proposal is an attempt to resolve the recurring problem of highly-publicised custody battles over unilateral conversions of children by spouses who converted to Islam. Several of such court disputes, framed around religious freedom, have been pursued in Malaysia's dual track legal system of civil and Shariah (Islamic law) courts in the past decade. Amid the growing religiosity of the majority ethnic group, the Malays, who increasingly choose to identify themselves by religion and call for wider implementation of Islamic codes, laws that negatively and disproportionately affect non-Muslims serve as ominous harbingers of how secularity is being eroded within the Malaysian polity, especially for non-Muslims. Growing Secular-Religious Divide This dynamic not only leads to increased inter-ethnic tension between the Malay Muslim-majority and the non-Muslim minorities, it also creates tension between the religious and the areligious within the ethnic Malay majority.

Kedah\u2019s historical importance is distinguished by its widely acknowledged position as a thriving international port and trading mecca. The Islamisation of the Kedah monarchy in 1136 prepared the avenue for the large-scale dissemination of Islam covering the entire state.

From the overview of the history of Islam in Kedah, it is shown that Islam enjoys a symbiotic relationship with the culture that has fundamentally moulded the power dynamics of political praxis in Kedah. The relevant politico-cultural practitioners here include the kings and their family members, the royal inner circle, palace advisors, ruling elites, the ulama and modern politicians. From the point when Islam established itself as the most important factor in Kedah politics, the commanding heights of Kedah\u2019s political equation were controlled by those who gave priority to tolerant practices such as negotiations, discussions, compromises, consensus and consociationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59817942, "asset_id": 39652764, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=215664", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=215664", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 16171, "name": "Islamic Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Political_Thought?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 167916, "name": "Sejarah Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 921027, "name": "Malaysia Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_Politics?f_ri=215664"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=215664"}]}, {"id": 8498537, "title": "God as politics in Malaysia", "created_at": "2014-09-25T17:13:51.042-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8498537/God_as_politics_in_Malaysia?f_ri=215664", "dom_id": "work_8498537", "summary": "Asia Times.
