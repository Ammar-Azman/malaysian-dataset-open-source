But few people have actually read the Sejarah Melayu to realise the fairytale-like claims of Singapore's supposed medieval founder as a descendant of Alexander the Great, and the son of an Indian king who tried to conquer China and a princess from underwater; or that the creature he purportedly saw was not described as a lion, but a chimera with a red body, black head, white breast, and was a little larger than a he-goat. And barely anyone remembers the days when respectable residents of Singapore scoffed at suggestions that Singapore's name has anything to do with the Felis Leo.\n\n\nDecoding Sejarah Melayu daringly challenges the assumption that the Sejarah Melayu records Singapore's pre-modern past, which has been held since Sir Stamford Raffles arrived in 1819 and declared himself at the \"ancient Capital of the Malay kings\". It seeks to grasp what is the Sejarah Melayu and how its accounts of Singapore as Temasek and Singapura were written, critically re-examines key historical text such as the Malay epic Hikayat Hang Tuah, Tom\u00e9 Pires' Suma Oriental and 14th century Chinese travelogue Daoyi Zhilue, and makes an expansive study into other sources in Malay, Javanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Siamese, Arabic, Portuguese, Dutch, French, and the English language to discover clues to ancient Singapore's long hidden past. This is a book that will profoundly change understandings of Singapore's history and identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67537540, "asset_id": 49148310, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24633161, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Heng", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "JasonHeng", "display_name": "Jason Heng", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/JasonHeng?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12745, "name": "Yuan Dynasty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yuan_Dynasty?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246574, "name": "History of Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 375194, "name": "Melaka History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melaka_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 542606, "name": "Bintan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bintan?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 699098, "name": "Sejarah Melayu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Melayu?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 752825, "name": "Singapore History Before Raffles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History_Before_Raffles?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 16308945, "title": "Convict labour in colonial Singapore", "created_at": "2015-09-29T22:06:46.697-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16308945/Convict_labour_in_colonial_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_16308945", "summary": "Examines convict life when Singapore was a penal colony between 1825 and 1873 and the unusual convict system where prisoners were their own warders.

In earlier times its history was tightly knit to the development and prosperity of its port. Today's global trading hub, however, is broadly conditioned by its position within a global communications regime that includes various modes of transportation by sea, land and air, as well as electronic forms of communication such as telephony and the internet. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure are certainly prerequisites for success, but Singapore's rapid rise in becoming a global trading hub cannot be explained by these factors alone: the hub is backed by an array of industries that directly or indirectly support transport and trade at large, ranging from warehousing to finance and trade. All these activities, moreover, are regulated and driven by policies that have been carefully formulated and put into place over the past five decades. Then there is Singapore's greatest asset today: its people. In the context of this introduction, it is of course impossible to give a detailed or even comprehensive overview of the historical developments that have evolved and today underpin the global trading hub. What is possible, however, is to single out some of the developmental highlights as well as explain their historic relevance and interdependence. In the following sections I shall do so with an eye cast on history and chronological development as well as moving from the larger picture to the particular. As the SG50 celebrations move into the past, the Republic will begin to look toward 2019, the bicentennial of the British colonial settlement's founding. Like SG50, the bicentennial will offer a unique opportunity to look back and take stock, though the time horizon taken on during the bicentennial will be rolled back well beyond 1965 to the beginning of the 19 th century or perhaps even before. There will be a fresh, vigorous debate about what makes Singapore a special place. One question is likely to feature prominently: Just how much of Singapore's historic success is locationally pre-conditioned?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63772949, "asset_id": 21273653, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26, "name": "Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2074, "name": "International Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Business?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3479, "name": "Business History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 18673, "name": "Economic history/Trade history/Oriental trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_history_Trade_history_Oriental_trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 30568852, "title": "Sustainability studies and the changing landscape of social science research in Singapore", "created_at": "2016-12-21T21:12:17.855-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30568852/Sustainability_studies_and_the_changing_landscape_of_social_science_research_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_30568852", "summary": "The Singapore government has traditionally invested heavily in, and focused on, the development of the hard sciences since gaining independence in 1965. This bode well for the fate of sustainability studies as the state, in the initial decades, focused heavily on performance legitimacy, emphasising issues of survivability and economic progress. With the country now at the top of global charts on many rankings on economic prosperity, the city-state has steadily begun to examine issues of nation-building rather than state-building. This can be attributed, in part, to the paradox of soft authoritarian regimes that invest heavily in human capital, because in the long run, an educated electorate will want, as active and informed citizens, to participate effectively in politics. The social sciences are slowly evolving to look at the Singapore model from a comparative perspective, moving away from the dominant narrative of \u201cSingaporean exceptionalism\u201d, which overstates the uniqueness of the city-state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51010756, "asset_id": 30568852, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403373, "first_name": "Kamaludeen", "last_name": "Mohamed Nasir", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "KamaludeenMohamedNasir", "display_name": "Kamaludeen  Mohamed Nasir", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/KamaludeenMohamedNasir?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403373/99485/5021698/s65_kamaludeen.mohamed_nasir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4524, "name": "Sustainable Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Development?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4995, "name": "History of Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Social_Sciences?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 10439, "name": "Academia Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academia_Research?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 552366, "name": "Developmentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Developmentalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 578214, "name": "Impact of Social Sciences and Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 743628, "name": "Liberal Arts and Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Arts_and_Social_Sciences?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1197942, "name": "Social Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Science?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 14136198, "title": "The Changi Book", "created_at": "2015-07-16T18:52:25.981-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14136198/The_Changi_Book?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_14136198", "summary": "The Changi story is synonymous with suffering, hardship, and the Australian prisoner-of-war experience in the Second World War.

Between the 1950s and 1970s, large numbers of middle- and low-income families moved from the unauthorised wooden housing of kampongs to the modern, usually multi-storey flats of public housing estates. This paper explores ways to cultivate the key historical skills of imagination and empathy in source-based studies in the secondary-level History curriculum. The paper argues that examining a range of historical sources which offer differing perspectives, including official documents, oral history interviews and photographs, can help students understand and analytically appraise older Singaporeans\u2019 experiences of a momentous social transformation in our recent past. By drawing from a small-size study in a local secondary school, the paper discusses the use of sources on two main themes: official and residents\u2019 views of kampong life; and former kampong dwellers\u2019 responses and adjustment to public housing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39029270, "asset_id": 16515954, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 788580, "first_name": "Kah Seng", "last_name": "Loh", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "KahSengLoh", "display_name": "Kah Seng Loh", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/KahSengLoh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/788580/267997/316725/s65_kah_seng.loh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15692, "name": "History Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Education?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15838, "name": "Imagination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagination?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44886, "name": "Empathy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empathy?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 7048322, "title": "The Use and Abuse of Oral History: Personal Dimensions in the Singapore History Gallery", "created_at": "2014-05-14T13:53:55.818-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7048322/The_Use_and_Abuse_of_Oral_History_Personal_Dimensions_in_the_Singapore_History_Gallery?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_7048322", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33702089, "asset_id": 7048322, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1801351, "first_name": "Elysia", "last_name": "Teh", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "ElysiaTeh", "display_name": "Elysia Teh", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/ElysiaTeh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1801351/615583/14850889/s65_elysia.teh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3987, "name": "History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Memory?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 14619842, "title": "History of Piracy in Singaporean Waters", "created_at": "2015-08-03T07:52:09.066-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14619842/History_of_Piracy_in_Singaporean_Waters?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_14619842", "summary": "In the course of this paper I want to gain an understanding of historical piracy on and around the island of Singapore \u2013 hereby I was especially interested in the period before which Raffles found the British settlement.

Drawing on a multi-disciplinary range of archival, textual and cartographical records, as well as the latest archaeological discoveries, the authors cast a singular historical trajectory for Singapore over the past seven centuries, animating its history like never before.\r\nWritten in a compelling and accessible manner, and richly illustrated with more than 200 artefacts, photographs, maps, art works and ephemera, this volume builds upon the foundations of an earlier book, Singapore: A 700-Year History. Extensively rewritten to incorporate ground-breaking research findings, Seven Hundred Years: A History of Singapore widens the historical lens and offers a vital new perspective on the story of Singapore.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59197268, "asset_id": 8798361, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 32014, "name": "Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 117855, "name": "Maritime Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 273287, "name": "Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Johor?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 13230521, "title": "Book Review: R.

books and articles have been written about the Japanese Occupation in Singapore and Malaya, there is a considerable absence of the study of collaboration during the Japanese Occupation in Singapore and Malaya. This absence is even more jarring in the Singapore story, where the Japanese Occupation is treated as a defining moment when people of all races suffered under the hands of the Japanese. This paper will thus attempt to examine the issues of collaboration during the Japanese Occupation in Singapore and Malaya, from the eyes of the Chinese community in Singapore and Malaya, which was divided into two distinct groups, the Chinese who were in anti-Japanese resistance groups such as the Malayan People Anti-Japanese Army and those that were not. This thesis will attempt to argue that the Chinese who were in active resistance group viewed and defined the act of collaboration and collaborators much harsher than the Chinese who chose not to join such groups by examining the reaction towards the act of collaboration and collaborators during and after the Japanese Occupation. This thesis will also argue that labelling someone as a collaborator and a traitor is extremely problematic especially in the context of Malaya and Singapore where both territories were occupied by the Japanese military. It is hopeful that this study on collaboration in Singapore and Malaya during the Japanese Occupation will result in a fuller understanding of the complexities in Malayan and Singapore society during the Japanese Occupation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32325819, "asset_id": 5117582, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4104182, "first_name": "Han", "last_name": "Ming Guang", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "HanMingGuang", "display_name": "Han  Ming Guang", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/HanMingGuang?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4104182/1584809/1917682/s65_han.ming_guang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4828, "name": "Collaboration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collaboration?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65082, "name": "World War 2", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_2?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 602642, "name": "History of Singapore, Japanese Occupation of Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Singapore_Japanese_Occupation_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 4970120, "title": "Changing Urban Rivers: The History and Modern Value of Singapore's Urban Canals", "created_at": "2013-11-02T17:41:12.178-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4970120/Changing_Urban_Rivers_The_History_and_Modern_Value_of_Singapores_Urban_Canals?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_4970120", "summary": "The evolution and modern value of Singapore\u2019s urban canals underlies its developmental history and future. As Singapore pursues increasingly ambitious development goals, the City in a Garden\u2019s urban canal system continues to evolve to address new challenges including population growth and intensifying land limitations. Singapore faces many water-related vulnerabilities ranging from flooding to supply scarcity that stem from the city-state\u2019s rapid urbanization, population growth, biophysical limitations, and other political circumstances. Singapore uses its urban canal system as a vehicle to mitigate these vulnerabilities and ensure water does not limit the young nation\u2019s economic growth. To understand the past and future of this crucial enabler of development, this paper seeks to 1) provide background on role and hydrodynamics of urban water, 2) describe the history of the canal network, 3) identify the effects of urbanization on water resources, 4) describe contemporary programs (specifically the ABC and 3P programs) which seek to enhance the canal system, and 5) use a value framework to identify the potential values urban canals offer. This effort is informed by first-hand observations recorded during three weeks of travelling in Singapore and interacting with relevant decision makers; additional information is drawn from publications of governmental bodies and academia. Overall, this paper aims to provide insights into the past, present, and future trajectories of Singapore\u2019s canal system and its path toward implementing a sustainable land-use planning model.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32219788, "asset_id": 4970120, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4903794, "first_name": "Luke", "last_name": "Maier", "domain_name": "princeton", "page_name": "LukeMaier", "display_name": "Luke Maier", "profile_url": "https://princeton.academia.edu/LukeMaier?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4526, "name": "Water resources", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_resources?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14469, "name": "Sustainable Water Resources Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Water_Resources_Management?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20436, "name": "Urban And Regional Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_And_Regional_Planning?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 706368, "name": "Canals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canals?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 34526754, "title": "R.

Should we teach our students to be good citizens by telling them one unifying narrative of Singapore, or many varied narratives? Have we always said no to social welfare, or to the casino? Is liberal democracy necessarily a threat to social stability? Have Singaporeans historically been apathetic, ignorant or irrational?\n\nThe contributors to this book believe that knowing, and debating, how we live with myths will help us to better understand Singapore today, and to imagine its future.

The historian needs to access this Chinese domain to fully understand the transformations taking place in Singapore between 1945 and 1963. A study of the Chinese newspapers offers insight into this domain in several ways. Firstly, how important events were reported affected public perception. Secondly, the opinions and views expressed in the newspapers\u2019 editorials and articles were influential in Chinese society, and the public responded in various literary forms. The back pages of the newspapers formed a space for public debate. Thirdly, the newspapers existed as\r\ncultural artefacts. Standing at the nexus of the political, cultural, and social spheres, it was on the pages of the newspapers that many new ideas were put forward, and traditional concepts were contested. The newspapers acted as mediators between the old and the new, developing the new concepts and language of decolonization and independence. The evolution of Chinese thought in Singapore can be traced within the pages of the newspapers.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2320628, "asset_id": 498449, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 380793, "first_name": "Pingtjin", "last_name": "Thum", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "PingtjinThum", "display_name": "Pingtjin Thum", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/PingtjinThum?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/380793/118176/2411453/s65_pingtjin.thum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 876, "name": "Print Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Print_Culture?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9801, "name": "Chinese Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language_and_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 14902, "name": "Chinese linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_linguistics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29367, "name": "Subaltern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subaltern_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 54489, "name": "Newspapers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Newspapers?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 31316562, "title": "Srivijaya and the Aesthetic Project", "created_at": "2017-02-08T20:06:41.212-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31316562/Srivijaya_and_the_Aesthetic_Project?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_31316562", "summary": "A working paper developed from research on the subject of\n\u015ar\u012bvijaya, specifically in the context of its reference from the vantage point of Singapore.

About 70% of films screened were American and many large Hollywood studios had distribution offices in Singapore. A entire supporting field consumption shaped by film fandom culture emerged, from film magazines to sales in gramophone records and wireless broadcasting of popular soundtracks and live performances in dance halls at entertainment parks, called the \u2018Worlds\u2019\u2014such as Great World and Happy World. There were diverse reactions to this social phenomenon from different quarters. The colonial government was alarmed at the perceived influence of decadent Hollywood films on a native audience in terms of moral vices and crime. Religious bodies and older members of the local non-European community were brought in to sit on the Cinematograph Films Censorship Annual Committee. Drawing from the Anglophone print media, this paper aims to document local audiences' voices in the highly-debated topic of censorship. The existence of a large corpus of English-language publications produced in inter-war Singapore for a local, non-European audience is testimony to the depth of the domestic, English-language public sphere, which cut across diverse ethnic backgrounds and was based upon a common framework of English-language education and cultural references. This paper will argue that America films played a crucial role in influencing social changes in Singapore, particularly amongst young people and women, as well as in shaping the identity of Singapore as a distinctly modern city.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46150469, "asset_id": 3308173, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 46150477, "asset_id": 3308173, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2795473, "first_name": "Chua Ai", "last_name": "Lin", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AiLinChua", "display_name": "Chua Ai Lin", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AiLinChua?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2795473/915594/23966561/s65_chua_ai.lin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2972, "name": "Media History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15996, "name": "American Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Cinema?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19258, "name": "Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 951389, "title": "Conflict and Change at the Margins: Emergency Kampong Clearance and the Making of Modern Singapore", "created_at": "2011-09-26T01:20:01.953-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/951389/Conflict_and_Change_at_the_Margins_Emergency_Kampong_Clearance_and_the_Making_of_Modern_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_951389", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5813274, "asset_id": 951389, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 788580, "first_name": "Kah Seng", "last_name": "Loh", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "KahSengLoh", "display_name": "Kah Seng Loh", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/KahSengLoh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/788580/267997/316725/s65_kah_seng.loh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 41, "name": "Real Estate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Real_Estate?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 534, "name": "Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3167, "name": "Disaster Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6603, "name": "Property", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Property?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 7453, "name": "Rural Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Development?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9846, "name": "Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 53772, "name": "High Modernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/High_Modernism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 68838, "name": "Public Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Housing?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 126747, "name": "Emergency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emergency?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 156498, "name": "Squatters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Squatters?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235678, "name": "Bukit Ho Swee fire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bukit_Ho_Swee_fire?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235680, "name": "Kampong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kampong?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235705, "name": "Clearance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clearance?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 35952698, "title": "Cycling Communities: Bicycle Clubs in Australia with an emphasis on Sydney", "created_at": "2018-02-18T14:20:01.307-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35952698/Cycling_Communities_Bicycle_Clubs_in_Australia_with_an_emphasis_on_Sydney?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_35952698", "summary": "The formation and popularity of bicycle clubs in Australia closely reflects the costs of purchasing a bicycle. In the 1860s it was largely a pastime for the rich and affluent, and by the 1890s it widened to include the middle classes. However by the turn of the twentieth century, with the rich and middle classes smitten with new motorized transportation like automobiles and motorcycles, opportunities to own a bicycle opened up for the first time to the working classes. As a result bicycle clubs flourished throughout the Australian social landscape. The decades following the Second World War saw growth in wealth and the growing affordability of personal motorized transportation. By the 1960s and especially in the 1970s, bicycle users turned away from the low tech bicycle towards the now affordable automobile. However by the 1990s and 2000s the bicycle acquired new meanings, practicalities and charm of bicycles were discovered yet again by new affluent professional classes.", "downloadable_attachments":

In pursuing this programme I will make use of a broad range of sources including chronicles and histories, letters and treaties, navigational instructions and travel literature, as well as (European) cartography of the 16th to 18th centuries. In order to gain deeper appreciation of the multi-faceted roles and understandings of the Singapore Straits across the longue dur\u00e9e, I  not only adduce and evaluate materials of European colonial origin, but importantly also heed special attention to sources of Asian origin in general, and specifically to materials that have originally been written in Arabic, Malay, Chinese and have been made accessible to the wider reading public in various contemporary translations. The modes of enquiry and the insights brought to paper here differ both in terms of scope and objectives from my earlier findings expounded in The Singapore and Melaka Straits published in 2010.",

"work_33240521", "summary": "Conserving and protecting Singapore's heritage has been one of the key talking points between the Singapore state and civil society in contemporary Singapore. The purpose of this paper is to provide a deeper and more critical understanding of heritage in the Singapore context by studying how heritage has politicized and commodified by the People's Action Party (PAP) government, from 1959 to 1988. We aim to do this by dividing the period that we are investigating into 3 time periods and examining how the PAP government used and/or neglected heritage to suit its agenda as well as to satisfy the exigent needs of the young nation-state. The first section will show how fledging attempts at conserving Singapore's built-up heritage during the late 1950s and 1960s faltered due to economic necessity of feeding and housing the growing population of Singapore. Yet, intangible heritage was used by the PAP government to push for merger with Malaysia. The next section will show through the activities of the Preservation of Monuments Board, how heritage was neglected in favor of economic development during the 1970s. Finally, this paper will demonstrate how and why heritage became more important to the Singapore government during the 1980s due to the changing economic and political conditions of that decade. This discussion would equip information professionals with critical awareness of how and why state-directed heritage information is produced.

In this colony, poor Chinese, Malays, archipelagic South-east Asians, and Indians struggled to eke out a living by razing rainforest, because they possessed no better options. As these workers struggled to transform forests into farms, houses, and roads, they created an ecology of poverty that had catastrophic consequences for\nhumans and tigers alike. Finding ever less forest in which to hide from humans, the mighty cats instead began to regard some people as prey. Unable to flee, poor Chinese, Malays, archipelagic South-east Asians, and Indians sought to protect themselves by killing tigers. In the end, the humans vanquished the cats, but not without enduring hundreds of fatalities. Colonial Singapore\u2019s environmental history reminds us that the people who carry out the work of eradicating nature often do so because they possess limited alternatives for survival.

Despite the archaeological recovery of material cultural remains of this settlement in recent years, historical discourse on the subject remains largely confined to either the epistemological significance of this settlement in the colonial and post-colonial histories of the Malay-speaking people in the Malay Archipelago, or the general importance of this landmark within the context of maritime trade in Southeast Asia. More often than not, artefacts are used only to highlight these narratives but are themselves seldom addressed.\n\nThis thesis is hence dedicated to the study of these artefacts as primary sources of 14th century Singapore. It seeks to address a fundamental question which underlies all narratives of the settlement but has hitherto been inadequately addressed by conjunctures and hypotheses: How complex was this pre-colonial Singapore society? In doing so, this thesis will first address the historiographical issues underlying this question by reviewing existing literature and primary sources concerning this pre-colonial entity. Deductions from the analysis of material cultural remains sampled from the archaeological site at the churchyard of the Saint Andrew\u2019s Cathedral (STA) will next be made.

As a colony, Singapore not only received Western psychiatric expertise from the metropole but also suffered from the inner contradictions and failings of colonial rule. The mental asylum thus had both a modernizing and marginal role. As an international port city, Singapore was a major center for internationally crisscrossing flows, yet the transnationalism in mental health policy remained connected to colonial power in two ways: the British simplified the culturally diverse patients into distinct, subordinate races and transferred them between Singapore and other countries. Singapore was also an unruly \" coolie town \" where, utilizing the weapons of the weak, Chinese sufferers contested the psychiatric regime in the asylum and continued to seek treatment and care beyond it. Their ability to do so depended, however, on the specific circumstances that prevailed in the individual, asylum, and coolie town, and their agency was expressed in relation to the colonial system rather than independent of it. Singapore: Colony, Port City, and Coolie Town Was Singapore a British colony, international port city, or Chinese coolie town? From a factual standpoint, all three descriptions are of course correct, but each has histo-riographical implications for writing about mental illness.

This thesis will demonstrate that Hainanese identity cannot be seen as an essentialised and unchanging entity and that Hainanese identity itself, is shaped by the historical forces that have affected the Hainanese community and that the essentialised image and identity of the Hainanese that has been shaped by the current power holders of the community is problematic and flawed. Lastly, through this thesis, I hope to be able to provide an alternative approach to examining other Chinese dialect groups and ethnic communities by studying them not through the institutions that lead the community, but through the voices of the ordinary members of the community and also through the external perception of others.

"summary": "In a climactic end to Singapore\u2019s 50th National Day Parade celebration, the most extravagant firework display in the nation\u2019s history was set against a backdrop of Singapore\u2019s most popular National Day Songs. Nationalist songs also featured extensively throughout the parade, with an instrumental medley of community songs performed and previous National Day Songs sung by their original singers. Prime Minister Lee himself set a precedent by having local favourite, Home, performed before the annual National Day Rally.  Nationalist songs, in particular National Day Songs, today occupy a prominent place in the nation\u2019s annual celebration of its independence.\n\t\nThis thesis shows, however, that the singing of nationalist songs at such scale and ceremony, is a relatively recent development. Although the origins of singing nationalist songs in Singapore can be traced to the time of self-government, this study argues that this practice constitutes an invented tradition, directed by the state for the purposes of nation-building. Identifying three distinct phases within the development of nationalist songs, I examine the discontinuities and shifts within the use, production and reception of nationalist songs. Finally, I further situate the songs\u2019 messages within their historical context to show how they were employed by the state for nation-building purposes.\n\nBy documenting the tradition of singing nationalist songs in Singapore, this study offers an innovative perspective of nation-building while exploring the extent to which a state can invent a national identity.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48285267, "asset_id": 27983026, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29025592, "first_name": "Aloysius", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AloysiusHo", "display_name": "Aloysius Ho", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AloysiusHo?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29025592/8264190/9244586/s65_aloysius.ho.jpg_oh_2f718d7fc50843d7c5ab5b16846f88b0_oe_559c3e9e___gda___1437395045_4f1c1bfe27eb1252583ea7c5b76cf7eb"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28508, "name": "History of Nationalism and Nation-Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Nationalism_and_Nation-Building?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42199, "name": "Invented Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Invented_Traditions?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 36084492, "title": "An Old Teochew Oral Account Sheds New Light on the 1819 Founding of Singapore", "created_at": "2018-03-05T15:12:40.027-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36084492/An_Old_Teochew_Oral_Account_Sheds_New_Light_on_the_1819_Founding_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_36084492", "summary": "In 1950 a Singapore Chinese publisher Phua Chye Long (\u6f58\u9192\u519c\uff09 compiled a set of Teochew oral account relating to the settlement of a group of Teochew gambier planters in Singapore, before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819.

This thesis will thus attempt to analyse Singapore\u2019s commemorative practices through the study of National Day stamps from 1960 to 1984. It will argue that national commemoration in Singapore was used to construct and propagate official historical narratives, thereby legitimising the rule of the incumbent political party. \n\nAs seen through commemorative National Day stamps and its significance for nation building, commemoration in Singapore was used to shape historical narratives and consequently, construct a believable collective memory for Singapore and Singaporeans. This thesis will demonstrate how commemoration started in the 1960s with the rejection of history, emphasising the need for modernisation and advancement. By 1969, there was a marked shift in the government\u2019s view on history, creating new narratives of economic success and survival, which were embodied in these commemorative stamps. However, by 1984, when the government faced serious political challenges, the purpose of commemoration changed and a more complex historical narrative was created. Although commemoration largely continued earlier historical narratives that emphasised the need for survival and the economic successes of Singapore, its main function became didactic. \n\nMoreover, as this thesis will establish, commemoration as seen through stamps served enshrined national values of pragmatism, stability and multiracialism. It also buttressed the political legitimacy of the PAP and served as a site for negotiation between the state and the citizenry. Although stamps might not have formed the main thrust of commemoration and nation building, their study will provide an interesting perspective into the construction of national identities.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39374257, "asset_id": 17217732, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1004029, "first_name": "Pei Ying", "last_name": "Loh", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeiYingLoh", "display_name": "Pei Ying Loh", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeiYingLoh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1004029/925096/15151166/s65_pei_ying.loh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12644, "name": "Commemoration and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_and_Memory?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28508, "name": "History of Nationalism and Nation-Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Nationalism_and_Nation-Building?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 407582, "name": "Postage Stamps", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postage_Stamps?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 614845, "name": "Singapore Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Political_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 14759986, "title": "\"Shenti Lixing: The Documenting Practice of Loke Hong Seng\" (2015)", "created_at": "2015-08-08T07:50:47.699-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14759986/_Shenti_Lixing_The_Documenting_Practice_of_Loke_Hong_Seng_2015_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_14759986", "summary": "Zhuang, Wubin. \u201cShenti Lixing: The Documenting Practice of Loke Hong Seng.\u201d In A Social Portrait of Singapore, The Critical Years.

The first half of the seventeenth century brought heightened political, commercial and diplomatic activity to this region. It has long been clear to both the Portuguese and the Dutch that whoever controlled the waters off modern Singapore gained a firm grip on regional as well as long-distance intra-Asian trade. By the early 1600s Portuguese power and prestige were waning and the arrival of the Dutch East India Company constituted a major threat. Moreover, the rapid expansion and growing power of the Acehnese Empire, and rivalry between Johor and Aceh, was creating a new context for European trade in Asia.\r\n\r\nDrawing on maps, rare printed works, and unpublished manuscripts written in Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Latin, Peter Borschberg provides new information on the diplomatic activities of Asian powers, and shows how the Portuguese and Spanish attempted to restore their political fortunes by containing the rapid rise of Dutch Power in the region. Key documents, transcribed and translated into English for the first time, make up a series of appendices.\r\n\r\nThe product of more than two decades of research in European libraries, archives, The Singapore and Melaka Straits will be of great interest to readers in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, where little is known about this pivotal pre-colonial period. It is also an invaluable resource for historians and other students of early modern Europe and of the European presence in Asia.\r\n\"\"\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50080315, "asset_id":

authors have as much to say about Singapore and the old Johor capital Batu Sawar as Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge (c.1570-1632). This admiral of the Dutch East India Company sailed to Asia in 1605 and besieged Portuguese Melaka in 1606 with the help of Malay allies. A massive Portuguese armada arrived from Goa to fight the Dutch at sea, break the siege and relieve the Portuguese colony. During his Asian voyage and on his return to Europe in September 1608, Matelieff penned a series of letters and memorials in which he provided a candid assessment of trading opportunities and politics in Asia. He advised the VOC and leading government officials of the Dutch Republic to take a long-term view of Dutch involvement in Asia and fundamentally change the way they were doing business there. Singapore, the Straits region, and Johor assumed a significant role in his overall assessment. At one stage seriously contemplated establishing the VOC\u2019s main Asian base at a location near the Johor River estuary. On deeper reflection, however, Matelieff and the VOC directors in Europe began to shift their attention southward and instead began to prefer a location around the Sunda Strait. This was arguably a near miss for Singapore two full centuries before Thomas Stamford Raffles founded the British trading post on the island in 1819. This book is aimed at students, researchers and general readers who are interested in the history of Singapore and Johor as well as in answering the question: Was Singapore\u2019s potential as a strategic and commercial center not recognized before the arrival of the British?\n\nThis book has been published by the National Library of Singapore's Books SG site.

political leader of the anticolonial and Malayan left-wing in Singapore until his detention without trial in 1963 ended his political career. That he had a major impact on Singapore\u2019s decolonisation is beyond dispute \u2013 indeed, both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee Kuan Yew formulated their merger policy specifically in response to Lim\u2019s politics and his values. Yet Lim remains a poorly understood figure because of a lack of sources and a historiography written almost entirely from his opponents\u2019 perspectives. Reassessing existing literature in view of recently declassified British archives, this essay pieces together Lim\u2019s articulation of three tenets in the political thinking that guided his tactics for social mobilisation: anticolonial unity, non-violence, and popular sovereignty.

"Informal housing communities of semi-autonomous urban migrants emerged rapidly at the margins of Southeast Asian cities and Hong Kong after World War II. Their development constituted an important moment in postwar social history: the dwellers eked out a livelihood on land which initially lay beyond official control, relying on family, kinship and community ties to cope with the challenges of employment, environmental disaster and eviction. What was also historic was the response of the colonial and postcolonial states to the informal housing. \r\nInfluenced partly by the advice of international experts on the need for controlled development, the region\u2019s governments criminalised the informal housing as illegal, represented their dwellers as socially inert and warned of the dire impact such unplanned settlement, like a contagion, would have on the character and future of the society and nation. To varying degrees, they also undertook to either resettle the dwellers in emergency public housing or reorganise social life in the settlements through aided self-help. In only the former British-ruled city-states of Singapore and Hong Kong did the authorities succeed in transforming the face and character of the city; elsewhere, the pressure of patronage politics and the preference for \u201cprestige projects\u2019 greatly limited the scope of the actual reorganisation. Drawing upon James Scott\u2019s concept of \u201chigh modernist\u2019 planning and social governance, this paper examines the origins and development of informal settlements in urban Southeast Asia and Hong Kong and the different outcomes of state efforts to transform their residents into \u201csquatters\u2019, colonial subjects and, finally, model citizens of new nation-states.

Through a careful analysis of European sources, the author assesses the broader consequences of this event and the ensuing international implications. After 1603, the VOC directors and the regents of the Dutch Republic were alerted to how profitable the policy of freebooting and despoiling the enemy could be, while the Portuguese authorities of the Estado da \u00cdndia became aware of their vulnerability in the face of geographical constraints. There is also a discussion of the legal defence of the Dutch interests as presented by Hugo Grotius, the Dutch jurist who has frequently been upheld as the \u201cfather of modern international law\u201d. What becomes very transparent in the course of the present account is how important the Macao merchants really were to the Estado da \u00cdndia, how far their networks of trade spanned deep into Southeast Asia, and how, despite suffering a number of severe setbacks as a result of VOC freebooting activities, they managed to recuperate from these blows with amazing agility and perseverance.

Jacques de Coutre visited Southeast Asia in the early 17th century, and his lengthy account of his experiences provides a glimpse of Singapore, Johor and the Straits of Melaka during an era for which little written material has survived. This special edition, which presents reworked highlights from the full translation, is designed to provide students, teachers and the wider public with a glimpse of this tumultuous region when it was still controlled by local rulers, and Western colonialism was just gaining a foothold. The author describes dangerous intrigues involving fortune hunters and schemers, as well as local rulers and couriers, adventures that on several occasions nearly cost him his life. \r\nThe manuscripts come from a bundle of documents preserved at the National Library of Spain in Madrid that includes De Coutre\u2019s autobiography and several memorials to the Crowns of Spain and Portugal. Chapters from the autobiography have been excerpted from book I, which covers the writer\u2019s life in Southeast Asia between 1593 and 1603. A glossary and list of place names provide information about officials, goods and places mentioned in the text that will be unfamiliar to readers of English.\r\n ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37450692, "asset_id": 9672124, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 268, "name": "Political Geography and Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Geography_and_Geopolitics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2320, "name": "Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textiles?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9163, "name": "Shipping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipping?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 18673, "name": "Economic history/Trade history/Oriental trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_history_Trade_history_Oriental_trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 52982, "name": "Commerce", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commerce?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 59695, "name": "Navigation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Navigation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 59858, "name": "Geopolitcs and Geostrategy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitcs_and_Geostrategy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 195481, "name": "Geopol\u00edtica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopol%C3%ADtica?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 236098, "name": "Commodity trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commodity_trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 273287, "name": "Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Johor?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 437666, "name": "Military History of Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 732637, "name": "Johor-Riau", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Johor-Riau?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1412129, "name": "Sejarah Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Johor?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1477490, "name": "History of Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 8237992, "title": "Asian Seafaring Communities and the Blood-Red Seas: Maritime Violence and the Waters surrounding the Malay Peninsula, 1825-1885", "created_at": "2014-09-07T23:22:54.064-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8237992/Asian_Seafaring_Communities_and_the_Blood_Red_Seas_Maritime_Violence_and_the_Waters_surrounding_the_Malay_Peninsula_1825_1885?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_8237992", "summary": "Throughout much of nineteenth century, seafarers sailing the waters off Malaya often experienced violence, as the era witnessed shifts in wealth and power.

This essay instigates a reevaluation of Singapore's nationalist understanding of self and \"Other,\" so as to enable us to begin to recognise the colonial frames we routinely adopt.\r\n\r\nHistories written for nation-states are circumscribed in their scope and ambit by the limits of artificial present-day political boundaries. In the case of accounts written for small city-states, such as Singapore, this constraint is a serious shortcoming. The default geographical limits assumed for a nation-state is woefully inadequate in addressing the very different connections, boundaries, and terrains of older political, economic and cultural spheres in a longue-duree perspective of maritime trade and of the fortunes of ports. This is the case for the scope and timeline ambition set up for the book Singapore: A 700-year History (henceforth SG700).\r\n \r\nThis essay is an excerpt from a longer presentation for the Singapore Dreaming Conference in February 2015. It addresses a gap in the perspective of Singapore history and the trade of the Singapore Straits presented in the book SG700 and in the prevailing standard accounts and popular understanding. The excluded events are crucial components in the history of the English, Chinese, and Archipelago traders in the Straits of Singapore and in the major international port cities of the Archipelago before Singapore's founding - in other words, in places beyond our present-day territorial waters. Singapore's initial survival and prosperity in the 191h century has also not been contextualised within larger regional developments, and consequently we possess a truncated notion of our history, cut off from knowledge of the older regional links that were of immense significance to Singapore and her early trade communities. This essay also discusses the dual port that developed in Singapore. An overlooked indigenous royal port-town existed alongside the English trade post, and the former's crucial role and economic significance is absent in existing accounts. The narratives supplied here involve widening our historical consciousness and consequently our capacities for imagining beyond our narrow vision of our position based on the colonial perspective vis-a-vis those of the Archipelago or Nusantara. \r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55598447, "asset_id": 35724207, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 149352, "first_name": "Imran", "last_name": "bin Tajudeen", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "ImranbinTajudeen", "display_name": "Imran bin Tajudeen", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/ImranbinTajudeen?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/149352/39438/36232/s65_imran.bin_tajudeen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 432864, "name": "Singapore Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Urban_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 752825, "name": "Singapore History Before Raffles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History_Before_Raffles?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28004840, "title": "\"Domesticating Hybridity: Straits Chinese Cultural Heritage Projects in Malaysia and Singapore\"", "created_at": "2016-08-25T10:45:08.843-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28004840/_Domesticating_Hybridity_Straits_Chinese_Cultural_Heritage_Projects_in_Malaysia_and_Singapore_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_28004840", "summary": "This article examines the literal and figurative domestication of Straits Chinese, or Peranakan, history in selected heritage projects in late twentieth-century Malaysia and Singapore. These projects simultaneously foreground Straits Chinese history as a symbol of interracial harmony and marginalize it as a cultural artifact. Over the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the ethnoculturally hybrid Straits Chinese positioned themselves as \u201cthe King\u2019s Chinese,\u201d champions of a Confucian-values renaissance, and citizens of independent Malaysia and Singapore. Their adaptability helped them survive the upheaval of imperialism, decolonization, and nation building, but it was also controversial for its suggestion of political flexibility. Today, Southeast Asian governments and the Peranakan themselves depict the community as a uniquely local model of ethnic integration. Museums and historic homes emphasize portrayals and consumption of supposedly feminine aspects of Peranakan culture (e.g., fashion and cuisine), while downplaying purportedly masculine elements (e.g., the possession of multiple nationalities). By conflating femininity, tradition, and racial hybridity, this approach reifies stereotypes about gender and cultural identity, and replaces transgressive potential with politically anodyne nostalgia and commercialization. As anxieties about race, national history, and belonging continue to undergird the modern polity, transnationalism and transculturalism are acceptable as long as they are confined to the past.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56840983, "asset_id": 28004840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10194240, "first_name": "Karen", "last_name": "Teoh", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "KarenTeoh", "display_name": "Karen Teoh", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/KarenTeoh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10194240/14772974/15579444/s65_karen.teoh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 40719, "name": "Museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 307448, "name": "Peranakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peranakan?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 638003, "name": "Straits Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_Chinese?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 35668190, "title": "\u00c9 complicato: una panoramica delle relazioni tra Singapore e Cina", "created_at": "2018-01-14T21:38:38.919-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35668190/%C3%89_complicato_una_panoramica_delle_relazioni_tra_Singapore_e_Cina?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_35668190", "summary": "La Singapore indipendente e la Repubblica Popolare Cinese (RPC) hanno una relazione storica varia e complessa.

Through this we argue that augmenting linguistic analysis with philosophical perspectives develops and supports CDA scholarship more broadly by accommodating the shifting complexity of social problems of ideologically driven inequality that are inbuilt through, in our case, social policy texts. In discussing philosophical-methodological issues, the paper argues for the need to continually adapt CDA to the particular data so as to remain sensitive to and avoid hegemonic tendencies in analysis. Through adopting the principles of a working methodology, we discuss a micro-meso-macro CDA framework that draws on the analytical concepts of movement, metaphorical superfluidity, thematic condensation, and surrealism to conceive of a research approach capable of examining and comprehending evolving discourses of political economies. The most immediate benefit of this framework is its capacity to illustrate how forms of valuations perpetuated by and through policy discourse are the motivational locus of meaning making insofar as they strongly inform the moral underpinning the ideology of economic growth.\n ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55445759, "asset_id": 35579690, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Adopting different approaches, both books feature family correspondence within Chinese migrant families.

Beginning from these studies, the article defends \u201cChinese overseas\u201d as an intellectual concept and as a framework that allows an examination and comparison of the connections between China and its migrants as well as their descendants worldwide. In conclusion, the article argues that diasporas are made up of those who have left home but who miss that home, touching on the concept of nostalgia. Passing down the sense of nostalgia through successive generations via narrating, writing, and verifying, both in Sinophone and other languages, is a way by which Chinese diasporas construct their heritage.

Firstly, this paper argues that the bifurcation of the \u2018Singapore Dream\u2019 into two distinct phases as stressed by the Peoples\u2019 Action Party (PAP) and commentators in Singapore do not hold true. Instead, these two so-called \u2018distinctive forms of the \u2018Singapore Dream\u2019 have shown remarkable manoeuvrability in blending into one another. Subsequently, the \u2018individualistic\u2019 and \u2018selfish\u2019 nature of the \u2018Singapore Dream\u2019s\u2019 second form will be taken to task. Although the PAP had pinned the blame upon materialistic and selfish Singaporeans for the \u2018Dream\u2019s\u2019 socially unacceptable metamorphosis, the second thesis suggests otherwise. It argues that the PAP had passed policies that reflected its transaction-like approach towards public and foreign policies, a sentiment that has been consequently internalised by Singaporeans. The final part of this essay examines the problems of how the \u2018Singapore Dream,\u2019 throughout its various manifestations, had ignored perspectives that do not fit into the bread-and-butter paradigm envisioned in all components of the \u2018Dream.\u2019 In other words, the \u2018Singapore Dream\u2019 has been a \u2018Nightmare\u2019 for those who were excluded from the concept\u2019s imagination, even though, ironically, the belief in the \u2018Singapore Dream\u2019 was an aspiration for \u2018Singaporeans.\u2019", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60323241, "asset_id": 40111218, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7827157, "first_name": "Esmond", "last_name": "Soh", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "EsmondSoh", "display_name": "Esmond C M Soh", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/EsmondSoh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7827157/19312496/19713163/s65_esmond.soh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38626109, "title": "'From Third World to First': A Case Study of Labor Laws in a Changing Singapore", "created_at": "2019-03-25T06:27:39.616-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38626109/From_Third_World_to_First_A_Case_Study_of_Labor_Laws_in_a_Changing_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38626109", "summary": "The aim of this article is to examine the shift in the policy underpinnings of labor law in Singapore, and how the Singapore legislature appears to have recalibrated the emphasis placed on the competing goals of labor law, to now develop local policies more tilted towards social justice. A former British colony, Singapore has developed its own sui generis jurisprudence, influenced by unique political, social and economic traits that have evolved diachronically as it has struggled to achieve independence and then emerge as a 'First World Economy' - which makes it an interesting contribution to existing literature on the 'purpose' of labor law. A collective laissez-faire approach in the 1950s was followed by a sharp turn towards pro-employer efficiency and flexibility in the labor market over job security from the 1960s to the 1980s, at which point an influx of foreign workers marked a transition in the labor force constitution. In contrast, since then, the 21st century has witnessed genuine institutional efforts to 'counteract the inequality of bargaining power' inherent in the employment relationship. The 2018 amendments proposed to the Employment Act indicate more focus towards 'worker protection'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58703435, "asset_id": 38626109, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2750822, "first_name": "Meera", "last_name": "Rajah", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MeeraRajah", "display_name": "Meera Rajah", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MeeraRajah?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2750822/892176/36857160/s65_meera.rajah.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29, "name": "Industrial And Labor Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_And_Labor_Relations?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 751, "name": "Labor Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Economics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19415, "name": "Labor History and Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_History_and_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 6391612, "title": "Political Prints in Singapore", "created_at": "2014-03-12T17:56:14.671-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6391612/Political_Prints_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_6391612", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33203601, "asset_id": 6391612, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6132275, "first_name": "Cheng Tju", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChengTjuLim", "display_name": "Cheng Tju Lim", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChengTjuLim?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 876, "name": "Print Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Print_Culture?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23426, "name": "Prints (Art History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prints_Art_History_?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 496971, "name": "Woodcuts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Woodcuts?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 41204719, "title": "Toward a History of Engaged Buddhism in Singapore", "created_at": "2019-12-06T09:47:47.494-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41204719/Toward_a_History_of_Engaged_Buddhism_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_41204719", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61443649, "asset_id": 41204719, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 258868, "first_name": "Jack Meng-Tat", "last_name": "Chia \u8b1d\u660e\u9054", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JackMengTatChia", "display_name": "Jack Meng-Tat Chia \u8b1d\u660e\u9054", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JackMengTatChia?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/258868/54913/95545755/s65_jack_meng-tat.chia_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4357, "name": "Engaged Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Engaged_Buddhism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4285020, "title": "The Singapore Straits in the Latter Middle Ages and Early Modern Period (c.13th to 17th Centuries).

and Singapore. The persistence of such concepts and practices has covertly implanted ideas in the contemporary mindset that Singaporean communities inherently lived separately and did not interact in any meaningful way. Except for the various Peranakan communities which predated British colonialism, there is little evidence in current scholarly research to show that consistent interaction, friendships, and even intermarriages took place in the first few decades following 1819. This article will examine new evidence about multiracial Roman Catholic communities, starting in the early 1830s, showing how intermarriages were extremely commonplace and possible reasons behind this development. This research also inadvertently uncovers the creation of a native Peranakan bloodline starting from 1833, specific to Singapore.

The British in the nineteenth century governed the Chinese communities in Singapore through the \u201cdivide and rule\u201d policy, which considered the mutually intelligence Chinese southern speech-groups as different \u201craces.\u201d But after Chinese nationalism turned to an anti-imperialist position in the 1920s, the British colonial census changed to view the Chinese as an integrated group. In contrast, the Japanese challenger had to deal consistently with the divergent Chinese reactions to its southward expansion. Japan thus learned to make use of the social cleavages that prevailed in the Chinese communities in the South Seas. With few exceptions, the postwar Asian studies however overlook the prewar Japanese paradigm. The continuing influence of the southern Chinese languages in maritime East and Southeast Asia nonetheless points out the limit of the pervasive assumption about a singular Chineseness.

First, Bukit Brown\u2019s authenticity is played out in its depiction as a heritage space. Such depictions are generally\nframed within a dichotomy of sites and in this particular case in distinction against the Gardens by the Bay, a billion-dollar state project in the downtown area, designed to give the city-state an international profile. The second way is as a green sanctuary through the naturalist\u2019s gaze. Finally, Bukit Brown is deemed authentic because it signifies cultural destruction and loss. The threat of destruction and loss conjures up cultural trauma which can be visited upon other cultural-ethnic heritage sites and thus serves as a cautionary tale to other ethnic groups. It is argued that these three discourses of authenticity enable Bukit Brown to transcend its ethnic origins, thus making it accessible to other ethnic groups who, though may not connect to it as intimately or culturally as ethnic Chinese, are able to incorporate the site in their national imaginary.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44153338, "asset_id": 23724750, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 518375, "first_name": "Terence", "last_name": "Chong", "domain_name": "iseas", "page_name": "TerenceChong", "display_name": "Terence Chong", "profile_url": "https://iseas.academia.edu/TerenceChong?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/25b62c366bde3bbe49037915646750f8?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 414900, "name": "Bukit Brown", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bukit_Brown?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 38932724, "title": "Sumber Sejarah Brunei di The National Archives United Kingdom", "created_at": "2019-04-25T20:36:04.563-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38932724/Sumber_Sejarah_Brunei_di_The_National_Archives_United_Kingdom?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38932724", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59034514, "asset_id": 38932724, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14751088, "first_name": "Nani", "last_name": "Suryani", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Nanisuryani35", "display_name": "Nani  Suryani", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Nanisuryani35?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14751088/4741176/18021693/s65_nani.suryani.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38743243, "title": "Too Young To Die: Giving New Lease of Life to Singapore\u2019s Modernist Icons", "created_at": "2019-04-08T11:05:32.938-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38743243/Too_Young_To_Die_Giving_New_Lease_of_Life_to_Singapore_s_Modernist_Icons?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38743243", "summary": "Three of Singapore\u2019s most iconic and historically-significant buildings from the post-independence era \u2014 Pearl Bank Apartments, People\u2019s Park Complex, and Golden Mile Complex, are at risk of collective sale and demolition.

Suryadinata makes the case in the book that as the PRC becomes more globally prominent, it is increasingly blurring lines in its treatment of PRC citizens and non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese overseas. This claim comes amid allegations of growing PRC efforts to mobilize ethnic Chinese communities abroad to serve its national interests, be they economic, political, or strategic. These concerns are not new and are in fact a throwback to the past. They give the book an added timeliness and importance.\nFor much of the Cold War, ethnic Chinese communities in non-communist parts of Southeast Asia faced the suspicion of being a possible subversive fifth column for the PRC, especially if they seemed left-leaning. Such perspectives diminished as the PRC engaged in economic reform from the late 1970s, eschewed radical revolution, and passed a nationality law in 1980 clearly demarcating non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese abroad from PRC citizens. Recent reports of PRC efforts to lobby and police opinion in foreign countries using members of local ethnic Chinese communities ranging from Europe and North America to Oceania and Southeast Asia have again brought these long-dormant issues to the fore.1 This is an issue on which Suryadinata has previously written, and he provides readers a brief reminder of these themes in Chapter 3.2 [End Page 151]\nAn Awkward Closeness\nSuryadinata organizes the book into four parts. Part I (Chapters 1\u20133) discusses the PRC's rise to prominence from the 1980s till the present, changes in ethnic Chinese communities outside the PRC, and the organization of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO). The OCAO is the government body responsible for managing official ties with ethnic Chinese communities outside the PRC, be they PRC citizens abroad or ethnic Chinese who do not hold PRC citizenship. Within these pages, Suryadinata introduces his main observation\u2014that Beijing seems to be reverting to its older policy of reducing distinctions between PRC citizens and non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese in foreign jurisdictions. The key motivation behind this move, according to Suryadinata, is PRC efforts to advance and protect its interests and concerns overseas.\nPart II (Chapters 4\u20138) examines how the PRC responds officially to events outside its borders that affect ethnic Chinese and PRC citizens. Each chapter contains a case where ethnic Chinese come under threat from developments outside China and assess the PRC position. Beijing's reaction to the 1998 anti-Chinese race riots in Indonesia and violence in the South Pacific, Middle East, and Africa indicates a willingness to evacuate PRC citizens, especially those who work for PRC state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The 2014 anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam, triggered by a Beijing-initiated escalation in its maritime dispute with Hanoi, suggests that the PRC is not above placing its citizens overseas in danger for the pursuit of more important interests.\nHowever, contrasting PRC responses to incidents involving ethnic Chinese in Malaysia and Myanmar point toward an evolution in Beijing's position. Beijing responded to alleged ill-treatment of its citizens by Malaysian police in 2005 as well as political pressure, even violence, toward ethnic Chinese Myanmar citizens in the Kokang region along the PRC border in 2015 with diplomatic entreaties. Such actions resulted from Beijing's desire to maintain positive official relations with Malaysia and Myanmar. Threats against ethnic Chinese Malaysians in 2015, in comparison, saw the then-PRC ambassador to Malaysia publicly expressing an intention to protect these co-ethnics even though this was tantamount to intervention and divided local opinion. This step appears to portend an effort by Beijing to extend influence over non-PRC citizen ethnic Chinese communities overseas, even at the risk of upsetting foreign governments.\nThe next four chapters in Part III examine the ways domestic considerations in the...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57007360, "asset_id": 37056621, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Yet the historiography is silent on their perspectives, values, and assumptions. Using contemporary Chinese- language sources, this article argues that in approaching merger, the Chinese were chiefly concerned with livelihoods, education, and citizenship rights; saw themselves as deserving of an equal place in Malaya; conceived of a new, distinctive, multiethnic Malayan identity; and rejected communist ideology. Meanwhile, the leaders of UMNO were intent on preserving their electoral dominance and the special position of Malays in the Federation. Finally, the leaders of the PAP were desperate to retain power and needed the Federation to remove their political opponents. The interaction of these three factors explains the shape, structure, and timing of merger.

Some of you may have even been through Singapore your way to somewhere else. For those who come to the city as tourists, they are likely to check out the famous Raffles Hotel. Here at one of Asia\u2019s finest addresses you will learn that the hotel has been named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, an agent of the East India Company in London, who founded the British trading post and settlement in 1819. Before Raffles arrived, it is said, there was nothing much on the island except a handful of fishermen and pirates. Singapore was a place forgotten by time.\r\nMy paper seriously challenges this view. If you attend my lecture, I want you to walk away knowing that Singapore has a longer and deeper history that predates 1819. Raffles did not discover either the location Singapore or its potential as a trading emporium: that had been recognized long before. As a second takeaway I want viewers to appreciate that Singapore was everything but a forgotten place before 1819 and that it fulfilled different functions at different times.

The memory of Zheng He and his legacy rooted in an anomalous series of sea expeditions makes him unique in Chinese history and speaks to contemporary issues of multiculturalism, ethnic hybridity, and the geopolitics of migration and diaspora. Kuo reappropriates the Zheng He theme to re-present the eunuch admiral as an ancient paradigm of the modern multicultural man in an increasingly transnational world. Scholars have noted the way Kuo uses storytelling to prompt people in Singapore to show a greater willingness to live together as a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation. However, I argue that the play\u2019s text reveals more somber and personal undercurrents, where Kuo draws upon an intimate understanding of the classical Chinese Zheng He story to record shrewd observations and articulate concealed shafts of criticism about Singapore\u2019s bureaucracy, intermingled with philosophical reflections addressing contemporary Sinophone lived reality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48867246, "asset_id": 28516708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33761858, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Leng", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "RachelLeng", "display_name": "Rachel Leng", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/RachelLeng?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33761858/9944794/36160202/s65_rachel.leng.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9801, "name": "Chinese Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language_and_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 15514, "name": "Contemporary Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 22123, "name": "Classical Chinese literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Chinese_literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 24550, "name": "Contemporary China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_China?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 27584, "name": "Chinese literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 34132, "name": "Chinese Modern Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Modern_Literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 39262, "name": "Sinophone Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone_Literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 60807, "name": "Maritime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 81388, "name": "Multiethnic Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiethnic_Literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 351900, "name": "Zheng He", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zheng_He?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 407650, "name": "Admiral Zheng He", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Admiral_Zheng_He?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 618429, "name": "Chinese Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 858132, "name": "Kuo Pao Kun", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kuo_Pao_Kun?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 960793, "name": "Diasporic and Sinophone Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporic_and_Sinophone_Writing?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1235192, "name": "Sinophone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 13369825, "title": "The Cosmopolitan Jazz Hero: Negotiating Class, Gender, Modernity and an Emerging Nation in 1960s Malay Films", "created_at": "2015-06-27T23:25:13.356-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13369825/The_Cosmopolitan_Jazz_Hero_Negotiating_Class_Gender_Modernity_and_an_Emerging_Nation_in_1960s_Malay_Films?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_13369825", "summary": "Two of the most well-known Malay films from the 1960s, Antara Dua Darjat (Between Two Classes, 1960) and Ibu Mertuaku (My Mother-in-law, 1962) feature \u2018jazz-heroes\u2019: a consummate jazz pianist and a tragically blind tenor saxophonist. During the 1960s, the vernacular Malay entertainment industry was based in Singapore; a cosmopolitan hub of international commerce and cultural exchange. In my paper, I consider how jazz-musician protagonists and their music articulated the concerns of an emerging nation and negotiated issues of class, gender and modernity in Malay \u2018social\u2019 films of the 1960s. This emerging genre of vernacular film, scripted and directed by local Malays, articulated the tensions and anxieties of a predominantly rural Malay community adapting to urban environments. Such films engaged progressive ideas about working-class rights and challenged Malay feudalistic elitism. I consider in the above mentioned films how \u2018jazzy\u2019 and cosmopolitan music negotiated the fissures between modernity and tradition, urban and rural, working-class and elites, autocracy and self-determination. P. Ramlee \u2013 an omnipresent national culture icon until present day - directed, starred, composed and performed music for both films. Both films feature musicians as a marginalised working class, performing for the elite classes in exclusive private parties or swanky nightclubs. In my intertextual historical-musical-narrative analysis, I note how the performance of jazz or jazz-like music allows such musicians to cross the class divide and Ramlee\u2019s \u2018jazz heroes\u2019 cross further by courting women from the elite classes with their music. In turn, these female protagonists in their class-defying romances articulate notions of self-determination and challenge the patriarchal orders of elite Malay society. I argue that \u2018jazz\u2019 on the Malay silver screen provided a cosmopolitan musical aesthetic for the imagining of new class and gender roles; resonating the zeitgeist of modern postcolonial nationhood in 1960s Singapore and Malaysia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38026697, "asset_id": 13369825, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 850081, "first_name": "Adil", "last_name": "Johan", "domain_name": "myum", "page_name": "AdilJohan", "display_name": "Adil Johan", "profile_url": "https://myum.academia.edu/AdilJohan?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/850081/301543/48839457/s65_adil.johan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 682, "name": "Jazz Studies And New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jazz_Studies_And_New_Media?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2601, "name": "Film Music And Sound", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Music_And_Sound?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5037, "name": "Historical Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Ethnomusicology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 17223, "name": "Jazz Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jazz_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 22805, "name": "Jazz History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jazz_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 26381, "name": "Film musicals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_musicals?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 28061, "name": "World music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_music?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 39323, "name": "Film Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Music?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 61734, "name": "P.

A popular tourist attraction as it may be, Kampong Gelam\u2019s rich history and heritage nevertheless extend well beyond the descriptions found in glossy tourism publicity blitz. More importantly, at the heart of it all, Kampong Gelam was home to modern Singapore\u2019s pioneers, entrepreneurs, craftsmen and residents including the author, Hidayah, who was born in Gedung Kuning (Yellow Mansion). \n\nISBN 978-981-11-5806-3\n\n- - - - - - - -\n'Leluhur: Singapore\u2019s Kampong Gelam' won the 2021 NUS Singapore History Prize.\nThere were 31 submissions and six shortlisted books. \n\nhttps://fass.nus.edu.sg/news/2021/09/09/book-on-history-of-kampong-gelam-clinches-nus-singapore-history-prize/\n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/kampong-glam-book-by-former-resident-hidayah-amin-wins-50k-singapore-history-prize\n\nhttps://www.straitstimes.com/life/arts/ordinary-lives-in-the-spotlight-on-nus-history-prize-shortlist\n\nhttps://news.nus.edu.sg/six-inspirational-works-make-the-shortlist-for-s50000-nus-singapore-history-prize/\n\n\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60139393, "asset_id": 39951587, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 446951, "first_name": "Hidayah", "last_name": "Amin", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "HidayahAmin", "display_name": "Hidayah Amin", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/HidayahAmin?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/446951/144735/49987227/s65_hidayah.amin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6735, "name": "Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 38023559, "title": "Voices from the Streets: Trends in Naming Practices of Singapore Odonymy", "created_at": "2018-12-21T19:35:33.208-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38023559/Voices_from_the_Streets_Trends_in_Naming_Practices_of_Singapore_Odonymy?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38023559", "summary": "Past studies on Singapore toponymy have mainly focused on etymological aspects of individual street names as distinct units, overlooking the relevance of naming practices across different languages. Singapore odonymy is still a largely unexplored field. An investigation into naming strategies in Singapore street names can provide deeper insights not only into the field of Historical Toponomastics, but also shed light on both the history of Toponymy in the local context and among different ethnic groups \"en masse\". This paper explores trends in naming practices in Singapore odonyms belonging to three different languages, namely English, Malay, and Chinese. A randomized sampling of 50 street names from each language was collected and analyzed according to specific naming strategies, highlighting the following categories: descriptive, commemorative, thematic, and borrowing. Results show tendencies towards naming strategies of commemoration and borrowing for English-derived odonyms, descriptive for Malay street names, and a strong preference for commemorative naming for the Chinese-derived ones. Further examination of the odonyms suggests a combination of social, political, and historical-geographical factors underlying these multi-faceted naming processes. This paper aims at being a starting point for a series of studies on the almost unexplored field of Singapore Toponymy, developed through an approach that considers the social and sociolinguistic perspectives besides the conventional historical and etymological methods.

The port and its facilities were significant enough to warrant the presence of a shahbandar, a \u201clord of the haven\u201d, whose existence and trade facilities are found in some crucial travelogues and cartographical specimens of the period. Deemed \u201cone of the best ports that serves the East Indies\u201d by the Flemish trader Jacques de Coutre, Singapore acted as a strategic choke point: It served as gatekeeper of the upstream towns of the Johor River, including Johor\u2019s royal administrative centre at Batu Sawar. Singapore\u2019s location along the busy Straits also made it an important nodal point in the transition from the South China Sea to the Melaka Straits and the Bay of Bengal. Due to these roles and its geographic location, it is unsurprising that the waters around Singapore became contested spaces. Moreover, the islands here and nearby featured regularly in plans of the early colonial powers to assert their dominance and project commercial hegemony across the region in the five decades from 1590 to 1640.

The task of providing a flat to citizens and permanent residents thanks to the efforts of a public institution has not only been one of pragmatic realism, or an aspect of the application of economic theories pertaining to the sphere of developmentalism, it also constituted a central feature in the collective project of a City-State in which social engineering was conceived as a global duty of the ruling party and comprised various aspects of the organization of everyday life, from urban planning to housing or from education to leisure and civic engagement. With about 80% of the population (5.5 million inhabitants in 2015) housed in flats built by the Housing and Development Board ( HDB), Singapore remains in 2015, in spite of the recent diversification of the housing market, one of the cities in the world in which the share of population housed in publicly built estates is the highest. 95% of the inhabitants of Singapore that are housed in such HDB flats, though, own them on a 99-year lease agreement. In the stronghold of capitalism in South-East Asia, social housing was conceived, since the time of independence, as a way to reinforce private property and the familial values that are attached to it. The object of the present paper is to analyse the evolution of this ideology of social housing in Singapore from the moment of the invention of the HDB as an instrument of national development and social balance to the period of the necessary adaptation of this heritage to the new needs that emerged twenty years after independence and up to more recent challenges posed by the concurrence of alternative models and social imaginaries of housing, such as those embodied by condominiums.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46758576, "asset_id": 17475711, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28968, "first_name": "Denis", "last_name": "Bocquet", "domain_name": "ensas", "page_name": "DenisBocquet", "display_name": "Denis Bocquet", "profile_url": "https://ensas.academia.edu/DenisBocquet?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28968/9439/435340/s65_denis.bocquet.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1143888, "name": "Singapore Housing Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Housing_Policy?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 12057982, "title": "From tents to picture palaces", "created_at": "2015-04-21T18:41:26.203-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12057982/From_tents_to_picture_palaces?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_12057982", "summary": "A survey of the early history of cinematography and the cinema business in Singapore, from the introduction of the kinetoscope in 1896 to the birth of Singapore's own film industry in the 1930s.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37383202, "asset_id": 12057982, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3386450, "first_name": "Bonny", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BonnyTan", "display_name": "Bonny Tan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BonnyTan?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3386450/1142961/1431785/s65_bonny.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 19258, "name": "Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 44387774, "title": "Compliant Singaporean Christians?

The COVID-19 pandemic supplies us with a unique window of opportunity to understand how Singaporean Christian groups have been compliant actors to the state's policies, even during this health crisis. By evaluating the differing responses of various churches and organisations, I argue that in spite of inadequacies in the state's public health and social measures, Christian leaders and groups crafted state-centred responses, and engaged in crisis-driven social action and the construction of state-affirming narratives within government-promoted boundaries. This also meant that Christians have projected an image of themselves as being socially-responsible Singaporeans who are willing to adhere to the government's crisis-mandated standards, while sacrificing their regular faith-based practices and physical gatherings for the greater good of the nation. The willingness to adhere to the single-party state's measures and boundaries has, nevertheless, disclosed the Christian community's inability to provide a critical voice about public health gaps and socio-economic injustices during this crisis. Secular civil-society groups and academics have filled this gap by highlighting these problems and criticising the government's failures.

The memory of Zheng He and his legacy rooted in an anomalous series of sea expeditions makes him unique in Chinese history and speaks to contemporary issues of multiculturalism, ethnic hybridity, and the geopolitics of migration and diaspora. Kuo reappropriates the Zheng He theme to re-present the eunuch admiral as an ancient paradigm of the modern multicultural man in an increasingly transnational world. Scholars have noted the way Kuo uses storytelling to prompt people in Singapore to show a greater willingness to live together as a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation. However, I argue that the play\u2019s text reveals more somber and personal undercurrents, where Kuo draws upon an intimate understanding of the classical Chinese Zheng He story to record shrewd observations and articulate concealed shafts of criticism about Singapore\u2019s bureaucracy, intermingled with philosophical reflections addressing contemporary Sinophone lived reality.

Cultivation connotes a delicate and systematic way of instilling life into Chinese education, much like what a farmer does by watering his growing plants. At the other end, cessation implies the complete and abrupt halt to the system of Chinese education, not unlike the act of eradicating a plant at its roots. The examination of the relationship between key players from the late 1960s to the early 1980s will shed light on the authenticity of such a hypothesis. The beginning of the collapse of Chinese education will be traced back to the pre-independence period while the merger of Nantah and University of Singapore represents the finality of that collapse.\n\nThe study examines the nature of actions and policies undertaken by the PAP government during the post-colonial period. Whether or not there was a deliberate plot by the government to neutralise Chinese education is a question that remains to be answered. To answer the questions, the correlation or causation between the crackdown on communists by the government and the collapse of Chinese education must be established.\n\nAs a matter of peripheral interest, the study will also analyse the Nanyang saga in the context of a harsh post-war Southeast Asian environment and the economic realities of the time. Hence, not only will policies by the PAP government be scrutinised as the same applies to the other factors singing tunes of harmony or discord in relation to these policies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49484483, "asset_id": 29034480, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3258729, "first_name": "Walter", "last_name": "Boo Keng Hua", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WalterBooKengHua", "display_name": "Walter Boo Keng Hua", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WalterBooKengHua?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3258729/1077569/9686765/s65_walter.boo_keng_hua.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5854192, "title": "\"Voids, Riverine and Otherwise\", Iconoclast (Cheo Chai-Hiang)", "created_at": "2014-01-27T00:05:03.682-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5854192/_Voids_Riverine_and_Otherwise_Iconoclast_Cheo_Chai_Hiang_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_5854192", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65652607, "asset_id": 5854192, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2648444, "first_name": "Louis", "last_name": "Ho", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LouisHo7", "display_name": "Louis Ho", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LouisHo7?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2648444/844434/4111271/s65_louis.ho.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20178, "name": "Conceptual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conceptual_Art?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 998282, "name": "Singapore Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 2351931, "title": "\u201cFlesh and Bone Reunite as One Body\u201d: Singapore\u2019s Chinese-speaking and their Perspectives on Merger", "created_at": "2013-01-02T10:59:19.323-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2351931/_Flesh_and_Bone_Reunite_as_One_Body_Singapore_s_Chinese_speaking_and_their_Perspectives_on_Merger?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_2351931", "summary": "Singapore\u2019s Chinese speakers played the determining role in Singapore\u2019s merger with the Federation.

Using contemporary Chinese- language sources, this article argues that in approaching merger, the Chinese were chiefly concerned with livelihoods, education, and citizenship rights; saw themselves as deserving of an equal place in Malaya; conceived of a new, distinctive, multiethnic Malayan identity; and rejected communist ideology. Meanwhile, the leaders of UMNO were intent on preserving their electoral dominance and the special position of Malays in the Federation. Finally, the leaders of the PAP were desperate to retain power and needed the Federation to remove their political opponents. The interaction of these three factors explains the shape, structure, and timing of merger.

Compared to other countries in Asia and the\nPacific, Singapore has been more open to external ideas and practices of mental health. On the one hand, in both the colonial and postcolonial periods, Singapore has had a diverse multicultural population, which\nhistorically comprised migrants from different parts of Asia and beyond, and which held different views of mental illness. On the other hand, the dominant model of mental health and psychiatry in the city-state is\nthe western one: namely the British influence in the colonial and immediate post-independence periods, and increasingly from the Second World War, the prevailing American model. Thus, the openness of Singapore to western ideas and expertise, while beneficial in some aspects, is not without difficulty and ambivalence. The shift from asylum-based institutionalization to community psychiatry and the recognized\nimportance of mental health are definite signs of progress. However, the continuing dominance of western frameworks of psychiatry ignores both the rich experience of clinicians based in Singapore as well as the varied customary ways in which Singaporeans have viewed and treated mental illness. History thus provides insights not only into the social impact of a western-centered psychiatry in Singapore. It also highlights the need for a more grounded paradigm that is appropriately attuned to local circumstances and experiences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52298626, "asset_id": 31723103, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 788580, "first_name": "Kah Seng", "last_name": "Loh", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "KahSengLoh", "display_name": "Kah Seng Loh", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/KahSengLoh?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/788580/267997/316725/s65_kah_seng.loh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 635, "name": "Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychiatry?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2827, "name": "Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mental_Health?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 11893816, "title": "Casting Singapore\u2019s History in the Longue Dur\u00e9e", "created_at": "2015-04-10T23:18:37.216-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11893816/Casting_Singapore_s_History_in_the_Longue_Dur%C3%A9e?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_11893816", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37272524, "asset_id": 11893816, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23048684, "first_name": "Derek", "last_name": "Heng", "domain_name": "nau", "page_name": "DerekHeng", "display_name": "Derek  Heng", "profile_url": "https://nau.academia.edu/DerekHeng?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 455099, "name": "Post Colonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Colonial_Theory?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 8681191, "title": "Singapura in Early Modern Cartography: A Sea of Challenges", "created_at": "2014-10-07T18:38:32.074-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8681191/Singapura_in_Early_Modern_Cartography_A_Sea_of_Challenges?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_8681191", "summary": "This book chapter explores how Singapore is featured and understood on early modern maps of Chinese, Turkish, Arabic and European provenance.

Its unexceptional presence belies a rich cartographical history and infamous reputation for leading ships to grief since antiquity. Pedra Branca was first pushed into the spotlight when the British constructed the Horsburgh Lighthouse in 1851. It later caught international attention when a heated territorial dispute for the island between Singapore and Malaysia arose, lasting from 1979 to 2018, with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) eventually granting rights to Singapore. The ensuing legal battle led to renewed interest in the geography and post-19th century history of the island. The most recent breakthrough, however, provides a glimpse into an even earlier history of Pedra Branca - and, by extension, Singapore - as shipwrecked remains dating from the 14th century were uncovered in the surrounding waters. Historical research on the ancient history of Pedra Branca has been mostly neglected by scholars over the years; thus, this paper aims to shed some light on this enigmatic history of the island and at the same time establish its history and significance by utilizing pre-British-colonization historical cartographical data from as early as the 15th century.

Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand carry the impression that they are the origins of cheap, sometimes easily exploitable, migrant labor for employers in Taiwan. Many people in Taiwan also see the former two countries as sources of brides for lower-income men. These same countries, along with Cambodia and, to a lesser degree, Malaysia, are locations where Taiwanese capital is invested in factories for low-cost labor, proximity to Taiwan and China, and the relative absence of political contentiousness for being Taiwanese. With the advent of cheap air travel, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also offer the middle class in these areas options for quick holiday getaways. These interactions and the condescension toward Southeast Asia that sometimes accompany them belie the rich history of interactions that Taiwan and Southeast Asia share.\n\nhttp://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=831", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55538728, "asset_id": 35667987, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

"dom_id": "work_35130828", "summary": "This dissertation investigates the role of certain factors in key decisions made for Singapore\u2019s survival and development in the period following the Second World War. The relationship between these factors and their respective decisions is examined, and a model of cause-and-effect is proposed to provide analysis to substantiate the arguments made.\nThe dissertation follows Singapore\u2019s separations from the three \u2018empires\u2019 of Japan, Britain, and Malaysia. The main themes of each \u2018empire\u2019 are examined: first, after the Japanese Occupation, the importance of providing social welfare and the background that made it necessary is discussed; secondly, the role of the communist threat on the decision for a Singapore-Malaya merger is examined; and finally, following Singapore\u2019s separation from Malaysia, the decision to implement National Service is analysed, both as an essential defence policy and as a means to build a common national identity.\n\nIt is argued that, counter to most previous research which has suggested that Singapore\u2019s success can be attributed to, almost exclusively, successful economic policies, the relationship between Singapore\u2019s varying social and political environments since the end of the Second World War and the resulting decisions made, did indeed have a significant impact on Singapore\u2019s overall development and\nsuccess.\n\nThe aim is to answer the question of why the particular decisions that\nwere made was imperative for Singapore\u2019s survival and success, at each distinct period, through an analysis of the factors that made them necessary. Rather than the three periods themselves being the focus, this dissertation is written in the perspective of their influence on the decisions and ultimately the outcomes after the periods occurred. The very path that Singapore took to gain independence significantly contributed to not only its extraordinary developmental success, but also to the very survival of the little red dot.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54992206, "asset_id": 35130828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22742236, "first_name": "Divya", "last_name": "Radhakrishnan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DivyaRadhakrishnanIR", "display_name": "Divya Radhakrishnan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DivyaRadhakrishnanIR?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22742236/11188082/18471955/s65_divya.radhakrishnan.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 954124, "name": "Singapore Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25131673, "title": "John Turnbull Thomson and the Hikayat Abdullah", "created_at": "2016-05-08T08:51:28.598-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25131673/John_Turnbull_Thomson_and_the_Hikayat_Abdullah?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_25131673", "summary": "Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir Munshi (commonly known as Munshi Abdullah), the prolific nineteenth-century Malay writer and teacher, is hailed today as Malaysia and Singapore\u2019s father of modern Malay literature and reformer.

This seeming paradox sits uneasily at the heart of Singapore historiography, and over time historians have suggested a variety of ways to resolve it. This volume collects studies about Singapore before 1800 bringing together different efforts across the 20th century at reconstructing Singapore\u2019s \u201cmissing years\u201d. Some authors have found additional details by scouring ancient and early modern texts for references to Singapore, and by reading well-known classics such as the Sejarah Melayu against the grain. Others have built narratives that bridge pre- and post-1800 perspectives by positioning Singapore within long-term global history. These efforts have yielded a much richer understanding of Singapore\u2019s changing fortunes before 1800. The articles collected in this volume represent key milestones in this effort.

Based upon a collection of policy texts from 2002 to 2012, our analysis illustrates that the metaphor of diversity in policy texts provides ways for systemic discrimination within the education system and that this inequality is given legitimacy as necessary through various moral discourses. The paper employs a critical discourse analysis that draws upon the relationship between language analysis, the philosophical study of valuation, and political economy as a composite formulation of values to highlight the ways in which an argument for inequality permeates policy from within a frame of meritocracy, and to analyse how changes associated with new modes of value determination serve to legitimize inequality.\r\n\r\n1. The article questions and challenges the official meritocratic principle of \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 (Wong, 2000) in Singapore's education system. Drawing on Foucault's and Nietzsche's philosophical perspectives, there is an explicit illustration through an in-depth analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in policy report/speech.\r\n\r\n2. Discourse builds in/tangible structures in society and greatly determines the possibilities of the now. As such, I am also arguing that it would be more difficult to 'help' any 'community' if the structural discrimination which has been deeply embedded, is not made explicit through national policies, and by this I mean an explicit illustration through an in-depth policy analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in Singapore's education policies. It may be through this that discriminatory structures could be substantially challenged.\r\n\r\nAn initial analysis of the original 1979 policy on primary school streaming which I conducted illustrates how dichotomous (arbitrary) categorization of pupils, i.e. 'slow' and 'fast' learners legitimates and sustains increasing institutional/structural access (over the years terms like 'talents' have been employed in policy discourse), of who gets privileged knowledge access. Through this, I also ask then to what ends do forms of 'categorization' or conventional designation entail? By this, given that categorization legitimizes structural access, my question is, what is 'Malay/Muslim community' and how is this categorization necessary?\r\n\r\n3. Even though the analysis in the article was based on Singapore's education system, it provides possible ways of understanding how inequality is continuously being inbuilt through policies on the basis of the ideology that economic growth is the (only) way forward. A way to critique this ideology is to expose its underlying assumptions. I believe the findings have much resonance with the widening inequality across many developed nations, as Singapore's policies have parallels with that of the U.K., U.S., and international organizations such as the World Bank.\r\n\r\n4. Economically considered, the transliteration of meritocratic discourse into the metaphor of diversity pinpoints how the appeal of development for all necessarily also demands the advance of inequity for the sake of the whole, i.e. advancing the 'growth with inequity' principle.\r\n\r\n5. The analysis highlights that value judgments are continually at work in the policy discourse and that despite the strong discourse of meritocracy that the Singapore education system promotes, it is argued that it is in the interests of the Singapore people that 'talents' should get privileged access to knowledge as it is through this that more 'opportunities' for the rest of the population are created. The findings demonstrate that although the underlying assumptions of this 'logic' that has been constructed in policies are unsubstantiated, the logic is continuously legitimated through forms of e/valuations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article has been featured in websites such as:

City. Diverging from more micro reconstruction-based toponymic approaches, the analysis adopts a critical toponomastics framework, placing emphasis on the interaction between the use and maintenance of toponyms and the wider socio-political context. Acknowledging the complex past of Singapore\u2019s becoming, the period of British colonial rule forms the basis in which contemporary toponyms are treated in the study. Both old and newly reclaimed offshore islands are considered, and this article ultimately finds Singapore\u2019s toponymic landscape to have remained relatively stable. The stasis does not represent a lack of development, for it instead reveals that the unchanging naming practices are in fact responses to socio-political contexts diachronically unveiled between colonial and contemporary Singapore. Situating toponomastics within the wider development of Singapore as the post-colonial nation it is today, this paper reveals how the landscape has sought to cement social, economic, and political goals.\n\nKey words: Historical Toponomastics, Island Toponymy, Toponymic Landscapes, Singapore, Colonial Place Names", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75914564, "asset_id": 63503877, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4424566, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Perono Cacciafoco", "domain_name": "xjtlu", "page_name": "FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco", "display_name": "Francesco Perono Cacciafoco", "profile_url": "https://xjtlu.academia.edu/FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4424566/1801903/2148322/s65_francesco.perono_cacciafoco.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2717, "name": "Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etymology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3904, "name": "Onomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4469, "name": "Toponomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponomastics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 13239, "name": "Place Names (Cultural Geography)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Names_Cultural_Geography_?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 16337, "name": "Lexicography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lexicography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 34818, "name": "Toponymy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponymy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 90016, "name": "Topography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Topography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 130755, "name": "Names", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Names?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 130809, "name": "Place Names", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Names?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 174666, "name": "Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islands?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 444741, "name": "Onomastics, Toponomastics, Hydronyms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics_Toponomastics_Hydronyms?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 38230134, "title": "Chinese Evangelistic Bands in Nanyang: Leona Wu and the Implementation of the John Sung-Inspired Evangelistic Band Model in Pre-War Singapore", "created_at": "2019-01-27T08:28:38.481-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38230134/Chinese_Evangelistic_Bands_in_Nanyang_Leona_Wu_and_the_Implementation_of_the_John_Sung_Inspired_Evangelistic_Band_Model_in_Pre_War_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38230134", "summary": "This paper explores the history of the evangelistic bands which John Sung established in Singapore.

Importantly, it looks at the role of the much-neglected Leona Wu in leading the bands and founding Chin Lien in Singapore. The paper demonstrates that local agents like Wu and the Chinese church leaders played an important role in shaping the ecclesiastical scene in Singapore through their usage of Sung\u2019s institutional model to meet local needs. It also shows that we cannot merely understand the influence and impact of John Sung through an \u201cimpact-response\u201d framework which over-exaggerates the results of his work; rather a more balanced approach needs to be taken in order to comprehend how local agents like Wu were crucial in mediating and adapting Sung\u2019s work for their own agendas and purposes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60821458, "asset_id": 38230134, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35491773, "first_name": "Joshua Dao Wei", "last_name": "SIM", "domain_name": "hkbu", "page_name": "JoshuaDaoWeiSIM", "display_name": "Joshua Dao Wei SIM", "profile_url": "https://hkbu.academia.edu/JoshuaDaoWeiSIM?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35491773/10314819/32240974/s65_joshua_dao_wei.sim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16833, "name": "Evangelicalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evangelicalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19227, "name": "World Christianity and Chinese Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Christianity_and_Chinese_Christianity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25719, "name": "Religious History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43521, "name": "Religious Fundamentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Fundamentalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 54261, "name": "Fundamentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fundamentalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 68163, "name": "World Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Christianity?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 297866, "name": "Chinese and Transnational Modernisms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Transnational_Modernisms?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 510588, "name": "Chinese Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Christianity?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1991087, "name": "John Sung", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Sung?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2901599, "name": "Leona Wu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leona_Wu?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3406101, "name": "Jia Yuming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jia_Yuming?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 37593005, "title": "Resilience of the Straits Settlement Chinese Business Community during the Great Depression Years", "created_at": "2018-10-16T01:53:30.048-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37593005/Resilience_of_the_Straits_Settlement_Chinese_Business_Community_during_the_Great_Depression_Years?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_37593005", "summary": "This paper seeks to provide insights on the impact, then resilience of Chinese business communities alongside the recovery process in the Straits Settlement economies during the Great Depression years, with particular focus on Singapore.

Tahun ini pula (2015), yakni bersamaan perayaan ulangtahun kemerdekaan Singapura yang ke-50 atau SG50, sebuah pameran dengan judul yang sama, serta sebuah lelaman web mengenai sejarah Singapura yang memuatkan rentetan peristiwa sebelum 1819 juga telah dilancarkan.\n\nSebenarnya sejarah pra-kolonial Singapura telah lama diberi perhatian para pengkaji Barat zaman kolonial sejak tahun 1930-an.Sejarah awal Singapura juga telahpun dikemukakan melalui kumpulan makalah dalam penerbitan khas tahun 1969 (Sheppard 1969) sempena ulang tahun ke-50 \u201ctertubuhnya\u201d Singapura oleh Raffles pada 1819; ia kemudian diterbitkan kembali tahun 1973, dan dicetak ulang tahun 1982 dan 1984.\n\nNamun dalam zaman pasca-merdeka, pensejarahan yang merangkumi zaman awal ini telah diketepikan dan hanya diberi perhatian kembali baru-baru ini. \n\nSemenjak tahun 1980-an pula, penulisan sejarah tempatan dalam bahasa Inggeris mula mengalihkan pandangannya daripada kisah-kisah yang berkisar sekitar pemerintahan kolonial sahaja kepada sejarah masyarakat kolonial yang majmuk.Pergerakan ini diberi nama \u2018people\u2019s history\u2019 (sejarah rakyat), \u2018social history\u2019 (sejarah masyarakat), dan sebagainya. \n\nSeiring dengan dua perkembangan ini, makalah ini menyampaikan dua sudut pandang: pertama sejarah pra-kolonial (pra-1819) dari sastera Melayu lama, dan kedua gambaran masyarakat Melayu kota di Singapura dari zaman kolonial sehingga tahun 1960-an yang tercatat dalam sastera Melayu cetak batu abad ke-19, sastera transisi seperti Hikayat Abdullah, Syair Dagang Berjualbeli, dan Tuhfat al-Nafis, serta sastera moden semenjak abad ke-20.

"dom_id": "work_34357691", "summary": "The origin of the British railway system in the Malay Peninsula can be traced to the laying of its first tracks between Taiping and Port Weld in Perak, 1885. It was to take another half a century before the extent of the network in the British protectorate was reached in full. Together with the technologies of steamship and telegraph, the railway revolutionized transportation and communications in the nineteenth century. Its significance within the imperial framework is generally perceived to lie in accelerating economic exploitation and growth as an enhancement of existing infrastructures for agriculture, industry and trade. As some historians have noted, the development of railways in British Malaya was indeed closely connected to the tin and rubber industries and the emergence of an export economy situated on the western coast of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, this thesis argues that the railway functioned not just as a tool which served the colonial economy but also served as an instrument of imperial rule in British Malaya as well. British imperial rule in the Federated Malay States (FMS) was consolidated through the establishment of a railway system that connected its constituent states together into a political unit, whereupon the Federated Malay States Railway (FMSR) facilitated in the dissemination of British authority. As the railway became a site of imperial contest and control over sovereignty in the Unfederated Malay States (UMS), the assertion of British dominance over the peninsula railway facilitated in drawing these states into the orbit of British imperialism. At the same time, the railway also became a cultural technology of rule as it diminished the indigenous political system of the kerajaan in the Malay states. Consequently, this thesis asserts the importance of imperial institutions such as the railway in the creation of European empires during the late nineteenth century.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54248607, "asset_id": 34357691, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 371409, "first_name": "Tse Siang", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "TseSiangLim", "display_name": "Tse Siang Lim", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/TseSiangLim?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/371409/99250/34186667/s65_tse_siang.lim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32932769, "title": "The Doctor Turned Diplomat: John Crawfurd's Writings on the Malay Peninsula, Biblioasia Apr-Jun 2017", "created_at": "2017-05-10T01:08:15.236-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32932769/The_Doctor_Turned_Diplomat_John_Crawfurds_Writings_on_the_Malay_Peninsula_Biblioasia_Apr_Jun_2017?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_32932769", "summary": "John Crawfurd, the 19th-century British colonial administrator in Southeast Asia, was known for his insightful writings on ethnology and history in the Malay Peninsula.

Singapore and Seoul are known for their rapid economic growth and urbanisation under a strong control of developmental state in the past. However, these cities are at a critical crossroads of societal transformation, where participatory and community-based urban development is gaining importance. This new approach can be seen as a result of a changing relationship between the state and civil society, where an emerging partnership between both aims to overcome the limitations of earlier urban development. The book draws attention to the possibilities and challenges that these cities face while moving towards a more inclusive and socially sustainable post-developmental urbanisation. By applying a comparative perspective to understand the evolving urban paradigms in Singapore and Seoul, this unique and timely book offers insights for scholars, professionals and students interested in contemporary Asian urbanisation and its future trajectories.\n\nhttp://www.springer.com/us/book/9789811019852", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51696489, "asset_id": 31300973, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5412308, "first_name": "Bla\u017e", "last_name": "Kri\u017enik", "domain_name": "hanyang", "page_name": "blaz", "display_name": "Bla\u017e Kri\u017enik", "profile_url": "https://hanyang.academia.edu/blaz?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5412308/6484843/7333703/s65_bla_.kri_nik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3470, "name": "Community Engagement & Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Engagement_and_Participation?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3902, "name": "Korean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6422, "name": "Urban Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Regeneration?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8223, "name": "East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 19298, "name": "Community Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Participation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25072, "name": "Social sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_sustainability?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 28849, "name": "Urban Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Development?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 35646, "name": "Community Empowerment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Empowerment?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 272073, "name": "Seoul", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seoul?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 12497561, "title": "Merlionicity: The twenty first century elaboration of a Singaporean symbol", "created_at": "2015-05-20T16:18:24.795-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12497561/Merlionicity_The_twenty_first_century_elaboration_of_a_Singaporean_symbol?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_12497561", "summary": "Designed in 1964 as a symbol for the (then) fledgling Singaporean tourism industry that reflected Singapore\u2019s maritime heritage, the Merlion \u2013 a figure comprising a lower half fish and upper half lion \u2013 has become a widely recognized icon of the modern island-state.

The first were descendants of Chinese sea-faring merchants who settled in the Nanyang colonies such as Batavia (Jakarta) and Penang and Malacca, where some of the earliest portraits still survive. The Straits Chinese did not only established themselves in the Straits Settlements but also in many parts of the archipelago where they were equally as prominent and firmly established. Hence, Colonial Singapore and the Straits Settlements cannot be talked about separate from other Straits Chinese communities from other colonies. The paintings and photographs in the NUS Museum Straits Chinese Collection and the Peranakan Museum\u2019s Straits Chinese Chinese portrait collections has formed most of the content of this study.  As these are the first of these types of pictures to be studied and seen rigorously, this study is limited to portraits of the early Chinese residents in Singapore and the older colonial settlements such as Malacca, Penang and Java. Although there is to be found, some portraits of Arabs, Chettiars, Malays and Europeans, they will not be included in the scope of this study. The Chinese, being the most populous of the groups, have provided for the bulk of surviving examples of portraits were produced by Chinese artists as well as portraits depicting the Chinese. \n\nThis early period of artistic production that warrants requisite attention and should be situated at the very threshold of early modernities in Singapore\u2019s History of Art. A revision of this historiography is therefore deservedly requisite. In addition, the development of artistic practices in Singapore have undeniably inextricable connections to the artistic practices in her neighboring countries, hence must be articulated not by national narratives nor circumscribed by national borders. These recent discoveries of early pictures germane to this study will therefore be a pioneering attempt at establishing a new framework for Singapore\u2019s History of Art.\n\n",

Japanese intellectuals requisitioned by the Army were put in charge of conducting the propaganda and cultural policies in Syonan-to, which is the war-time name of Japanese-occupied Singapore. This paper examines some aspects of Japanese cultural policies in Syonan-to with a focus on a Japanese cartoonist Matsushita Kikuo. In particular, it aims to highlight the natures and the boundaries of the cultural policies in Syonan-to through exploring Matsushita\u2019s works.\r\n\r\nAfter the breakout of the Pacific War, Matsushita was sent to Singapore to work for the fine art section of the Propaganda Department and later moved to Borneo. In Singapore, he drew cartoons and illustrations for a Chinese newspaper the Syonan Jit Poh (Zhaonan Ribao) and an English newspaper the Syonan Times. In 1944 he published a book of drawings, Minami wo Mitekure (Look at South), which he created based on his experiences in Southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nMatsushita\u2019s Minami wo Mitekure contains a series of episodes from his own experiences in Syonan-to, Sumatra and Borneo with many illustrations. Although he called this book of drawings \u201cpolitical cartoons\u201d, its focus is on the unique exotic scenes he got interested in rather than political and military issues. Similarly, the central subject matter of his cartoons and illustrations in the two newspapers published in Syonan-to was not the Japanese people who were expected to lead the Empire but the local people. Even in the illustration of the enemies, he\r\ndid not draw the Japanese soldiers who beat them. Rather, the cultures and the products he encountered in Southeast Asia were his major concerns in his works.\r\n\r\nMost of Matsushita\u2019s works are, regardless of the clich\u00e9 of war propaganda in his statement and in his Minami wo Mitekure, non-political. The propaganda policies in Syonan-to lacked consistent principles, as it primarily depended on the personality and ability of each intellectual. Thus, Matsushita\u2019s war-time works reflect his way of conveying a Japanese intellectual\u2019s perception of Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37204727, "asset_id": 11786903, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4918340, "first_name": "Masakazu", "last_name": "Matsuoka", "domain_name": "geidai", "page_name": "MasakazuMatsuoka", "display_name": "Masakazu Matsuoka", "profile_url": "https://geidai.academia.edu/MasakazuMatsuoka?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4918340/2120559/2490783/s65_masakazu.matsuoka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 387, "name": "Japanese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6000, "name": "Manga and Anime Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manga_and_Anime_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15701, "name": "Modern Japanese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Japanese_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 66979, "name": "Cartoons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartoons?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 82000803, "title": "An Institution for Independence", "created_at": "2022-06-21T11:25:00.089-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82000803/An_Institution_for_Independence?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_82000803", "summary": "Edited by Beatriz Colomina, Ignacio G.

When it comes to the actual course of events, however, existing narratives tend to describe the abortive revolts as ill-prepared, poorly organised and easily suppressed \u2013 and consequently, of limited impact in shaking the foundation of the Dutch colonial regime. It is also commonly understood that in the aftermath of the rebellions, dutch authorities dealt a crushing blow to the pki and its associated organisations by carrying out large-scale arrests, imprisonments, executions, and banishments. Beyond these facts, however, very little attention has been paid to the deeper meanings that the revolt revealed. as the following sections will demonstrate, the movement created enormous anxiety in the NEI which forced the Dutch colonial government to act with a strong hand. moreover, with frequent exchanges of information and personnel across the Malacca Straits, the NEI uprisings also generated considerable uneasiness in British Malaya.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55883704, "asset_id": 35998143, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 335629, "first_name": "Kankan", "last_name": "Xie", "domain_name": "pku", "page_name": "KankanXie", "display_name": "Kankan  Xie", "profile_url": "https://pku.academia.edu/KankanXie?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/335629/92861/23697031/s65_kankan.xie.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 253522, "name": "Dutch East Indies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_Indies?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 10108325, "title": "History of Music Space at The Substation", "created_at": "2015-01-11T03:12:20.622-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10108325/History_of_Music_Space_at_The_Substation?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_10108325", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36227733, "asset_id": 10108325, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2108071, "first_name": "Jun Kai", "last_name": "POW", "domain_name": "nlb", "page_name": "JunPow", "display_name": "Jun Kai POW", "profile_url": "https://nlb.academia.edu/JunPow?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2108071/685862/18499773/s65_jun.pow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 3243559, "title": "Social Discourse and Economic Functions: The Singapore Chinese in Japan\u2019s Southward Expansion,  1914-1941", "created_at": "2013-04-08T05:37:54.158-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3243559/Social_Discourse_and_Economic_Functions_The_Singapore_Chinese_in_Japan_s_Southward_Expansion_1914_1941?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_3243559", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31101019, "asset_id": 3243559, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1423384, "first_name": "Huei-Ying", "last_name": "Kuo", "domain_name": "johnshopkins", "page_name": "HueiYingKuo", "display_name": "Huei-Ying Kuo", "profile_url": "https://johnshopkins.academia.edu/HueiYingKuo?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1423384/512813/38407118/s65_huei-ying.kuo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 110154, "name": "Japanese Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Imperialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 131705, "name": "Taiwan History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 298048, "name": "Racial Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Discourse?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1033501, "name": "Inter Asian Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inter_Asian_Trade?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 74121357, "title": "The Loss of the RMS Empress of Asia in the Battle for Singapore", "created_at": "2022-03-20T03:41:08.768-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74121357/The_Loss_of_the_RMS_Empress_of_Asia_in_the_Battle_for_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_74121357", "summary": "The Empress of Asia was originally a luxury ocean liner.

The country has experienced many political and social transitions from British colonialism to attaining independence in 1965 and thereafter. Since independence, English-based bilingualism has been vigorously promoted as part of nation-building. While the roles of the multiple languages in use in Singapore feature prominently in the discourse on language planning, historical records show no mention of how these impacts on the deaf community. The first documented deaf person in archival documents is a Chinese deaf immigrant from Shanghai who established the first deaf school in Singapore in 1954 teaching Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) and Mandarin. Since then, the Singapore deaf community has seen many shifts and transitions in education programming for deaf children, which has also been largely influenced by exogeneous factors such as trends in deaf education in the United States A pivotal change that has far-reaching impact on the deaf community today, is the introduction of Signing Exact English (SEE) in 1976. This was in keeping with the statal English-based bilingual narrative. The subsequent decision to replace SSL with SEE has dramatic consequences for the current members of the deaf community resulting in internal divisions and fractiousness with lasting implications for the cohesion of the community. This publication traces the origins of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) by giving readers (and future scholars) a road map on key issues and moments in this history. Bi- and multi-lingualism in Singapore as well as external forces will also be discussed from a social and historical perspective, along with the interplay of different forms of language ideologies. All the different sign languages and sign systems as well as the written/spoken languages used in Singapore, interact and compete with as well as influence each other. There will be an exploration of how both internal factors (local language ecology) and external factors (international trends and developments in deaf education), impact on how members of the deaf community negotiate their deaf identities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80471300, "asset_id": 70919278, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18155523, "first_name": "Phoebe", "last_name": "Tay", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "PhoebeTay", "display_name": "Phoebe Tay", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/PhoebeTay?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18155523/5067956/17781849/s65_phoebe.tay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10632, "name": "World Englishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Englishes?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17292, "name": "Deaf Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deaf_Education?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36467, "name": "Language Ideologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Ideologies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 117612, "name": "Deaf history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deaf_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 380069, "name": "Linguistic Imperialism in Postcolonial Era and Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Imperialism_in_Postcolonial_Era_and_Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 49161611, "title": "Teaching History with Virtual Field Trips", "created_at": "2021-06-07T14:00:01.207-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49161611/Teaching_History_with_Virtual_Field_Trips?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_49161611", "summary": "Presentation at Singapore Teacher Conference 2021 on the use of Virtual Field Trip in the history classroom.

The two states enjoy excellent economic ties, which have been a key feature of bilateral interactions since the PRC\u2019s \u201cOpening and Reform\u201d initiative in the late 1970s. Substantial cultural, educational and tourist exchanges are also a feature of Singapore\u2013PRC relations. Yet diplomatic ties have only recently reverted to a general cordiality after a protracted two-year period of friction. There have been other, longer periods of estrangement between Singapore and Beijing \u2013 Singapore discouraged its citizens from having contact with the PRC during the Cultural Revolution and established official ties with the PRC only in 1992.\n\nSingapore and the PRC are deeply economically intertwined. The PRC is Singapore\u2019s largest trading partner, as well as being the largest of the other member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As a major international capital exporter, Singapore is the PRC\u2019s second-largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI). Singaporean investments in the PRC include major government-linked development projects in Suzhou, Tianjin and Chengdu, in addition to regular commercial interests. Globalized production and capital networks mean that the Singaporean and Chinese economies also connect through other economies in the region and beyond.\n\nWhat must be noted, however, is the diversification of Singapore\u2019s economy: ASEAN, the United States, Europe and Japan remain substantial trading partners for Singapore. Moreover, the United States, Europe and Japan are still larger investors in Singapore than the PRC in terms of both FDI and capital stock. Even if some proportion of trade and investment tilts more favourably towards the PRC, especially as Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) gets underway, Singapore is likely to continue to seek economic options beyond the PRC. These relationships provide Singapore with some buffer against overdependence on the PRC.\n\nThe BRI obviously presents opportunities for Singapore. Indeed, Singapore was one of the earliest members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which is associated with the project. To the extent that infrastructure development promotes growth in Singapore\u2019s immediate neighbourhood, this could raise demand for Singaporean goods and services. Prosperous neighbours are likely to be more invested in regional security. Of course, Hong Kong is likely to offer competition to Singapore, particularly in terms of financial and finance-related services. Moreover, Singapore\u2019s economy has been diversifying away from maritime services \u2014 they now account for only about 7 percent of GDP. This mitigates some of the pressure resulting from enhancements in regional transport infrastructure.\n\nExternalities that could result from the BRI may be cause for greater concern. Economic benefits from the initiative that flow to various business and political elites in Southeast Asia may make the establishment of consensus more difficult among ASEAN members, particularly over issues that Beijing deems sensitive. Limited transparency and unclear corporate governance in the BRI projects may encourage rent-seeking and abuse, as well as distributions of costs and benefits that foster political instability. Furthermore, uncertainty over dispute management stemming from investment projects introduces higher degrees of risk in such projects. \u201cWin\u2013win\u201d approaches and \u201csetting differences aside\u201d are fine until problems that require urgent management or resolution emerge.\n\nRules, procedures, norms, laws, processes, and their practice, especially as they pertain to strategic restraint by the powerful, are especially important to Singapore. This is an area of some divergence between Beijing and Singapore. Singapore tends to favour stronger, binding processes that guarantee a degree of even-handedness.\n\nAn area where Singapore\u2013PRC differences over rules and processes are especially noticeable is over the rule of law in the South China Sea. When the Philippines sought an interpretation from an arbitral tribunal over claims on maritime features in waters it disputes with Beijing, the PRC called the processes flawed, refused direct participation and rejected the ruling of the tribunal. Singapore, in comparison, stressed the importance of the legal process and the binding nature of its findings even though it is not a South China Sea claimant. Rather, Singapore felt that complying with such internationally established legal procedures offered a better means of handling differences, maintaining stability and protecting its interests. A similar distinction appears to divide Singapore and the PRC over the degree to which a South China Sea code of conduct should be binding. Such differences recently presented key points of contention and friction between the PRC and Singapore.\n\nMore knotty for Singapore is, perhaps, the way ethnicity intersects with PRC nationalism. Given that Singapore\u2019s population is 70 per cent ethnic Han Chinese, many PRC citizens and even officials believe that Singapore should be particularly understanding of, if not sympathetic to, PRC concerns. This includes issues such as the PRC\u2019s various territorial disputes and suspicions of the United States and Japan. There is sometimes surprise, a sense of betrayal, and even anger from PRC official quarters when Singapore\u2019s official position diverges from that of Beijing. Such perspectives come from a sense of Chinese nationalism that rests heavily on linking ethnicity to political loyalty to the PRC.\n\nSingapore and its Chinese citizens, however, do not and should not share the same sense of nationalism as in the PRC. Despite historical linkages between Chinese nationalist movements, ethnic Chinese in Singapore now have very different political loyalties. Even though Singaporean Chinese may speak languages and share cultural practices that originated from what is today the PRC, they are no more Chinese citizens than French-Canadians are French citizens. Singapore\u2019s post-independence nation-building project continues to be about creating distinct Singapore citizens. Such a position is critical given the need to hold together Singapore\u2019s multi-ethnic population and avoid characterisation as a potentially hostile Chinese \u201cfifth column\u201d by its neighbours.\n\nThe PRC is one of Singapore\u2019s most important foreign relationships. Much of this comes from the fact that the PRC is critical to prosperity and stability in Asia. Singapore\u2019s future is in many ways tied to the PRC doing well. However, Singapore will continue to seek other partnerships, inside its region and out, for the simple reason that such diversification of ties is an effective risk management strategy. This means that Singapore has an incentive to continue engagement with Europe, Australia, India, Japan, the United States and others. Singapore also has a longstanding interest in binding international rules that it prefers major powers, including the PRC, to abide by.\n\nTo the extent that Beijing accepts an open and inclusive Southeast Asia as well as established and binding rules, the Singapore\u2013PRC relationship is likely to continue smoothly. That said, predictability and comfort in the Singapore\u2013PRC relationship also depend on a continued commitment to the region by Singapore\u2019s other international partners. The positive trajectory of Singapore\u2019s current ties with the PRC rests on such conditions being sustained. If this situation changes, as may arguably be the case at present, Singapore\u2019s relationship with the PRC may become more fraught and require some recalibration.", "downloadable_attachments":

Marshall and his government. It draws a contrast with how he was regarded by the English-language press and by the British. It argues that Marshall was an effective and highly regarded Chief Minister who succeeded in passing many reforms that were important to the Chinese community. While Marshall was limited by his own lack of political skill and by a divided minority government, he was able to exploit British fears of a radical Chinese electorate to enable his success. As a result, Marshall was far more successful than anyone predicted, and tremendously popular among the Chinese throughout his term in office. The David Marshall government thus demonstrates how effective Singapore\u2019s repre- sentative government could be, even in its limited form. This article also illustrates the importance of vernacular sources and multiple perspectives to developing a more complete historical analysis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30246523, "asset_id": 2195036, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 380793, "first_name": "Pingtjin", "last_name": "Thum", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "PingtjinThum", "display_name": "Pingtjin Thum", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/PingtjinThum?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/380793/118176/2411453/s65_pingtjin.thum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19197, "name": "Decolonialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonialization?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29367, "name": "Subaltern Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subaltern_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 614845, "name": "Singapore Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Political_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 63500332, "title": "Isles and Their Stories: A Study of Three Islands of the Singapore Archipelago", "created_at": "2021-12-07T20:21:18.382-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63500332/Isles_and_Their_Stories_A_Study_of_Three_Islands_of_the_Singapore_Archipelago?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_63500332", "summary": "This paper studies three Singaporean islands (with their original Malay names in brackets): St. John\u2019s Island (Pulau Sakijang Bendera), Sentosa (Pulau Blakang Mati), and Coney Island (Pulau Serangoon). Using primary sources, such as maps and newspapers, and secondary sources, like books on Singaporean toponymy, the authors trace these place names across time. The toponyms conform to the broader trend of naming patterns of Singaporean toponyms. More importantly, the facilities, land uses, and histories of the three islands dovetail with pertinent aspects of Singapore\u2019s history and, more broadly, with global discussions on linguistic toponymies and geographies. Through this research, it is evident that the toponyms, or place names, along with their connected stories, are inextricably linked to the history, languages, cultures, and societies of the places they name. This paper ultimately aims to be a starting point for further research on Singapore\u2019s island names, an area that has received scant attention in Singaporean toponymy thus far. \n\nKeywords:

"work_19678243", "summary": "This article is about the contestation of two different forms of nationalism in Singapore during and after two elections in 2011. Manufactured nationalism is topdown, state-defined and economically driven, concerned mainly about accumulation\nof national wealth through globalization that would eventually \u2018trickle down\u2019 to the masses. This view is promoted by the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP). The PAP projects Singapore as a state born out of the party\u2019s triumph over colonialism, racial violence, and communist insurgency. Popular nationalism, on the other hand, is bottom-up and people driven, concerned about local issues concerning national identity, social cohesion, and an appreciation (or at least an understanding) of local heritage. Proponents of popular nationalism emphasize a common beginning (birth of independent Singapore on 9 August 1965), shared historical memories (local heritage), several elements of a common culture (such as the use of Singlish), and an association with a specific \u2018homeland\u2019 (born and raised in Singapore and, for males, the completion of conscription). They view Singapore as a nation-state with a unique and evolving identity destabilized by a liberal immigration policy. The elections generated considerable attention due to the gains by the opposition parties and the public airing of frustrations against the PAP government. These frustrations are strongly driven by the influx of new migrants, especially those classified as \u2018foreign talent\u2019 by the PAP\ngovernment. In this article, I argue that popular nationalism has emerged in twenty-first century Singapore and examine the debates over the future of Singapore during and after the elections.",

These conditions and their agents are: The matrix of laws that restrict civil society activities, the specific practices and actions that contribute further to these restrictions, as well as state authorities including the police, Elections\r\nDepartment, other official bodies, and commentators given an airing in the mainstream media.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve the conditions in which civil society groups that work towards civil and political reform in Singapore, SFD has listed a number of recommendations. They are:\r\n\r\n1. Release non-political party organisations from the Political Donations Act\r\n2. Revise the Societies Act and liberate civil society operations\r\n3. Reform the Public Order Act to allow meaningful approval for political activities\r\n4. Introduce a Freedom of Information Act\r\n5.

The historical reconstruction, based on pre-colonial Malay and early modern European source materials, differs from previous expos\u00e9s in three key respects: first, Melaka\u2019s rise in the early 1400s did not occur at the expense of medieval Singapore, but rather Melaka\u2019s founding was a response to shifts in trading networks that may have been triggered, or exacerbated, by the forces of nature. Second, Melaka society and its institutions are primarily examined through the prism of two of its surviving legal documents: Undang-undang Melaka (Laws of Melaka; sometimes called Hukum Kanun Melaka) and Undang-undang Laut Melaka (Maritime Laws of Melaka). Third, the Melaka Sultanate did not eclipse with the Portuguese attack on the town in 1511 and the expulsion of Sultan Mahmud from his capital city. Rejecting the conventional Eurocentric view, the Melaka empire is argued to have ended almost two decades later with the death of the dislodged ruler and the founding of the sultanates of Perak and Johor by his two sons in 1528.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59329518, "asset_id": 28357388, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263,

The Special Branch\u2019s bravado, glimpsed only perfunctorily in the colonial record, conceal a far more contingent process from which the colonial establishment and various institutions and individuals under its ambit contended, arrested but never arrived at an unequivocal appreciation of the Communist threat in its midst. In this sense, the British and their formative encounters with Communism in the aftermath of the Great War are meritorious of scholarly attention. Colonial officials came face-to-face with a revolutionary ideology still revelling in its newfound, post-war international prestige and understandably, located its insidious influence in the local Chinese diaspora. That set the stage for the British and their showdown with their pro-Communist Hainanese subordinates at Kreta Ayer. The colonial government was disgraced there, and only then was anti-Communist policy placed firmly under the Special Branch\u2019s purview. Yet, the rot did not stop there. The Special Branch consistently agonised in the early 1930s over the fledgling Malayan Communist Party (MCP) and its international affiliations and only through due diligence, emasculated it. The rest of the colonial government, on the other hand, was increasingly privy to Malayan Communism and its local grievances. The sheer complexity of local problems in the run-up to the Second World War, of which Communism was integral, finally threw into sharp relief these differences in appraisal of the Communist threat within the colonial government. The story of the British and their rendezvous with pre-war Malayan Communism, indeed, was one of liminalities and ambiguities, directed not only towards the Communist follower but at the heart of the colonial edifice as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58532478, "asset_id": 38467545, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51097579, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Mah", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JamesMah", "display_name": "James Mah", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JamesMah?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51097579/22706709/21879654/s65_james.mah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52197, "name": "Colonial Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Discourse?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 77501, "name": "Anti-communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-communism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 442481, "name": "Malayan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 749811, "name": "British Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Malaya?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1614766, "name": "Malayan Communist Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayan_Communist_Party?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 36738589, "title": "Ecological  Biopolitics in the Garden City: Cosmopolitanism, Nationalism, and The Discourse on Natural Heritage", "created_at": "2018-05-29T03:26:47.243-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36738589/Ecological_Biopolitics_in_the_Garden_City_Cosmopolitanism_Nationalism_and_The_Discourse_on_Natural_Heritage?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_36738589", "summary": "The coherence of official environmental discourse in Singapore is torn apart by the continued existence of two conflicting visions of the state-led landscaping project. On one hand, the idea of the \" man-made garden \" favors exotic lifeforms at the expense of native biodiversity. On the other hand, the increasingly popular notion of the \" ecological garden \" seeks to create a sacred space for native species at the total exclusion of foreign ones. This ideological incoherence directly contradicts the Foucauldian paradigm of ecological biopolitics which takes rational governmentality as its axiom. Consequently, this paper argues for a paradigmatic shift in the field of ecological biopolitics by proposing the \" gardening paradigm \" as a replacement for the mainstream Foucauldian paradigm of ecological biopolitics. Rejecting the Foucauldian paradigm's assumption of a rationalist state, the gardening paradigm demonstrates how the aesthetic and ecological imperatives of gardening influence state biopolitical management of non-human populations. The ecological imperative seeks to create a nativist utopia for local biodiversity by entirely excluding all exotic species while the aesthetic imperative seeks to create a cosmopolitan microcosm which often privileges exotic ornamentals at the expense of native species. This zero-sum situation forces the state to practice biopolitics by making non-human populations live and die based upon their overall contribution to the garden. At the same time, this paper will also account for the emergence of biopolitical tensions between the aesthetic and ecological imperatives by using the \" gardening paradigm \" to trace the historical evolution of official environmental discourse in Singapore. This narrative will illustrate how the ecological imperative, in the guise of \" natural heritage, \" has broken the continuity of Singapore's environmental discourse. By creating a parallel discourse alongside the predominant aesthetic imperative, this discontinuity has resulted in the two discordant visions of the garden city.\r\n\r\n\r\nCitation: Goh, Ngee Chae Joshua, \u201cEcological Biopolitics in the Garden City: Cosmopolitanism, Nationalism and the Discourse of Natural Heritage\u201d.

It examines the construction of two buildings constructed with an iron framework in detail, mainly the Church of Our Lady of Lourdes in Singapore, and the printing press of the House of Nazareth in Hong Kong. Such a study into the materialisation of church construction in colonial port cities is significant yet neglected part of transnational architectural historiography. While the genealogy of Catholic architecture in former colonies remained undeniably influenced by western archetypes, especially from France, I argue that the church and the House of Nazareth, the French Mission's linguistic and printing headquarters in Hong Kong discussed in this paper, had to adopt a nuanced approach which considers multiple factors such as liturgy influences particular to the society, the types of architectural discourses circulating throughout overseas MEP missions during this period, the influence of institutional representatives and patronage on the style of architecture, as well as the skills and affiliations of various building professionals involved in the joint enterprise of design: priests, overseas constructors and foundries, as well as local craftsmen, surveyors, and engineers. This approach offers a reconsideration of the autonomy and responsibilities an architect or design practice is attributed to the construction of a building in the contemporary sense, given the multicity of construction constraints, and the difficulties in maintaining clear communications over vast distances and lag in between correspondences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68433991, "asset_id": 50450841, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3616344, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "IanTan", "display_name": "Ian Tan", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/IanTan?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3616344/1265101/107855828/s65_ian.tan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 920232, "name": "HONG KONG HISTORY", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/HONG_KONG_HISTORY?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37553615, "title": "Culinary Biographies: Charting Singapore's History Through Cooking and Consumption.

Spanning Singapore's documented 700-year history, this study will trace the pathways through which ingredients, techniques, and regional culinary philosophies converged in Singapore. The project will demonstrate how these conjunctures established crucial precedents for some of Singapore's most iconic food offerings, mapping out the everyday historical contexts in which the island's cuisines emerged and evolved. Through food, the study will encourage interest in Singapore's social history among residents of different generations. Our investigation seeks to construct the 'culinary biographies' of seven food items: fish-head curry, ice kachang, laksa, biryani, Milo dinosaur, sweet potato lemak, and betel quid. We combine a focus on cuisine with the novel concept that all food items have socially embedded 'lives' that change over time, revealing the long-term dynamics and historical underpinnings of Singapore's food heritage. Each biography will trace the diversity of locations where each offering and its predecessors were prepared, the knowledge and practices of their creators and consumers, and each food's underlying material realities. In doing so, our framework aims to consolidate understandings of how tangible and intangible notions of heritage can be mutually reinforcing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63145602, "asset_id": 37553615, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2695259, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Pakiam", "domain_name": "iseaslib", "page_name": "GeoffreyPakiam", "display_name": "Geoffrey K Pakiam", "profile_url": "https://iseaslib.academia.edu/GeoffreyPakiam?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2695259/3193298/43320832/s65_geoffrey.pakiam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6858, "name": "Food History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12374, "name": "History Of Food Consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Food_Consumption?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 17108, "name": "Anthropology Of Consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_Of_Consumption?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 32314048, "title": "THE BEACONS HERITAGE TRAIL AND THE CURATION OF AN EVOLVING URBAN NARRATIVE", "created_at": "2017-04-07T03:31:37.300-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32314048/THE_BEACONS_HERITAGE_TRAIL_AND_THE_CURATION_OF_AN_EVOLVING_URBAN_NARRATIVE?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_32314048", "summary": "Compared to most Asian and European cities, Singapore has a relatively short history. It traces its beginning to 1819 when the British East India Company, represented by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, established its first port at the tip of the Malaya peninsula, thereby breaking the trade hegemony held by the Dutch in the peninsula since the early-18 th century. The small port established at the mouth of Singapore River developed into a well-known British trading port and colony in the 1900s. It subsequently became an independent state in 1965 and still remains till today, a key shipping node and business hub. Yet in an endless race to keep abreast with the development of other international cities, the Central Business District (CBD) along the mouth of Singapore River and the Telok Ayer basin had underwent rounds of development which not only replaced vernacular buildings in preference for contemporary buildings throughout different periods but had also reshaped our landscape through hill levelling and land reclamation. The original shoreline had been extended thrice, once during the colonial period and twice after Singapore's independence. This created new strips of the land which were developed to fulfil the changing aspirations of the island, first as a striving mercantile port in the late 19 th and 20 th century, then a booming financial centre during the rapid economic boom of the 1960s \u2013 70s and now a showcase of gleaming skyscrapers, rejuvenated colonial buildings and immaculate landscaping along a promenade waterfront that had been dammed up to form Singapore's largest freshwater reservoir. Vestiges of the different time periods could still be found within pockets in the CBD, yet its original urban context could no longer be discerned. Most surviving historic shophouses which were previously associated with cramped living conditions and traditional trades had been preserved and adapted as SOHO offices and upmarket eateries that bear no traces of its original function and living conditions. Utilising the concept of narrativity in describing urban environments, such a setting shows a low level of narrativity. The concept of narrativity will be used in this essay to set out the objectives of the proposed Beacons Heritage Trail to trace the evolution of Singapore's CBD over the last two centuries. By juxtaposing the narrative of shifting coastlines in Singapore's city centre against architectural pieces representing the epochs of its development, the trail will provide an overarching narrative to contextualise the wide range of buildings found within walking distance. The essay will also attempt to show how the creation of heritage trails should not be seen as an isolated effort in understanding the", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52526522, "asset_id": 32314048, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3616344, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "IanTan", "display_name": "Ian Tan", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/IanTan?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3616344/1265101/107855828/s65_ian.tan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 22288, "name": "Architectural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_Heritage?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50618, "name": "Community-based Heritage Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community-based_Heritage_Tourism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 990260, "name": "Heritage Trail", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Trail?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31669847, "title": "The Persistence of National Memories of Trauma", "created_at": "2017-03-01T18:41:57.586-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31669847/The_Persistence_of_National_Memories_of_Trauma?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_31669847", "summary": "In February 2017, two events occurred in Southeast Asia which highlight the persistence in national life of collective memories of trauma.

We were happily married with two kids, two  girls. 3 months ago, I started to notice some strange behavior from him and a few weeks later I found out that my husband is seeing someone. He started coming home late from work, he hardly cared about me or the kids anymore, Sometimes he goes out and doesn't even come back home for about 2-3 days. I did all I could to rectify this problem but all to no avail. I became very worried and needed help. As I was browsing through the Internet one day, I came across a website that suggested that Dr USMAN  can help solve marital problems, restore broken relationships and so on. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he did a spell for me. Two days later, my husband came to me and apologized for the wrongs he did and promised never to do it again. Ever since then, everything has returned back to normal. My family and I are living together happily again.. All thanks to Dr USMAN. If you need a spell caster that can cast a spell that truly works, I suggest you contact him. He will not disappoint you.

Yet Stamford Raffles\u2019 founding of a British trading post there was controversial from the start. The Dutch and the British haggled as to whether or not Raffles had overstepped his authority, and whether the trading post was legal. From the start, the Dutch demanded that the British quit their occupation of Singapore. During a three-year hiatus in the Anglo\u2013Dutch negotiations (1820\u201323), Anton Reinhard Falck, the lead Dutch negotiator, decided to drop claims to Singapore in favour of a rearrangement of possessions in the archipelago. Crucially, he concluded that dropping claims over Singapore would not amount to a real loss. Instead, Falck hoped to use Singapore as a bargaining chip to squeeze additional concessions from the British.

It promotes economic development, mitigates environmental degradation, and fosters a sense of social cohesion. Notwithstanding, one can understand a place's culture, geography, history, languages, and sociopolitical structures by studying the naming practices in public transport, such as bus routes and train stations, among others. This article studies the naming conventions in Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system, which serves millions of commuters daily, and alludes to the importance of public transport in urban spaces. The paper analyses MRT station names, which can be regarded as toponyms, of the North South and Downtown lines according to two aspects: firstly, by conducting a linguistic analysis of the languages used in naming these MRT stations and, secondly, by applying toponymic classifications from current research in grouping the MRT stations themselves. Ultimately, the study compares the naming practices of Singapore's oldest and second newest MRT lines using a sociolinguistic and historical toponomastics mixed methods approach, studying the MRT station names based on social categories as well as using historical sources to account for the linguistic and historical meaning of these toponyms. This work is aimed at providing scholars and a general audience with a better understanding of Singapore's language, culture, and society through the analysis of the naming practices of the MRT station names, unique toponyms in the urban transport of the Lion City.

Following the tracks of these punitive laws and practices, the book moves into the 1960s when the newly independent city-state created a national lottery while criminalizing both organized and petty gambling in the name of nation-building. The second history shifts the focus to corporate Las Vegas in the 1950s when digital technology and corporate management practices found each other on the casino floor. Tracing the emergence of the specialist casino designer, the book reveals how casino development evolved into a highly rationalized spatial template designed to maximize profits. Today an iconic landmark of Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is also an artifact of these two histories, an attempt by Singapore to normalize what was once criminalized in its nationalist past.\n\nLee Kah-Wee argues that the historical project of the control of vice is also about the control of space and capital. The result is an uneven landscape where the legal and moral status of gambling is contingent on where it is located. As the current wave of casino expansion spreads across Asia, he warns that these developments should not be seen as liberalization but instead as a continuation of the project of concentrating power by modern states and corporations.\n\n \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58263776, "asset_id": 38223997, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1517533, "first_name": "Kah-Wee", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "KahWeeLee", "display_name": "Kah-Wee Lee", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/KahWeeLee?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1517533/537737/672442/s65_kah-wee.lee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5223, "name": "Gambling Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gambling_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 24122280, "title": "Gay Liberation in the Illiberal State, 24 Wash.

Incrementalism ultimately promotes sexual normativity by dividing the gay community into \" good gays, \" who deserve equal protections, and \" bad queers, \" who are further marginalized. Incrementalism in the United States began with decriminalization of sodomy and terminated with the recognition of gay marriage but did so by imagining gay sexuality within the context of committed relationships. The gay rights movement in Singapore is currently challenging the constitutionality of the country's anti-sodomy statute, but has also encountered problems with bifurcating good gays from bad queers. Singaporean gay rights advocacy has adopted an approach that looks similar to incrementalism in the United States, but is actually adapted as a strategy of survival within the authoritarian structures of its illiberal democratic government. Dissecting these similarities shows how gay rights in the United States has acquiesced to a similar, but more hidden, disciplinary regime of social control that venerates marriage as an imagined ideal and suppresses other forms of sexual expression. The recent decision by the Singapore judiciary to reject the good gay and bad queer dichotomy and treat the two similarly, however, has forced gay rights advocacy to adapt and imagine a different and more unified strategy than in the United States.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44482006, "asset_id": 24122280, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3210461, "first_name": "Stewart", "last_name": "Chang", "domain_name": "whittier", "page_name": "StewartChang", "display_name": "Stewart Chang", "profile_url": "https://whittier.academia.edu/StewartChang?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3210461/1055821/1318485/s65_stewart.chang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4918, "name": "Gay And Lesbian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_And_Lesbian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 290912, "name": "Gay Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_Rights?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 23502211, "title": "Bukit Brown: World Monuments Watch  \u6b66\u5409\u5e03\u6717\u575f\u5c71: \u5217\u51652014\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u7269\u5efa\u7b51\u89c2\u5bdf\u540d\u5355", "created_at": "2016-03-20T23:56:04.111-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23502211/Bukit_Brown_World_Monuments_Watch_%E6%AD%A6%E5%90%89%E5%B8%83%E6%9C%97%E5%9D%9F%E5%B1%B1_%E5%88%97%E5%85%A52014%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E6%96%87%E7%89%A9%E5%BB%BA%E7%AD%91%E8%A7%82%E5%AF%9F%E5%90%8D%E5%8D%95?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_23502211", "summary": "An October 2015 overview and update of events relating to Bukit Brown cemetery, a heritage site under threat by transport and housing developments.

I have lived here since 2007 and felt that a \u201ccommunity report\u201d should aim to probe recent history deeper than what I could possibly do on my own, in order to give a rich perspective of what is happening here today. I was very happy when Pete Kellock, Zul Mahmod and Mark Wong agreed to be interviewed. Each has a long-time involvement in the Singapore sound scene, in a different capacity. Pete is an electroacoustic music composer who has worked in research and entrepreneurship, and is a founder of muvee technologies. Zul is a multimedia artist and performer who has developed a rich personal expression, mixing sonic electronics, sculpture and robotics in playful ways. Mark is a writer and sound artist who has followed Singapore\u2019s experimental scenes closely since the 1990s.\r\nI sent the three of them a letter containing a range of observations I had made (which may or may not be entirely accurate) and questions (admittedly thorny and intended to provoke), including the following:\r\nThe geographical location and Singapore\u2019s historic reason-to-be as a trading post has instilled a sense of ephemerality \u2014 people come and go, ideas and traditions too \u2014 as well as a need to develop contacts with the exterior. The arts scene in general seems to be largely a reflection of whatever the current trading priorities demand. In what way does the current local sound art reflect the larger forces within Singaporean society? Since art is mostly orally traded, how are its traditions nurtured and developed?\r\nAround 2010, the Government seems to have indicated a new task for cultural workers, including sound artists and musicians: to define \u2014 create or discover, stitch-up or steal \u2014 a \u201cSingapore identity\u201d. The Singapore Art Festival shut down two years while the think tanks were brewing. Will this funnel taxpayer money and (more importantly) peoples\u2019 attention towards folkloristic or museal music, rather than to radical and/or intellectual sound art? At the same time, there is considerable commercial pressure to subsume music / sound listening into an experiential, multimodal, game-like and socially mediated lifestyle product. Are commercialization and identity-seeking two sides of the same coin \u2014 one side inflation-prone, and the other a possible counterfeit? Is there room for a \u201cpure listening experience\u201d, for example to electroacoustic music? Or is the future of sound art ineluctably intertwined with sculptural and visual elements?\r\nDifferent kinds of creative people involved in sound art are entrepreneurs, programmers, academics, educators, curators and journalists. Which institutions nurture talent and bring audiences to meet new experiences? Where are the hothouses for developing ideas, craft, artistry, innovation and business?\r\nThe interviews, loosely structured around these themes, were made in January and February 2014. Our conversations often took unexpected turns (mostly for the better). I diligently transcribed the recordings, and each interviewee made corrections and additions, before we gently nudged spoken language a little closer to prose. I then brought out a pair of big scissors and a large pot of coffee, and made a cut-out collage, weaving the texts into the multilogue that follows. The idea has been to create an illusion of four people conversing with each other under the same roof. Deceit or not, at the very least, we all live and work on the same small island, somewhere in the deep southeast.

inequality in Singapore society. The\r\nrole of opposition internet activism is also explored. Semi-structured personal and group interviews,\r\nwith politicians and grassroots activists; literature search; and attendance at opposition party\r\nfunctions. The opposition in general and Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) and National Solidarity\r\nParty (NSP) in particular have repeatedly highlighted the growing income inequality and poverty in\r\nthe country. Pictures in the SDP\u2019s promotional literature skillfully and dialectically present wealth\r\nand poverty in Singapore within the same pictorial image. Interviewees speak of the Dickensian\r\nliving conditions in the one-room rental flats in Bukit Merah, just a taxi ride from Changi Airport, in\r\nthe Minister Mentor Harry Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s constituency of Tanjong Pagar GRC. The SDP\u2019s\r\nAlternative Economic Programme It\u2019s about You (2010) outlines the Party\u2019s proposals for minimum\r\nwage and unemployment insurance. The researchers obtain direct and personal access to\r\nSingapore\u2019s grassroots opposition community, including people that are not party leaders and who\r\nare difficult to access. The views of this community have rarely been heard because of the Singapore\r\nGovernment\u2019s hegemonic control of mainstream media within the country.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

struggles of the hospice movement in Singapore to establish itself\nin the 1980s. Specifically, there was a ten-year gap between a failed attempt in 1975 by\nprivate individuals to set up a local hospice, and the pioneer hospice movement that began\nin 1985. This silence was not fortuitous. This thesis argues that the government\u2019s profamily\ndiscourse within the context of an aging society in the late 1970s and early 1980s\nwas antithetical to the hospice cause. This agenda was aimed at the Chinese, and expressed\nvia the promulgation of Confucian values and the implementation of public housing\npolicies, both of which were targeted towards supporting the three-generation family\nstructure. The government\u2019s aim was to emphasise familial responsibility for the aged, as\nopposed to state responsibility or the provision of institutionalised care. The government\u2019s\npro-family discourse hence inhibited the growth of hospice care in the late 1970s and early\n1980s. This thesis further argues that when hospice care was established in 1985, it faced\nan uphill struggle as the impact of the government\u2019s pro-family agenda lingered on.\nHowever, a shift occurred in 1989, when the government altered its initial stance of\nresistance against hospice care to one of reluctant acceptance. Due to the increasing\npressures of the aging society, the government\u2019s pro-family discourse was no longer able\nto adequately address the needs of terminally ill patients, many of whom were the elderly.\nAs more hospices were built in the late 1980s and 1990s, the government and hospice\ncaregivers had to contend with a Chinese public that was fearful of hospices as they\nperceived them as successors to the death houses in Chinatown during the early twentieth\ncentury. This contention revealed the government\u2019s effort to balance the needs of the state\nwith public concerns. Ultimately, this thesis seeks to historicise the struggles of the hospice\nmovement in Singapore within a broader discourse of Singapore\u2019s aging society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49846984, "asset_id": 29406411, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38090068, "first_name": "Jessica", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JessLee23", "display_name": "Jessica Lee", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JessLee23?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6533, "name": "Hospice & Palliative Care Nursing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospice_and_Palliative_Care_Nursing?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 17516531, "title": "Transnational Mobility, Translation and Transference: The Cultural Identities of British Interpreters in Two Colonial Asian Cities (1840-1880)", "created_at": "2015-10-30T07:31:04.617-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17516531/Transnational_Mobility_Translation_and_Transference_The_Cultural_Identities_of_British_Interpreters_in_Two_Colonial_Asian_Cities_1840_1880_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_17516531", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39553308, "asset_id": 17516531, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6915489, "first_name": "Kwan", "last_name": "Sze Pui Uganda", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "KwanSzePuiUganda", "display_name": "Kwan Sze Pui Uganda", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/KwanSzePuiUganda?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6915489/3637324/18048536/s65_kwan.sze_pui_uganda.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9132, "name": "Translation History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 105152, "name": "History of Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Hong_Kong?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975919, "name": "Colonial And Post Colonial Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_And_Post_Colonial_Cities?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1397747, "name": "Straits Settlements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Straits_Settlements?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 15239455, "title": "Learning from the South: Japan's Racial Construction of Southern Chinese, 1895-1941", "created_at": "2015-08-27T23:23:26.648-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15239455/Learning_from_the_South_Japans_Racial_Construction_of_Southern_Chinese_1895_1941?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_15239455", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38686595, "asset_id": 15239455, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1423384, "first_name": "Huei-Ying", "last_name": "Kuo", "domain_name": "johnshopkins", "page_name": "HueiYingKuo", "display_name": "Huei-Ying Kuo", "profile_url": "https://johnshopkins.academia.edu/HueiYingKuo?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1423384/512813/38407118/s65_huei-ying.kuo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6777, "name": "Japanese Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Colonialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9756, "name": "Racial Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Identity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13911, "name": "Chinese Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Nationalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15658, "name": "History of Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Taiwan?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 132923, "name": "China and Southeast Asia (Chinese maritime activity, migration, education and intellectuals)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_and_Southeast_Asia_Chinese_maritime_activity_migration_education_and_intellectuals_?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 11719890, "title": "In the family ", "created_at": "2015-03-30T05:49:07.107-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11719890/In_the_family?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_11719890", "summary": "Highlights of library resources that would be useful for family heritage research.

At the dawn of the seventeenth century, the escalation of Portuguese expeditionary activities in and around the region led to the uncovering and creation of new knowledge. The Miscellany Atlas contains three maps of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra that offer a glimpse into a local trading world that was interconnected by riverine systems and overland trails. With the help of different analytical frameworks employed for understanding Malay polities of the pre-modern era, this paper carefully peels back the layers of information that have been sketched out and visually represented in these maps.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62257606, "asset_id": 41243491, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 167916, "name": "Sejarah Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 221325, "name": "Sumatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumatra?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 273287, "name": "Johor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Johor?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 375195, "name": "Malacca early history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malacca_early_history?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 24093036, "title": "Knowing Singapore.

During the period of analysis, Singapore has been greatly influenced by the United States of America (U.S.), especially after the 9/11 terrorist acts and the establishment of a \u2018second front\u2019 in the \u2018Global War on Terror\u2019 (GWOT). Taking this under consideration, the research also explores the degree of U.S. influence over the evolution of Singapore counterterrorism policies in the post 9/11 era. The results are that Singaporean CT policies evolved over the decades through three phases and four approaches. In a pre-9/11 era (first phase), Singaporean CT measures were formulated through a \u2018pendulum\u2019 approach, influenced by a \u2018holistic\u2019 approach in its defense posture. In the early post-9/11 era (second phase), the policies then shifted to an \u2018integrated\u2019 approach.

"work_4302946", "summary": "Four hundred years ago, the Dutch humanist and jurisconsult Hugo Grotius was commissioned by the United Netherlands\u2019 East India Company (VOC) to write a defense of Admiral Jakob van Heemskerk\u2019s seizure of a Portuguese merchant carrack in the Straits of Singapore (February 1603). At the time he was twenty-one years old. What Grotius produced between 1604 and 1606 is a comprehensive political and historical expos\u00e9 on war. Today, this work is known as De Jure Praedae Commentarius, or \u201cCommentary on Law of Prize and Booty\u201d. Only part of this comprehensive manuscript was published during its author\u2019s lifetime and is known as Mare Liberum or \u201cThe Free Sea\u201d (1609).\r\nMare Liberum is essentially a propagandistic treatise and argues for Holland\u2019s merchants to freely access emporia in Asia by unimpeded navigation across the high seas. The freedom of navigation forms a subset to the overarching arguments on the freedom of access and trade. This particular assessment of Mare Liberum stands in sharp contrast to past interpretations, insofar as these have placed the \u2018freedom of the seas\u2019 - and not the broader issues surrounding \u2018free trade\u2019 - at the forefront of scholarly attention. From this vantage point, Grotius was surprisingly consistent in his thinking on the broader issues of maritime trade and navigation.\r\nDuring the first two decades of the seventeenth century, Grotius lent a helping hand in the process of forging political and commercial treaties between the VOC and Asian rulers. Far from championing peace and the freedom of navigation on the high seas for which the Dutch humanist is best remembered in modern times, Grotius should also assume a place among the intellectual fathers of Dutch colonial rule in Asia.\"\"\"\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58286056, "asset_id": 4302946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

Archaeologists have frequently understood trade to be the cause of social and cultural change across Southeast Asia, particularly the regional 'Urban Revolution' which took place during the first millennium CE. This paper presents a multiscalar investigation that questions this assumption by reconceptualizing the relationships between glocal phenomena and settlement forms in ancient and Medieval Southeast Asia (100-1300 CE). Focusing on the Malay Peninsula, a part of the region thought to be most affected by global influences, this paper demonstrates that relationships between global trade and local settlement behaviours are not deterministic, offering an example of how multiscalar or glocal analyses can disrupt deterministic explanations of the archaeological record and enhance understanding of the interactions between the global and local scales of human activity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56912863, "asset_id": 36962818, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

(PAP) government pragmatically used the institution of sports in its nation-building enterprise. Based on an analysis of the speeches and press statements of Singaporean bureaucrats and civil servants from the 1960s to the 1980s, this article investigates the ruling elite\u2019s general perception of sports and regional sporting events, examining how such a perception influenced Singapore\u2019s local governance and strategic thinking in foreign relations. Although scholars have pointed out that sports were prominent in the nationalistic discourses of Singapore and in the projection of Singapore\u2019s international image, little about the history and development of individual sports in Singapore is known. The article argues that swimming was the premier sport of choice for Singapore\u2019s ruling elite in its projects of building bodies and the nation after independence, manifested in the swimming pools that the nascent nation strove to build in the residential estates outside the \u201ccolonial stronghold\u201d of the central town district.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42674525, "asset_id": 20238938, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 489265, "first_name": "Ying-kit", "last_name": "Chan", "domain_name": "leidenuni", "page_name": "YingkitChan", "display_name": "Ying-kit Chan", "profile_url": "https://leidenuni.academia.edu/YingkitChan?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/489265/166833/40033895/s65_ying-kit.chan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11893833, "title": "RECONSTRUCTING BANZU, A FOURTEENTH-CENTURY PORT SETTLEMENT IN SINGAPORE", "created_at": "2015-04-10T23:22:17.086-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11893833/RECONSTRUCTING_BANZU_A_FOURTEENTH_CENTURY_PORT_SETTLEMENT_IN_SINGAPORE?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_11893833", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37272536, "asset_id": 11893833, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23048684, "first_name": "Derek", "last_name": "Heng", "domain_name": "nau", "page_name": "DerekHeng", "display_name": "Derek  Heng", "profile_url": "https://nau.academia.edu/DerekHeng?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 277, "name": "Urban Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Geography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5063, "name": "Settlement Patterns", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settlement_Patterns?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 9007876, "title": "SINGAPORE   [....]  Cz\u0119\u015b\u0107 Trzecia:\tRozdzia\u0142 3 cz\u0119\u015bci 3:    (pe\u0142en tytu\u0142 artyku\u0142u i jego tre\u015b\u0107 u wydawcy broszureczki).", "created_at": "2014-10-28T23:04:53.169-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9007876/SINGAPORE_Cz%C4%99%C5%9B%C4%87_Trzecia_Rozdzia%C5%82_3_cz%C4%99%C5%9Bci_3_pe%C5%82en_tytu%C5%82_artyku%C5%82u_i_jego_tre%C5%9B%C4%87_u_wydawcy_broszureczki_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_9007876", "summary": "DU E TO E-PIRACY THIS STATION \r\nCEASES TO BROADCAST WITH THE EMMEDIATE EFFECT \r\n Ca\u0142o\u015b\u0107 artyku\u0142u mo\u017cliwa do przeczytania w oryginale.\r\n ", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13406855, "first_name": "Christopher (A.K.A.

yet to familiarize themselves with his autobiography (Vida) and his petitions. De Coutre, who was a native of Bruges in Flanders, spent roughly one decade in Southeast Asia between 1593 and 1603, and in this time was based in Melaka and Manila. From here he made lengthy trips to other parts of the Malay Peninsula \u2013 such as Pahang and Patani, and especially also to Siam and Cambodia. This paper which is held on the occasion of the launch of the first published English translation of a selection of De Coutre\u2019s writings asks two very fundamental questions: Why should we bother to read this source and of what value might it be to Southeast Asian researchers today?\r\n\"\"\"", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter",

Ed. Farish A. Noor & Peter Carey. Amsterdam: AUP, 15 January 2021\n\nThe colonisation of Southeast Asia was a long and often violent process where numerous military campaigns were waged by the colonial powers across the region. The notion of racial difference was crucial in many of\nthese wars, as native Southeast Asian societies were often framed in negative terms as 'savage' and 'backward' communities that needed to be subdued and 'civilised'. This collection of critical essays focuses on the colonial construction of race and looks at how the colonial wars\nin 19th-century Southeast Asia were rationalised via recourse to theories of racial difference, making race a significant factor in the wars of Empire. Looking at the colonial wars in Java, Borneo, Siam, the Philippines, the Malay Peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia, the\nessays examine the manner in which the idea of racial difference was weaponised by the colonising powers and how forms of local resistance often worked through such colonial structures of identity politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65515543, "asset_id": 44977866, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3186061, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Carey", "domain_name": "indonesia", "page_name": "PeterCarey", "display_name": "Peter B Carey", "profile_url": "https://indonesia.academia.edu/PeterCarey?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3186061/1047844/1308753/s65_peter.cary.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 15468, "name": "The Moros Of Mindanao In Southern Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Moros_Of_Mindanao_In_Southern_Philippines?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 28507, "name": "History of Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 225603, "name": "Sabah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabah?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 272528, "name": "Pahang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pahang?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 344654, "name": "Mindanao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mindanao?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 630718, "name": "History of the Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Philippines?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 720132, "name": "British Colonial History in Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Colonial_History_in_Malaya?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1289943, "name": "history of Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Thailand?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 37418834, "title": "The value of Admiral Matelieff's writings for studying the history of Southeast Asia,\r\nc.1600\u20131620", "created_at": "2018-09-15T00:08:22.971-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37418834/The_value_of_Admiral_Matelieffs_writings_for_studying_the_history_of_Southeast_Asia_c_1600_1620?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_37418834", "summary": "NOW FREELY DOWNLOADABLE VIA OPEN ACCESS\n\nCornelis Matelieff de Jonge (also Cornelis Cornelisz.

Based on her ethnic, religious and education-based belonging, she characterizes this environment as \u201ctraditional\u201c. In this respect, \u201cromantic love\u201c is a means to identify herself as \u201cmodern\u201c. \nMalaysia is a multicultural society with 65% of Malay Malaysians and so called indigenous people, 26% of Chinese Malaysians and 7% of Indian Malaysians. Singapore as a \u201cmodern Southeast Asian metropolis\u201c, which is comprised of the same ethnic groups due to the historic ties to Malaysia, however, is Chinese dominated. In both states, the concept of romantic love developed in the 1960s in all of the three ethnic groups as an alternative to arranged marriage. \nThe process to identify oneself as a modern woman through practices of romantic love is mostly negotiated by Christian Chinese Malaysian women who earned a high degree of formal education. They intensify this process through a migration step to \u201cmodern\u201c Singapore. In the local context, the concept of \u201cromantic love\u201c is defined through having a partner before marriage, being sexual active with him and strengthening this relationship through a \u201cwhite wedding\u201c. \u201cRomantic love\u201d in Singapore and Malaysia is based on practices of adaption of the concept of romantic love developed in Western modern times, which developed on the basis of Western subjectivity, individuality and the differentiation between public and private spaces.

Few have examined the forms of state violence targeted at popular illegalities enjoyed by different classes of citizens. The intensification of the criminalization of gambling from the 1960s to the 1980s in Singapore was part of this complex phenomenon where the very notions of morality and legality had become bound up in the processes of urbanization and nation-building. Rather than interpreting this as part of the growing political and ideological dominance of the ruling party, I analyse the discourses and programmes centred around crime, cleanliness and the built environment so as to construct the positive order against which gambling was posed as a danger. Then, I use media reports to parse the different spatial zones that described a specific relationship between vice and crime. These zones were neither discrete nor hierarchical; instead they were relational and unstable, such that a similar act could be tolerated at one place but criminalized at another. Writing the history of the control of vice opens a window into a process whereby the terrain of popular illegalities was slowly but thoroughly rearranged, and how this unstable process expressed both the limits of criminalization in the context of a strident nationalism, and the relationship between the spatial order of the city and the symbolic order of the nation.

The country\u2019s limited territorial lands and\r\nnatural resources, combined with huge per capita income, high population density and sensitive racial concoction, make Singapore the quintessential pragmatic trading state of the twenty-first century.

It\r\nargues that in order to maintain the city-state\u2019s geo-economic and geo-political viability, the Singaporean government has progressively linked its security interests with its multilevel free trade activities. Given the vulnerability fetish and siege mentality that confront Singaporean leaders and policymakers, the pursuit of economic development via free trade has become the heart of its national security policy and strategy. The paper concludes by arguing that the enhancement and preservation of Singapore\u2019s survival as a sovereign nation-state demands a strategic utilization of FTAs with different trade partners, especially with inter-regional and transregional powers such as the United States and China.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35943209, "asset_id": 9762647, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1920447, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Magcamit", "domain_name": "leicester", "page_name": "MichaelMagcamit", "display_name": "Michael Magcamit", "profile_url": "https://leicester.academia.edu/MichaelMagcamit?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1920447/4443544/38693761/s65_michael.magcamit.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4370, "name": "Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5535, "name": "Critical Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Security_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6276, "name": "International Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Political_Economy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 10370, "name": "East Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 10371, "name": "South East Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 18794, "name": "Critical international political economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_international_political_economy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 22965, "name": "Political Economy of International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy_of_International_Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 22967, "name": "Trade and Industrial Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_and_Industrial_Policy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 28578, "name": "Fair Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fair_Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 32014, "name": "Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 39038, "name": "Free Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 71228, "name": "Trade Liberalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Liberalization?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 97103, "name": "Free trade agreements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_trade_agreements?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 137587, "name": "International Relations, Security, Strategic Studies, Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_Security_Strategic_Studies_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 257285, "name": "Social and political science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_political_science?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 410377, "name": "Foreign Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Trade?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 430672, "name": "International and Comparative Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_and_Comparative_Political_Economy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 516104, "name": "Trade Liberalization and Poverty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Liberalization_and_Poverty?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 954124, "name": "Singapore Foreign Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Foreign_Policy?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 8576983, "title": "Henk Nellen's Review of P.

Long characterised as authoritarian in popular culture, the Singaporean\r\npolitical context is actually far from straightforward. State-led industrial policy in favour\r\nof high-tech economic activities has created some opportunities for social change. At\r\nthe same time, conflicts within society itself have limited any sudden moves towards a\r\nmore liberal politics. Many of these pre-existing conflicts have spilled over onto the\r\nminimally-regulated realms of the Internet, which in turn has accentuated the multidimensional nature of social struggle in Singapore. These developments have\r\novershadowed the Internet's ability to unite previously marginalised individuals across\r\ngeographies.

examines international labour migrants in the context of South\u2013South migration with a focus on Bangladeshi migration to Singapore. Two principal questions in the South\u2013South migration are addressed: Why and how individuals migrate for work; and what impact this temporary form of migration has for migrants and their families. The book adopts a relatively new methodological approach to labour migration by linking different phases that migrants undergo in the migration process and by combining migrants in the host country with their families in the origin country. This is achieved through identifying and addressing six key areas: (i) migration policy, (ii) social imperatives of migration (iii) recruitment, (iv) social worlds of the migrants, (v) remittance process, and finally, (vi) family development dynamics. This book introduces the bari to migration research as a unit of analysis over and above individual and family units. The book reveals how social and cultural forces both initiate and perpetuate migration, and later on influence bari dynamics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52396272, "asset_id": 32157969,

the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait lies Pedra Branca, an island of granite rock situated in hazardous waters. Its unexceptional presence belies a rich cartographical history and infamous reputation for leading ships to grief since antiquity. Pedra Branca was first pushed into the spotlight when the British constructed the Horsburgh Lighthouse in 1851.

The ensuing legal battle led to renewed interest in the geography and post-19th century history of the island. The most recent breakthrough, however, provides a glimpse into an even earlier history of Pedra Branca\u2014and by extension, Singapore\u2014as shipwrecked remains dating from the 14th century were uncovered in the surrounding waters.

"dom_id": "work_45103952", "summary": "The history of the names of Singapore and of their variants and different versions produced over time is extremely interesting and shows still some unclear stages, both at the etymological level, in the linguistic explanation of the origins and original meanings of the numerous names the island had throughout the centuries, and at the historical level, in the attempt to connect the names of Singapore with local and external peoples who inhabited and occupied the island in the past. This paper aims at providing a synthetic, but punctual, survey on the names used for the Lion City over time, with the addition of some linguistic and historical details. The main issue in the diachronic reconstruction of the names of Singapore resides in the early stages of the history of the island, for which the historical sources are rare and, sometimes, controversial. The different names used for Singapore from the beginnings of its history witness changes in population and settlement dynamics that are not always very clear, due to the lack of reliable historical sources, but that give an outstanding image of the multicultural and multilingual nature of Singapore already from its origins. The paper reconstructs and documents the different stages of the naming process of Singapore from the origins to the present time. \n\nKey words: The Names of Singapore, Toponomastics, Naming Process", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65668303, "asset_id": 45103952, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4424566, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Perono Cacciafoco", "domain_name": "xjtlu", "page_name": "FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco", "display_name": "Francesco Perono Cacciafoco", "profile_url": "https://xjtlu.academia.edu/FrancescoPeronoCacciafoco?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4424566/1801903/2148322/s65_francesco.perono_cacciafoco.jpg"}, {"id": 7248213, "first_name": "Chloe", "last_name": "Gan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GanChloe", "display_name": "Chloe Gan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GanChloe?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 778, "name": "Diachronic Linguistics (Or Historical Linguistics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diachronic_Linguistics_Or_Historical_Linguistics_?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1206, "name": "Lexicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lexicology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2717, "name": "Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etymology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3904, "name": "Onomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Onomastics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4469, "name": "Toponomastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponomastics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 17445, "name": "Historical maps", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_maps?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 34818, "name": "Toponymy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toponymy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 52505, "name": "Historical topography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_topography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 648975, "name": "Trade Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Routes?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 43847558, "title": "Early buildings and structures of Nanyang University, Singapore", "created_at": "2020-08-13T02:13:05.471-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43847558/Early_buildings_and_structures_of_Nanyang_University_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_43847558", "summary": "Nanyang University (Nantah) was a Chinese-medium tertiary institution started by the Chinese community in Malaya to meet the needs of Chinese high schools graduates who could not pursue higher education in China following a change of government in the country.

These have been both of general and specialist nature, written not only by historians, but also by political scientists as well as specialists of international relations. The truly excellent study published in 2002 by Edward Keene, can be taken as a point in case. Central to his revisitation of seventeenth-century treaties of the United Dutch East India Company (VOC) with the Emperor of Kandy, is the notion of divided sovereignty expounded by Hugo Grotius around 1600-1610. It was against the backdrop of such concepts of divided sovereignty that the VOC could ultimately conclude its complex web of treaty relationships that broadly characterise the Dutch colonial empire in the East Indies up the advent of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. There is some legitimacy in contending that Keene's postulations effectively rework and reinterpret, at the level of international relations, what was once conveniently dubbed the \u2018Age of Partnership\u2019, i.e. an age characterised by trade-driven colonial empires that grew upon a complex, sometimes self-contradictory network of treaty relationships as well as formal and informal cooperation garnered from native elites. Admittedly such relations were often but not always based on unequal power and treaty relationships. Despite the uneven playing fields created by many such Euro-Asian treaties, especially those forged in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the conclusion of treaties was assumed on the basis of the nominal co-equality of sovereigns and plenipotentiary agents acting on their behalf. European and Asian treaty partners were accepted as contracting equals, and this is particularly stunning given that the feudal world of European power politics at the time was, by comparison, probably more complex and legally structured than Asia. Certainly, the underlying power relations behind these early modern agreements were completely different from those imposed by the mature colonial powers on Asia at the zenith of nineteenth-century imperialism", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62266205, "asset_id": 38314844, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 38239057, "title": "Seven Hundred Years: A History of Singapore", "created_at": "2019-01-28T16:49:11.676-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38239057/Seven_Hundred_Years_A_History_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38239057", "summary": "This flagship publication co-authored with Derek Heng, Kwa Chong Guan and Tan Tai Yong has been recommended as one of the top ten reading picks by the Straits Times (Singapore) on 29 January, 2019. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58280627, "asset_id": 38239057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 35575557, "title": "Southeast Asian Studies in the UK in the late 1980s: An Historical Overview", "created_at": "2018-01-04T02:21:49.984-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35575557/Southeast_Asian_Studies_in_the_UK_in_the_late_1980s_An_Historical_Overview?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_35575557", "summary": "In 1989, I was invited by Professor V. T.

This short article, simply entitled 'History' appeared in Victor T. King, 'Research on Southeast Asia in the United Kingdom: A Survey', was published by Hull University's Centre for Southeast Asian Studies in 1989 (iv + 70 pages), pp.49-57. It should be read in conjunction with my 'Maritime Southeast Asian Studies in the United Kingdom: A Survey of Their Post-War Development and Current Resources' (Oxford: JASO, 1986) (115 pp.), which described the situation in the early to mid-1980s when the UK Government's Commission on Area Studies headed by former British Rail boss, Sir Peter Parker, was about to make its recommendations. Both the Survey and the 1989 'History' paint a picture of a worrying decline in the number of scholars with SE Asian specialisations  holding tenured posts in British Universities and of their graduate students with research interests in the region. Sadly, this has not been substantially reversed in the past three decades since these surveys were written.

Dalam jangka pendek (1 tahun): Perlu pengembangan  rencana strategis, peta jalan (road-map) dan rangkaian kebijakan publik memajukan Enggano. Mulai dari membenahi \u2018Paradigma dan Citra Baru Enggano\u201d. Enggano adalah \u201cPulau Terdepan-Etalase Indonesia\u201d. Enggano bukan \u2018Pulau Kosong\u2019 yang sepihak dapat diapakan saja. Namun, pulau kecil di tengah samudra yang rentan kerusakan lingkungan. Enggano berpenduduk yang giat bekerja, beradat-istiadat dan senang  berdialog. Enggano itu ramah, tangguh, tujuan etno-ekowisata dunia, indah, khas dan eksotis. Untuk memajukannya, perlu perbaikan konektivitas laut Enggano dengan penambahan jadwal dan jumlah kapal Roro/Fery; penambahan panjang bandara Enggano agar dapat digunakan pesawat besar; juga pelatihan penduduk tentang \u2018Standard Jasa Pelayanan Pariwisata\u2019. Bagi para ibu untuk membuat Oleh-Oleh Khas Enggano; mengundang guru/maestro seni dari Bali dan manca negara untuk tinggal setahun di Enggano dalam persiapan transfer pengetahuan;  juga mendirikan \u2018Kebun Raya Enggano\u2019, Koperasi Kerajinan, Pasar Seni  dan Kuliner Enggano; pendirian penginapan/ home-stay dan seni pertunjukan untuk wisatawan di desa wisata adat lingkungan di seputar Blakblau (kolam alam)  desa Meok dan Tanjung Kooman; menyelesaikan jalan lingkar pulau dengan konstruksi tahan cuaca (semen betonisasi dengan lapis hotmik aspal+ karet) dan jasa angkutan umum bus pulau dan rental kendaraan (mobil, motor, sepeda) bagi wisatawan. \nDalam jangka tengah (2-5 tahun): perlu menuntaskan krisis minyak dan listrik. Enggano sangat memerlukan SPBU (Stasiun Pengisian Bahan Bakar Umum) karena kelangkaan bensin dan solar yang sangat parah dan PLTD (Pembangkit Listrik Diesel) Kapal Terapung untuk memasok kebutuhan listrik untuk pengembangan wisata dan perikanan. Selain bertahap mengembangkan energi terbarukan tenaga surya, kincir angin dan pasang surut gelombang samudra; Membangkitkan potensi kelautan sesuai hasil riset Puslit Oceanografi dan Biologi LIPI yang  menyarankan perikanan tangkap (ikan tuna/karang) dan kerang mutiara di beberapa teluk, karena cocok dengan  \u2018arus kuat  melingkar\u2019 yang kaya plankton untuk budi daya potensi kelautan.\nDalam jangka panjang (6-25 tahun): Perlu dibuat Perda Provinsi dan Kabupaten tentang Paket Pengembangan Wisata Dunia Bengkulu dan  Enggano ditargetkan dapat menembus pariwisata global. Caranya dengan meminta pihak terkait (Gubernur, Bupati dan DPRD) menghubungi kedutaan Inggris dan Singapura untuk menawarkan paket pemasaran bersama pengembangan wisata kapal pesiar besar (big sea-cruiser) dengan  jalur Triple-Cities (London-Eropah)-(Singapura-Asia)- (Bengkulu/mengelilingi Sumatera-Indonesia) terkait icon herritages (warisan sejarah) Sir Stamford Raffles Inggris, Portugis di Enggano dan  juga setahun Prancis di Bengkulu; terakhir: mengadakan kapal tangkap 30 GT dan mengkaji pengangkutan ikan segar/ikan hias hidup  dengan kapel tanker yang pulang kosong  dari Bengkulu ke Jakarta dan Singapura-Hongkong-Taiwan-Korsel.(srs)\n\nKata kunci: Politik Kebijakan Publik, Memajukan Enggano, IPSK, P2P LIPI, Model Kota Segi Tiga Dunia.\n \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40720133, "asset_id": 19598007, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 202479, "first_name": "syafuan", "last_name": "rozi", "domain_name": "lipi", "page_name": "syafuanrozi", "display_name": "syafuan rozi", "profile_url": "https://lipi.academia.edu/syafuanrozi?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/202479/47551/43774/s65_syafuan.rozi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 74, "name": "Transportation Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transportation_Engineering?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 798, "name": "Policy Analysis/Policy Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Analysis_Policy_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 942, "name": "Tourism Marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Marketing?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4071, "name": "Heritage Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Tourism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4123, "name": "Cross-border cooperation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-border_cooperation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4448, "name": "British Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4524, "name": "Sustainable Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Development?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6276, "name": "International Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Political_Economy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 10322, "name": "Nineteenth Century British History and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_British_History_and_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 10679, "name": "International Marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Marketing?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 14396, "name": "Sustainable Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Tourism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29411, "name": "Frontier Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Frontier_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 59470, "name": "Borders and Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Frontiers?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 62988, "name": "Traveling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traveling?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1476336, "name": "Objek Wisata Bengkulu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Objek_Wisata_Bengkulu?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 13673772, "title": "Daringly Different: The Making of the Singapore Management University", "created_at": "2015-07-05T18:45:15.997-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13673772/Daringly_Different_The_Making_of_the_Singapore_Management_University?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_13673772", "summary": "The establishment of the Singapore Management University (SMU) in 2000 represented a major departure from established systems and models of tertiary institutions in Singapore.

These claims are made in discussions of the current state of affairs or future course of Singapore. They go beyond the past and reflect (and reinforce) our perspectives and identities. We call such claims \u2018myths\u2019 in the manner that they render history useful for non-historical pursuits.\r\n\r\nThis forum series unpacks the myths of Singapore history. By myths, we do not mean fabrications, but discursive devices that have become accepted as part of our \u2018common sense\u2019. Myths are a shorthand for official discourses and policies; they thus mask countervailing views of history and obscure other possibilities for the future. As Singapore celebrates 50 years of nationhood in 2015, being aware of myths is an important social project that will make us a more mature, self-reflexive and inclusive people.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34848361, "asset_id": 8418060, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1517533, "first_name": "Kah-Wee", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "KahWeeLee", "display_name": "Kah-Wee Lee", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/KahWeeLee?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1517533/537737/672442/s65_kah-wee.lee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5223, "name": "Gambling Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gambling_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7655, "name": "Architectural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 132974, "name": "Casino Gambling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Casino_Gambling?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 7502018, "title": "Torsten Arnold's review of \"The Memoirs and Memorials of Jacques de Coutre\" (2014)", "created_at": "2014-06-29T20:06:51.006-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7502018/Torsten_Arnolds_review_of_The_Memoirs_and_Memorials_of_Jacques_de_Coutre_2014_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_7502018", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47877880, "asset_id": 7502018, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2861, "name": "Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 7088, "name": "History Portuguese and Spanish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Portuguese_and_Spanish?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 20433, "name": "History of the Portuguese Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Portuguese_Empire?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 5508527, "title": "Paul D.

This served as the royal residence of the Johor rulers between the late 1580s and at least until 1609/12. I will argue that in the early 17th century political and economic life at the Johor court at Batu Sawar was dominated by the interests of Raja Ali Jalla bin Abdul Jalil\u2019s four surviving sons, of whom two played an especially important role in forging Batu Sawar\u2019s commercial life: Raja Siak in terms of the trade in pepper and bezoars from Sumatra and Raja Bongsu in terms of the trade in rough diamonds.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63780594, "asset_id": 4303085, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter",

"summary": "By 1970, Singapore\u2019s urban landscape was dominated by high-rise blocks of planned public housing built by the People\u2019s Action Party government, signifying the establishment of a high modernist nation-state. A decade earlier, the margins of the City had been dominated by kampongs, home to semi-autonomous communities of low-income Chinese families which freely built, and rebuilt, unauthorised wooden houses. This change was not merely one of housing but belied a more fundamental realignment of state-society relations in the 1960s. Relocated in Housing and Development Board flats, urban kampong families were progressively integrated into the social fabric of the emergent nation-state. This study examines the pivotal role of an event, the great Kampong Bukit Ho Swee fire of 1961, in bringing about this transformation. The redevelopment of the fire site in the aftermath of the calamity brought to completion the British colonial regime\u2019s \u2018emergency\u2019 programmes of resettling urban kampong dwellers in planned accommodation, in particular, of building emergency public housing on the sites of major fires in the 1950s. The PAP\u2019s far greater political resolve, and the timing of and state of emergency occasioned by the scale of the 1961 disaster, enabled the government to rehouse the Bukit Ho Swee fire victims in emergency housing in record time. This in turn provided the HDB with a strategic platform for clearing other kampongs and for transforming their residents into model citizens of the nation-state. The 1961 fire\u2019s symbolic usefulness extended into the 1980s and beyond, in sanctioning the PAP\u2019s new housing redevelopment schemes. The official account of the inferno has also become politically useful for the government of today for disciplining a new generation of Singaporeans against taking the nation\u2019s progress for granted. Against these exalted claims of the fire\u2019s role in the Singapore Story, this study also examines the degree of actual change and continuity in the social and economic lives of the people of Bukit Ho Swee after the inferno. In some crucial ways, the residents continued to occupy a marginal place in society while pondering, too, over the unresolved question of the cause of the fire. These continuities of everyday life reflect the ambivalence with which the citizenry regarded the high modernist state in contemporary Singapore.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5813204,

reference to the decision by NUS Press&amp;#39;s decision to cancel Pavin&amp;#39;s book contract, the problem here is not a university press per se NOT publishing one academic&amp;#39;s book, this happens to academics all the time-books are constantly rejected on the basis of peer review, incompatibility with the mission of the press and so on. An abandonment after selection and contract would seem to indicate that a university press responded to undisclosed &amp;quot;stakeholder&amp;quot; concerns. This seems to fit a pattern that has overtaken the evolution of universities across Asia. Professionally, I advocate the role of historians in trying to explain the background of contemporary problems and that policies could be better informed if they are made with an understanding of the history behind them, and this is what I will try to encourage briefly here. Across the long history-and I look beyond the first university at Bologna to early proto-universities at Nalanda and Gundishapur as well, so thousands of years-universities were actually given to parochialism, the teaching of religion, the education of noble sons to do and think exactly as their fathers had done and their peers would do, the university was a place where thinking was structured according to what I call state-think-I am here applying James Scott&amp;#39;s concept of state space to the patterns of thinking 1-in a way that made thinking easy to conform to the state, to run the state, to lead the state. 2 The unspoken part of this process was learning how to control, suppress, and exploit the vast majority of the population. Colonial authorities knew this when they introduced colonial universities in the decades up to and just after World War I. These were to teach the colonial mother tongue, European ideas and values, and both obedience and the figurative whip through the provision of certain kinds of knowledge and behaviour. Select Southeast Asian youth of means and merit, would walk in elite children and walk out colonial bureaucrats, military officers, and intermediary elites. They saw or were meant to see the world as sharply defined, hierarchically stacked ethnic minorities, right and wrong moral sexual behaviour, the legitimacy of the huge global and racial disparities in wealth and just why Southeast Asians on the whole deserved to be servants and peasants, and why the indigenous mode of thought was inherently inferior to the western mode of thought.",

As colonial\nadministrators began their plans to unify and decolonize their territories in Southeast Asia, they recognised a potential problem with Singapore\u2019s economy. Although it was the richest city in the region, Singapore\u2019s wealth was almost entirely built on trade; should this trade have receded or shifted elsewhere it would spell disaster. Therefore, beginning in the 1950s and continuing throughout the 1960s, a policy was implemented to diversify the Singaporean economy by establishing local manufacturing industries. These eventually led to new industrial settlements on the island and introduction of new types of urbanised work.\n\nThis paper charts the Singaporean government\u2019s efforts to remake their economic future during the same period in which they traversed the processes of decolonisation. Drawing from political speeches, newspapers, government reports and promotional grey literature, the paper looks at the ways in which the state expressed its ambitions regarding industry, technical training, design and product development. This focuses attention on the period after the Industrial Promotion Board\u2019s founding in 1957, and follows the subsequent development of polytechnic education in architecture and engineering, the Industrial Research Unit, the Jurong Town Corporation and the Product and Design Centre. The material demonstrates the country\u2019s first efforts to organise and promote ideas about design as a means of strengthening the economy, as well as its internal strategies to create a manufacturing workforce that could engage with globalised industrial product design. Through this, the paper addresses a significant example of mid-twentieth century industrialisation in the postcolonial world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67327736, "asset_id": 48923922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51943143, "first_name": "Jesse", "last_name": "O'Neill", "domain_name": "chelseaspace", "page_name": "JesseONeill", "display_name": "Jesse O'Neill", "profile_url": "https://chelseaspace.academia.edu/JesseONeill?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51943143/46031870/35700773/s65_jesse.o_neill.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1632, "name": "Design History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246008, "name": "Modernisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernisation?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 830809, "name": "Design promotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design_promotion?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44870131, "title": "The rejuvenation of the NSP and the rebranding of the SDP: Conversations with Singapore\u2019s opposition politicians", "created_at": "2021-01-09T11:20:31.518-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44870131/The_rejuvenation_of_the_NSP_and_the_rebranding_of_the_SDP_Conversations_with_Singapore_s_opposition_politicians?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_44870131", "summary": "Via detailed personal interviews, this article canvasses the views of leading Singapore oppositional grassroots activists about the state of play in Singapore politics and likely developments over the next ten to fifteen years.

In this paper, Goh and Gomez reflect upon their reasons for leaving WP. Goh points to the lack of emphasis placed by the WP upon internet activism which he views as a strategic error. In one key respect Gomez differs significantly in strategy from Goh. Gomez argues that Goh\u2019s Malay Bureau within the National Solidarity Party (NSP) reflects outdated, old-school politics which can be contrasted sharply with Singapore Democratic Party\u2019s (SDP) post-modern multicultural ethos.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65382387, "asset_id": 44870131, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 179721135, "first_name": "Kieran", "last_name": "James", "domain_name": "westscotland", "page_name": "KJames", "display_name": "Kieran James", "profile_url": "https://westscotland.academia.edu/KJames?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/179721135/49778238/37786252/s65_kieran.james.jpg"}, {"id": 274610, "first_name": "Roderick", "last_name": "Chia", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RoderickChia", "display_name": "Roderick Chia", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RoderickChia?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/274610/63478/2474551/s65_roderick.chia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 165686, "name": "Grassroots Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grassroots_Activism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 260207, "name": "Ethnicity in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 461769, "name": "Singapore Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Society?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 614845, "name": "Singapore Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Political_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2194949, "name": "Singapore Opposition Political Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Opposition_Political_Parties?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 43786831, "title": "Singapore as a nexus of migration corridors: The qiaopi system and diasporic heritage", "created_at": "2020-08-05T03:21:00.195-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43786831/Singapore_as_a_nexus_of_migration_corridors_The_qiaopi_system_and_diasporic_heritage?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_43786831", "summary": "Singapore has served as a strategic hub of immigration in Southeast Asia over the past two centuries since its founding as an entrepot in 1819. It is not only due to its geographic location at the crossroads between the East and West, but also to its vibrant social and business organizations that have provided effective institutional links both within Southeast Asia and between the region and China. This has, in turn, contributed to the making of Singapore as a key migration corridor among the Chinese diaspora. An overlooked institutional link in this corridor is qiaopi, the remittances-cum-letters sent home by Chinese immigrants from the 1820s to the 1980s, which was part of the intra-regional circulation of capital, goods, people and information. Qiaopi was officially selected into the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) \"Memory of the World\" Register in 2013, thus demonstrating its heritage significance. This paper examines the role of the qiaopi trade in establishing and consolidating Singapore's place as the most important migrant corridor in Southeast Asia.

the mid-1950s, a young lecturer in the history Department at the University of Singapore named Ian Macgregor embarked on an ambitious project to research the history of pre-1800 Singapore and Malaya by using Portuguese documents. His findings were published in three articles in the Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society between 1955 and 1957. The untimely death of this researcher abruptly ended what appeared to be a promising trajectory in writing the history of Singapore and the region. For the past two decades, research on the Portuguese and other early European sources touching on the region in the 16th and 17th centuries has intensified and thanks to modern IT facilities easier access to archival materials worldwide, the question has resurfaced as to what the value of the Portuguese sources might be for identifying important events in Singapore\u2019s pre-modern history. This has become especially important against the backdrop of the ongoing preparations for the Singapore Bicentennial in 2019. The present paper should be seen as a contribution to the historiography of pre-1800 Singapore insofar as it critically engages with the different types of materials at hand, compares them with other period European sources, and reviews some of the different materials that have been published in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57167963, "asset_id": 37217257, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 19455, "name": "Early Modern economic and social history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_economic_and_social_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 36876896, "title": "Uniquely Singapore", "created_at": "2018-06-20T07:21:02.669-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36876896/Uniquely_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_36876896", "summary": "In this historical essay, Christopher Chew compares the fortunes of two Singapores - one in Asia, the other in the United States - and asks the question: \"Is Singapore really that unique?\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56831865, "asset_id": 36876896, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20087416, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Chew", "domain_name": "columbia", "page_name": "ChristopherChew", "display_name": "Christopher Chew", "profile_url": "https://columbia.academia.edu/ChristopherChew?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20087416/5594890/19747161/s65_christopher.chew.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8032, "name": "Cross-Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35967196, "title": "The 1824 Treaties", "created_at": "2018-02-20T02:43:26.459-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35967196/The_1824_Treaties?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_35967196", "summary": "This is a  summary write-up on the Crawfurd and Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1824 and their significance to  the history of Singapore.

This paper reports three critical findings from a material driven approach. Firstly, sites of pan-Asian trade in early Southeast Asia do not necessarily correspond to archaeological settlement sites. Second, communities marginalised as minor and peripheral such as hill tribes and sea nomads must be re-centred at the heart of historical causality in Southeast Asia. Third, ritual and exchange are far more significant as connective factors across Southeast Asia, than evidence of intensive commerce. The research presented here will demonstrate how using new sources and critical approaches change our understanding of Asia and historical causality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54859973,

"work_6978767", "summary": "While the study of urban historical traditions in the architectural curriculum is a shared mandate, its modes of instruction have scarcely moved beyond the usual stock of precedent studies focused on form, style and typology.  This method of instruction, though sufficiently providing parallel background knowledge for students of architecture, further isolates the disciplines of history, theory and criticism as increasingly remote parameters for design.  In the context of Asian architecture\u2019s ever more prolific expansion, such antiquated and rarefied notions of history need to be urgently reviewed.  Indeed, the future of Asian space hinges on the premise that its globalized formats is held in equilibrium by critical knowledge of its localized historical origins and impetus.  \r\n\r\nThis paper thus proposes a more complex relationship between history and design by revisiting how the historical aspects of \u2018site\u2019 may be activated in the academic design studio through experimental pedagogies focused on the representations and fabrications of architectural histories conducted in relation to particular sites.  Drawing on \u2018Site, Situation, and Spectator\u2019, an interdisciplinary site-responsive programme developed at the National University of Singapore, new methodologies for appraising and intervening with, as well as subsequently representing, histories of urban sites will be examined.  In the island state of Singapore, the rapidly changing patterns of reoccupied, reclaimed, redeveloped and contested sites in its built environment become causes of concern in terms of their cultural and historical sustainability.  \r\n\r\nThe challenge of this programme is to find new means of engaging future changes while maintaining a critical engagement with a site\u2019s historical lineage.  Techniques are adopted from within architecture and its allied disciplines \u2013 art history, cultural geography and material culture - so that the design process, which begins with a revision of attitudes towards the site\u2019s history, may cultivate broader contexts beyond the typical focus on precedence.  In particular, the paper will discuss how an expanded notion of \u2018site\u2019 enables different modes of representation and fabrication, which ultimately poses history as a constructed and ever-changing category, aligned with the vicissitudes of Singapore, and Asia\u2019s, future space. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33645177, "asset_id": 6978767, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 534750, "first_name": "Lilian", "last_name": "Chee", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "LilianChee", "display_name": "Lilian Chee", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/LilianChee?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/534750/190908/222613/s65_lilian.chee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16320, "name": "Site-Specific Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Site-Specific_Art?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50118, "name": "Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 6635719, "title": "A Personal Journey in Search of Art and Society in Singapore", "created_at": "2014-04-02T17:29:34.708-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6635719/A_Personal_Journey_in_Search_of_Art_and_Society_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_6635719", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33373250, "asset_id": 6635719, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6132275, "first_name": "Cheng Tju", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChengTjuLim", "display_name": "Cheng Tju Lim", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChengTjuLim?f_ri=48603", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 876, "name": "Print Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Print_Culture?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22807, "name": "Political cartoons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_cartoons?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 998282, "name": "Singapore Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 5914051, "title": "Juan Jose Morales, Review of P.

(NHB), led a 15-member delegation to Vietnam. This was the sixth in a series of visits made by the NHB staff to fellow ASEAN nations to be acquainted with their museums and artists, as well as explore opportunities for collaboration and partnerships. The delegation's arrival marked an important milestone in the cultural relations between Singapore and Vietnam, as NHB signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on cultural heritage cooperation with Vietnam's Department of National Culture Heritage.

The nation removed itself from British political structures and established its own governmental bodies to guide public policy and the design of the physical environment. In the recreational lives of Singaporeans, this post-war period was also a dawning \u2018age of swimming pools\u2019. The continuing growth of international shipping lanes and shipbuilding industries made ocean swimming unpopular, and national land reclamations landlocked the previous seaside tidal pools. Local bathing cultures, which had once looked outward to the edges of the island, started looking inland as the policy of building more public pools became official urban strategy. When the Housing and Development Board planned new towns, they included swimming as a key public amenity. The Jurong Town Corporation similarly found it essential to incorporate swimming into its development of industrial estates and workers\u2019 housing. \n\nIn this paper we study the design and political context of swimming in Singapore, concentrating on facilities built between the 1960s and the 1980s. Such examples of the spectacle of modern leisure architecture provided images of glamour among the brutalist housing estates. More importantly, we argue, these examples also relate to the spectacle of the body beautiful. Singapore\u2019s threatened attitude in the 1960s led to a new military service system and necessitated a culture of readiness \u2013 this manifested in national fitness programmes, and body displays in the form of \u201cSport For All\u201d events and military parades. For the good of the nation, Singaporeans were taught to be agile, physically fit, and military minded. Ready access to swimming pools both provided an avenue for nationally-sanctioned exercise regimes, and contributed to shaping a positive image of the new nation\u2019s material aspirations. This paper deals with themes of architecture, leisure, and fitness, and aims to contribute to a wider understanding of the experience of modernity in republican Singapore.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67327987, "asset_id": 48924188, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51943143, "first_name": "Jesse", "last_name": "O'Neill", "domain_name": "chelseaspace", "page_name": "JesseONeill", "display_name": "Jesse O'Neill", "profile_url": "https://chelseaspace.academia.edu/JesseONeill?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51943143/46031870/35700773/s65_jesse.o_neill.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1632, "name": "Design History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4216, "name": "Sports History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1384202, "name": "Swimming Pools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Swimming_Pools?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44784016, "title": "In Search of the True Singapore Story: And Why We Stopped Bothering", "created_at": "2020-12-27T19:01:58.970-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44784016/In_Search_of_the_True_Singapore_Story_And_Why_We_Stopped_Bothering?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_44784016", "summary": "It is often said that history is written by the victors.

This essay reviews the relationship between power and contemporary ideology, arguing that the discontinuity in the attitudes of everyday Singaporeans towards our national narrative reveals that hegemony is not the sole actor behind our contemporary ideology. That is, the construction of our national narrative, and its embedded \u2018truth\u2019, is not solely communally hegemonic, but one reminiscence to Mark Fisher\u2019s notion of capitalist realism.

Part travelogue, part history, Walton charts the opportunities and pitfalls confronting small states that have become particularly acute in an era of identity politics and civilizational leadership. Potential threats include not only the Singapore\u2019s struggle to insulate itself from global trends as well the impact of the rise of ultra-conservative attitudes in its majority Muslim neighbours, Malaysia and Indonesia, but also increased difficulty in balancing rival powers China and the United States. If that were not enough, Singapore is juggling multiple issues at a time that it is transiting to a new generational leadership faced with the challenge of ensuring that Singapore remains relevant to its neighbours as well as the international community at large.\n\nTo do so, Singapore\u2019s leadership will have to upgrade if not reinvent its relevance to its neighbours as well as the international community at large given tectonic geopolitical and technological shifts among which first and foremost artificial intelligence. Walton argues convincingly that complacency may be one of Singapore\u2019s greatest challenges. Generational change involves not only a new generation of leadership but also a generation that was born into a wealthy welfare state, lacks the older generations\u2019 sense of being pioneers and takes things for granted. It is a challenge that is likely to have consequences for a rethink of Singapore\u2019s education system, considered one of the world\u2019s best. In portraying the miracle of Singapore\u2019s success and the challenges it faces, Walton brings a strong sense of history, keen observation and a journalist\u2019s ability to paint with words an incisive picture of a country that has turned its lack of resources into an asset.\n\nListen to the podcast at https://dcs.megaphone.fm/LIT5437635421.mp3?key=ac069218022a771a4a516305aa6f55d5 \n________________________________________\nJames M.

Focusing on what was seen in the nineteenth century as the three most pirate-infested areas in the region - the Sulu Sea, the Strait of Malacca and Indochina - this comparative study in colonial history explores how piracy was defined, contested and used to resist or justify colonial expansion, particularly during the most intense phase of imperial expansion in Southeast Asia from c.1850 to c.1920. In doing so, it demonstrates that piratical activity continued to occur in many parts of Southeast Asia well beyond the mid-nineteenth century, when most existing studies of piracy in the region end their period of investigation. It also points to the changes over time in how piracy was conceptualised and dealt with by each of the major colonial powers in the region - Britain, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States. \nThis title is available as Open Access on Cambridge Core.\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/books/pirates-of-empire/5E1D8EA4E7DCDD5A3B4384E8FC61C0CF#fndtn-contents ", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2536366, "first_name": "Stefan", "last_name": "Ekl\u00f6f Amirell", "domain_name": "linnaeus", "page_name": "StefanEkl\u00f6fAmirell", "display_name": "Stefan  Ekl\u00f6f Amirell", "profile_url": "https://linnaeus.academia.edu/StefanEkl%C3%B6fAmirell?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2536366/790017/3089178/s65_stefan.ekl_f_amirell.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7396, "name": "Vietnamese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9830, "name": "History of Piracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Piracy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 26064, "name": "Philippine History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 62467, "name": "Piracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Piracy?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 39856605, "title": "1500s Singapore at the heart of economic hub of region", "created_at": "2019-07-17T17:29:52.148-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39856605/1500s_Singapore_at_the_heart_of_economic_hub_of_region?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_39856605", "summary": "As part of \u2018Seven Centuries in Six Episodes\u2019, a series of talks by renowned historians which complements the Singapore Bicentennial Experience, Associate Professor Peter Borschberg (NUS Department of History) gave at talk at Fort Canning with regard to the centrality of Singapore as a port of call during the 16th century. Dispelling the myth of Singapore being a \u2018sleepy little fishing village\u2019, as many have regarded it prior to the arrival of Sang Nila Utama, Prof Borschberg described Singapore as a flourishing trading hub, from petty merchants that touted their goods to even a famous sea admiral, known as the laksamana and for being one of the four great lords of Melaka, who resided in Singapore.

Several reasons can be cited to explain this: First, against the backdrop of research conducted in the past two decades or so, there is now greater awareness of Singapore\u2019s longer historical trajectory. There is greater appreciation that in studying the centuries before and after 1819, one is dealing with a history of a location with multiple strands and intersecting (hi)stories, rather than a linear story of the British colony and its successor institutions. This appreciation for the longer span of Singapore\u2019s history has, in turn, led to a reappraisal of 1819 and its significance across the longue dur\u00e9e. After all, how could one judge the significance of 1819 if one is not informed of the developments that preceded this date?

While existing scholarship has covered the military failure in great detail, researchers have not paid equal attention to the disorganization of the colonial administration, which played a no less important role in the years leading up to the defeat. Based on his meticulous research in British archives, Ronald McCrum has filled the gap by scrutinizing the \u2018irresponsible and incompetent\u2019 behaviors of the civilian authorities. He argues that by pursuing different priorities, the colonial government failed to take necessary measures to counter the growing threat of the Japanese. Besides the fact that the British civilian administration was in disarray within itself, their poor relationship with the military also greatly hindered joint efforts to augment the defense against the imminent invasion, which ultimately led to astonishing casualties when the war broke out.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55993233, "asset_id": 36102246, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 335629, "first_name": "Kankan", "last_name": "Xie", "domain_name": "pku", "page_name": "KankanXie", "display_name": "Kankan  Xie", "profile_url": "https://pku.academia.edu/KankanXie?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/335629/92861/23697031/s65_kankan.xie.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12739, "name": "Second World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_World_War?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 31608508, "title": "Tastes of Home: Home Cooked Food, Hawker Food and the Construction of Nostalgia", "created_at": "2017-02-25T20:09:20.046-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31608508/Tastes_of_Home_Home_Cooked_Food_Hawker_Food_and_the_Construction_of_Nostalgia?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_31608508", "summary": "In this article, I will attempt to explain the absence of home cooking in memoirs on childhood life in Singapore between 1950 to 1970.

Such changes in the urban identity of the city, that ranged from a major liberty given to the private sector to develop programmes of high-end housing to the construction of huge resorts and casinos have had a strong impact on the local conception of what urbanity is, in a country where the most common paradigms had been for 50 years that of collective public housing and of a strict, and sometimes intrusive, State supervision of urban virtues.

In earlier times its history was tightly knit to the development and prosperity of its port. Today\u2019s global trading hub, however, is broadly conditioned by its position within a global communications regime that includes various modes of transportation by sea, land and air, as well as electronic forms of communication such as telephony and the internet. Transport and telecommunications infrastructure are certainly prerequisites for success, but Singapore\u2019s rapid rise in becoming a global trading hub cannot be explained by these factors alone: the hub is backed by an array of industries that directly or indirectly support transport and trade at large, ranging from warehousing to finance and trade. All these activities, moreover, are regulated and driven by policies that have been carefully formulated and put into place over the past five decades. Then there is Singapore\u2019s greatest asset today: its people. In the context of this introduction, it is of course impossible to give a detailed or even comprehensive overview of the historical developments that have evolved and today underpin the global trading hub. What is possible, however, is to single out some of the developmental highlights as well as explain their historic relevance and interdependence. In the following sections I shall do so with an eye cast on history and chronological development as well as moving from the larger picture to the particular.

Vorbrich, whom I think you might like to meet.\r\n\r\nI have known Dr Vorbrich since the beginning of 2001. In 2001 and 2002 he was attached to the Global Positioning Systems Centre at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. He has written almost hundred research papers on navigation and satellite navigation and he used his knowledge in Singapore with great success.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Singapore Dr Krzysztof K. Vorbrich gave more than 20 lectures on the topic of satellite navigation at NTU and other scientific organisations in Singapore. His work as a scholar versed in satellite navigation was outstanding; he showed great proficiency in general navigation and performed his task as a lecturer and research worker with great success.\r\n\r\nI have introduced Dr Vorbrich to become a guest member of the Changi Sailing Club in Singapore. I have had the pleasure to sail with him dozens of times in the waters near Singapore and Malaysia. I have found his skills in practical navigation and boat handling to be commendable, and equal to his theoretical training in those matters.\r\n\r\nI understand that Dr Krzysztof K. Vorbrich is travelling to UK in order to get more practice in skippering yachts, teaching and training. He is also planning to collect research materials in British libraries, universities and museums for his second PhD, which he is writing in the School of English Language at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any help you can give him in his endeavour.

While the National Museum of Singapore presents Singapore's history in the national and regional context, the community heritage institutions offer an opportunity to capture the social and cultural histories of each community in greater depth.

In particular, it looks at three aspects of Singapore's pre-colonial existence-modes of economic production, patterns of consumption of international products, and the articulation of high culture vis-\u00e0-vis external entities. By examining available archaeological , epigraphic, art historical and cartographic data from the fourteenth through the nineteenth centuries, this article postulates how distinct consumption patterns may have developed among different riverside populations living north of the Singapore River.

Over the same period, curriculum planning has come under increasing centralization by state authorities, in conjunction with shifting official perceptions of the role of history education in national identity formation.  \n\nThis chapter explores both of these trends by examining, in turn, the periods 1965-1980, 1980-1990, and 1990-2000. It discusses how pedagogical tools like caricatures, photographic captions, quiz-style questions, mnemonics, and carefully selected source material are used to convey particular views of race, and prompt students to engage with, and internalize, a particular narrative of race in the nation\u2019s history. It also discusses how political imperatives of each period have influenced treatments of race in the history curricula through the mechanisms of centralized curricular planning. It argues that both the consolidation of the racial narrative, and the centralization of the curriculum, must be seen in light of how race is construed as a threat to sovereignty and stability in multiracial Singapore. \n\nIn closing, the chapter discusses more recent developments in Singapore\u2019s history curriculum, and assesses whether the use of history textbooks to promote a particular narrative of race will have the same effectiveness today. It suggests that pressures from both within and outside the educational bureaucracy can lead to changes in the dominant narrative of race in Singapore\u2019s textbooks. \n\nThis book chapter appears in an edited volume: \nPia M.

Drawing on materials of European origin, this article aims to unlock the perceived geostrategic value of the island before 1800 and investigates plans devised by the early colonial powers at the turn of 16th and 17th centuries to construct fortifications on and around the island, and found a colonial settlement.

From successive generations of political leaders to senior civil servants, estab- lishment elites repeatedly remind Singaporeans of these grave external dangers.5 ey reiterate the need for Singapore to be ever vigilant in the constant defence against perils beyond the border just to be able to survive. An extension to this account is the need to keep political and social liberalisa- tion in check lest they render Singapore vulnerable to deadlock, susceptible to unrest, and prone to predation. According to this perspective, only a government headed by a strong and capable ruling party that guarantees political stability can protect the nation, its people, and its prosperity from danger. is reasoning provides continuing justi cation for Singaporeans to accept the political status quo and continued controls over political contestation and civic organisation in Singapore. By taking a comparative perspective that considers other states in positions of external vulnerability, this essay brings the tension between security imperatives and greater political openness, plurality, and contestation into sharper relief.

two-part panel on activism in Southeast Asia that engages theories from social movement studies and facilitates comparative perspectives\"\n\n\nAbstract: \n\nSoutheast Asia has seen dramatic political and social change in the last decade. Accompanying this sea-change is the ebb and \ue001ow of popular protests, including anti- and pro-democracy movements, as well as struggles over issues of identity and the environment. Regrettably, this rich reservoir of bottom-up contention has not been fruitfully tapped by social movement studies (SMS) writ large. Tellingly, from 2010 onwards, the top two SMS  journals (\u201cSocial Movement Studies\u201d and \u201cMobilization\u201d) have featured only four research entries that drew on Southeast Asian examples. When Southeast Asian movements are examined, it tends to be by area studies scholars, uninformed by the SMS literature, or by political scientists, who overwhelmingly focus on overtly political contention. This panel will therefore engage insights from SMS, facilitate comparative perspectives, and in turn, ignite intra-region and border-crossing theoretical debates. New light is then shed upon certain well-studied movements, questioning current orthodoxies, which tend to be elite-centred, and revolve around political economy and civil society frameworks. \n\nBased on empirical research, this panel illuminates novel ways of integrating local studies of grassroots contention with SMS, whether via a culturalist lens, or an institutionalist orientation. Sensitive to local particularities, our papers will address not only the overtly political contention, but also the less obviously political, which is so often overlooked. Amidst the apparent tensions between discipline and area studies, we illustrate their mutual complementarity.

The article explores the colonial origins of Singapore\u2019s contemporary ethnic population breakdown and the emergence of ethnic Chinese as the island\u2019s majority community. It examines how the Singapore government has come to officially depict the island\u2019s multicultural \u2018success story\u2019 since independence, and the official emphasis on the necessity of maintaining fixed ethnic ratios which ensure that Chinese remain roughly three-quarters of the island\u2019s settled population. At the same time, this article interrogates the official rationale behind such a policy, illuminating the colonial-era discursive assumptions that underpin it, and highlighting the way such assumptions have been contested. The article especially focuses on the role that immigration has played in the state\u2019s effort to ensure Singapore\u2019s racial \u2018balance\u2019, and argues that such an ethnically-determined immigration policy has frequently unsettled the Chinese majority it has been intended to bolster, while calling into question the multicultural idealism on which the Republic of Singapore was ostensibly founded.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5633584, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Frost", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "MarkFrost", "display_name": "Mark R Frost", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/MarkFrost?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5633584/4100847/86738221/s65_mark.frost.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310, "name": "Demography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Demography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 121518, "name": "Ethnic and migration studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_migration_studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 640641, "name": "Transnational Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Migration-1?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 74406390, "title": "Asian Seafaring Communities and the Blood-Red Seas: Maritime Violence and the Waters Surrounding the Malay Peninsula, 1825-1885", "created_at": "2022-03-23T13:12:46.448-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74406390/Asian_Seafaring_Communities_and_the_Blood_Red_Seas_Maritime_Violence_and_the_Waters_Surrounding_the_Malay_Peninsula_1825_1885?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_74406390", "summary": "Throughout much of nineteenth century, seafarers sailing the waters off Malaya often experienced violence, as the era witnessed shifts in wealth and power.

I pay special attention to changes in the crop's perceived food value during the inter-war years, a facet overlooked by earlier scholarship. Five different migrant groups in Malaya - planter households, Asian cooks, colonial officials, government chemists, and estate labourers - played critical roles in transforming palm oil into a crop purely for industrial purposes, rather than subsistence. The peculiarities of Malaya's social context are further sharpened by comparisons with Latin America and West Africa, where different groups of migrants propagated the oil palm's subsistence cultures, instead of shunning them.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64516557, "asset_id": 40133384, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2695259, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Pakiam", "domain_name": "iseaslib", "page_name": "GeoffreyPakiam", "display_name": "Geoffrey K Pakiam", "profile_url": "https://iseaslib.academia.edu/GeoffreyPakiam?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2695259/3193298/43320832/s65_geoffrey.pakiam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5671, "name": "West Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Africa?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6858, "name": "Food History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 18535, "name": "Culinary History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culinary_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 52056, "name": "Vegetable Oils", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vegetable_Oils?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 170637, "name": "Oil palm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oil_palm?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 225333, "name": "Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaya?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 259330, "name": "Palm Oil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palm_Oil?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 672874, "name": "Coconuts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coconuts?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 966953, "name": "History of Cooking and Food Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cooking_and_Food_Culture?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 40109692, "title": "Singapore in the 16th Century", "created_at": "2019-08-17T22:04:26.685-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40109692/Singapore_in_the_16th_Century?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_40109692", "summary": "A Special collaboration with SkillFuture Singapore, this history series complements the Bicentennial Experience by providing a quick introduction to each century to give a deeper understanding of the different aspects of history.\n\nIn this talk, Associate Professor Peter Borschberg introduces 16th century Singapore, another period that is widely assumed to be \u2018missing\u2019 in Singapore\u2019s history.

The arguments show that, far from being a forgotten or neglected place, Singapore as a settlement, port, and strategic location was recognised and appreciated by both the local rulers and the early European colonial powers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58193370, "asset_id": 38149828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 38036451, "title": "Frank Beyer reviews Kwa and Borschberg, \"Studying Singapore before 1800\"", "created_at": "2018-12-25T02:49:51.166-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38036451/Frank_Beyer_reviews_Kwa_and_Borschberg_Studying_Singapore_before_1800_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_38036451", "summary": "This review was published online and in the print edition of the South China Morning Post in late November, 2018.

In contention was whether the city-state should defer to major powers or insist on pursuing its longstanding foreign policy principles.\n\nThis discussion came against a backdrop of China\u2019s new willingness to assert its foreign policy preferences, apparent fissures within ASEAN as well as US capriciousness. Such developments have the potential to shake longstanding pillars of Singapore\u2019s external relations. The debate reflects unease about shifts in East Asian politics and uncertainty over how best to respond.\n\nEngaging China \u2014 especially in terms of economics \u2014 while encouraging comprehensive US engagement in Asia are integral to Singapore\u2019s longstanding approach of \u2018not choosing sides\u2019 between Beijing and Washington. This policy assumes significant overlap in US and Chinese interests, shared major power desire for self-restraint and mutual accommodation and US commitment to the liberal international order it created after World War II. Recent developments seem to cast doubt on these long-held presumptions. In fact, the 2017 Qatar Crisis that sparked the debate stemmed partially from US disinterest and ambivalence.\n\nSingapore is especially discomforted by China\u2019s reclamation and arming of artificial islands in the South China Sea despite widespread opposition, and Beijing\u2019s non-participation in and lambasting of the Philippines-initiated arbitration tribunal process. Beijing was also exceptionally harsh in criticising Singapore over the latter\u2019s insistence on the rule of law in relation to maritime issues and the arbitration tribunal. The detention in Hong Kong of Singaporean armoured vehicles en route from Taiwan and the apparent exclusion of the Singapore Prime Minister from Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road Forum further heightened Singaporean concerns.\n\nOne of Donald Trump\u2019s first moves as US President was to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Other major trade arrangements hang in the balance as the US administration threatens punitive action against trade partners. The rashness with which President Trump seems to treat North Korea\u2019s development of nuclear weapons could also destabilise the region. Potential US global retreat is similarly disconcerting despite reports that the Trump administration dropped calls to make security commitments contingent on payment from allies and partners. Such actions detract from efforts by US officials to assure East Asia of active and consistent US engagement.\n\nBehaviour by Beijing and Washington endangers another important pillar of Singapore\u2019s foreign policy: its preference for international law, institutions and norms. Such mechanisms give smaller states a degree of formal equality with major powers, since all actors are technically restrained by the same rules, requirements, and procedures. Notably, participants in the July 2017 debate agreed on Singapore\u2019s need for institutions such as the United Nations and ASEAN as well as international law to be robust. They differed on how strongly to advance such arrangements.\n\nBeijing\u2019s rejection, mobilisation against and dismissal of the South China Sea arbitration tribunal process along with its expansive maritime claims and broad interpretation of exclusive economic zone rights suggests a desire to adjust internationals laws in fact if not in form. China\u2019s ability to break ASEAN consensus on positions Beijing deems inimical to its interests and Washington\u2019s new suspicion of multilateral institutions \u2014 seen in the TPP withdrawal and its criticism of the UN \u2014 portend greater pressure on key institutions.\n\nSome ASEAN members seem ready to accede to China on the promise of economic gain, even as Washington appears to be turning into an increasingly unreliable institutional partner. Then there is worry about major powers eroding sovereign autonomy by intervening domestically through business, academia and other sectors. Prevailing laws, institutions and norms are familiar to Singapore and it has historically excelled in working with them to its own benefit. Shifts on these fronts \u2014 which Singapore cannot influence \u2014 are cause for anxiety.\n\nThe debate abated with a reiteration of longstanding principles by Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan without new policies or strategic directions. Such trepidation is unsurprising given the many complex variables currently at play. Circumstances surrounding China\u2019s rise and the United States\u2019 relative decline are unprecedented for Singapore, and the country is on the cusp of a generational leadership transition. ASEAN is no longer the same conservative, anti-communist Cold War club, where member interests were relatively predictable and consensus was easier to develop. Climate change, long-term economic sustainability, and terrorism too present serious challenges.\n\nSingapore is not alone in trying to find its foreign policy footing \u2014 the July debate parallels ongoing discussions in Australia, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere about how to reposition strategic priorities. Singapore may ultimately wish to re-examine how best to pursue its enduring interests in maintaining freedom of action, economic openness and the containment of tensions given the evolving external environment.\n\nPossible considerations range from reducing reliance on ASEAN in favour of other partnerships to investing in far-reaching ASEAN reform, perhaps at some expense to autonomy. Contemplating such change, particularly in public, may be uncomfortable for Singapore\u2019s foreign policy traditionalists, but it is necessary for charting the city-state\u2019s future in an increasingly uncertain world and hence deserving of sustained and open discussion.\n\nJa Ian Chong is Associate Professor of Political Science at National University of Singapore.",

The proposal instantly led to a surge of local interest on the history of tramways. Tramways were extensively introduced in Asian cities along with the spread of colonialism.   Indeed, the introduction of tramway system is a landmark in the histories of urban transport and urban planning, as it has often marked the shift from pre-colonial man-powered to modern mechanised transportation, and made effective urban planning and economic development possible.   Yet, those topics in an Eastern perspective are scarce, and so in urgent need of further scrutinising and historicising.  This article aims at filling the gap by examining the patterns and impacts of colonial transport development, and its relations with urban planning, using the cases of tramways in two of the most important and busiest British colonial ports in the East \u2013 HK and Singapore.  After illustrating some essential background issues, the essay will compare and contrast the developments and impacts of HK and Singapore Tramways, which are then followed by the important but often neglected linkage between transportation development and urban planning in colonies.  It is found that the two tramways experienced similar experiences and difficulties at first, but the lack of governmental support and inferior management strategies in Singapore led to her tramways\u2019 ultimate downfall in the late 1920s, and thus limited the impact on the society.  Furthermore, it is agued that in the period concerned, due to the dominating laissez-faire capitalist approach in colonial administrations, the colonial transport did not play an active role in urban planning but indirectly served as catalyst to urban development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53208783, "asset_id": 33113470, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37717833, "first_name": "Joseph Gregory", "last_name": "Yu", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "JosephGregoryYu", "display_name": "Joseph Gregory  Yu", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/JosephGregoryYu?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37717833/10958804/17037237/s65_joseph_gregory.yu.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 132, "name": "History of Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134, "name": "Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3620, "name": "Comparative History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 21481, "name": "History of Twentieth Century Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Twentieth_Century_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25021, "name": "Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 103634, "name": "Spatial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 105152, "name": "History of Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Hong_Kong?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 105941, "name": "Tramways", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tramways?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 122558, "name": "Hong Kong History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 440193, "name": "History of transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_transportation?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 618970, "name": "History and Culture of Hong Kong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Culture_of_Hong_Kong?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1477490, "name": "History of Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2545865, "name": "History of Public Transport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Public_Transport?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2707505, "name": "hong kong tramways", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/hong_kong_tramways?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 32563543, "title": "What we can learn about the 1603 naval battle map off Changi", "created_at": "2017-04-21T07:34:46.630-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32563543/What_we_can_learn_about_the_1603_naval_battle_map_off_Changi?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_32563543", "summary": "At the dawn of the seventeenth century, Singapore was a happening place at the crossroads of seaborne traffic. It had a functioning port and a shahbandar (port master). When the Portuguese merchantman Santa Catarina was attacked and plundered by the Dutch with the support of Johor on 25 February, 1603, Singapore became a cradle of the laws of war and peace. The incident formed the basis of a discussion by Hugo Grotius published in 1609 as The Freedom of the Seas. This was one of the historically most influential works ever published on the freedom of trade and navigation on the high seas. But that\u2019s not all.\n\nThe Portuguese authorities in Melaka were miffed at the loss of the Santa Catarina and at the staggering losses the Dutch and the Johoreans inflicted on the merchants of Macao, Melaka and Goa---the owners of the Santa Catarina\u2019s rich cargo. To punish Johor for its role in the Santa Catarina incident, the Portuguese imposed a blockade on the Johor River between in August and October, 1603. At the end of September, unexpectedly, a squadron of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) showed up off Pasir Panjang. The Dutch ships were lost and disoriented by the maze of islands of the Singapore Straits. While they were attempting to find their way through Singapore waters, they were informed by local fishermen of the Portuguese blockade. The events that began to unfold from this point onward brought the scene of action back to Changi.\n\nThe different stages of the Dutch battle with the Portuguese in the Johor River, off Changi and in the final stage off northern Batam were captured on a map sketch with published in 1606. This map sketch together with the travelogue of the Dutch naval commander who spearheaded the attacks on the Portuguese off Changi will form the backbone of this lecture.  \n\nhttp://www.nlb.gov.sg/golibrary2/e/what-could-we-learn-from-the-1603-sea-battle-off-changi-by-dr-peter-borschberg-98257684\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52742780, "asset_id": 32563543, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 280, "name": "Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cartography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2990, "name": "Geopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4157, "name": "Naval Warfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_Warfare?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 12785, "name": "History of International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Relations?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48488, "name": "Historical Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Cartography?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 49837, "name": "Historia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 89295, "name": "Relaciones Internacionales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Relaciones_Internacionales?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 104788, "name": "Hist\u00f3ria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hist%C3%B3ria?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 132848, "name": "Diplomacia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomacia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 195481, "name": "Geopol\u00edtica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopol%C3%ADtica?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 316016, "name": "Geopolitica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geopolitica?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 30699963, "title": "'Indian subalterns and the caste question in Singapore's history', Migrants and Making of Modern Singapore, -

"summary": "This thesis examines the material plurality of socially differentiated groups in colonial contexts. Colonial societies have tended to be perceived through a post-colonial dichotomy of coloniser and the colonised. Identities, historical events and trajectories have been divided into the archetypes of a powerful, violent transgressing Coloniser and a passive agentless group, -the Colonised. The dichotomy of Coloniser and Colonised has been challenged by recent scholarship in cultural studies, anthropology, material culture studies, museumology and heritage studies. While some in archaeology have also begun to question this duality, there has not yet been a systematic study of the phenomena or of the role of small dynamic groups.\nTo address this gap in archaeological research, three case studies from the British Empire; \u2013 Calcutta, The Straits Settlements and Sydney \u2013 are analysed and compared to examine whether the archaeology and materiality of colonial port cities reveals a plurality of groups within colonial contexts. That these case studies are regional and temporal contemporaries also addresses the current lack of historical archaeology in South and South East Asia, as well as the lack of integration of Australian historical archaeology within the wider Asia-Pacific region.\nUsing principles of British and German landscape archaeology enables the contents and spatial relationships of a landscape to be examined as an archaeological site. This approach is complimented by a consideration of smaller scale material and spatial relationships within and amongst buildings.

This behavioural shift is reshaping nations, economics, environmental, materiality and military pressures. Similar to today, ancient Southeast Asia saw the rise of urbanism, long distance trade and dramatic environmental challenges. An understanding of how these challenges effected the region provides new insights into the challenges of contemporary Southeast Asia.\nThis is a presentation of my current research at The University of Sydney. Exploring the rise and demise of Southeast Asian urban societies, will help us understand some of the ways contemporary complex urban systems behave. My research uses comparative landscape archaeology to examine the responses of settlements in maritime Southeast Asia to issues of climate change and associated challenges.\nMy research reveals surprising trans-regional patterning that calls into question past presumptions that have used Eurocentric approaches. Specifically low density urban models need to be considered in light of the Greater Angkor Projects research in Cambodia.\nToday Southeast Asian cities are, like those in the past, forming large unsustainable low density urban systems. These require significantly more energy to operate than small high density cities. The ecological and economic footprint of these settlements is dramatically increased. As a result these cities are functionally more susceptible to climate change, natural disasters and economic fluctuations. Due to the different needs of low density urbanism, it may be necessary to rethink the networks of labour and resources required to grow, maintain and defend such large urban systems. This explains the sudden and dramatic demise of cities in the ancient world and provides important lessons for us today. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40675771, "asset_id": 19529854, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 792, "name": "Historical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Anthropology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3290, "name": "Urbanism (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism_Archaeology_?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 7870, "name": "Medieval Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Archaeology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 9437, "name": "Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 16723, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation And Mitigation Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation_And_Mitigation_Strategies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25991, "name": "Urban archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_archaeology?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 35801, "name": "Climate Change Impacts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Impacts?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 191026, "name": "Climate Change and Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_and_Food_Security?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 17539030, "title": "Teddy Sim.

It begins with a discussion of the Westminster model on which Singapore\u2019s parliament continues broadly to be based. It then explores the different ways in which the PAP government has innovated this model, focusing on how these innovations address or do not address the shifting tensions between representation and effectiveness, while strengthening the PAP\u2019s political control.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5841206, "first_name": "Kenneth Paul", "last_name": "Tan",

"Admiral Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge was a commander of one of the first fleets sent out in 1605 by the Dutch East India Company (VOC) proper. Apart from the commercial instructions he received from the company directors, he also carried with him secret military instructions which unfortunately are now lost. With more than 1400 men at his disposal, Matelieff imposed a blockade on Portuguese Malacca in 1606, fought the Portuguese armada at sea, forged an enduring alliance with the Kingdom of Johor and Aceh, and founded the Dutch fort at Ternate. \r\nOn his return to the Netherlands in 1608 Matelieff penned a series of memorials recommending major changes in the way the Dutch organized their operations on the ground in Asia. Importantly, he recommended the founding of a permanent base and the appointment of a supreme authority, a Governor-General.  Matelieff also urged the forging of alliances with rulers in Asia to ensure ample supplies of spices and other goods for the company. Needless to say, these alliances were ostensibly also meant to contain the power and reach of the VOC\u2019s European competitors and enemies.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors":

The book demonstrates how the state maintained its hegemony and legitimacy through the culture of crisis management through education. It is essentially the history of how Singapore&#39;s developmental state managed crises (imagined, real or engineered), and how changes in history, civics and social studies curricula, served to legitimize the state, through educating and moulding the desired &#39;good citizen&#39; in the interest of nation building. Underpinning these changes has been the state&#39;s use of cultural constructs such as Confucianism and Asian values to shore up its legitimacy.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors":

An abandonment after selection and contract would seem to indicate that a university press responded to undisclosed \"stakeholder\" concerns. This seems to fit a pattern that has overtaken the evolution of universities across Asia. Professionally, I advocate the role of historians in trying to explain the background of contemporary problems and that policies could be better informed if they are made with an understanding of the history behind them, and this is what I will try to encourage briefly here. Across the long history-and I look beyond the first university at Bologna to early proto-universities at Nalanda and Gundishapur as well, so thousands of years-universities were actually given to parochialism, the teaching of religion, the education of noble sons to do and think exactly as their fathers had done and their peers would do, the university was a place where thinking was structured according to what I call state-think-I am here applying James Scott's concept of state space to the patterns of thinking 1-in a way that made thinking easy to conform to the state, to run the state, to lead the state. 2 The unspoken part of this process was learning how to control, suppress, and exploit the vast majority of the population. Colonial authorities knew this when they introduced colonial universities in the decades up to and just after World War I. These were to teach the colonial mother tongue, European ideas and values, and both obedience and the figurative whip through the provision of certain kinds of knowledge and behaviour. Select Southeast Asian youth of means and merit, would walk in elite children and walk out colonial bureaucrats, military officers, and intermediary elites. They saw or were meant to see the world as sharply defined, hierarchically stacked ethnic minorities, right and wrong moral sexual behaviour, the legitimacy of the huge global and racial disparities in wealth and just why Southeast Asians on the whole deserved to be servants and peasants, and why the indigenous mode of thought was inherently inferior to the western mode of thought.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65373762, "asset_id": 44863166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 136151, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Charney", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "MichaelCharney", "display_name": "Michael W Charney", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/MichaelCharney?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/136151/36138/43430952/s65_michael.charney.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 46666, "name": "Human Rights in Asia / ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_in_Asia_ASEAN?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 334316, "name": "ASEAN Plus Three", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Plus_Three?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 541313, "name": "LGBT rights in ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_rights_in_ASEAN?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 692049, "name": "ASEAN Political Security Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Political_Security_Community?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 995742, "name": "ASEAN Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Community?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1218765, "name": "National University of Singapore.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_University_of_Singapore?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 44741076, "title": "Three questions on Malayo-European relations from the Southeast Asian Perspective (sixteenth to eighteenth centuries)", "created_at": "2020-12-19T21:29:10.464-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44741076/Three_questions_on_Malayo_European_relations_from_the_Southeast_Asian_Perspective_sixteenth_to_eighteenth_centuries_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_44741076", "summary": "This paper will identify and discuss some issues in the bilateral dealings that arise during the period of documentation of the early colonial powers.

Abstract: In der deutschen \u00d6ffentlichkeit grassiert seit vielen Jahrzehnten die gro\u00dfe Angst vor dem \"demographischen Wandel\". Wir werden in diesem Essay aufzeigen, dass der \"demographischen Wandel\" f\u00fcr uns alle ein grosser Segen sein kann, wenn wir der Herausforderung mit einem Paradigmenwechsel begegnen. Das bedeutet aber, dass wir vor dieser Herausforderung nicht in eine Politik des ungebremsten Bev\u00f6lkerungswachstums fl\u00fcchten. In der Konsequenz hat diese Politik der letzten Jahrzehnte zu grossen Fehlleistungen und Problemen gef\u00fchrt. Viel besser w\u00e4re es, dieser Herausforderung des \"demographischen Wandels\" mit Mut und Intelligenz zu begegnen, um einen grundlegenden Paradigmenwechsel einzuleiten. Wie es so sch\u00f6n heisst: jede Krise bietet die Chance zu neuem Gl\u00fcck. Der nachfolgende Essay ist nicht revolution\u00e4r, fordert also weder zum Aufstand, noch zum Streik auf. Vielmehr sollen in ihm Fragen aufgeworfen werden, die in ihrer Beantwortung zu einem Prozess der gesellschaftlichen Transformation 1 f\u00fchren k\u00f6nnten, als Beitrag f\u00fcr die Gestaltung einer besseren Zukunft f\u00fcr uns alle. Wir haben dieses Thema des \"demographischen Wandels\" insbesondere deshalb gew\u00e4hlt, weil ein Paradigmenwechsel in diesem Bereich die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Hebelwirkung f\u00fcr eine nachhaltige Verbesserung der gesellschaftlichen Verh\u00e4ltnisse in Deutschland und f\u00fcr die Lebensqualit\u00e4t f\u00fcr alle Menschen h\u00e4tte. Dabei wollen wir auch an die Forderung nach einer Politik f\u00fcr mehr Lebensqualit\u00e4t ankn\u00fcpfen, die 1972 von Willy Brandt f\u00fcr Deutschland vorgeschlagen wurde, um eine alte, \u00fcberholte Vorstellung von Politik, die sich allein am Wachstum des Bruttosozialproduktes (BIP) ausrichtet, auf neue, nachhaltige und menschengem\u00e4sse Beine zu stellen. 1 Zur Begriffskl\u00e4rung wollen wir hier kurz bemerken, dass wir unter \"Paradigmenwechsel\" einen grunds\u00e4tzlichen Wandel in einem bestimmten Bereich des gesellschaftlichen Lebens verstehen, wobei im Zusammenhang mit einem solchen Wandel neue Denkformen, eine neue Sicht auf die Dinge und die Welt entstehen. Die Transformation ist ein eher allgemein gehaltener Begriff einer Wandlung, der je nach Bereich, von der Mathematik bis zur Chemie, spezifisch formuliert wird.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62508842, "asset_id": 42349723, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 132234982, "first_name": "Walter", "last_name": "Pfluger", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PflugerWalter", "display_name": "Walter Pfluger", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PflugerWalter?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/132234982/42029471/33859125/s65_walter.pfluger.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 310, "name": "Demography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Demography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1725, "name": "Historical Demography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Demography?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7179, "name": "Late 20th Century (De-industrialisation)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Late_20th_Century_De-industrialisation_?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 16414, "name": "Knowledge-based Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge-based_Economy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 24550, "name": "Contemporary China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_China?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 36260, "name": "Futures Studies and Foresight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Futures_Studies_and_Foresight?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 42277, "name": "Knowledge Based System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_Based_System?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 72564, "name": "Perestroika", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perestroika?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 120970, "name": "Willy Brandt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Willy_Brandt?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 565470, "name": "Political economy of European welfare states", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_economy_of_European_welfare_states?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 666803, "name": "Linear and holistic thinking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linear_and_holistic_thinking?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 953242, "name": "Lebensqualit\u00e4t", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lebensqualitat?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1053954, "name": "Deng Xiao Ping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deng_Xiao_Ping?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3058321, "name": "Ludwig Erhard", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ludwig_Erhard?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3601079, "name": "Hamburgisch en Weltwirtschaftsinstitutes (HWWA) ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hamburgisch_en_Weltwirtschaftsinstitutes_HWWA_?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3601080, "name": "urbanization and slums in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/urbanization_and_slums_in_Europe?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3601081, "name": "politics of transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/politics_of_transformation?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 41882088, "title": "Cultural Anxieties, Aspirational Cosmopolitanism and Capacity Building: Music Criticism in Singapore", "created_at": "2020-02-06T05:45:36.087-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41882088/Cultural_Anxieties_Aspirational_Cosmopolitanism_and_Capacity_Building_Music_Criticism_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_41882088", "summary": "This chapter by a journalist-turned-ethnomusicologist begins with a personal anecdote, channelling critic Tim Quirk\u2019s indictment of academia and journalism\u2019s shared and ambivalent reliance on maintaining \u2018dysfunctional relationships with the truth\u2019.

It is through this principle that the Baweanese made sense and made do with their urban surroundings developing unique dwelling practices shaped by social and cultural structures. To show this process, this article will expound on the narratives shared by Uwah Husna, a former resident of the Ponthuk Tampilung, from the 1960s and contextualize them to how the Bawanese adapted their surroundings based on mental templates they adopted from their daily life in the Bawaen desa.

The study is embedded in the disciplinary debates on migration and gender. The complexity of the issues of education, migration and gender as they operate along and across other axes of inequality and differentiation such as ethnicity and religion get analyzed by focusing the perspective of the social actors. The central questions that have guided the research are: Why do Chinese Malaysian women migrate to Singapore for further education? How do the social actors negotiate the education path in a gendered manner? Which strategies do the female educational migrants pursue through appropriation and allocation of certain gendered ideals and norms in transnational space?\r\nThe most important finding of the study points out that against the background of an ethnically segregated and patrilineal Malaysian society, educational migration to Singapore is the key for a transformation of femininity for Chinese Malaysian women as it implies extended scopes of action and relative independence. \r\nIn multicultural Malaysia, the Malay Malaysian population profits most from national politics. \r\nDespite cultural diversity in Malaysia, the government legitimates a cultural Malay supremacy. This is also linked to religion, as Islam has been established as the compulsory religion for the Malay Malaysians. These developments of in- and exclusion are based on colonial categorizations of \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 and the concept of multiculturalism. The ethnic segregation was introduced during British colonial times mainly through the establishment of a formal education system. \r\nDue to the social emphasis on ethnic boundaries, broad, supra-ethnic political action regarding women\u2019s and gender issues has so far been difficult to organize. The Chinese Malaysian women have been denied equal access to education and equal participation in national gender politics for the last four decades. But not only do multicultural politics hamper women-related issues, but also patrilineal Confucian elements of the Chinese population group itself contribute to the poor implementation of gender-related claims.\r\nSingapore with its multiethnic meritocratic society is the destination for the educational migration of Chinese Malaysian women who seek more equal opportunities. Its \u201amodern\u2018 neoliberal education system opens up more possibilities for the migrants. The young Chinese Malaysian women do not only migrate to the \u2018modern\u2019, but also to the Chinese-dominated Singapore. Therewith, the migration process is also a means of ethnic distinction. Through appropriations of \u2018modern\u2019, Chinese-focused discourses on femininity, the social actors distance themselves from the Muslim Malay norms concerning family constellations, sexuality and romantic love as well as the body. \r\nBy means of change in perspective, the book not only analyzes the stories and topics of young Chinese Malaysian women, but also of female Malay Malaysian students with their perspectives on the similar issues. Through this complex picture, the transnational space between Singapore and Malaysia gets analyzed as a place of social order.

nominal independence. This is arguably already happening with some of its ASEAN neighbours. Under such an arrangement, Singapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be in the hands of Beijing\u2019s largesse.\" - Original\n\"One risk of Chinese dominance for Singapore over time is Finlandisation, even if many find this option unpalatable.\nSingapore\u2019s future prosperity and security would be subject to Beijing\u2019s largesse; Singapore would have to defer to China under such an arrangement. The concept comes from Finland\u2019s relationship with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, in which Helsinki kept all the formal trappings of sovereignty, but submitted to Moscow\u2019s preferences on foreign and security policy.\nSovereignty is not a dichotomous quality \u2014 it can be parsed into different components, each to varying degrees. Finlandisation is arguably already happening in South-east Asia at some level, given China\u2019s growing regional dominance.\"\n\nPlease find a link to the full piece on Today here:

"In Indonesia and the Malay World vol. 45 issue 133 (Nov 2017)\r\n\r\nCommendation in the Indonesia and the Malay World Young Scholars' Prize 2016.\r\n\r\nThis article traces conflicts and compromises over sounds associated with processions in colonial Singapore from the first recorded conflict in 1837 until tensions on this topic subsided in the late 1870s. Following the establishment of a British settlement there in 1819, Singapore became a meeting place for migrant communities of diverse cultural backgrounds as large numbers of workers arrived in the flourishing port. One of the stages on which intercommunal power dynamics were played out was the conflict over the right to make sound at particular times and places. Conflict over \u2018noise\u2019 ostensibly originated in the encounter between communities with fundamentally different sonic ideologies. British colonial authorities sought to control Asian sounds, while their colonial subjects resisted their attempts. If British principles of regulation had been enforceable, the conflict over processions would have been short-lived. In practice, the duration and complexity of the clashes demonstrates that the British were not decisively in control on this issue. Rather, a high level of compromise and negotiation between various ethnic communities was involved alongside simple colonial domination and resistance, frequently involving multilateral negotiations between Singapore\u2019s Asian communities and comparisons with governmental policy elsewhere. The vigorous efforts of Singapore\u2019s Asian inhabitants to defend their sounding traditions, and of the colonial authorities\u2019 attempts to control them, demonstrate the significance and usefulness of sound in the context of this divided colonial city.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28400601, "first_name": "Jenny", "last_name": "McCallum", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "JennyMcCallum", "display_name": "Jenny McCallum", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/JennyMcCallum?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28400601/10515394/11733932/s65_jenny.mccallum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5037, "name": "Historical Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Ethnomusicology?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6634, "name": "Soundscape Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7212, "name": "Sound studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 30601909, "title": "Review of Kadir Mohamed, Malaysia Singapore: Fifty Years of Contention 1965-2015", "created_at": "2016-12-24T19:50:38.157-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30601909/Review_of_Kadir_Mohamed_Malaysia_Singapore_Fifty_Years_of_Contention_1965_2015?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_30601909", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17810956, "first_name": "Charles Chao Rong", "last_name": "Phua", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "CharlesCRPhua", "display_name": "Charles Chao Rong Phua", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/CharlesCRPhua?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17810956/4976953/75079704/s65_chao_rong_charles.phua.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1911, "name": "International Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6276, "name": "International Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Political_Economy?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 692049, "name": "ASEAN Political Security Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Political_Security_Community?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 954114, "name": "Singapore Malaysia Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Malaysia_Relations?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 27195215, "title": "Pepijn Brandon Reviews P.

More than simply providing basic necessities to transplanted residents of the new housing estates, these ebullient open-air bazaars were important public spaces where families gathered to unwind after work. By the end of the 1970s, the second decade into Singapore\u2019s rapid economic growth, the itinerant hawkers that comprised them had vanished from the landscape of the island. Beginning around this same time, shopping malls, which epitomized Singapore\u2019s burgeoning image of First World prosperity, would be erected one after another along the 2-kilometre stretch of Orchard Road. At first, the assumption might be that the pasar malam or night market, with its seemingly rudimentary configuration, had existed in a primitive state of nature and innocence prior to the modernization of British Malaya. On the contrary, I would like to argue that the pasar malam formed an integral part of the process of modernization. It was a by-product of the extensive transformation of Singapore\u2019s spatial and social landscape, which marked the early stage of its national development. Furthermore, the chronological coincidence between the disappearance of night markets and the emergence of shopping malls could be seen as forming a genealogical relationship not simply in terms of commercial arrangement but also in terms of leisure practice. In this chapter, I examine the public culture of the 1960s to unearth how the pasar malam was perceived during its heyday. I suggest that this perception led to its elimination. Through the course of Singapore\u2019s robust development from a colonial entrep\u00f4t into a cosmopolitan hub, the pasar malam was efffaced from its domain and replaced by the mall. According to this perception, night markets represent disorderly and recalcitrant realities whose forms of creativity and contingency have no place in a leading global city, which must compete in the world market to attract capital investment and expatriate professionals. These unmanageable forms of creativity and contingency have been superseded by neoliberal ideals of \u2018innovation\u2019 and \u2018buzz\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52377577, "asset_id": 19605493, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 404426, "first_name": "Elmo", "last_name": "Gonzaga", "domain_name": "cuhk", "page_name": "ElmoGonzaga", "display_name": "Elmo  Gonzaga", "profile_url": "https://cuhk.academia.edu/ElmoGonzaga?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/404426/2647747/14555165/s65_elmo.gonzaga.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7531, "name": "History of Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Capitalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9705, "name": "Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capitalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 30096, "name": "Cultures of Capital and Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultures_of_Capital_and_Capitalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47112, "name": "Varieties of Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Varieties_of_Capitalism?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 18048639, "title": "Sonic histories and colonial encounters in nineteenth-century Singapore and Riau-Lingga (PhD thesis)", "created_at": "2015-11-09T17:00:40.053-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/18048639/Sonic_histories_and_colonial_encounters_in_nineteenth_century_Singapore_and_Riau_Lingga_PhD_thesis_?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_18048639", "summary": "This thesis explores hearing and listening in the Johor-Riau-Lingga sultanate during the transition to European colonial dominance in the region c.1819-1911. During this period the sultanate was split by competing colonial powers into a British sphere of influence including Singapore, and the Dutch-controlled sphere of Riau-Lingga, setting the two regions on different trajectories. In this thesis, I argue that sound-making and hearing were an important channel through which the colonial encounter was mediated in this region. I demonstrate how sonic encounters between ethnically-defined communities were highly productive; pre-existing sonic ontologies were refashioned, and certain sounds acquired new meanings. My analysis of the contrasting contexts of Singapore and Riau shows that the political, economic and spatial contexts affected how sounds were heard, and that these three factors were inextricably linked.\n\tMy focus on sound encompasses music, sound-art and noise among other things, and accommodates opposing viewpoints. I write from the perspective of my source material, discussing Chinese processional music, cannon fire and reciting Malay voices alike from the perspective of the listener. Chapter 1 explores concepts of the functions and powers of sound as represented in traditional Malay texts prior to the 1820s. Drawing on the local press, travelogues and colonial records, Chapters 2 and 3 examine the role of sound in the cosmopolitan port city of Singapore, showing how sound formed a point of contact, conflict and compromise between ethnic communities. Chapter 4 explores how these same issues played out in the contrasting social and spatial context of Riau-Lingga. Chapter 5 returns to Malay literature, exploring the lively tradition of syair recitation in 19th-century Riau, and the affective power of human voices as represented in the syair themselves. I propose that the defamiliarisation of this colonial encounter through attention to sound highlights above all the affective aspect of this process.\n\n(PhD thesis, King's College London, 2015)", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28400601, "first_name": "Jenny", "last_name": "McCallum", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "JennyMcCallum", "display_name": "Jenny McCallum", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/JennyMcCallum?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28400601/10515394/11733932/s65_jenny.mccallum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6634, "name": "Soundscape Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7212, "name": "Sound studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 244916, "name": "Malay Language and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 17767865, "title": "Ostsee-Zeitung reports the double launch of Borschberg's \"Journal, Memorials and Letters of Cornelis Matelieff\" and Michael North's \"The Baltic-A History\" in Greifswald on 29 October, 2015", "created_at": "2015-11-04T16:26:56.492-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17767865/Ostsee_Zeitung_reports_the_double_launch_of_Borschbergs_Journal_Memorials_and_Letters_of_Cornelis_Matelieff_and_Michael_Norths_The_Baltic_A_History_in_Greifswald_on_29_October_2015?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_17767865", "summary": "This article appeared in the Ostsee-Zeitung on 4 November, 2015", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39698663, "asset_id": 17767865, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 16430121, "title": "Book Review: Immigration in Singapore", "created_at": "2015-10-03T10:32:44.241-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16430121/Book_Review_Immigration_in_Singapore?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_16430121", "summary": "Das, Anup Kumar (2016).

"summary": "Decolonisation often involved picking from competing nationalist visions for the shape of the postcolonial nation-state. The visions which lost out are no less important for their impact on decolonisation and the nation-state, but they are often poorly understood. In Singapore, the rise of Singapore\u2019s progressive left gave the opportunity and drove the timing for the merger of Federation of Malaya and Singapore in 1963, before its leadership was removed by Operation Coldstore. However, the nature of the progressive left \u2013 their values, motivations, and goals \u2013 has never been adequately understood. It is usually attributed to some degree of Communist subversion, and Operation Coldstore presented as the solution to a security problem. Using vernacular sources and newly declassified documents, this article analyses Singapore\u2019s progressive left. It deconstructs the origin of the progressive left as a generational unit, reconceptualises the events of merger from their perspective, and re- evaluates their role and impact on the process of merger. In resituating the progressive left in the narrative of merger, it expands our understanding of Singapore\u2019s decolonisation.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 380793, "first_name": "Pingtjin", "last_name": "Thum", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "PingtjinThum", "display_name": "Pingtjin Thum", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/PingtjinThum?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/380793/118176/2411453/s65_pingtjin.thum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39492, "name": "Decolonisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonisation?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 225333, "name": "Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaya?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 614845, "name": "Singapore Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Political_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 4311522, "title": "Spices and Stimulants \u2013 A Clearing House and Agricultural Base", "created_at": "2013-08-23T14:04:52.041-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4311522/Spices_and_Stimulants_A_Clearing_House_and_Agricultural_Base?f_ri=48603", "dom_id": "work_4311522", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5205263, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Borschberg", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "PeterBorschberg", "display_name": "Peter Borschberg", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/PeterBorschberg?f_ri=48603", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5205263/2293146/36384048/s65_peter.borschberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=48603", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 3479, "name": "Business History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 6940, "name": "Consumption Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_Studies?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 25552, "name": "Consumption and Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_and_Material_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 54691, "name": "History of Commodities in a Global Perspective", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Commodities_in_a_Global_Perspective?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 60428, "name": "Medical History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_History?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 373895, "name": "medicinal & Aromatic plants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/medicinal_and_Aromatic_plants?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 376660, "name": "Herbs & Spices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Herbs_and_Spices?f_ri=48603"}, {"id": 511009, "name": "Consumption Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_Culture?f_ri=48603"}]}, {"id": 4311422, "title": "Security, VOC Penetration and Luso-Spanish Co-operation.

conservation issues in Singapore are explored in this study, based on the experiences of Jalan Besar and Balestier, which are two nodes of \"Old World Charm\" identified for holistic conservation by

The discussion considers the changing ideologies and strategies of the planning authorities towards urban heritage conservation vis-a-vis the perspectives of the general public. Specifically, the issue of heritage contestation and the extent of public consultation are explored. Despite the planning authorities' claims to synergize the activities and communities within the built environment and to garner more public feedback, this study reveals that there are limited efforts in conserving the vernacular landscapes in Jalan Besar and Balestier and in consulting the public for constructive feedback. To resolve the complications in heritage conservation and a more transformative approach of public participation are recommended.
