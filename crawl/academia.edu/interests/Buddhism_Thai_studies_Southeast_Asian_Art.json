The Buddha did not present relics to the brothers, but by the time of the great Commentaries, Buddhaghosa and Dhammapala had expanded the story to include 8 living hair relics that the Buddha gifted to the brothers. Accretions never stopped and by the time that the myth assumed importance in Burma (late 15th-century Mon, Burmese and Pali inscriptions at the Shwedagon), even a medieval Sri Lanka episode about a nagaraja was added,  from the Naladhatuvamsa. The later Burmese conquest of Lower Burma saw the myth expand yet into new directions, incorporating local nats, who assisted a search for the relics of past Buddhas who had visited Lower Burma. The most prominent nat was located at Sule Pagoda, a shrine elevated to prominence only because the pagoda was made the hub in the newly adopted city plan of British Rangoon. This chapter is merely a brief summary of the various myths and the monument's patronage.

The examination of Buddhist art and architecture as vehicles of national memory-making can be framed conceptually by the dialectical tension between their cult value as continuing foci of devotion and their exhibition value as evidence of cultural achievement. Four aspects of this productive tension are emphasized: the foundational tension in Buddhism between the doctrine of impermanence and the cult of relics; the tension between Buddhist monuments as elements of the diffuse sacred landscape and, conversely, of individual countries' historical landscape; the tension between the place and reception of buddha images in the temple and, instead, in the museum; and finally, the tension between the traditional pious care for Buddhist monuments and their modern, scientific conservation. Owing to these productive tensions, works of Buddhist art and architecture continue to generate spiritual, cultural, and social meanings-in particular identitarian and mnemonic associations-even though in multiethnic and multireligious societies, these meanings are not uncontested.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66719116, "asset_id": 47777086, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62407, "first_name": "Maurizio", "last_name": "Peleggi", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "MaurizioPeleggi", "display_name": "Maurizio Peleggi", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/MaurizioPeleggi?f_ri=327417", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62407/17746/28527148/s65_maurizio.peleggi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9617, "name": "Cultural Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Nationalism?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12644, "name": "Commemoration and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_and_Memory?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 32191, "name": "Japanese Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Art_History?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 43802, "name": "Buddhist art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_art_and_architecture?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 110012, "name": "Indian Archaeology and History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Archaeology_and_History_of_Art?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 327417, "name": "Buddhism, Thai studies, Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_Thai_studies_Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 408818, "name": "Thailand archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_archaeology?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 795101, "name": "Buddhism In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_In_Thailand?f_ri=327417"}]}, {"id": 44472930, "title": "Sangha as art public?

Publics for art have been under-studied in this region, and rarely discussed in more nuanced terms than as being a \u2018general public\u2019 or \u2018ordinary people.\u2019 The essay argues for the need for an alternate vocabulary and terms of reference for thinking and speaking about the reception of art: one that is theoretically informed by and engaged with the multiplicity of discourses and publics in this part of the world. The essay provides a brief survey of the sangha\u2019s role in the development of modern art in Southeast Asia, as a constitutive agent in the articulation of modernity since the mid-nineteenth century, and then concentrates on the engagement of monks with contemporary art, since the 1990s. Key examples discussed include activities organised by Sa Sa Art Projects in Phnom Penh since 2010; the collection and programming of the Buddhist Archive of Photography in Luang Prabang; the practice of artist Orawan Arunrak since 2015; and the historiography of the Chiang Mai Social Installation and related festivals held during the 1990s. \n\nPublished in a special issue of World Art journal titled \"Contemporary Art Worlds and Art Publics in Southeast Asia\", guest edited by Michelle Antoinette and Francis Maravillas.

The Chinese culture had blended with the harmonious Thai method. In the arts, mural painting is a reflection of Buddhist stories in orderly pattern of each wall which has been used in Thailand since the Ayutthaya period. The appearance of Chinese mural painting is an art style that affects the community and local to present the influence of concepts, values, beliefs, and social behaviors. It also \nexpresses the power of leadership in the community by image and structure of the painting analysis.\nThe study of mural paintings of Wat Buppharam, Muang, Trad province, found that the painting is unique and different from others by the influence of traditional Chinese painting. There are full of Chinese writing on the whole area of the wall; the structure is not based on the original Thai framework to reflect the role and influence of China which is creating a new identity through mural painting in the community. The symbol of belief in various perspectives, related to the way of life, indicates the identity of the Chinese people to Buddhism which also impacts to the leadership of the community. As a result, the appearance of Chinese mural painting of Wat Buppharam has represented both concepts and elements of Chinese arts by using a combination of cultures and symbolic forms to reflect the expansion of Chinese culture from the capital cities of the east coast", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67390932, "asset_id": 49002528, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7940494, "first_name": "Puvasa", "last_name": "Rcw", "domain_name": "su-th", "page_name": "puvasaRcw", "display_name": "Puvasa  Rcw", "profile_url": "https://su-th.academia.edu/puvasaRcw?f_ri=327417", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7940494/2790179/17833438/s65_puvasa.rcw.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 182511, "name": "Mural painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mural_painting?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 327417, "name": "Buddhism, Thai studies, Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_Thai_studies_Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 499449, "name": "Thai Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Study?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5191778, "title": "Ritual Restructurings of New Year Ceremonies in Northern Laos", "created_at": "2013-11-22T21:08:39.749-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5191778/Ritual_Restructurings_of_New_Year_Ceremonies_in_Northern_Laos?f_ri=327417", "dom_id": "work_5191778", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32382350, "asset_id": 5191778, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6345404, "first_name": "Vanina", "last_name": "Bout\u00e9", "domain_name": "ehess", "page_name": "VaninaBout\u00e9", "display_name": "Vanina Bout\u00e9", "profile_url": "https://ehess.academia.edu/VaninaBout%C3%A9?f_ri=327417", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6345404/2659386/42435466/s65_vanina.bout_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12538, "name": "Funeral Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funeral_Practices?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 54320, "name": "LAOS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LAOS?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 144279, "name": "Anthropology of Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Buddhism?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 205060, "name": "Tibeto-Burman", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibeto-Burman?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 324649, "name": "Funeral Rites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funeral_Rites?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 327417, "name": "Buddhism, Thai studies, Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_Thai_studies_Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 698585, "name": "Anthropology of Buddhism,  Theravada Buddhism,  Burma studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Buddhism_Theravada_Buddhism_Burma_studies?f_ri=327417"}]}, {"id": 2042640, "title": "(2012) Thai and Islamic Influences on Thailand\u2019s Southern Malays.

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

paper discusses two groups of musical instruments gifted by Thai Monarchs to the United States: six instruments accompanying the Harris Treaty (1856) and nineteen instruments sent for Philadelphia\u2019s Centennial Exposition (1876). We suggest that the selection of these pieces was primarily for aesthetic quality or display, not for their acoustic properties. Though they are visually impressive, sometimes a single item was given of normally paired instruments; some pairs given are not of matching design; non-visible components required to play them were originally missing; and one cannot assemble the instruments given into most traditional ensembles. Yet they served well as symbols, in King Mongkut\u2019s words to U.S. President Pierce, of \u201cheartful and true friendship\u201d and to confirm the \u201cpower in manufactures\u201d of Thailand\u2019s \u201cworkmen and artists.\u201d We conclude by briefly contrasting these with the instruments presented to the Library of Congress by King Bhumipol Adulyadej, Rama IX (a musician himself), during his 1960 visit to Washington, D.C.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57787028, "asset_id": 36666471, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=327417", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5037, "name": "Historical Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Ethnomusicology?f_ri=327417", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 14833, "name": "Gift Giving (Economic Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gift_Giving_Economic_Anthropology_?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 53272, "name": "Musical Instruments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Musical_Instruments?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 117087, "name": "Thai political history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_political_history?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 327417, "name": "Buddhism, Thai studies, Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_Thai_studies_Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=327417"}, {"id": 924450, "name": "Thai Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Art?f_ri=327417"}]}]
