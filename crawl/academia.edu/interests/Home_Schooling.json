This data was analysed using perspectives from historical sociocultural, critical and identity theories. Participant groups discussed common experiences from different perspectives. Students fell into four ability groups \u2013 gifted, advanced learners, average and students with learning and/or health difficulties. Less than a quarter of the students interviewed in this study were identified as average students.

We show that historically, similar shocks in average learning levels disproportionally affect the most vulnerable students, and that emerging evidence from developed countries, as well as simulations, support the expected significant shifts in the learning distribution.

presented article, we are looking for the solutions and challenges of homeschooling in terms of further education and labour market inclusion.\r\nPurpose: The purpose of the paper is to discuss the conceptual framework of a research-initiative on homeschooling. What are the consequences? Because of a lack of adequate state language usage, is there a forced migration in the pupils\u2019 career paths? To what extent are homeschoolers included into traditional compulsory education, lifelong learning, the labor market, and the society?\r\nMethods: This is a paper with the conceptual framework of a research, where snowball sampling based qualitative interviews are planned.\r\nResults: From the research to be conducted, the authors expect a reliable picture of the causes, challenges and consequences of homeschooling on lifelong learning, the labour market and social inclusion.\r\nDiscussion: It seems that homeschooling in the Seclerland is a de-schooling solution, because it is usually opted by parents dissatisfied with the quality of education. It helps them avoid Romanian language tests of skills and maturity examinations. We assume that those with outstanding competencies (e.g. in music or sports) or those with a certain handicap (e.g. health problems), as well as those temporarily living abroad are choosing it. It can be a sort of forced solution, a self-defense strategy that protects students from increasing school conflicts, and a reaction to the lack of satisfactory educational offers, commuting, or school segregation.\r\nLimitations: Limitations of research are due to the snowball sample method and time/money limits.\r\nConclusions: We hope that, above all, the results will help parents to take a wise decision on whether to choose this option or not, but also schools and decision makers in education to assess their roles in the process and make changes if they want to and can do so.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98896586, "asset_id": 97212219, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35169795, "first_name": "Kinga", "last_name": "Mandel", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KingaMandel", "display_name": "Kinga M A G D O L N A Mandel", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KingaMandel?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35169795/11166128/12460586/s65_kinga.mandel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83247, "name": "Homeschooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 505236, "name": "Homeschool", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschool?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 991492, "name": "Integration of Ethnic Resources to Homeschooling Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration_of_Ethnic_Resources_to_Homeschooling_Methods?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 97211844, "title": "THE REASONS OF HOMESCHOOLING IN THE SZEKLER REGION, ROMANIA", "created_at": "2023-02-20T03:13:32.449-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/97211844/THE_REASONS_OF_HOMESCHOOLING_IN_THE_SZEKLER_REGION_ROMANIA?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_97211844", "summary": "The aim of this paper is to analyze the reasons for homeschooling in the Szekler region in Romania.

Based on a social constructivist (Vygotsky, 1986) and stakeholder (Smith, 2000) methodological framework, we developed a qualitative research inquiry, with semi-structured, theme-centered interviews, processed in Excel. The conclusion is that although the main reasons for homeschooling collide with that of homeschoolers elsewhere in the world (mainly the USA), some contextual specificities are locally overwriting some of them. We hope that, our study will assist parents to take a wiser decision on whether to choose this schooling option or not, but also schools and decision makers involved in education to assess their roles in the process and make changes if they consider so.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98896326, "asset_id": 97211844, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35169795, "first_name": "Kinga", "last_name": "Mandel", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KingaMandel", "display_name": "Kinga M A G D O L N A Mandel", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KingaMandel?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35169795/11166128/12460586/s65_kinga.mandel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 83247, "name": "Homeschooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 505236, "name": "Homeschool", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschool?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 991492, "name": "Integration of Ethnic Resources to Homeschooling Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration_of_Ethnic_Resources_to_Homeschooling_Methods?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1286459, "name": "Homeschool Publisher", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschool_Publisher?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1466983, "name": "Home Education, Home Schooling, Homeschool", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education_Home_Schooling_Homeschool?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1836877, "name": "Homeschooling Versus Public School", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling_Versus_Public_School?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 97191026, "title": "Challenges to Private School Teachers in Remote Areas of Pakistan During Pandemic: An Exploratory Study", "created_at": "2023-02-19T20:20:59.177-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/97191026/Challenges_to_Private_School_Teachers_in_Remote_Areas_of_Pakistan_During_Pandemic_An_Exploratory_Study?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_97191026", "summary": "It was because of the worldwide lockdown, the COVID-19 had quite a significant impact on corporate organizations as well as the lives of millions of people.

study approach was used to uncover perspectives held by parent teachers who home educate their children, either through full-time home education or part-time options called \u2018flexi-schooling\u2019 in England & Wales or \u2018hybrid home schooling\u2019 in the USA. Eight participants, with six or more years of home educating experience, gave a voice to their individualised practices; three of the participants were also able to give insight to their version of flexi-schooling or hybrid home schooling. Home education represents no more than 3 per cent of compulsory schooled children in either community studied; yet it is legal, and a viable alternative for some families. Part-time home education combined with part-time instruction in schools was seen as less visible in online home education materials, as well as less deliberately practiced, by participating parent teachers. Nonetheless, with a broader definition including accessing online classes, dual enrolment in community college, or teacher-led tutor groups, the study found that all eight participants customised their practice to \u2018flexi-school\u2019 or \u2018hybrid home school\u2019 to some extent. The part-time inclusion of flexible or hybrid teaching from sources other than the parent teacher was especially apparent for children accessing classes for college credit in the USA, or courses to enable International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) or Advanced Level (A Level) examination success. Though the study does not claim to be representative of complex home educating communities, it aims to add to and continue the conversation on home education, especially on flexi-schooling and hybrid home schooling.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97967397, "asset_id": 95924093, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52798739, "first_name": "Sam", "last_name": "Eddis", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SamEddis", "display_name": "Sam Eddis", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SamEddis?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1003, "name": "Educational Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Technology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1298, "name": "Alternative Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15869, "name": "Online Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Learning?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 95242497, "title": "Inclusive Skills : Psychological Resources and the Role Played by Spirituality", "created_at": "2023-01-18T09:08:32.193-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/95242497/Inclusive_Skills_Psychological_Resources_and_the_Role_Played_by_Spirituality?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_95242497", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97478087, "asset_id": 95242497, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24240204, "first_name": "janusz", "last_name": "surzykiewicz", "domain_name": "wfi", "page_name": "januszsurzykiewicz", "display_name": "janusz surzykiewicz", "profile_url": "https://wfi.academia.edu/januszsurzykiewicz?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24240204/106876803/96090898/s65_janusz.surzykiewicz.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3815, "name": "Spirituality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 94996431, "title": "Senior High School Homeschoolers' Perceived Impact of the Flipped Classroom on ESL Learning in an Online Platform", "created_at": "2023-01-14T20:01:16.368-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/94996431/Senior_High_School_Homeschoolers_Perceived_Impact_of_the_Flipped_Classroom_on_ESL_Learning_in_an_Online_Platform?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_94996431", "summary": "Many scholars have conducted studies on Flipped Classrooms (FC) over a decade.

To address this gap, this study focused on the perceived effect of the Flipped Classroom on Grade 11 Homeschoolers' ESL learning in a digital classroom during the pandemic. Twenty-five Grade 11 students were taught Reading and Writing Skills subject using the FC for three days. The researcher observed her co-researcher's Flipped classroom execution and gave her constructive feedback to refine her FC implementation. On Days 2 and 3, the researcher-made survey was administered to determine the students' perceived effect of the Flipped Model on their learning. However, only 15 and 11 students responded to the survey on Day 2 and 3, respectively. A Focused group discussion was also conducted on Day 3 for the same purpose. Weighted mean was used to measure the students' perception of the effect of the FC on their learning. Students' responses to the open-ended questions and during the FGD were coded. Results show that the Grade 11 students perceived the positive effect of the Flipped Classroom on their learning through engaging in-class group activities and the materials provided before the session (cognitive engagement). Despite the study's limitations, the findings show that the Grade 11 students perceived that Flipped classroom positively impacted their learning of English language skills due to engaging in collaborative activities. Hence, educators may utilize Flipped Classrooms as an instructional method; however, they must design the learning content, materials, and activities well to provide maximum student engagement.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97300782, "asset_id": 94996431, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 142738739, "first_name": "Nina Svetlana", "last_name": "Mendoza", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NinaSvetlanaMendoza", "display_name": "Nina Svetlana Mendoza", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NinaSvetlanaMendoza?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5625, "name": "Instructional Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Instructional_Technology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24943, "name": "Distance Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distance_Learning?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 94932269, "title": "Educational Cooperatives and the Changing Nature of Home Education: Finding Balance Between Autonomy, Support, and Accountability", "created_at": "2023-01-13T12:33:38.893-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/94932269/Educational_Cooperatives_and_the_Changing_Nature_of_Home_Education_Finding_Balance_Between_Autonomy_Support_and_Accountability?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_94932269", "summary": "Four families&#39; experiences in an educational cooperative and the impact on their home schools are detailed in the study.

There were multiple signs everywhere of its decline and perhaps even of its imminent death. Fewer and fewer people were attending European churches and those that did were rapidly aging. North American churches were breaking into either a vapid, liberal emptiness or a religious, anti-intellectual fundamentalism. South American Churches were increasingly becoming separated from the concerns of the people and no leaders seemed capable of speaking to those concerns with authority. None of these patterns were new. With every discovery emerging from the world of science over the last 500 years in regard to the origins of the universe and of life itself, the traditional explanations offered by the Christian Church appeared to be more and more dated and irrelevant. Christian leaders, unable to embrace the knowledge revolution seemed to believe that the only way to save Christianity was not to disturb the old patterns either by listening to, much less by entertaining the new knowledge.\n     As I engaged these issues as a bishop and a committed Christian, I became convinced that the only way to save Christianity as a force in the future was to find within the church the courage that would enable it to give up many of the patterns of the past.

To see whether this is so, we introduce the concept of \u2018attentive parenting\u2019, which encompasses a set of family characteristics, and we examine whether and under what conditions attentive parents risk loss of intimacy by sending their children to school; or, alternatively, whether they can avoid this risk by educating children at home.

It begins with the recognition that home education is a legal alternative to school education in Australia. However it argues that legal definitions of home education do not properly reflect the practice of home education. This is illustrated by an examination of different educational approaches taken by home educators and research on the socialisation of home educated children in Australia. Research on who chooses home education, why people choose home education and the educational outcomes for home educated children is also discussed. Home educating families represent all family types, are found in rural, suburban and city locations, and choose home education for a variety of reasons. Research indicates that Australian home educated children have positive educational and social experiences and outcomes.

theme of fundamental social significance, neither has had much social recognition nor sociological attention commensurate with this importance. In this Current Sociology monograph we want to move the discussion forward towards a global sociology of care and care work. The contributions focus on both theoretical and empirical studies about care relations and their global interrelations. To shed light on the dynamics that characterise the social organisation of care and care work, the monograph has been structured around three significant tendencies in the international sociology of care: (a) the marketisation and the de-commodification of care and care work; (b) the transnationalisation of labour and policies; and (c) new forms of governance and social statehood. The articles in this monograph present state of the art research reflecting on the care-situation, -arrangements and -regimes all over the globe.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88195626, "asset_id": 82508579, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83305748, "first_name": "Brigitte", "last_name": "Aulenbacher", "domain_name": "jku", "page_name": "BrigitteAulenbacher", "display_name": "Brigitte Aulenbacher", "profile_url": "https://jku.academia.edu/BrigitteAulenbacher?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83305748/52051491/40148455/s65_brigitte.aulenbacher.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63855, "name": "Current Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Current_Sociology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 165253, "name": "Care work", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Care_work?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 82508483, "title": "Violence against Women as an Issue of Human Rights, Justice and Democracy \u2013 An Interview with Margaret Abraham", "created_at": "2022-07-02T18:55:27.326-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82508483/Violence_against_Women_as_an_Issue_of_Human_Rights_Justice_and_Democracy_An_Interview_with_Margaret_Abraham?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_82508483", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88195595, "asset_id": 82508483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83305748, "first_name": "Brigitte", "last_name": "Aulenbacher", "domain_name": "jku", "page_name": "BrigitteAulenbacher", "display_name": "Brigitte Aulenbacher", "profile_url": "https://jku.academia.edu/BrigitteAulenbacher?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83305748/52051491/40148455/s65_brigitte.aulenbacher.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52408, "name": "Literary studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 82508439, "title": "The new entrepreneurship in science and changing gender arrangements \u2013 Approaches and perspectives", "created_at": "2022-07-02T18:55:08.044-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82508439/The_new_entrepreneurship_in_science_and_changing_gender_arrangements_Approaches_and_perspectives?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_82508439", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88195579, "asset_id": 82508439, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83305748, "first_name": "Brigitte", "last_name": "Aulenbacher", "domain_name": "jku", "page_name": "BrigitteAulenbacher", "display_name": "Brigitte Aulenbacher", "profile_url": "https://jku.academia.edu/BrigitteAulenbacher?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83305748/52051491/40148455/s65_brigitte.aulenbacher.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 209, "name": "Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Theory?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 82332639, "title": "Parent\u2019s Perception Towards Excessive Use of Technology at Early Primary (5-7Y) Level", "created_at": "2022-06-28T22:15:22.021-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82332639/Parent_s_Perception_Towards_Excessive_Use_of_Technology_at_Early_Primary_5_7Y_Level?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_82332639", "summary": "The impact of technology in modern life is multifarious.

The authors argue, overall, that home educators are asserting their historical option of cultural agency and schooling. (Note 1)If &quot;school reform&quot; is a bandwagon, then the parade is still in progress. Most of the grand proposals earlier composed by politicians, pundits, policy wonks, and professors have evolved into smaller, more locally pertinent endeavors by actual change participants (educators, students, parents and community members).

a qualitative collective case study regarding the possibility of homeschool participation in public school extracurricular activities in West Tennessee. Literature exists on extracurricular activities but not on the effect on the homeschooled student specifically. The research questions addressed: How do homeschool parents in west Tennessee whose children are involved in one or more extracurricular activities outside of the public school system feel about current legislation regarding homeschool students being excluded from participation in public school extracurricular activities other than sports?

The movement of students out of the common public school, however, varies significantly across jurisdictions and sociodemographic characteristics such as race and class. This variation in individual decision making and macro policy outcomes directs us to theorise about the relationship between parental preferences, government responses, and policy outcomes. We map the interplay between the demand for choice, institutional responses, and policy feedback effects that lead to four major policy outcomes: partially attenuated governance, hyper choice, partial accommodation within the public system, and non-accommodation that leads parents to withdraw from the public education system. We apply this framework to understanding variation in patterns of school choice in Canadian provinces and conclude by outlining some ways in which our framework can be used to understand school choice outcomes cross-nationally.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79865475, "asset_id": 69967596, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 854174, "first_name": "Phil", "last_name": "Triadafilopoulos", "domain_name": "utoronto", "page_name": "PhilTriadafilopoulos", "display_name": "Phil Triadafilopoulos", "profile_url": "https://utoronto.academia.edu/PhilTriadafilopoulos?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/854174/355306/765746/s65_phil.triadafilopoulos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4618, "name": "Education (Social Policy)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Social_Policy_?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 12322, "name": "Canadian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Politics?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 12327, "name": "Canadian Federalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Federalism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 21289, "name": "Educational reform", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_reform?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 24710, "name": "Policy Design Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Design_Theory?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 46552, "name": "Policy Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Design?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 54114, "name": "Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canada?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 79374, "name": "School Choice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Choice?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 111537, "name": "Educational Policy Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Policy_Studies?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 147488, "name": "Consumer Preferences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Preferences?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 295145, "name": "Public vs Private Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_vs_Private_Schools?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 561884, "name": "Public Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Schools?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 845409, "name": "Canadian Education System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Education_System?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1262005, "name": "Policy Feedback", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Feedback?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1723635, "name": "Public Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Policy?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 69858201, "title": "University: A Place of Formation for Achievers or Thinkers?", "created_at": "2022-01-28T22:38:19.376-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69858201/University_A_Place_of_Formation_for_Achievers_or_Thinkers?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_69858201", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79795377, "asset_id": 69858201, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32836567, "first_name": "Janez", "last_name": "Vodi\u010dar", "domain_name": "uni-lj", "page_name": "JanezVodi\u010dar", "display_name": "Janez Vodi\u010dar", "profile_url": "https://uni-lj.academia.edu/JanezVodi%C4%8Dar?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15838, "name": "Imagination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagination?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44096, "name": "Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 69735152, "title": "\u201cAuthentic\u201d Arts Teaching and Learning: An Investigation Into the Practices of Australian Home Educators", "created_at": "2022-01-28T00:07:14.426-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69735152/_Authentic_Arts_Teaching_and_Learning_An_Investigation_Into_the_Practices_of_Australian_Home_Educators?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_69735152", "summary": "Research into the ways that \u201cauthentic\u201d arts teaching and learning are conducted in Australian home education contexts has not yet been undertaken.

The results of the study uncover areas for further research into the role of education professionals on student experiences, the place of home education in relation to formal education and assessment of collaborative educational programmes which combine aspects of formal education with home education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79396231, "asset_id": 69216383, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 117275, "first_name": "Glenda", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GlendaJackson", "display_name": "Glenda Jackson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GlendaJackson?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/117275/609021/8260351/s65_glenda.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7099, "name": "Case Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Case_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 28076, "name": "Cognitive Style", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Style?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 55704, "name": "Transition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transition?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 104446, "name": "Academic achievement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_achievement?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 565494, "name": "Student Perspectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Perspectives?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 703276, "name": "Home Based Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Based_Learning?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 69042952, "title": "Educational System and action in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic: opinion and prospects for improvement according to teachers", "created_at": "2022-01-21T11:49:58.971-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69042952/Educational_System_and_action_in_the_face_of_the_COVID_19_pandemic_opinion_and_prospects_for_improvement_according_to_teachers?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_69042952", "summary": "The objective of this work was to know the opinion of the pre-school, primary and secondary education teachers about their situation and that of the students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, carrying out a series of recommendations to improve in future similar cases A questionnaire was passed to assess the Responsibility of the students (PSRQ, alpha = 932), as well as two ad hoc questionnaires, to assess the teacher&#39;s perception of the attitude of the students prior to the pandemic (OASBP, alpha = 910) and general management during the pandemic (MPES, alpha = 884) The results indicated that prior to the pandemic, students had shares of personal and social responsibility similar to those of previous studies, but decreased during confinement with less committed attitudes towards the teacher, especially in the Secondary stage In addition, during the pandemic, the teachers perceived that the most relevant was the lack of training and resources for families in the use of ICT,...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79293164, "asset_id": 69042952, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57464915, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Manzano S\u00e1nchez", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DavidManzanoS\u00e1nchez", "display_name": "David Manzano S\u00e1nchez", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DavidManzanoS%C3%A1nchez?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57464915/32804513/29499938/s65_david.manzano_s_nchez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 68799096, "title": "Interview with Jonas Himmelstrand", "created_at": "2022-01-20T02:39:51.737-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68799096/Interview_with_Jonas_Himmelstrand?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_68799096", "summary": "Jonas Himmelstrand is an anomaly in the current world of alternative education; a Swedish home educator.

Taking the view that language is a political tool (Fairclough, 2003), this paper explores how the space of \u2018other\u2019 education is discursively created from both within and outside home education. Using Fairclough\u2019s critical discourse analysis (CDA) methodology, a variety of texts (including official documents, Local Authority websites, the media and home educators\u2019 own words) are analysed. Discursive strategies of universalism, normalisation, self-proclamation and self-censorship are identified and considered. It is argued that these strategies are instrumental in creating and maintaining the separation and difference which is used to politically position home education and home educators. The paper concludes with the argument that genuine educational plurality is partly a matter of discursive practice and that changing patterns of discourse around home education ma...",

This is the first index of its kind that measures the development of school choice policies across the Canadian provinces from 1980 to 2020 using eight unique indicators of choice. In contrast to other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the CSCPI reveals that although Canada has witnessed an increase in school choice over time, this increase has largely been contained within public education systems rather than in the expansion of private education options. Our findings raise the importance of future research to address growing choice in public education systems across the provinces, in addition to choice in the private sphere.

The primary purpose of the project was to produce a comprehensive, and generously-proportioned, portrait of the changing critical reputation of Defoe between 1700 and 1900. While the material collected has undergone a rigorous editorial process that renders it -- necessarily -- selective, one of my fundamental objectives throughout has been to give the broadest possible sense of the developing critical response to Defoe\u2019s extraordinarily diverse canon of writing. It will come as no surprise to Defoe scholars that the public, intellectual and cultural esteem held by this most prolific and idiosyncratic of writers has undergone profound changes during the course of these centuries; so, too, has the focus of readers\u2019 attention on different subjects or genres within Defoe\u2019s canon.

Home schooling has become the new 'norm' during the first and third lockdowns in England. This paper reports on relevant policy analysis, empirical research/literature review and findings from semi-structured interviews with parents who home schooled their primary school aged children. Findings indicate that the habitus of familial environment and the social position of field are significant determinants of education outcomes, in which the cultural and material deprivation have played a part. This paper highlights that home schooling has brought inequalities in educational experience into sharp focus and has shown the importance of embodied preferences and cultural goods in the drive to improve outcomes across the country. Had cultural approaches not been so different, the experiences of children from the North and the South, and from richer and poorer families, would not have been so different.

analyzes various aspects of the interaction between family and school during the period of forced self-isolation in March-May 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on the analysis of foreign and Russian studies, the author examines the difficulties that arose in the \u201cschool-child-family\u201d system during the transition to a remote work format: social, technical, educational, integration. New roles of parents are analyzed. The problems arising in the implementation of the pedagogical process, deepened by the existing socio-economic inequality, are noted. Attention is drawn to the insufficient preparation of teachers for the implementation of online learning. A survey of 178 first-year students of Smolensk State University conducted by the author showed that the period of distance learning in March-May 2020 changed many aspects of the usual life of schoolchildren. However, most of the respondents managed to successfully cope with the difficulties that arose, to find the positive aspects of homeschooling. The greatest concern was caused by the lack of interaction between the family and the school, especially in matters of upbringing and career guidance, the lack of help from the school psychologist and social educator. It is concluded that there is a need for better training of all school staff that is able to work in new conditions, based on the practical experience gained in the conditions of distance learning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76052090, "asset_id": 63702700, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57556933, "first_name": "Sergey", "last_name": "Kremen", "domain_name": "smolgu", "page_name": "SergeyKremen", "display_name": "Sergey A .

This is illustrated by an examination of different educational approaches taken by home educators and research on the socialisation of home educated children in Australia. Research on who chooses home education, why people choose home education and the educational outcomes for home educated children is also discussed. Home educating families represent all family types, are found in rural, suburban and city locations, and choose home education for a variety ofreasons. Research indicates that Australian home educated children have positive educational and social experiences and outcomes.

The present study seeks to explore the experiences of final-year international undergraduate students who have had access to E-leaning from their home countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study draws on qualitative interviews with 13 international students from India, Nigeria and Pakistan. All the participants were in their final year at three University of London member institutions, Birkbeck, SOAS and UCL. Using Interpretive Interactionism analysis, the study explored students\u2019 E-learning experiences during Covid-19, and its impact on their academic performance, particularly on their final grades. There was also an exploration of how the students\u2019 experiences differ along existing socioeconomic divides, and whether the pandemic has aggravated existing inequalities.\nFindings: Five master themes were identified in the analysis: feelings of disconnection and anxiety; issues with comprehension; impact on academic performance; technical and socioeconomic issues. Participants\u2019 own words or expressions (\u2018thick descriptions\u2019) have been maintained in these analyses as expected with interpretive interactionism approach (Denzin, 2011; 2019). \u2018Thick Description\u2019 is used here to avoid overly reductionist treatment of participants\u2019 interpretations of their experiences. \nSocial implications: The qualitative data are based on a small sample of international students. Therefore, its findings cannot be assumed to be generalisable and further research needs to be done if many issues are to be clarified. However, one of the strengths of the present study lies in its detailed qualitative analyses of the perspectives of the international students. This study aimed to take seriously the experiences of each international student as presented in their accounts rather than dismissing them as simply being inaccurate. Students pre and post covid results were also used to critically analyse participants\u2019 account - such combination can be argued to provide rich data, particularly since accounts were not treated as the simple \u2018truth\u2019 but were accepted as social constructions that provided insights into lived experiences. As with some interpretive studies, findings from the present study are considered to be transferable.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95586332, "asset_id": 63208425, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2685276, "first_name": "Tolulope", "last_name": "Eboka", "domain_name": "kingston", "page_name": "TolulopeEboka", "display_name": "Tolulope Eboka", "profile_url": "https://kingston.academia.edu/TolulopeEboka?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2685276/858327/17638512/s65_tolulope.eboka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1609, "name": "E-learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/E-learning?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13889, "name": "International Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Students?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32215, "name": "Social Inequalities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inequalities?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 170565, "name": "Learning and Teaching in higher Education at UK based institutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_and_Teaching_in_higher_Education_at_UK_based_institutions?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 487947, "name": "Experiences of black and ethnic Minority students in Higher education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experiences_of_black_and_ethnic_Minority_students_in_Higher_education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3862236, "name": "Covid 19 - Education - necessity of online education -  adaptability and applicability ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Covid_19_Education_necessity_of_online_education_adaptability_and_applicability?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 62970391, "title": "Slovenian Parents\u2019 Views on Emergency Remote Schooling during the First Wave of the Covid-19 Pandemic", "created_at": "2021-12-02T05:15:18.101-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62970391/Slovenian_Parents_Views_on_Emergency_Remote_Schooling_during_the_First_Wave_of_the_Covid_19_Pandemic?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_62970391", "summary": "In early 2020, the whole world was confronted with the emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Yoder (decided in 1972) has changed the constitutional landscape of custody cases - - and it has done so in a way that is unsound both as a matter of law and policy. Following Yoder, most courts require a showing of harm to the child, or a substantial threat of harm to the child, before placing any restrictions on exposure to a parent\u2019s religious beliefs and practices. This harm standard leaves children in an untenable position when parents compete for \u201cspiritual custody,\u201d for the law can protect them only when the risk of harm is already substantial. Indeed, the bar is set so high that few courts have found circumstances that satisfy the harm standard. In this essay, I argue that a strict scrutiny standard has no place in spiritual custody cases. It is hardly consistent with the basic principle that the custody court\u2019s paramount consideration is the best interests of the child...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74888230, "asset_id": 62006253, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 154250251, "first_name": "Jeffrey", "last_name": "Shulman", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JeffreyShulman1", "display_name": "Jeffrey Shulman", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JeffreyShulman1?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3687, "name": "Family Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Law?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4565, "name": "Law and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Religion?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16606, "name": "Human Resource", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Resource?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 585296, "name": "Oregon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oregon?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 679783, "name": "Boolean Satisfiability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Boolean_Satisfiability?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 61790442, "title": "Variety of Teaching Methodologies Used by Homeschoolers: Case Studies of Three Homeschooling Families", "created_at": "2021-11-16T08:50:56.498-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61790442/Variety_of_Teaching_Methodologies_Used_by_Homeschoolers_Case_Studies_of_Three_Homeschooling_Families?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_61790442", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74738164, "asset_id": 61790442, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43578444, "first_name": "Andrea", "last_name": "Clements", "domain_name": "etsu", "page_name": "AndreaClements", "display_name": "Andrea  Clements", "profile_url": "https://etsu.academia.edu/AndreaClements?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43578444/12284393/13677968/s65_andrea.clements.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7099, "name": "Case Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Case_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 89488, "name": "Teaching Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_Methods?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 393800, "name": "Independent Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Independent_Study?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 61789399, "title": "Functional MR Imaging to Evaluate Sensory Processing in Dyslexia", "created_at": "2021-11-16T08:31:48.310-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61789399/Functional_MR_Imaging_to_Evaluate_Sensory_Processing_in_Dyslexia?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_61789399", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74737375, "asset_id": 61789399, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39420980, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Burdette", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JonathanBurdette", "display_name": "Jonathan Burdette", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JonathanBurdette?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1026, "name": "Psychophysiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychophysiology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6200, "name": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25052, "name": "Dyslexia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dyslexia?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64568, "name": "Humans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humans?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 244814, "name": "Clinical Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clinical_Sciences?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 277717, "name": "Somatosensory Cortex", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Somatosensory_Cortex?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 61750377, "title": "Slovenian Parents\u2019 Views on Emergency Remote Schooling during the First Wave of the Covid-19 Pandemic", "created_at": "2021-11-15T23:51:21.464-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61750377/Slovenian_Parents_Views_on_Emergency_Remote_Schooling_during_the_First_Wave_of_the_Covid_19_Pandemic?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_61750377", "summary": "In early 2020, the whole world was confronted with the emergence of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. Due to restrictive measures, Slovenia, like most other countries, was forced to close all educational institutions. Teaching and learning shifted from classrooms to an online environment, which was a major challenge for teachers, students and their parents and required a significant amount of adaptation and effort. In May 2020, we conducted a study to investigate parents\u2019 attitudes toward emergency remote schooling. The study included 313 parents of students from the last triad of primary (compulsory) school (Grades 7\u20139; 12\u201315 years old), 147 parents of secondary school students (Years 1\u20133; 15\u201318 years old) and 35 parents of students in their final (4th) year of secondary school (18\u201319 years old). Specifically, parents of primary school adolescent children, in particular, reported having the most difficulty coordinating their work and the remote schooling of their child, and they also reported more difficulty motivating their child to complete schoolwork at home than the other two groups of parents did. Parents of secondary school students in Year 4 were most likely to miss personal contact with the teacher and rated emergency remote schooling as more stressful than the other two groups of parents. In general, parents rated emergency remote schooling to be more complicated and difficult than traditional classroom instruction. Most parents agree that such schooling provides students with less knowledge, which is also less consolidated, although they perceived teachers\u2019 remote help for students quite positively. They also believe that online education will become important in the future.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74708358, "asset_id": 61750377, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48437335, "first_name": "CEPS", "last_name": "Journal", "domain_name": "uni-lj", "page_name": "CEPSJournal", "display_name": "CEPS  Journal", "profile_url": "https://uni-lj.academia.edu/CEPSJournal?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48437335/19742431/26795729/s65_ceps.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 180300, "name": "Beliefs and attitudes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beliefs_and_attitudes?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 303598, "name": "Parents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parents?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 594653, "name": "Pandemics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pandemics?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 60859163, "title": "Interview with Jonas Himmelstrand", "created_at": "2021-11-03T01:26:18.662-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/60859163/Interview_with_Jonas_Himmelstrand?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_60859163", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74120419, "asset_id": 60859163, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8145635, "first_name": "harriet", "last_name": "pattison", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "harrietpattison", "display_name": "harriet pattison", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/harrietpattison?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25701, "name": "Progressive Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Progressive_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 59334735, "title": "The Problem of Religious Learning", "created_at": "2021-10-21T09:53:48.226-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/59334735/The_Problem_of_Religious_Learning?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_59334735", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73311493, "asset_id": 59334735, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 772143, "first_name": "Marc O.", "last_name": "DeGirolami", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MarcODeGirolami", "display_name": "Marc O.

An overview of the theoretical basis on which the assignment was built is provided followed by a quick account of how the class was conducted employing expressivist pedagogy. At the end of the sixth week, students were asked to write a one-page journal entry to reflect on and evaluate their writing experience. The article tries to analyze this journal entry to uncover what students learned from doing the assignment and how they evaluated their learning.

Some groups also use legal provisions enabling the implementation of home education, which allows them to protect children against the harmful, in their opinion, impact of the external environment. All this leads to a kind of gap in the cult\u2019s relationship with the education system, causing it to lose both external and internal control mechanisms to limit potential abuse, making children from cultic milieu more vulnerable and defenseless than their peers growing up in a society equipped with the mentioned mechanisms, even if they are sometimes insufficiently implemented. Pupils taught in the mainstream school system maintain regular contact with their peers from different families and social groups. Similarly, teachers and other employees of the education system are embedded in different social contexts, which provides them with a perspective that lets them notice an occurring problem and offer help to the child.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67715378, "asset_id": 49341574, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58637320, "first_name":

Abstract: The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  analyze  the  development  of  remote  learning  in  preschool  educa-tion  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  This  study  de-ploys  descriptive  and  inferential  statistics  to  interpret  the  data  collected  from  preschoolers  (n=267)  from  seven  schools  in  Malaga.  The  results  offer  an  over-view  of  the  constraints  of  virtual  education,  showing  a  correlation  between  routines  and  children's  com-mitment, enjoyment of tasks, activities carried out as a  family,  how  their  development  has  been  affected  by  the  lack  of  face-to-face  education,  participation  in videoconferences, and coordination with teachers. We  conclude  that  the  education  of  these  pandemic natives requires greater attention from policy makers, schools and their own families.Keywords:  Preschool  education,  COVID-19,  Remote  learning, Quantitative analysis.

Home has lost its central feature of being a daily cyclical station, becoming the only place for self-quarantine. At this point, home life intertwined with that of work. This study aims to establish the experiences with rhythmic phenomena, which explains the effect of the social practices on everyday life of a 'house-academic' during self-quarantine. In this regard, I examine my autoethnographic experiences during my three-month self-quarantine period with the rhythmanalytical view of Lefebvre, which allows me to express the effect of practices on everyday lives. I suggest that autoethnographic writing will enable me to give a perspective on my life transformed by Covid-19, based on body, performance, and experience. Home has transformed into a preschool in the morning and a university in the evening, just contrary to the way of living before the pandemic. It acquired a syncopated rhythmic order, from arrhythmia to eurhythmia, thus staging the transformation of the spatial experience. In these unprecedented times, guest practices such as homeschooling and distance education, becoming henceforth a part of our lives, have turned everyday life into a stage of new struggles.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67467012, "asset_id": 47844311, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1730124, "first_name": "G\u00fczin", "last_name": "A\u011fca-Varo\u011flu", "domain_name": "tau-tr", "page_name": "G\u00fczinA\u011fcaVaro\u011flu", "display_name": "G\u00fczin A\u011fca-Varo\u011flu", "profile_url": "https://tau-tr.academia.edu/G%C3%BCzinA%C4%9FcaVaro%C4%9Flu?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1730124/595692/34586113/s65_f._g_zin.a_ca-varo_lu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1695, "name": "Distance Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distance_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3886, "name": "Rhythm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rhythm?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5737, "name": "Autoethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autoethnography?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 13126, "name": "Feminist Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Ethnography?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 17497, "name": "Sociology of Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Everyday_Life?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 24136, "name": "Henri Lefebvre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Henri_Lefebvre?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 30414, "name": "Rhythmanalysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rhythmanalysis?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 41286, "name": "Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Everyday_Life?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 87317, "name": "Gendered Spaces", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gendered_Spaces?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 120069, "name": "Ethnographic & autoethnographic research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnographic_and_autoethnographic_research?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 47843319, "title": "BEING A HOUSE-ACADEMIC IN THE PANDEMIC: THE TRANSFORMATION OF EVERYDAY LIFE", "created_at": "2021-05-01T08:02:44.226-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/47843319/BEING_A_HOUSE_ACADEMIC_IN_THE_PANDEMIC_THE_TRANSFORMATION_OF_EVERYDAY_LIFE?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_47843319", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66758086, "asset_id": 47843319, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1730124, "first_name": "G\u00fczin", "last_name": "A\u011fca-Varo\u011flu", "domain_name": "tau-tr", "page_name": "G\u00fczinA\u011fcaVaro\u011flu", "display_name": "G\u00fczin A\u011fca-Varo\u011flu", "profile_url": "https://tau-tr.academia.edu/G%C3%BCzinA%C4%9FcaVaro%C4%9Flu?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1730124/595692/34586113/s65_f._g_zin.a_ca-varo_lu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1695, "name": "Distance Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distance_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5737, "name": "Autoethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autoethnography?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22133, "name": "Palimpsests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palimpsests?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41286, "name": "Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Everyday_Life?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 575545, "name": "Palimpsest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palimpsest?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 47767379, "title": "Alternative education in light of the Coronavirus crisis - Helen Lees Cambridge Philosophy of Education Seminars 2020-21", "created_at": "2021-04-28T05:46:14.069-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/47767379/Alternative_education_in_light_of_the_Coronavirus_crisis_Helen_Lees_Cambridge_Philosophy_of_Education_Seminars_2020_21?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_47767379", "summary": "What happened to education (and schooling) on account of the global pandemic? For those seeking hard facts I suggest the search is fruitless and pointless. Due to conservatism regarding the educational models in play in societies nothing much will change. HOWEVER we need change. Flowing out of alternative education modalities of freedom, choice, joy and holistic understanding, I propose a way to dissolve \"education\" as old world (schooling will remain as people find it handy despite anomaly and crisis). The new approach to what we used to call education is \"state of mind\". State of mind is self care and a shift from negative drama triangle scenarios (Karpman) into the Choy Winner's Triangle. Everything we thought was education occurs but only with and through a privileging of state of mind first. This approach values attachment, mental health, awareness of early years affects, parental responsibility, peaceful kind approaches to use of silence or other (beneficial) state of mind aids. It does not exclude the fact of human fragility and vulnerability but instead works with them in an open, transparent, honest and regenerative manner.

Document analysis as a qualitative method was adopted in our study. Academic books and articles related to the subject, statistical records, various re-ports provided by the state and private institutions, school curricula, school inspection reports, and law articles, and some court decisions constitute the main data sources. Maximum diversi-ty sampling from the purposeful sampling types was used in determining the schools that were examined their Islamic curriculum, and it was tried to include as many different curriculum examples as possible. The fact that religious lessons are compulsory in schools in England and that this lesson is taught with a multicultural approach can be seen as an opportunity. On the other hand, there is a flexible education system in England. Muslim faith schools, supplementary schools (madrasa, maktab, and mosque school), and the home-schooling system are places and structures where Islamic education is carried out within the scope of formal and informal education. It is seen that Muslim faith schools are allowed to be opened as 'voluntary aided schools' by defining their distinctive religious characters as Muslim. The number of \u2018state-funded Muslim schools\u2019 is very limited, but their existence carries symbolic weight as a recognition of the Muslim com-munity\u2019s right to establish such schools. It is understood that Muslim faith schools were opened mostly in the category of \u2018independent schools\u2019. Although there are various discussions about it, it is also important for Muslims to have informal religious education, in addition to formal education; it is allowed to open schools that offer Islamic education under the name of madrasa, maktab or mosque school. Families who send their children to the community schools because of the insufficient number of Muslim faith schools send their children to mad\u0101ris (singular: madrasa), mak\u0101tib (singular: maktab), or mosque schools which are called as \u2018supplementary schools\u2019. Social and moral values are taught here, including the teaching of the Qur'an, as well as s\u012brah (the biography of the Prophet), fiqh (jurisprudence), and Islamic history. It was understood that families who want to protect their children from the unhealthy envi-ronment of the school have the right to prefer home education, since the school is not compul-sory. In this sense, home-schooling can be considered as another opportunity for Muslim fami-lies to have their children Islamic Education. In addition to all these opportunities, the lack of a standard in these educational structures, the unqualified teachers, the inadequacy of curriculum development studies, and as a result, lack of qualified teaching materials are important problems. Economic limitations emerge as the first obstacle to increase the number of Muslim faith schools and to improve educational quali-ty. This situation threatens the quality of education by giving rise to poor buildings, insufficient resources, insufficient health and safety standards, and inexperienced management. Another threat to the quality of education is that teachers for independent schools do not have to have Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). While negative perceptions about Muslim schools have been identified as another challenge, it is expressed in various sources that Muslim students are frequently exposed to Islamophobia in various ways in public schools. Linking mosques and Islamic education institutions to radicalization and making them a subject of discussion is another noteworthy issue. Although there is no evidence of the relationship between Muslim schools and terrorist acts in England, Muslim schools are subjected to suspicions of being po-tential breeding grounds for future extremists. It seems necessary to take some actions for madrasahs who do not want to be under the con-trol of the state to reach certain standards and increase the quality of education. For example, Muslim supplementary schools should be united under the same roof of an association like The Association of Muslim Schools. This will help to attain certain standards, to increase the quality of education, and to create opportunities for various cooperation and sharing of experiences. Also, it should not be seen enough that the teachers in the mad\u0101ris only have religious educa-tion, and their pedagogical competencies should be improved by subjecting them to various educational programs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65480061, "asset_id": 44949902, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44982679, "first_name": "Cumhuriyet Theology Journal", "last_name": "- Cumhuriyet \u0130lahiyat Dergisi", "domain_name": "cumhuriyet", "page_name": "Cumhuriyet\u00dcniversitesi\u0130lahiyatFak\u00fcltesiDergisiCUIFDCumhuriyetUniversityJournalofFacultyofTheologyCUIFD", "display_name": "Cumhuriyet Theology Journal  - Cumhuriyet \u0130lahiyat Dergisi", "profile_url": "https://cumhuriyet.academia.edu/Cumhuriyet%C3%9Cniversitesi%C4%B0lahiyatFak%C3%BCltesiDergisiCUIFDCumhuriyetUniversityJournalofFacultyofTheologyCUIFD?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44982679/11942158/15189649/s65_cumhuriyet_theology_journal._cumhuriyet_ilahiyat_dergisi_.jpg"}, {"id": 5561692, "first_name": "\u0130rfan", "last_name": "ERDO\u011eAN", "domain_name": "erbakan", "page_name": "\u0130rfanERDO\u011eAN", "display_name": "\u0130rfan ERDO\u011eAN", "profile_url": "https://erbakan.academia.edu/%C4%B0rfanERDO%C4%9EAN?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5561692/3903558/53409235/s65_i_rfan.erdo_an.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2397, "name": "Religious Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18663, "name": "Supplementary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Supplementary_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30494, "name": "England", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/England?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 165453, "name": "Madrasa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madrasa?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 719983, "name": "PTK TENTANG PENERAPAN MODEL PEMBELAJARAN BERBASIS ICT MAPEL FIQH MADRASAH ALIYAH", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PTK_TENTANG_PENERAPAN_MODEL_PEMBELAJARAN_BERBASIS_ICT_MAPEL_FIQH_MADRASAH_ALIYAH?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 44894374, "title": "Homeschooling: Is It Better Than The Traditional Method Of Schooling", "created_at": "2021-01-13T02:05:08.343-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44894374/Homeschooling_Is_It_Better_Than_The_Traditional_Method_Of_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_44894374", "summary": "Each parent wishes to give his kid the best training as it opens more chances and is an assurance of a reckless and upbeat life.

The Brazilian Constitution of 1988 represents an institutional framework able to restructure the relationship between the powers after the military dictatorship. The constituents drafted the Brazilian Constitution in order to set an extensive system of judicial protection for fundamental rights, by means of several instruments that have strengthened access to the Judiciary. Because the Brazilian Constitution has an extensive list of fundamental rights, the STF was called to interpret them several times and it developed an unwritten understanding of these fundamental rights. These decisions are not available to the international community since they are not translated to English. Based on this gap, this original book illustrates the main rulings on human rights analyzed by great scholars in Brazil. The text presents a deep discussion regarding the characteristics of the cases and demonstrates how the STF has built the legal arguments to interpret the extension of the fundamental rights.\n\nhttps://rowman.com/ISBN/9781793623706/The-Unwritten-Brazilian-Constitution-Human-Rights-in-the-Supremo-Tribunal-Federal", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65365525, "asset_id": 44856490,

has gained in popularity as the world's lingua franca, inviting individuals and countries to join the international community. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the use of English has dramatically increased in Turkmenistan, in Central Asia (CA). Russian was required for securing jobs, professional development, and economic well-being in CA countries during the time of the Soviet Union, but it has been replaced with English. Using liberal feminist theory (Groenhout, 2002; Tong, 2009) and Norton's (1995) investment theory, this case study examined the experience of one woman learning English as a foreign language in rural Turkmenistan and its role in her professional trajectory and identity development as an empowered Turkmen woman. The authors show how Ayna, the case study participant, invested in learning English as a child but was originally prohibited from postsecondary education by the family's matriarch because Ayna is female. Later, with help from her parents and an English tutor, Ayna used her advanced English skills to access postsecondary employment and education, where she was introduced to Western philosophical and sociological texts. Through these experiences Ayna transformed her identity as an empowered woman by increasing her awareness of gender inequality, shifted her perspectives on rural village life, and took on, as she said, \"an English-speaking mindset.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65211577, "asset_id": 44728170, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21747890, "first_name": "Gulshirin", "last_name": "Orazova", "domain_name": "niu", "page_name": "GulshirinOrazova", "display_name": "Gulshirin Orazova", "profile_url": "https://niu.academia.edu/GulshirinOrazova?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21747890/5978352/6784573/s65_gulshirin.orazova.jpg_oh_961cc4ea31bebeec0b77c572927a7ce6_oe_54e2021f___gda___1423482899_fd3b850a80cd46ea80bc7a8083ea8749"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18004, "name": "Equity and Social Justice in Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equity_and_Social_Justice_in_Higher_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19966, "name": "Educational Leadership and Policy Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Leadership_and_Policy_Analysis?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 66369, "name": "Academic Student Success Initiatives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Student_Success_Initiatives?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 117302, "name": "Gender and Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Womens_Studies?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 165455, "name": "Teacher Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Performance?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 508371, "name": "Curriculum and Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_and_Pedagogy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 603502, "name": "International Educaiton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Educaiton?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 44726126, "title": "Kizel, A.

Unwilling to allow his Crusoe to travel from cover to cover statically immutable, Defoe instead presents a character whose initially fear-filled, fatalistic colonialism gives way to a Christian understanding of providential kindness. Beyond the surface-level narrative of a castaway merely seeking survival, Robinson Crusoe is a story of a man working to learn how to live in both his immediate environment and that which lies beyond what he can physically see. Although the ethos of the protagonist, and the novel as a whole, is still significantly encumbered by imperialistic tendencies, Defoe's narrative unfolds his Crusoe's transformation into a relatively sympathetic representation of seventeenth and eighteenth-century Christian faith and a drastically different protagonist than the one who opened the novel. Critics of the Protestant view of providence often equate that doctrine with the broader idea of fatalism. While surface level similarities certainly exist and many who claim a belief in providence often express it in attitude and terminology more akin to a belief in Fate, the two ideas are distinct and in many ways contradictory. Far from being the result of an impersonal force, the Protestant view of providence argues that a personal deity exists in sovereign control of every second of every day and of every atom of every molecule. How this is manifest in the ebb and flow of everyday life is debated, but the personal nature of providence distinguishes it from fate.

Ed.\nDepartment of Leadership, Educational Psychology, and Foundations Northern Illinois University,\nCharles Howell, Director\nLately there have been concerns about the academic and spiritual atmosphere of the public school system in the US, leading some parents to provide alternative educational opportunities for their children. As one of the alternative ways to the public schools, Somerville states that homeschooling has become one of the most flourishing educational reform movements in America. Since many people know little about this alternative to one of society\u201fs most fundamental institutions, research on this topic is vital to public understanding.\nThe present study investigated homeschooling groups in DeKalb, Illinois, and addressed three issues prominent in the research literature on homeschooling and child development: first, parental autonomy support for their children to choose as well as make decisions upon their education; second, the implications for the children\u201fs opportunities for socialization and development of social skills; and finally the differences between Christian and secular homeschooling groups in terms of the parental autonomy support and provision of opportunities for the children\u201fs social skills.\nThrough interviews and surveys, it was found that homeschooling parents supported autonomy development in their children through strategies oriented to promote independence as well as interventions designed to promote volitional functioning. Additionally, the findings indicated that in DeKalb both Christian and secular homeschooling groups provided various opportunities for the proper development of their children\u201fs social skills.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64031163, "asset_id": 43722827, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21747890, "first_name": "Gulshirin", "last_name": "Orazova", "domain_name": "niu", "page_name": "GulshirinOrazova", "display_name": "Gulshirin Orazova", "profile_url": "https://niu.academia.edu/GulshirinOrazova?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21747890/5978352/6784573/s65_gulshirin.orazova.jpg_oh_961cc4ea31bebeec0b77c572927a7ce6_oe_54e2021f___gda___1423482899_fd3b850a80cd46ea80bc7a8083ea8749"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1298, "name": "Alternative Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1151389, "name": "Parental Autonomy Support", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parental_Autonomy_Support?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3254256, "name": "children\u2019s social skills", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/children_s_social_skills?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 43686699, "title": "Learning inequalities during the Covid-19 pandemic: how families cope with home-schooling", "created_at": "2020-07-22T01:44:15.740-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43686699/Learning_inequalities_during_the_Covid_19_pandemic_how_families_cope_with_home_schooling?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_43686699", "summary": "The transition from face-to-face to distance (home and online) schooling is likely to generate educational loss.

We begin by exploring the views of the student users, and also the team of learning advisors (LAs) who work full time in the SALC. Context The context for the study is a small, private university located in Japan, which specialises in foreign languages and cultures. The majority of students are Japanese nationals who are majoring in English or other languages, and all students are required to take some English courses. In order to support the use and study of English, and also promote language learner autonomy, students are all encouraged to use the large, purpose-built SALC. The SALC provides various kinds of learning spaces, a professional learning advising service, workshops, credit courses, and a range of regular events and learning communities. Although attendance at the SALC is optional, over 1000 students use the SALC each day. We (the two authors) are members of the team of 11 learning advisors working full time in the SALC. Research framework Our research framework is based on a self-determination theory (SDT) perspective (Deci and Ryan 1985). SDT is a broad framework for the study of human motivation and well-being and within this framework, there are six sub-theories. One of these is Basic Psychological Needs\n\nIn Pattison, T.

The paper sheds light on Western hegemony of travel from the metropolis to the peripheries for the sake of discovering and colonizing the \"Other\" parts of the world in one hand; on the other hand, these journeys enable the protagonist to grow physically, psychologically, spiritually and mentally. The paper also traces the physical journey that coincides with the inner journey which results in the self-discovery of the protagonist of himself as sequences of gradual growth from childhood to maturity; this trait makes the novel as bildungsroman. The protagonist commits a sin of disobedience at the beginning of his life and he has to endure all difficulties of life because of that deadly sin and with the passage of time he discovers his mistakes and repents from his wickedness and comes back to God who redeems him from his original sin. Therefore, he discovers himself after reaching the stage of wisdom, maturity and repentance. He has also been redeemed and awarded the fruitfulness of his endurance by reaching his father's house again and reunited with his family.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62489201, "asset_id": 42332139, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1844342, "first_name": "Khalid", "last_name": "Alkadasi", "domain_name": "uni-mysore", "page_name": "KhalidAlkadasi", "display_name": "Khalid Alkadasi", "profile_url": "https://uni-mysore.academia.edu/KhalidAlkadasi?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 21277, "name": "Travel Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_Literature?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 754676, "name": "ELT AND POST COLONIAL LITERATURE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ELT_AND_POST_COLONIAL_LITERATURE?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42111695, "title": "THE WHAT, WHYS AND WHEREFORES OF HOME EDUCATION AND ITS REGULATION IN AUSTRALIA", "created_at": "2020-03-01T17:09:22.022-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42111695/THE_WHAT_WHYS_AND_WHEREFORES_OF_HOME_EDUCATION_AND_ITS_REGULATION_IN_AUSTRALIA?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_42111695", "summary": "This paper presents a unique summary ofAustralian research on home education, and an evaluation of current regulation in an Australian context. It begins with the recognition that home education is a legal alternative to school education in Australia. However it argues that legal definitions o f home education do not properly reflect the practice o f home education. This is illustrated by an examination o f different educational approaches taken by home educators and research on the socialisation o f home educated children in Australia. Research on who chooses home education, why people choose home education and the educational outcomesfor home educated children is also discussed. Home educatingfamilies represent allfamily types, arefound in rural, suburban and city locations, and choose home educationfor a variety o f reasons. Research indicates thatAustralian home educated children have positive educational and social experiences and outcomes. The question o fwhether, and ifso the extent to which, home education should be regulated by the state is examined. The authors argue that whilst regulation is acceptable to protect a child\u2019s right to education, a more consistent regulatoryframework is needed across Australia. It is argued that such aframework shouldfacilitate and encourage children who are being home educated and should beflexible enough to accommodate the variety o f educational approaches taken to home education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62243243, "asset_id": 42111695, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 117275, "first_name": "Glenda", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GlendaJackson", "display_name": "Glenda Jackson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GlendaJackson?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/117275/609021/8260351/s65_glenda.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83247, "name": "Homeschooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1002568, "name": "Education Legislation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Legislation?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41363050, "title": "Software Engineering in the Era of Cloud Computing, Springer", "created_at": "2019-12-19T07:39:06.561-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41363050/Software_Engineering_in_the_Era_of_Cloud_Computing_Springer?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_41363050", "summary": "This book focuses on the development and implementation of cloud-based, complex software that allows parallelism, fast processing, and real-time connectivity. Software engineering (SE) is the design, development, testing, and implementation of software applications, and this discipline is as well developed as the practice is well established whereas the Cloud Software Engineering (CSE) is the design, development, testing, and continuous delivery of service-oriented software systems and applications (Software as a Service Paradigm). However, with the emergence of the highly attractive cloud computing (CC) paradigm, the tools and techniques for SE are changing. CC provides the latest software development environments and the necessary platforms relatively easily and inexpensively. It also allows the provision of software applications equally easily and on a pay-as-you-go basis. Business requirements for the use of software are also changing and there is a need for applications in big data analytics, parallel computing, AI, natural language processing, and biometrics, etc. These require huge amounts of computing power and sophisticated data management mechanisms, as well as device connectivity for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. In terms of hardware, software, communication, and storage, CC is highly attractive for developing complex software that is rapidly becoming essential for all sectors of life, including commerce, health, education, and transportation.\n\nThe book fills a gap in the SE literature by providing scientific contributions from researchers and practitioners, focusing on frameworks, methodologies, applications, benefits and inherent challenges/barriers to engineering software using the CC paradigm.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61561115, "asset_id": 41363050, "asset_type": "Work",

"This study explored the reasons why \tQueensland families in the Australian Christian \nAcademy chose home schooling.  One hundred and sixty-five families returned survey questionnaires and thirteen home school families were interviewed to provide data which was subsequently analysed and categorised.  Broadly speaking, home school families indicated six major categories of reasons which motivated them to choose home education.  These categories of reasons were religious, academic, parenting, social, pragmatic and special needs.  Home school families articulated a deep commitment to their views about life which thus affected their views about their children and their children\u2019s education.  This study provides an understanding of human motivations which have precipitated the home school movement among these families.  It also presents a platform from which Australian Christian Academy administrators may develop future policy.  The study raises awareness of key issues in the minds of home schooling parents concerning the development of their children.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59560986, "asset_id": 39415902, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 102104747, "first_name": "Terry", "last_name": "Harding", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TerryHarding2", "display_name": "Terry Harding", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TerryHarding2?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/102104747/27596842/25921977/s65_terry.harding.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 811266, "name": "home schooling in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/home_schooling_in_Australia?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38733852, "title": "Sociology in Brazil:  A Brief Institutional and Intellectual History", "created_at": "2019-04-07T10:06:21.675-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38733852/Sociology_in_Brazil_A_Brief_Institutional_and_Intellectual_History?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_38733852", "summary": "Full book: https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9783030104382\r\n\r\nAbstract: Offers the first complete history in English of sociology in Brazil Highlights the political and institutional changes that were fundamental to the development of sociology in Brazil Presents new research and analysis that maps new developments in Brazilian sociology, publications and centers of production, using qualitative and quantitative data This book provides an overview of the institutional and intellectual development of sociology in Brazil from the early 1900s to the present day; through military coups, dictatorships and democracies.

Cham: Palgrave. \r\nhttps://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783030238896\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the First World War letters and diaries of Australian soldiers for insights into the relationships between language and violence, focusing on accounts of violent actions and the deaths these caused. Analysis from a corpus of writings from 22 soldiers demonstrates around two-thirds of accounts utilise linguistic resources to minimise or downplay the realities of violence. Two main approaches are generally used: figurative language (euphemism and metaphor) and language that downplays human involvement (passive voice, simplified register, nominalisation/light verb constructions, and the use of inanimate nouns in place of people involved). Our exemplification and analysis of these strategies provides insight into both soldiers\u2019 experiences of violence and death and how they made sense of these experiences. The chapter thus adds to the understanding of First World War vernacular writing, contributes to existing scholarship by using a linguistic method of analysis, and more broadly considers the way violence is discussed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61235269, "asset_id": 38574782, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 349376, "first_name": "Cara", "last_name": "PENRY WILLIAMS", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "CaraPENRYWILLIAMS", "display_name": "Cara PENRY WILLIAMS", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/CaraPENRYWILLIAMS?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/349376/23164403/22268669/s65_cara.penry_williams.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 918326, "name": "Language and Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Violence?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2790118, "name": "Letters and diaries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Letters_and_diaries?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 38420837, "title": "Similarities and differences in belief and practice for Hinduism and Buddhism.", "created_at": "2019-02-22T17:41:52.081-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38420837/Similarities_and_differences_in_belief_and_practice_for_Hinduism_and_Buddhism?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_38420837", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58479727, "asset_id": 38420837, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 94077197, "first_name": "Noreen", "last_name": "Fatima", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "NoreenAtta", "display_name": "Noreen  Fatima", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/NoreenAtta?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/94077197/20614678/21938411/s65_noreen.atta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 767900, "name": "Budhhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Budhhism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3143856, "name": "Similarities and differences in belief and practice for Hinduism and Buddhism.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Similarities_and_differences_in_belief_and_practice_for_Hinduism_and_Buddhism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3143857, "name": "budhism and hinduism ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/budhism_and_hinduism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3143858, "name": "what is hinduism?", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/what_is_hinduism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3143859, "name": "Hinduism and Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism_and_Buddhism?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 38348984, "title": "Harding & Farrell 2003 Hm Schlng & Legislation.pdf", "created_at": "2019-02-13T18:27:51.981-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38348984/Harding_and_Farrell_2003_Hm_Schlng_and_Legislation_pdf?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_38348984", "summary": "Home schooling, as an alternative model of education, is emerging as a growing educational phenomenon throughout Australia.

It is the practice whereby parents engage in the full time education of their children at home. This study used a phenomenographic approach to identify and analyse how home educating parents conceive of their roles as home educators. Data analysis presented an outcome space of the parents\u2019 qualitatively different conceptions of their roles as home educators. This outcome space exemplifies the phenomenon of the roles of parent home educators. \nThis thesis reports on the qualitatively different ways in which a group of 27 home educating parents viewed their roles in the education of their children. Four categories of description of parent home educator roles emerged from the analysis. These parents saw themselves in the role of a (1) learner, as they needed to gain knowledge and skills in order to both commence and to continue home education. Further, they perceived of themselves as (2) partners, usually with their spouse, in an educational partnership, which provided the family\u2019s educational infrastructure. They also saw themselves in the role of (3) teachers of their children, facilitating their education and development. Finally, they conceived of themselves as (4) educational pioneers in their communities. These four categories were linked and differentiated from each other by three key themes or dimensions of variation. These were the themes of (1) educational influence; (2) educational example; and (3) spirituality, which impacted both their families and the wider community. \nThe findings of the study indicate that home educators experience their roles in four critically different ways, each of which contributes to their family educational enterprise. The findings suggest that home educators, are bona fide educators and that they access parental qualities that provide a form of education which differs from the educational practices characteristic of the majority of Australians.\nThe study has the potential to generate further understandings of home education for home educators and for the wider community. It may also inform policy makers in the fields of education, social welfare, and the law, where there is a vested interest in the education and welfare of children and families.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58374445, "asset_id": 38324155, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 102104747, "first_name": "Terry", "last_name": "Harding", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TerryHarding2", "display_name": "Terry Harding", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TerryHarding2?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/102104747/27596842/25921977/s65_terry.harding.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 566205, "name": "Explicit Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Explicit_Teaching?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 663157, "name": "K-12 Distance Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/K-12_Distance_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 811266, "name": "home schooling in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/home_schooling_in_Australia?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 38298313, "title": "Exploration: Becoming playful - the power of a ludic module", "created_at": "2019-02-06T08:34:16.084-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38298313/Exploration_Becoming_playful_the_power_of_a_ludic_module?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_38298313", "summary": "This book examines the increasing popularity of creativity and play in tertiary learning, and how it can be harnessed to enhance the student experience at university. While play is often misunderstood as something \u2018trivial\u2019 and associated with early years education, the editors and contributors argue that play contributes to social and human development and relations at a fundamental level. This volume invalidates the commonly held assumption that play is only for children, drawing together numerous case studies from higher education that demonstrate how researchers, students and managers can benefit from play as a means of liberating thought, overturning obstacles and discovering fresh approaches to persistent challenges. This diverse and wide-ranging edited collection unites play theory and practice to address the gulf in research on this fascinating topic. It will be of interest and value to educators, students and scholars of play and creativity, as well as practitioners and academic leaders looking to incorporate play into the curriculum.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58345797, "asset_id": 38298313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3461540, "first_name": "Sandra", "last_name": "Sinfield", "domain_name": "londonmet", "page_name": "SandraSinfield", "display_name": "Sandra Sinfield", "profile_url": "https://londonmet.academia.edu/SandraSinfield?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3461540/1171798/1469557/s65_sandra.sinfield.jpg"}, {"id": 8491716, "first_name": "Tom", "last_name": "Burns", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TomBurns2", "display_name": "Tom Burns", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TomBurns2?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8491716/15883722/16402300/s65_tom.burns.jpg"}, {"id": 6144, "first_name": "Sandra", "last_name": "Abegglen", "domain_name": "ucalgary", "page_name": "SandraAbegglen", "display_name": "Sandra Abegglen", "profile_url": "https://ucalgary.academia.edu/SandraAbegglen?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6144/2389/15395946/s65_sandra.abegglen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1751, "name": "Creativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creativity?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3457, "name": "Learning and Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_and_Teaching?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17951, "name": "Learning And Teaching In Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_And_Teaching_In_Higher_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 175427, "name": "Undergraduate Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1222768, "name": "Play and Creativity in the Curriculum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Play_and_Creativity_in_the_Curriculum?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 38260215, "title": "Student and parental attitudes toward voucherization of education", "created_at": "2019-01-31T06:01:53.966-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38260215/Student_and_parental_attitudes_toward_voucherization_of_education?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_38260215", "summary": "Voucher system of education implies the use of vouchers as instruments of financing public and private education.

This is quite different from what we may see or experience in the public school classroom, where curriculum is strictly adhered to, and testing is the way a student's learning is assessed. In this study, how and when unschoolers learn to read without a set curriculum will be explored. Twenty eight unschooled adults (age 18 and older) were interviewed and asked to recall their experiences with reading and learning to read.

This paper builds upon the existing documents which has been refereed as available on the references section. Quality education nurtures human talent and creativity, thereby contributing to the personal and professional development of the individual person, as well as to social, psychological, economic, political and environmental development of society at large. It promotes peace, democracy, creativity, solidarity, inclusion, a commitment to a sustainable environment, and international and intercultural understanding. It provides people with the critical knowledge, abilities and skills that are needed to conceptualise, question and solve problems that occur both locally and globally. Every citizen of this country has the right to a quality education. This country education system for primary and secondary level is still adapting the traditional education, which is the compulsary attendance to the school. In spite of some efforts made to reform education by governments and institutions at national level, we still see an overall gap in providing a holistic approach to the matter. This system has gone off long without a problem until recently, there are problems reported in schools. These problems includes social problems such as bullying and unequal opportunities, insufficient infrastructures and utilities especially for disabled learners, certain health condition that limit the learning ability of the students, such as autisme, Cerebral palsy, dyslexia, and environmental and safety issues of the students. All the stated problems have been observed to keep arising day by day with few choice of solutions available, which usually involve high cost in terms of financial. It has been observed the implementation of Homeschooling policy in Malaysia could be the solution for the learning problems associated with disabled learners, including those with mental health disorder. Therefore, it is high time for the ministry to approve the Home schooling policy, which have been observed to solve the stated problems in developed countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57564930, "asset_id": 37584840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43829419, "first_name": "Dr Muhammad Nur Azimi", "last_name": "Azizan", "domain_name": "unisel", "page_name": "DrMuhammadNurAzimiAzizan", "display_name": "Dr Muhammad Nur Azimi Azizan", "profile_url": "https://unisel.academia.edu/DrMuhammadNurAzimiAzizan?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43829419/11691213/21040644/s65_dr_muhammad_nur_azimi.azizan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1062, "name": "Special Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Special_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37314286, "title": "U\u0455\u0456ng Worksheets A\u0455 \u0430 W\u0430\u0443 t\u043e Teach Kids", "created_at": "2018-08-29T21:44:38.767-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37314286/U%D1%95%D1%96ng_Worksheets_A%D1%95_%D0%B0_W%D0%B0%D1%83_t%D0%BE_Teach_Kids?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_37314286", "summary": "Worksheets h\u0430v\u0435 b\u0435\u0435n u\u0455\u0435d \u0456n \u043eur day t\u043e day lives.

Adopting a unique integrative approach, it examines the fragmentation of governance that is a critical barrier to achieving the SDGs. The main question addressed is: What are the crucial elements and the organizing logic of an integrative framework that is suitable for analysing governance for the SDGs and for implementing the transitions that we need towards a more sustainable world? This transdisciplinary book first proposes a combination of innovative governance theories that can improve the analysis and practice of sustainability governance. Secondly, it explores the interests of core actors in a number of case examples. And thirdly, it offers recommendations for improving the study and practice of sustainability governance. The findings presented form the basis for a new approach to governance towards objectives such as the SDGs: Integrative Sustainability Governance (ISG). The ensuing ISG framework includes indicator frames within the pillars of power, knowledge and norms. The book concludes that the transformation of crisis into sustainability transitions requires a deeper consideration of risk management that strengthens resilience; systems deliberation that complements democracy; and behavioral insights that elevate human awareness and collaboration. This handbook is a comprehensive and valuable companion for students, experts and practitioners with an interest in the SDGs.

Amongst criticisms of character education, the political criticism that character education is a form of indoctrination stands out. In particular, the charge is made against character education that it breaches the principle of liberal neutrality about the good. In this paper I discuss liberal approaches to character education. I outline the two most prominent liberal approaches to character education in school, liberal neutralism and liberal perfectionism, as we find it in the work of Clayton (neutralism) and Levinson (liberal perfectionism). I hold that the two standard liberal approaches do not distinguish carefully enough between two possible forms of character education \u2013 moral character education and intellectual character education. Drawing on recent work in virtue epistemology, I hold that the liberal position tacitly demands intellectual character education. Regarding moral character education, however, I hold that the picture appears different. In the final analysis, I advocate a new form of perfectionism regarding character education that I call 'intellectual perfectionism'. According to intellectual perfectionism, schools should be perfectionist regarding children's intellects, but neutralist regarding their morals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56683398, "asset_id": 36740134, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8362294, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Kotzee", "domain_name": "bham", "page_name": "BenKotzee", "display_name": "Ben Kotzee", "profile_url": "https://bham.academia.edu/BenKotzee?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8362294/5481585/8675986/s65_ben.kotzee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2559, "name": "Philosophy of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4568, "name": "Liberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberalism?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15236, "name": "Virtue Epistemology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtue_Epistemology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16449, "name": "Perfectionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perfectionism?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36491240, "title": "HOW SPONSORS INFLUENCE STUDENTS' WRITING PRACTICES IN AN EIGHTH GRADE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS CLASSROOM", "created_at": "2018-04-24T12:37:33.727-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36491240/HOW_SPONSORS_INFLUENCE_STUDENTS_WRITING_PRACTICES_IN_AN_EIGHTH_GRADE_ENGLISH_LANGUAGE_ARTS_CLASSROOM?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_36491240", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56410469, "asset_id": 36491240, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26469090, "first_name": "Adam", "last_name": "Loretto", "domain_name": "gcc", "page_name": "AdamLoretto", "display_name": "Adam Loretto", "profile_url": "https://gcc.academia.edu/AdamLoretto?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26469090/7345286/15210857/s65_adam.loretto.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11823, "name": "K-12 writing instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/K-12_writing_instruction?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47177, "name": "Sponsorship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sponsorship?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36120884, "title": "Help End Child Neglect & Abuse with Home School Regulation in Utah", "created_at": "2018-03-09T11:41:52.040-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36120884/Help_End_Child_Neglect_and_Abuse_with_Home_School_Regulation_in_Utah?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_36120884", "summary": "Here requesting peer review and recommendations , 2018\nHere requesting peer review and recommendations: Such new home school regulations would encourage and protect the reputations of exceptional home schools while eliminating the worst ones that don't prepare their children to function in our society with a good education and social skills.

Muslims shy away from this while some people refuse to develop their kids giving finance as an excuse to train them. Some can afford the luxury of sending their wards to a bigger school, while forgetting that they still owe them a responsibility to be homeschooled.

Given that home education is experiencing rapid growth and that many current global education reforms place emphasis on the arts as vital to creative futures, the development of deeper understanding is warranted. In order to address the shortfall, this paper reports on the first phase of a qualitative study that investigated the arts practices of 14 Australian home educators for the purpose of understanding the variety of ways that arts learning and teaching are incorporated in individual home education contexts. The study sought to identify the issues that participants experience when facilitating their children's arts education, the specific strategies they adopt, and how arts teaching and learning approaches are adapted to the fluctuating needs and dynamics of their individual contexts. The paper begins by outlining home education as a unique and alternative pedagogical practice that differs from formal institutional learning, before unpacking the concept of authentic arts education. Details are presented that reveal the research process when interaction between participant and researcher combined to consider engagement with the arts and of associated challenges. Introduction This research investigated the ways that a group of Australian home educators facilitate their children's arts education. The inquiry sought to uncover the ways they approach arts learning, looking at the issues they experience and at wider contextual features impacting on their individual contexts. The core motivation was to develop an understanding of current practices and that new insights could lead to the development of new strategies that would offer practical benefit to the home educators in their teaching. Importantly, our objective included the concept of \" authenticity \" in arts teaching as this is our benchmark for meaningful practice in arts education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55779542, "asset_id": 35899740, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17832856, "first_name": "Katie", "last_name": "Burke", "domain_name": "usq", "page_name": "KatieBurke", "display_name": "Katie  Burke", "profile_url": "https://usq.academia.edu/KatieBurke?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17832856/4982177/21073539/s65_katie.burke.jpg"}, {"id": 37805867, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Cleaver", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DCleaver", "display_name": "David Cleaver", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DCleaver?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37805867/10624687/11859793/s65_david.cleaver.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4052, "name": "Arts Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4830, "name": "Sociocultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociocultural_Theory?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35838134, "title": "Statement on Homeschooling at Belweder Palace", "created_at": "2018-02-04T18:56:48.450-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35838134/Statement_on_Homeschooling_at_Belweder_Palace?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_35838134", "summary": "Statement of Stephen Baskerville, PhD\nProfessor of Government at Patrick Henry College \n\tand Fulbright Scholar at the Jagiellonian University (2015-2016) \t\nEducacja domowa: wczoraj, dzis i jutro\nBelweder Palace, Warsaw, 8 February 2016\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55716190, "asset_id": 35838134, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15347315, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Baskerville", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "StephenBaskerville", "display_name": "Stephen Baskerville", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/StephenBaskerville?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15347315/6917116/18701392/s65_stephen.baskerville.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3454, "name": "Children and Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children_and_Families?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 72614, "name": "Parental Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parental_Rights?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83247, "name": "Homeschooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 333977, "name": "State Power", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Power?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958419, "name": "Child and Family Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_and_Family_Policy?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 35507558, "title": "Mathematica for Theoretical Physics", "created_at": "2017-12-25T08:40:17.199-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35507558/Mathematica_for_Theoretical_Physics?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_35507558", "summary": "The first \u20ac price and the \u00a3 and $ price are net prices, subject to local VAT.

Engaging with the power turn in translation studies contexts, it offers innovative perspectives on the role of self-translators as cultural and ideological mediators. The authors explore the unequal power relations and centre-periphery dichotomies of Europe's minorised languages, literatures and cultures. They recognise that the self-translator's double affiliation as author and translator places them in a privileged position to challenge power, to negotiate the experiences of the subaltern and colonised, and to scrutinize conflicting minorised vs. hegemonic cultural identities. Three are the main themes explored in relation to self-translation: hegemony and resistance; self-minorisation and self-censorship; and collaboration, hybridisation and invisibility. This edited collection will appeal to scholars and students working on translation, transnational and postcolonial studies, and multilingual and multicultural identities.\n\nTOC and free preview here: http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781137507808 ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54324938, "asset_id": 34451110, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 104113, "first_name": "Olga", "last_name": "Castro", "domain_name": "warwick", "page_name": "OlgaCastro", "display_name": "Olga Castro", "profile_url": "https://warwick.academia.edu/OlgaCastro?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/104113/28641/12132580/s65_olga.castro.jpg"}, {"id": 945809, "first_name": "Svetlana", "last_name": "Page (nee Skomorokhova)", "domain_name": "bham", "page_name": "SvetlanaPageneeSkomorokhova", "display_name": "Svetlana  Page (nee Skomorokhova)", "profile_url": "https://bham.academia.edu/SvetlanaPageneeSkomorokhova?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/945809/542902/678194/s65_svetlana.skomorokhova.jpg"}, {"id": 68121928, "first_name": "Sergi", "last_name": "Mainer", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SergiMainer", "display_name": "Sergi Mainer", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SergiMainer?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 383, "name": "European Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 18347, "name": "Self-translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-translation?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 50804, "name": "Literary translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_translation?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 34355776, "title": "Ways of Being in Teaching", "created_at": "2017-08-25T14:17:26.082-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34355776/Ways_of_Being_in_Teaching?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_34355776", "summary": "As teachers, we can share our experiences with one another. It is a way to make sense of our teaching lives and teaching selves. We encourage all teachers to share their stories of living. We invite you to imagine Ways of Being in Teaching as a scholarly conversation amongst friends, one that includes you as the reader. As you will experience in this book, our chapters are in dialogue with thinkers like Paulo Freire, William Pinar, bell hooks, Parker Palmer, and Maxine Greene. Feminist author and activist bell hooks (1995) suggests that discussion is the unit of social change. We align our perspectives with Paulo Freire\u2019s (1970) notion of praxis and dialogue. The Freirean notion of dialogue, which can be described as informal education built on mutual respect, depends on equality, love, cooperation, and a collaborative understanding within communities. William Pinar builds on Freire\u2019s (1970) work through his conception of \u201ccomplicated conversation\u201d (2011), which he describes as:\n\u2026conversation in which interlocutors are speaking not only among themselves but to those not present, not only to historical figures and unnamed peoples and places they may be studying, but to politicians and parents dead and alive, not to mention to the selves they have been, are in the process of becoming, and someday may become. (p. 43)\nThe ways we strengthen and sustain self, soul, heart, identity, can strengthen teaching. Being a teacher recognizes that who we are, where we are, and why is as much a social process as a personal one, so we claim that attending to our purpose in life is also attending to our teaching. Chapters in this text have a surprising forthrightness that will appeal to teachers who are tired of the tips and tricks, and want to talk more deeply about how flourish in this profession. Readers will be challenged to put away the tidy boxes and neat platitudes and undertake the rigourous work of discovering who they are as human beings and how this impacts who they are with their students.\nAs a group of editors, we are listening to ourselves, each other (our community), our students, and to the world around us. We listen for connections to others and ourselves.

Studies on biotic and abiotic interactions, plant biodiversity, and soil-plant relationships are also covered. Covering a wide range of plant conditions and adaptations, this book analyzes what happens when plants must endure very high temperatures and aridity. Plants have adapted by evolving their physical structure to store and conserve water. Examples are the absence of leaves which reduces transpiration and the growth of extremely long roots, allowing them to acquire moisture at, or near the water table. Plants in hyperarid habitats have also made behavioral adaptations in order to survive by synchronizing with the seasons of greatest moisture and/or coolest temperatures. For example, desert perennials remain dormant during dry periods of the year, then spring to life when water becomes available.

In fact students of educational psychology from all over the world are at least familiar with some of the ideas connected to it. But there are also many misappropriations of this concept. For example the zone of proximal development necessitates the \" assistance of others \" in a social context of learning as the above quote mentions. In Vygotsky's view this involves another person who is more advanced in the target learning domain that can negotiate the point of learning in a way that leads to development. This is impossible as an independent activity that is withdrawn from consistent human interaction. Another misconception is seen in thinking that a simple rearrangement of classroom furniture will create a zone of proximal development (zpd). There are at least two errors in this approach. First, the zpd is not a geographical zone, but refers rather to the \" space \" between the learner's actual level of experience and their potential level of development. Second, Vygotsky is very clear on the role of the mentor/teacher's role to lead in development even though the goal is the co-construction of knowledge. In this context it becomes necessary to distinguish between a \" student centered \" approaches with a \" learner centered \" one. In both approaches, what the student is able to internalize is more important than a \" top down \" method which is characterized by a teacher centered delivery of instruction. But in a learner centered environment, the teacher or mentor is able to maintain certain parameters within the target subject matter in an environment of interaction and dialogue that enhances student voice and personal agency.

A fundamental barrier that inhibits access to surgical care in these locations is the lack of basic surgical instruments and supplies in healthcare facilities. RepRap printers are highly versatile 3D printers assembled from basic, domestically sourced materials that can fabricate low-cost surgical instruments on-site, ultimately enhancing the interventional capacity of healthcare facilities to treat patients. Rather than focusing on one specific field of interest, this book takes an integrative approach that incorporates topics and methods from multiple disciplines ranging from global health and development economics to materials science and applied engineering. These topics include the feasibility of using bio-based plastics to fabricate surgical instruments via 3D printing sustainably, the application of \"frugal innovation and engineering \" in resource-poor settings, and analyses related to the social returns on investment, barriers to entry, and current and future medical device supply-chain paradigms. In taking a multidisciplinary approach, the reader can gain a holistic understanding of the multiple facets related to implementing medical device innovations in developing countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52929882, "asset_id": 32776163, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45917249, "first_name": "Krish", "last_name": "Ramadurai", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "KrishRamadurai", "display_name": "Krish W Ramadurai", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/KrishRamadurai?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45917249/12322687/13719077/s65_krish.ramadurai.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48, "name": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Engineering?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 727, "name": "Development Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Economics?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 923, "name": "Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1656, "name": "Social Entrepreneurship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Entrepreneurship?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4990, "name": "Global Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Health?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 6631, "name": "Economics of Innovation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economics_of_Innovation?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 23091, "name": "3D printing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/3D_printing?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 72520, "name": "International Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Public_Health?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 207384, "name": "Additive Manufacturing and 3D printing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Additive_Manufacturing_and_3D_printing?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 32770019, "title": "A written critique of my 'Cybermole' blog article: Back to the future with UTC's", "created_at": "2017-05-02T05:58:17.372-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32770019/A_written_critique_of_my_Cybermole_blog_article_Back_to_the_future_with_UTCs?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_32770019", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52925077, "asset_id": 32770019, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63746728, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Cook", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PaulCook26", "display_name": "Paul Cook", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PaulCook26?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63746728/16551010/16877533/s65_paul.cook.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 219191, "name": "Apprenticeship Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Apprenticeship_Learning?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32616566, "title": "J.

Global change is more than just climate change and the ramifications of changing trade patterns (geopolitical and economic aspects), the shift to the market economy, demographic factors (population growth, urbanization and resettlement), receive attention here. Land user change specialists, policy makers and natural resource management agencies will find the book very useful. Chapters focus on examples that are drawn from a number of sources including previously unpublished studies on the impact of climate change, markets and economics on pastoralist and dryland farming households. The key focus is to provide readers insights into the real world implications of change (including an analysis of the drivers of change) on these vulnerable groups within arid land societies. The role of humans as agents of these changes is canvassed. A regional analysis of the world's grasslands is also performed including those in Australia,", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52773581, "asset_id": 32598913, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 106989, "first_name": "Victor", "last_name": "SQUIRES", "domain_name": "gsau", "page_name": "VictorSQUIRES", "display_name": "Victor SQUIRES", "profile_url": "https://gsau.academia.edu/VictorSQUIRES?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/106989/29378/17877908/s65_victor.squires.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 449, "name": "Software Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Engineering?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3754, "name": "Climatology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climatology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32423196, "title": "The Interactionist Imagination Studying Meaning, Situation and Micro-Social Order (Flyer)", "created_at": "2017-04-14T03:14:59.554-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32423196/The_Interactionist_Imagination_Studying_Meaning_Situation_and_Micro_Social_Order_Flyer_?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_32423196", "summary": "This book outlines the history and developments of interactionist social thought through a consideration of its key figures.

Through an engagement with the latest scholarship this work shows that in a discipline often focused on macrosocial developments and large-scale structures, the interactionist perspective which privileges the study of human interaction has continued relevance.

Majavu Uncommodified Blackness The African Male Experience in Australia and New Zealand Series: Mapping Global Racisms \u25b6 Provides a new theoretical concept with which to understand racism and xenophobia directed at Africans \u25b6 Offers important insights into the experience of being African and male in Australia and New Zealand \u25b6 Addresses the question of African-ness: a question that has not been well examined in this part of the world This book is a study of the lived experience of African men in Australia and New Zealand. The author employs a relational account of racism which foregrounds how the colonial shaped the contemporary, with the settler states of contemporary Australia and New Zealand having been moulded by their colonial histories. Uncommodified Blackness examines the changing racial conditions in Australia and New Zealand, inspired by the view that as racial conditions change globally, prevailing racial modalities in these two countries must be reexamined and theory must be developed or revised as appropriate.

His four mathematical works were originally published in Latin: two in his lifetime (1550\u20131617), one shortly after he died, and one over 200 years later. The authors have prepared three introductory chapters, one covering Napier himself, one his mathematical works, and one his religious work. The former has been prepared by one of Napier\u2019s descendants and contains many new findings about Napier\u2019s life to provide the most complete biography of this enigmatic character, whose reputation has previously been overshadowed by rumour and speculation. The latter has been written by an academic who was awarded a PhD for his thesis on Napier at the University of Edinburgh, and it provides the most lucid and coherent coverage available of this abstruse and little understood work. The chapter on Napier\u2019s mathematical texts has been authored by an experienced and respected academic, whose recent works have specialised in the history of mathematics and whose Journey through Mathematics was selected in March of 2012 as an Outstanding Title in Mathematics by Choice magazine, a publication of the American Library Association.

The author explores Warren\u2019s attempt to develop planning strategies, culturally-based initiatives, community design projects, and creative partnerships in the region in order to address the challenges of shrinkage and foreclosures at multiple scales. Global urban development is currently characterized by varied combination of metropolitan growth and urban core shrinkage. While much of the shrinkage is concentrated in central cities, first suburbs are now facing the same problem. The Warren case illustrates opportunities for flexible policies combining rightsizing, shared maintenance, and incremental development in struggling first suburban communities, which are less studied and often ignored.

Employing updated databases, this book presents tables and diagrams to compare the conventional and the new estimates of the linkage between energy and economic development (Energy Intensity) throughout the world, over the last 100 years. Whereas estimates based on the established framework for evaluating the link between energy resources and the economy indicate a strong decoupling trend, the new indicators follow substantially different paths which suggest a strong coupling between economic growth and energy use. These differences-which call into question the prevailing opinion of decoupling-are fundamental for the prospects of sustainability. This book provides a valuable resource for economists, energy and environmental analysts, natural resource managers and policy makers.

In chapter two of The School and Society, Dewey demonstrates how a model of the 'ideal home' can impart crucially important lessons about a comparable model of the 'ideal school.' Dewey then insists that education should direct the student's natural impulses, just as the concerned parent guides the growth of the child. There are at least two ways in which to interpret this position. One is that homeschooling is the ideal form of early education. The other is that school life should emulate family life. Though advocates of homeschooling would prefer the former account, the case is difficult to make because (i) Dewey rarely recommended specific institutional forms or practices and (ii) the interpretation does not align with the book's thesis that the school should be a microcosm for the best and most educative kinds of experience that the larger society has to offer. So, consistent with the overall theme of the work, the better interpretation is that school life should resemble family life. Nevertheless, a Deweyan defense of homeschooling is possible. Of course, Dewey would not agree with the rationale of religious conservatives to home school, namely, that it allows them to impart sectarian values and thereby insulate their children from a secular world. Still, a Dewey-inspired defense proves possible if the practice of homeschooling is the sole alternative to an educational environment that stifles growth, imposes values through bald appeals to authority and denies the opportunity for learning through experimental inquiry and intelligent habit formation. Finally, I examine the policy implications of a Deweyan defense of homeschooling, arguing that homeschoolers and public schooling advocates should find common ground and forge partnerships for their mutual advantage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44086222, "asset_id": 23681785, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58399, "first_name": "Shane", "last_name": "Ralston", "domain_name": "woolf", "page_name": "ShaneRalston", "display_name": "Shane J Ralston", "profile_url": "https://woolf.academia.edu/ShaneRalston?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58399/17004/108535126/s65_shane.ralston.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14589, "name": "John Dewey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Dewey?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19118, "name": "Pragmatism (Philosophy)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pragmatism_Philosophy_?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 23360687, "title": "Curriculum Policies for Students with Special Needs in Australia", "created_at": "2016-03-17T03:26:48.365-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23360687/Curriculum_Policies_for_Students_with_Special_Needs_in_Australia?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_23360687", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43814437, "asset_id": 23360687, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45296705, "first_name": "Tania", "last_name": "Aspland", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TaniaAspland", "display_name": "Tania Aspland", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TaniaAspland?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1062, "name": "Special Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Special_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30151, "name": "Policy Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Analysis?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 23075033, "title": "The experiences of children aged six to twelve years, with autism spectrum disorder, in the Australian mainstream educational environment: A parental perspective on the effectiveness of current policies and procedures", "created_at": "2016-03-10T01:40:24.570-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23075033/The_experiences_of_children_aged_six_to_twelve_years_with_autism_spectrum_disorder_in_the_Australian_mainstream_educational_environment_A_parental_perspective_on_the_effectiveness_of_current_policies_and_procedures?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_23075033", "summary": "The Australian commonwealth and state governments have established policies to enable children with autism spectrum disorder to experience equality and inclusion in mainstream education, and provide funding for the implementation of appropriate practices.\nThe Australian Senate is currently conducting an inquiry into current levels of access and attainment for students with a disability in the school system, and the impact on students and families associated with inadequate levels of support, and has called for submissions from parents, advocacy groups, and educators.\nThis qualitative study uses grounded theory and a phenomenological interpretivist approach to analyse the content of submissions made to the inquiry, to gain a collective perspective from parents of children with autism aged 6-12 years in mainstream schooling, and their level of satisfaction with current policies and procedures.

Owing to the large number of parents who do not register with any educational body, accurate statistics of home educating families are difficult to obtain, however all estimates indicate that it is the fastest growing educational sector in Australia (Townsend, 2012).  Given the significance of the arts as an integral component of a quality holistic education, developing insight into how this rapidly growing educational sector is engaging with the arts is considered a timely issue. \nKatie Burke\u2019s background as a home educator to her two children for 8 years, and a tertiary arts educator for the same period of time has directly contributed to her interest in researching arts practices in Australian home education. This focus actually arose from a personally experienced difficulty: ironically, as a tertiary art educator, Katie experienced difficulty in facilitating an arts education within her home education practice. Pedagogical challenges were raised by the difference in her children\u2019s ages and the diversity of their interests.  Arts resources and time were both limited and the general demands of teaching across all subject areas meant that she often carried a sense of ineffectiveness in the facilitation of Arts learning with her children. Informal conversations with other home educators highlighted they shared these difficulties, and in some cases, did not engage with arts learning at all. \nSuch experiences, and the dearth of research into arts practices within home education, indicates the need for research at the intersection of the arts and home education. However, beyond merely gaining understandings into how home educators engage with the arts, Katie desires to use research to facilitate innovation in arts practices in Australian home education. In conceptualising her research project, she has therefore sought to move beyond traditional education research practices, and has sought an approach that re-engineers research as an endeavour that both engages in - and results in \u2013 innovations in the arts.  \nHer doctoral project will explore how the arts are being taught in Australia\u2019s home education community, and, using a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach, will also work with home educators to develop an arts support resource and communication space that responds to the needs of home educators that is underpinned by the principles of quality arts education. DBR provides a viable alternative to traditional educational research that attempts to bridge the gap between research and practice.  It is advocated as a means to simultaneously advance learning design, educational research and practical application (Reeves, McKenney, & Herrington, 2011; Wang & Hannafin, 2005).  It is suitable for this project, which aims to simultaneously develop understanding of arts practices in home education, whilst advancing learning design and practical application of best practice in arts learning, thus enabling participants to experience practical benefit from their engagement with the research. This presentation will thus explore how the research is being used to generate innovation in the arts within Australian home education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38732392, "asset_id": 15593606, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17832856, "first_name": "Katie", "last_name": "Burke", "domain_name": "usq", "page_name": "KatieBurke", "display_name": "Katie  Burke", "profile_url": "https://usq.academia.edu/KatieBurke?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17832856/4982177/21073539/s65_katie.burke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4052, "name": "Arts Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22326, "name": "Design-based research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design-based_research?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15550214, "title": "Learning through the soles of our feet: unschooling, anarchism, and the geography of childhood", "created_at": "2015-09-09T09:42:31.296-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15550214/Learning_through_the_soles_of_our_feet_unschooling_anarchism_and_the_geography_of_childhood?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_15550214", "summary": "Schooling is a form of misopedy and a fundamental structure in conditioning societal acceptance of domination in other registers. The subordination of children begins with the misguided notion that they are incapable of autonomy, reinforcing a dichotomous understanding of adult/child or teacher/student. Schooling should not be confused with education. The former represents the interests of oppression, molding societal consciousness to accept the conditions of subjugation. In contrast, education in its idealized form is a process of self-discovery, an awakening to one\u2019s potential, and a desire to see such abilities realized. To ensure the absence of coercion in education children need to explore for themselves, making their own decisions about what their interests are, and how those curiosities might be fulfilled. Presenting a broad range of opportunities is crucial, but the decision about what path to follow should be determined by the child. When bound to a classroom we often mistake obedience for education. Yet learning, as geographers recognize, best occurs 'through the soles of our feet' and when children explore the world through unschooling, they live into their creative potential, opening an aperture on alternative ontologies. Unschooling is, in short, one of the most powerful forms of anarchism we can engage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59135281, "asset_id": 15550214, "asset_type": "Work",

mainstream schooling and education are becoming increasingly recognised as pertinent and urgent to better understand. We need to know what really works in successfully educating children and adults today. This is not just important but a duty. This duty comes especially in light of the dominating performance driven and managerially organised economic modelling of education. This Handbook seeks to explore the vast range of educational alternatives\u2014from appreciating just why we don\u2019t like changing our mind about education to knowing more about the value of forest schools; to \u201cseeing\u201d home education properly to learning the value of solitude in schools; to hearing about new technological attitudes to education to understanding why order at home meets educational goals; to feeling our way through heterotopic education spaces to learning about practical new alternative school models. The Handbook maps the current and future terrain of the educational landscape. Global in its perspective and field-defining in content, this wide-ranging one-stop volume will be an indispensable reference resource for academics, students and researchers in the fields of education, education policy and philosophy.\n\nEditor Biographies\nDr Helen E Lees researches and writes about alternative education, broadly conceived in all its matters and manners and silence for education and well-being.

Only few alternatives to a state-run pre-school day care exist in the Czech Republic, yet women are expected and willing to work. The conflict between paid work and family life is emphasized in academic as well as public debates and women are pressurized to choose either work or care/family. Alongside semi-permanent alternatives to Kindergarten child care, several families solve their situation on the permanent basis and opt for the life strategy of unschooling, rooted in the belief in symbiosis of family life, education of the children and paid work of the parents. \nPaper explores and for the first time ever describes unschooling as practiced in the conditions of the Czech Republic.

Paradoxically, even as these themes emerged, the actual teaching practices in many programs for slow learners, in their concreteness, in\r\ntheir freedom from constraints such as standardized testing, and in their use of inquiry methods, were reported as beneficial to these students and potentially to other\r\nstudents as well. When similar methods were used in non-segregated classrooms that included students named as slow learners, most students were reported to be engaged\r\nand successful. In this vein, broader educational reform measures that might be\r\npotentially helpful in helping make schools more inclusive for the students currently labelled slow learners were also examined. This thesis recommended the use of\r\ninclusive approaches in classrooms at the site-based level as well as continued scrutiny and reform of the institutional barriers at the school, district, and provincial\r\nlevels that contribute to the production of slow learners.

There are, therefore, multiple loci in\nthese systems where dysfunction may lead to developmental\ndyslexia. However, most normal children learn to\nread using the alphabetic system.

Most dyslexic children\nhave deficient phonological awareness and have difficulty\nconverting graphemes into phonemes. Studies of patients\nwith acquired lesions who are unable to convert graphemes\ninto phonemes, as well as positron emission tomographic\nstudies of normal subjects, suggest that the left\ninferior frontal lobe is important in phonologic reading.\nPhonetic gestures are represented in the brain as invariant\nmotor commands that program the articulators. Phonologic\nreading may activate the left inferior frontal lobe\nbecause grapheme-to-phoneme conversion requires activation\nof these motor-articulatory gestures.

The inability to associate the position of their\narticulators with speech sounds may impair the development\nof phonological awareness and the ability to convert\ngraphemes to phonemes.

The philosophical debates and distinctions are firmly grounded upon examples from actual physics, thus exemplifying a robustly empiricist approach. The essays, by both prominent scholars in the field and promising young researchers, constitute a pioneer effort in bringing out the connections between probabilistic, causal and dispositional aspects of the quantum domain. The book will appeal to specialists in philosophy and foundations of physics, philosophy of science in general, metaphysics, ontology of physics theories, and philosophy of probability.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37478653, "asset_id": 12181662, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1941, "first_name": "Mauricio", "last_name": "Su\u00e1rez", "domain_name": "ucm", "page_name": "MauricioSu\u00e1rez", "display_name": "Mauricio Su\u00e1rez", "profile_url": "https://ucm.academia.edu/MauricioSu%C3%A1rez?f_ri=1299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 821, "name": "Philosophy of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Science?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 822, "name": "Philosophy of Physics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Physics?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8220, "name": "Causation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Causation?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9796, "name": "Philosophy Of Probability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Probability?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 62143, "name": "Metaphysics of Causation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metaphysics_of_Causation?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 12148307, "title": "Geomorphology and Internal Sedimentary Structure of a Landward Migrating Barrier Spit (Southern Sylt/German Bight): Insights from GPR Surveys", "created_at": "2015-04-29T03:30:11.336-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12148307/Geomorphology_and_Internal_Sedimentary_Structure_of_a_Landward_Migrating_Barrier_Spit_Southern_Sylt_German_Bight_Insights_from_GPR_Surveys?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_12148307", "summary": "Barriers comprise approximately 15 % of the world\u2019s coastlines and are formed due to the combined action of wind, waves, and longshore currents. In this study ground-penetrating radar data (GPR) of different antenna frequencies and sedimentological data were combined to reveal the sedimentary structure and architecture of the southern barrier island spit of the North-Frisian island of Sylt, to define different coastal environments and to set up a barrier island stratigraphy.\r\n\r\nBased on these data, a sedimentological model has been generated for Southern Sylt which describes the interaction between extreme events, coastal processes and sedimentary development and elucidates the major episodes of barrier island evolution. The model is concerned with the spit add-on zone where the barrier spit is attached to the central island moraine core and shows a landward migration through barrier rollover involving an interplay of barrier retreat and washover associated with accumulation of sediment in a backbarrier environment as a result of storm surges. With the exception of the uppermost dune facies the spit add-on zone reveals a transgressive coarsening upward sequence starting with sandy mud flat deposits at the bottom which grade into coarser sandy tidal flat deposits toward the top. Sandy tidal flat deposits are overlain by washover sheet and washover fan deposits. Eroded sediment was transported along the west coast of Sylt by longshore drift and was added to the southern spit-end during fair weather conditions.\r\n\r\nWeblink:\r\nhttp://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13716-2_17\r\nhttp://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-13716-2", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37454280, "asset_id": 12148307, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14438397, "first_name": "Tanja", "last_name": "Dr. Tillmann", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TanjaTillmann", "display_name": "Tanja  Dr. Tillmann", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TanjaTillmann?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14438397/8201015/9177528/s65_tanja.tillmann.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 408, "name": "Geomorphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geomorphology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 420, "name": "Sedimentology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sedimentology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2478, "name": "Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ground_Penetrating_Radar_GPR_?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6808, "name": "Coastal Geomorphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_Geomorphology?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 9890, "name": "Quaternary Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quaternary_Geology?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 13664, "name": "Ground Penetrating Radar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ground_Penetrating_Radar?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 25439, "name": "Coastal geomorphology (Earth Sciences)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_geomorphology_Earth_Sciences_?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 48807, "name": "Sedimentary geology and stratigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sedimentary_geology_and_stratigraphy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 60446, "name": "Quaternary Sedimentology and Geomorphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quaternary_Sedimentology_and_Geomorphology?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 76628, "name": "Barrier Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Barrier_Islands?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 119188, "name": "ground-penetrating radar (GPR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ground-penetrating_radar_GPR_?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 119725, "name": "Gpr", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gpr?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 11748782, "title": "Preparing To Teach Writing", "created_at": "2015-03-31T22:12:34.398-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11748782/Preparing_To_Teach_Writing?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_11748782", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37177261, "asset_id": 11748782, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16039423, "first_name": "Ana", "last_name": "_333", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AnaNovianti", "display_name": "Ana _333", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AnaNovianti?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16039423/7327416/9171215/s65_ana.novianti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1601, "name": "Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11558081, "title": "Differentiation and Disassociations are \"the Gospel\"", "created_at": "2015-03-20T14:55:05.035-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11558081/Differentiation_and_Disassociations_are_the_Gospel_?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_11558081", "summary": "Christians want nothing more than to be liked, appreciated and accepted as cultural norms.

These 20 are a denial of the Kingdom of God.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37895779, "asset_id": 11325898, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8215756, "first_name": "Timothy", "last_name": "Price", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TimothyPrice8", "display_name": "Timothy L Price", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TimothyPrice8?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8215756/2823020/43109452/s65_timothy.price.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4315, "name": "Origins of Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Origins_of_Life?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5149, "name": "Calvinism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Calvinism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 7489, "name": "Freedom of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Freedom_of_Religion?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 7992, "name": "Eschatology and Apocalypticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eschatology_and_Apocalypticism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 12388, "name": "Problem of Religious Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Problem_of_Religious_Authority?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 14430, "name": "Religion, Conflict and Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_Conflict_and_Peacebuilding?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 16560, "name": "American Civil Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Civil_Religion?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 18297, "name": "Free Will", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_Will?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 24347, "name": "Creationism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creationism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 26548, "name": "Religious Persecution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Persecution?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 27131, "name": "Civil Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Religion?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 30899, "name": "Religion and Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Economics?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 60619, "name": "Kingdom of God", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kingdom_of_God?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 71227, "name": "Sabbath", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabbath?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 86169, "name": "Social Gospel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Gospel?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 160167, "name": "War and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_and_Religion?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 226038, "name": "Spiritual Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spiritual_Authority?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 236869, "name": "Inerrancy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inerrancy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 238421, "name": "Sabbateanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabbateanism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 281939, "name": "Sabbatianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabbatianism?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 341213, "name": "Religious Freedom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Freedom?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 538525, "name": "Theology and religion and Civil Rights Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology_and_religion_and_Civil_Rights_Movement?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1403633, "name": "Family Breakdown and Family Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Breakdown_and_Family_Policy?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 11243176, "title": "The Problem with Inerrancy", "created_at": "2015-03-03T16:58:59.008-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11243176/The_Problem_with_Inerrancy?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_11243176", "summary": "Talk of Inerrancy in many circles is like a currency in their realm.

In the twenties and thirties of the twentieth century, Dalton education was spread throughout the world. There was Dalton education in America, England, Germany, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, India, China and Japan. Particularly in the Netherlands and Japan, Dalton education has remained in existence. In recent years there has been a revival of international interest. It crops up again, for instance, in England, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Poland and China.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlands is the country with the highest density of Dalton schools. At the moment there are four hundred, three hundred and seventy of which are elementary schools. Comprising five percent of all elementary schools, Dalton education is by far the largest educational reform movement in the Netherlands. And, contrary to Montessori, Jena Plan and Waldorf education, it is steadily on the increase: approximately one hundred schools have been founded in the past five years. The only Dalton school in America, is the school that Helen Parkhurst founded herself in 1919, and which she was subsequently to direct for more than twenty years: the Dalton School in New York. It is a renowned school. But its fame is not due to its origins as an experiment in progressive education. The Dalton School is the second most expensive private school in New York.\r\n\r\nWe begin with an account of the original practice and theory of the Dalton Plan. The first chapter is mostly historical: a concise reconstruction of the history of the development of the Dalton Plan. The second chapter characterizes the theory of the Dalton Plan based upon our interpretation of texts written by Parkhurst.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36620992, "asset_id": 10757644,

But what is really happening for some of these parents when they try to gain and maintain an appropriate education for their child in these mainstream contexts and beyond? What is the educational experience like for these families who are in the midst of this generational change from historical exclusion to inclusion? Current research indicates that while islands of excellent mainstream inclusive practice do exist the educational experience for many students on the autism spectrum can often be one of hostility, inconsistency and unreliability. Without appropriate understanding of best practice educational methods, these students can present an inordinate educational challenge to both parents and educators alike. How do parents deal with such complex educational profiles? How do they continue to maximize their children\u2019s development over time? What are the barriers that hinder their quest? What are the facilitators that help their quest? To answer these questions, this book provides an in-depth, recent examination of the real life journeys of families who attempted to gain an appropriate education for their children on the autism spectrum including the areas of diagnosis, early intervention, mainstream schooling, home education, segregated schooling and transition to work and further study.", "downloadable_attachments":

We are secular, feminist, egalitarians who believe in an open, just democratic society. We began homeschooling our two eldest children, ages 11 and 10, in 2010. We did so because we found the dominant K-12 school system to be undemocratic, dehumanizing, and too often antithetical to our chosen educational goals for our children: to cultivate creative, compassionate critical thinkers.\r\n\r\nNeither of us had seriously considered homeschooling our children until after we first enrolled our eldest daughter into kindergarten. The eventual decision to homeschool Charlotte and Julian was an organic decision, one that was inspired by listening to our children and taking their concerns seriously. This kind of \"radical\" act subjects one to the scorn of many adults. Like all marginalized and generally oppressed groups, children's desires, concerns and complaints are often ignored or, when heard, trivialized.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36298091, "asset_id": 8166958, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22557, "first_name": "Jeffrey", "last_name": "Nall", "domain_name": "irsc", "page_name": "JeffreyNall", "display_name": "Jeffrey Nall", "profile_url": "https://irsc.academia.edu/JeffreyNall?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22557/7555/97877546/s65_jeffrey.nall.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1601, "name": "Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5344, "name": "Paulo Freire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paulo_Freire?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8144, "name": "School Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Psychology?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 25701, "name": "Progressive Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Progressive_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 45298, "name": "Education, education system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_education_system?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 55335, "name": "Bell Hooks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bell_Hooks?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 83247, "name": "Homeschooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 91916, "name": "School", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 115919, "name": "K-12 Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/K-12_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 171230, "name": "John Holt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Holt?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 7980738, "title": "Conceptions of Justice and Respect in Moral Education", "created_at": "2014-08-15T00:21:19.109-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7980738/Conceptions_of_Justice_and_Respect_in_Moral_Education?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_7980738", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44769868, "asset_id": 7980738, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9369819, "first_name": "W.

A leading goal of the collection is to carve out phenomenological dimensions within psychoanalysis and, equally, to carve out psychoanalytical dimensions within phenomenology. \n\nThe book examines the nature of unconsciousness and the role it plays in structuring our sense of self. It also looks at the extent to which the unconscious marks the body as it functions outside of experience as well as manifests itself in experience.  In addition, the book explores the relationship between unconsciousness and language, particularly if unconsciousness exists prior to language or if the concept can only be understood through speech. \n\nThe collection includes contributions from leading scholars, each of whom grounds their investigations in a nuanced mastery of the traditional voices of their fields. These contributors provide diverse viewpoints that challenge both the phenomenological and psychoanalytical traditions in their relation to unconsciousness.\"\n\nWith Dermot Moran, Alexander Schnell, Emmanuel de Saint Aubert, Timothy Mooney, James Phillips, Doroth\u00e9e Legrand, Francois Raffoul, Joseph Cohen, Drew Dalton, Dylan Trigg, Thamy Ayouch, Dieter Lohmar, Line Ryberg Ingerslev, Nataille Depraz, and Alphonso Lingis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52085355, "asset_id": 6648979, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42977, "first_name": "Dylan", "last_name": "Trigg", "domain_name": "univie", "page_name": "DylanTrigg", "display_name": "Dylan Trigg", "profile_url": "https://univie.academia.edu/DylanTrigg?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42977/13884/3748670/s65_dylan.trigg.jpg"}, {"id": 4673662, "first_name": "Doroth\u00e9e", "last_name": "Legrand", "domain_name": "ens", "page_name": "Doroth\u00e9eLegrand", "display_name": "Doroth\u00e9e Legrand", "profile_url": "https://ens.academia.edu/Doroth%C3%A9eLegrand?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4673662/5478210/6244469/s65_doroth_e.legrand.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 244, "name": "Psychoanalysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychoanalysis?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3508, "name": "Philosophy of Psychoanalysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Psychoanalysis?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5178, "name": "Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8024, "name": "Psychology of Unconscious", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology_of_Unconscious?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8338, "name": "Jacques Lacan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Lacan?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 8411, "name": "\u00c9mmanuel L\u00e9vinas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%C3%89mmanuel_L%C3%A9vinas?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 8418, "name": "Maurice Merleau-Ponty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 8436, "name": "Edmund Husserl", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edmund_Husserl?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 8437, "name": "Martin Heidegger", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Martin_Heidegger?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 14414, "name": "Philosophy of Psychopathology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Psychopathology?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 14617, "name": "Phenomenology of the body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_the_body?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 964578, "name": "Unconsciousness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unconsciousness?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 6605716, "title": "Vitale, John L.

At the same time, anarchists have developed very different political imaginations than Marxists, where the importance of pedagogy has always been of primary importance. Pedagogy accordingly represents one of the key sites of contact where anarchist geographies can continue to inform and revitalize contemporary geographical thought. Anarchists have long been committed to bottom-up, \u2018organic\u2019 transformations of societies, subjectivities, and modes of organizing. For anarchists the importance of direct action and prefigurative politics have always taken precedence over concerns about the state, a focus that stems back to Max Stirner\u2019s notion of insurrection in 'The Ego and Its Own' as walking one\u2019s own way, \u2018rising up\u2019 above government, religion, and other hierarchies, not necessarily to overthrow them, but to simply disregard these structures by taking control of one\u2019s own individual life and creating alternatives on the ground. Thus, the relevance of pedagogy to anarchist praxis (understood in a broad sense, as in Paulo Freire\u2019s 'Pedagogy of the Oppressed') stems from its ability to guide a new way of thinking about the world and as a space that is able to foster transgression.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59252748, "asset_id": 6326985, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

The reason for the disagreement is not injustice or abuse but seeing from different places with an incommensurability actively disallowing human sympathy, empathy, understanding, care and love. To see and not agree is a dangerous act. It has, as far as I can tell in this case of Domenic Johansson being removed from his parents in 2009, caused a tragic situation. To see and not agree ought to be a point of departure for dialogue and coming to common terms not a violence of one party against another. Home education is a key area where prejudice of an educational kind  - educationism - is strong. The Johanssons are victims of educationism.

Firstly there are the human and children's rights issues. The lack of care for the dignity of the person, the physical violence, the potential abuse because of power structures and so on. A perspective on compulsory schooling which performs like this is connected to schools as a social function in ways that emerge from within the failing aspects of the centre of the schooling enterprise. They are its shadow side but also perhaps its source of most hope. Secondly there is the law. In many countries schooling is not compulsory in any way. The UK and America are two countries where this reality has taken on a power and a life that begins - because of the growing numbers of home educators - to challenge the possibility of an assumption that education is schooling and to challenge also the philosophy that goes with it. Education alone is fairly compulsory these days. The mechanism by which that truth bears itself out varies and can vary. In countries where this \u201ctruth\u201d is not the case and it is schooling that is indeed compulsory, interesting factors contribute to that situation: in Germany the compulsory nature of schooling was enshrined in law by Adolf Hitler and has not been changed since. In Sweden where home education becomes close to impossible, complaints of the rise of the political far right temporally tally with complaints from parents who find their choice about educating their children diminishes to the point where the state is the educator of the child. And so we are back to human rights, but this time of parents. This chapter will examine the very idea of compulsory schooling from the point of view of an alternative world of education, where different rules apply. This will highlight the role of educational philosophy from and in an alternative education perspective.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34829875, "asset_id": 5042700, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4426, "first_name": "Helen E", "last_name": "Lees", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HelenELees", "display_name": "Helen E Lees", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HelenELees?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4426/1748/73178349/s65_helen_e.lees.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1003, "name": "Educational Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Technology?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1077, "name": "Educational Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Leadership?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1298, "name": "Alternative Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1601, "name": "Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1609, "name": "E-learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/E-learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 1763, "name": "Mobile Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3398, "name": "Educational Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Psychology?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 9306, "name": "Virtual Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_Schooling?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 12661, "name": "Alternative Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Pedagogy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 15869, "name": "Online Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 17612, "name": "Educational Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Philosophy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 18512, "name": "Inclusive Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inclusive_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 29486, "name": "Education Law (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Law_Education_?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 65733, "name": "Educational management and leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_management_and_leadership?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 95698, "name": "Truancy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Truancy?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 98941, "name": "Virtual Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_Learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 138580, "name": "Legal Education, Critical Pedagogy, Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_Education_Critical_Pedagogy_Law?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 238008, "name": "Home Education Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education_Regulation?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 257717, "name": "Elective Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elective_Home_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 365519, "name": "Compulsory Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Compulsory_Education?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 506856, "name": "Students Rights, Education, and the Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Students_Rights_Education_and_the_Law?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 693332, "name": "Impact of Truancy on Academic Achievement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Truancy_on_Academic_Achievement?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 931698, "name": "Open Distance Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Open_Distance_Learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 960095, "name": "Truancy Reduction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Truancy_Reduction?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 4761444, "title": "Effect of private tuition on achievement in science of secondary school pupils", "created_at": "2013-10-12T23:23:32.302-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4761444/Effect_of_private_tuition_on_achievement_in_science_of_secondary_school_pupils?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_4761444", "summary": "This study attempted to find out the Influence of private tuition on Achievement  in science among Secondary school pupils of Kerala .

Their intentions, as professors focused on cognition, was to create a change in teaching practices throughout the school that aligned more closely with social cognitive research. However, their experiences did not go as planned. Each found that he could not just simply bring their philosophies into their classrooms independent of the sociocultural context of the school. They found very quickly that none of them could act as fully autonomous agents. They described their experiences as being part of the sociocultural fabric of the school because each of their teaching practices changed in ways that they did not anticipate and in ways that were not philosophically aligned. However, they also found that this was a two-way relationship. They were not describing completely deterministic experiences. Davis and Sumara described observing colleagues changing their practices in ways that did incorporate some of the philosophies that they espoused during their tenure at the elementary school. They explain their experience as one where they were pushed and pulled by the sociocultural context and they also pushed and pulled on the sociocultural context. This dissertation focuses on three first-year science teachers (a 4 th grade teacher and two high school science teachers) who identified as wanting to bring critical, feminist, and ecojustice perspectives into their teaching practices. Each enacts these practices much differently in the context of the sociocultural contexts of their own schools, and often changed their teaching practices in ways that seemed to more closely align with those contexts. Each of the three dealt with external and internal hegemonic pressures that caused them to align more closely with their contexts. The philosophical foundations of their sociocultural contexts were manifested externally through technical controls (i.e. district-wide curriculum, state testing, district-wide common assessments, and state standards) and bureaucratic controls (i.e. mandates from administration that reinforce compliance to the technical controls) (Edwards, 1979; Irwin, 1996), sociocultural cues from administrators, colleagues, and students, and were made seemingly impenetrable via intensification, or high workloads that prevent reflective and critical thinking (Apple, 1988; Irwin, 1996). The internalized hegemonic pressures included their own feelings of internalized domination, surplus powerlessness (driven by feelings of isolation and self-blame) (Irwin, 1996; Lerner, 1986), and internalized dispositional views of their students (driven by feelings that their students were not capable of critical social thinking). Each of their case studies focus on how the philosophical differences between the first-year teachers and the sociocultural contexts contrasted providing constant tension for each of the three teachers in terms of their decision-making and their teaching practices. The technical controls seemed to be at the root of most of the external hegemonic pressures and even their internal hegemonic pressures. This paper will focus on the philosophical underpinnings of the state standards in science, the statewide tests, the district curricula, and district-wide common assessments that drove the teachers' practices. The philosophical foundations of their sociocultural contexts were: (1) knowledge as static and objectified, (2) curricular knowledge as the preferred knowledge, (3) standardized testing as a preferred method of gaining data about students' understandings of content, (4) uniform, decontextualized information as \"neutral\" facts and preferred knowledge, and (5) the summative view of 1-4 as a schooling process that produces learning that is preferred. The first-year teachers' philosophies together contrasted the philosophies of their sociocultural contexts. The first-year teachers held that: (1) knowledge has a deep connection with power in that knowledge is a construction of those in the dominant groups' views of reality, (2) knowledge is not static, but is a co-creative, continuous process, (3) knowledge is a contested terrain, (4) students should be offered the opportunities to explore the knowledge-power relationships, as well as act in their communities to disrupt social and ecological injustices, and (5) the summative view of 1-4 is their preferred view of the schooling process. This study describes how the three teachers responded to the hegemonic pressures of their sociocultural contexts in the form of technical and bureaucratic controls as well as the amplified messages from their colleagues, administrators, and students. This study also describes their own internalized feelings of fear, isolation, and a sense of not being able to make change in their schools. This study focuses on the complex experience of each of the three teachers as they struggle to exert their agency in a context where the ideology is clearly opposed to their own.

During the past two centuries, Thailand has faced a progression of events threatening its self-definition requiring very conscious educational and cultural reform policies to offset the advances of globalized movements. The first series of reforms began to take place in the late 19th century and served as a defensive measure to fend off the onslaught of European colonial activity and to unify a disjointed society. This reform was used to primarily centralize the cultural and religious authority and power of the kingdom, while assimilating the local/regional/rural areas through education. The most recent reform in late 20th century was devised to fend off global market forces and to unify a disjointed society through a strategy of decentralization and educational reform. Both these reforms were countered with strong resistance movements that reflect a resistance heritage that aspires to civil society.\r\n\r\nThis chapter examines some of the similarities of the past two eras of globalization in Thailand, their reforms, and how assimilation and extensive revisions to the cultural and spiritual elements of Thai society have provoked resistance movements. This chapter also suggests that the current alternative education movement in Thailand belongs to this heritage of resistance to national and international hegemony and envisions an inclusive and moral society that is attempting to prepare its citizens for a future in the globalized world. In that Thailand has invaluable experience dealing with the global and maintaining its independence, its story may be instructive for other developing countries as globalization will surely continue its unfoldment as will humanity\u2019s movement toward a civic world.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30630896, "asset_id": 2628932, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

issues around elective home education (EHE- also known as home schooling) discovery, which for too long have been unnecessarily problematic. Three theoretical frames using Kuhn, Foucault and Hirschman, and a policy framework for assessing discovery motivations are offered to contribute to increased understanding of the difference of EHE. An educational philosophy of EHE is developed. \u201cEducationism\u201d is presented as a term describing a widespread form of educational prejudice operating against the marginality of alternatives such as EHE and thorough-going democratic schooling. Empirical data extracts from a street survey and from in-depth interviews with adults who have discovered an educational alternative to mainstream schooling attendance are used. These show surprising and even shocking insights into the extent to which education is blindly conflated with schooling: finding out that schooling is not the only pathway for education to occur can cause wholesale revelation and personal transformation of the social, political, familial, financial and ethical. Unmet needs of parents to have information about alternative educational pathways are highlighted. Ignorance of professionals about EHE difference and a need for greater training is raised. The issues discussed have wide ranging implications for the concept of education and for the conduct of educational studies around the world. A reconfiguration of how education is structurally organised is suggested: from one field with educational marginalia to multiple equal paradigms of practice. The rise of technology is seen as a key factor in a reconfigured educational studies and increased discovery of EHE as option.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31213505, "asset_id": 2155256,

Finally, the author discusses several implications from the interview data, arguing that, though the home-schooled study participants demonstrated they could adjust smoothly to the literacy expectations of the university, faculty need to temper their enthusiasm for transforming these students' social values as well as their commitment to the college community.

While parents and the state both have roles in childhood development, the difficulty is finding the proper balance. Lawmakers must decide who should determine exposure of children to new and different ideas. Arguments that limit exposure to ideas should be pursued with the good of a child as the desired end, and not the means to some other end. These arguments fall into two categories: negative arguments and affirmative arguments. Affirmative arguments are less likely to be made with ulterior motives in mind. In the spirit of legal perfectionism, lawmakers have the obligation to make laws for the good of children, and these laws must keep the proper balance between the responsibilities of parents and the state.\r\n\r\nApplying the model of Ian Shapiro, a political scientist, the state is responsible for a child\u2019s basic interests and the parent is responsible for the child\u2019s best interests. Basic interests can be viewed as those interests attributable to all children, rather than best interests, which can be seen as unique to the individual child. The state is obliged to provide children with a quality education, where they can be exposed to new ideas and values. This is a basic interest for all children and will allow for success in the adult world. Parents do not have the right to keep children in intellectual slavery. A parent cannot, for example, keep a child from knowledge of evolutionary biology or the germ theory of disease, because of the parents\u2019 hope for the child\u2019s future religious preference that would contradict the child\u2019s basic interest. Instead, parents should expose children to various new and different perspectives, even if they feel it is in the best interest of the child to rebut these views.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

To\r\nsee whether this is so, we introduce the concept of \u2018attentive parenting\u2019, which\r\nencompasses a set of family characteristics, and we examine whether and under\r\nwhat conditions attentive parents risk loss of intimacy by sending their children\r\nto school; or, alternatively, whether they can avoid this risk by educating children\r\nat home. What we will determine is whether families who exhibit the specified\r\ncharacteristics are prima facie justified in educating their children at home under\r\nthe conditions of interest.

Seventeen educational professionals described their experiences with transitioning home educated students.  Students were evaluated as having strong to excellent academic abilities and good to excellent social skills.  The few academic problems identified in transitioning home educated students were linked to recognised learning difficulties while the social problems of a few students were linked by professionals to difficult family situations and family itinerancy rather than to the practice of home education.  The findings indicate that professionals were frequently unaware of a number of key factors related to student transitions into mainstream institutions, including student histories prior to entrance into mainstream institutions, the curriculum used by home educated students and how these were similar or different to curriculum used in their institutions.  Because professionals were also frequently unaware of parent reasons for home educating students, reasons for entering students into mainstream institutions, and student involvement in the decision to make these transitions, it is argued that more care and consideration be given to support these students in their transition into mainstream institutions.  In order to ensure positive transition experiences for home educated students, this paper recommends proactive use of existing school transition programs in conjunction with a clearer understanding of the culture of home education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 837100, "asset_id": 224922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 117275, "first_name": "Glenda", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GlendaJackson", "display_name": "Glenda Jackson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GlendaJackson?f_ri=1299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/117275/609021/8260351/s65_glenda.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1299, "name": "Home Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Schooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15208, "name": "Home Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Education?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55704, "name": "Transition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transition?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83247, "name": "Homeschooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeschooling?f_ri=1299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 703276, "name": "Home Based Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Based_Learning?f_ri=1299"}, {"id": 985294, "name": "Teacher Perspectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Perspectives?f_ri=1299"}]}, {"id": 209223, "title": "Australian Home Education and Vygotskian Learning Theory", "created_at": "2010-01-19T05:30:50.571-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/209223/Australian_Home_Education_and_Vygotskian_Learning_Theory?f_ri=1299", "dom_id": "work_209223", "summary": "An analysis of \u2018Australian home education and Vygotskian learning theory\u2019 investigates the practices of Australian home educators in light of Vygotskian learning theory.
