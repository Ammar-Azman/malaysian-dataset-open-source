Yet, despite its seemingly 'transnational' nature, performance art practices often draw upon nationally-rooted notions of community, site, history, participation and presence. This presentation reflects upon two research projects which I have developed; my doctoral research on performance art histories through the lens of British South Asian diasporic identities in Britain since the 1960s, and my ongoing postdoctoral research on the post-World War II histories of 'performativity' in contemporary art of Southeast Asia. It compares and contrasts the methodologies used in these two research projects. In doing so, it hones in on several ensuing questions: where do the 'transnational' elements of performance art reside - in the works themselves or the biographies of the artists? To what ends have the notions of mobility, migration and exchange been privileged in the study of performance art? What are some of the idiosyncratic ways in which artists consciously deploy performance to position themselves across international and national aesthetics, as well as socio-political practices?", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2992294, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Bentcheva", "domain_name": "hausderkunst", "page_name": "EvaBentcheva", "display_name": "Eva Bentcheva", "profile_url": "https://hausderkunst.academia.edu/EvaBentcheva?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2992294/987598/32140715/s65_eva.bentcheva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5463, "name": "Performance Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 581561, "name": "Archives and Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archives_and_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 889693, "name": "Transnational Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 33291951, "title": "The Evolution of an Ancient Technology", "created_at": "2017-06-01T10:34:02.940-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33291951/The_Evolution_of_an_Ancient_Technology?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_33291951", "summary": "We investigate pattern and process in the transmission of traditional weaving cultures in East and Southeast Asia. Our investigation covers a range of scales, from the experiences of individual weavers ('micro') to the broad-scale patterns of loom technologies across the region ('macro'). Using published sources, we build an empirical model of cultural transmission (encompassing individual weavers, the household and the community), focussing on where cultural information resides and how it is replicated and how transmission errors are detected and eliminated. We compare this model with macro-level outcomes in the form of a new dataset of weaving loom technologies across a broad area of East and Southeast Asia. The lineages of technologies that we have uncovered display evidence for branching, hybridization (reticulation), stasis in some lineages, rapid change in others and the coexistence of both simple and complex forms. There are some striking parallels with biological evolution and information theory. There is sufficient detail and resolution in our findings to enable us to begin to critique theoretical models and assumptions that have been produced during the last few decades to describe the evolution of culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53787473, "asset_id": 33291951, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 511354, "first_name":

In: Cultural Exchanges in Monsoon Asia:  Andrea Acri , Roger Blench  and Alexandra Landmann (eds), ISEAS, Singapore.\r\n\r\nWeaving plays an important role in Asian cultures, both in the practical and symbolic spheres. In this paper I trace the weaving technologies of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) to their origins on the Asian mainland. A distinctive suite of technologies, including the body-tensioned loom, warp ikat and the tubular sarong, is found across a wide area. In ISEA it is associated with Austronesian speakers, and remnants of it are found on the mainland amongst Daic and Austroasiatic speakers. Significantly, it is absent on Taiwan, which (together with Hainan and parts of Laos and Vietnam) preserve an older form of the loom. I conclude that the weaving traditions of ISEA came directly from the mainland, rather than via Taiwan.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54847256, "asset_id": 9974664, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 511354, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Buckley", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "ChrisBuckley", "display_name": "Christopher D Buckley", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/ChrisBuckley?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/511354/178087/75121118/s65_christopher.buckley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2320, "name": "Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textiles?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 5256, "name": "History of Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Textiles?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 5602, "name": "Austronesian Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Languages?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 27026, "name": "Ancient Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Textiles?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 53227, "name": "Archaeology, Historical Archaeology.

Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde, no. 30, pages 221-239.\nThis chapter offers one reading of the Smithsonian\u2019s collections assembled by William Louis Abbott (1860-1936), focusing especially on Abbott\u2019s motivation as a collector, and the dialectic that developed between the collector (Abbott) and the collecting institution (Smithsonian). By drawing upon correspondence between Abbott and museum scientists, and upon Abbott\u2019s letters to his family, a portrait emerges of Abbott\u2019s self-imposed mission, his methods and criteria for selection, and the extent to which they corresponded to the needs and desires of a collecting institution. By placing Abbott and his collections in the context of museum (especially Smithsonian) anthropology from the 1890s to today, we discover why Abbott\u2019s collecting activity was so important to turn-of-the-century Smithsonian anthropologists. Yet we also find that his ethnological collections were later relatively neglected, due to the decline in the importance of material culture studies from which anthropology suffered until quite recently.

We hope to exchange ideas to create a better relationship and great opportunities in future.\n\nEspecially we focus on:\n\u2022 The communication of ideas that inform and drive artistic thinking and practice, using a careful and relevant selection of artists who use challenging and engaging materials, techniques and concepts to drive their output.\n\u2022 A focus on female artists and cross disciplinary practice will be foremost.

Vitally, this project aims to support dialogue, debate and the ways that Myanmar artists can construct and communicate their practices in challenging conditions. A key part of this is access to other global practices, and the building and nurturing of their networks. The memories we went through these years are hard to save and survive under the pandemics and coup at the same time, while we are dealing with global issues such as humanity, climate -change, refugees and so on. The moments of all art forms, in the shapes of rebellion and powerful responses using different mediums. The moment encourages a revolution and the social changes, until that happens is endurance a way of resistance?\n\nSincerely,\nOrganizer\nSOCA Art Project Myanmar", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

The information presented here adds to the relatively few 19th-century primary sources for the ethnography and music of southern Thailand.

in Khmer in 1961\n\n\"A New Sun Rises Over the Old Land\" traces the story of Sam, a young man who leaves the countryside for the capital after the death of his parents. In Phnom Penh, he suffers countless hardships and injustices as a cyclo driver. Sam\u2019s humanity is denied him at every turn in the city\u2019s capitalist society, leading to devastation for him and his wife, Soy.\n\nAs Cambodia develops and Sam\u2019s fortunes change, he realises that while life as a farmer is far from easy, it has the potential to bring fulfilment and happiness.\n\nFirst published in 1961, eight years after Cambodia gained independence from French colonial rule, Suon Sorin\u2019s novel is an iconic work of modern Khmer literature. A singularly illuminating historical document of the new nation, the novel offers a fresh view into a period of profound transformation in Cambodia.\n\nThis is one of the first English translations of a modern Khmer novel, and is accompanied by an extended introduction which situates Suon Sorin\u2019s work in its historical and artistic context.\n\n\"Many survivors of Norodom Sihanouk\u2019s time in power in Cambodia (1955\u20131970) refer to the era as a golden age \u2013 as it certainly was when it\u2019s compared with what came next. A New Sun Rises Over the Old Land has been deftly translated and introduced by Roger Nelson. Reading this passionate, absorbing novel, it\u2019s poignant to re-enter a period that was filled for many Cambodians with optimism, autonomy and self-respect.\"\n-- David Chandler, Emeritus Professor, Monash University\n\n\"Of value to researchers and diasporic Khmers alike, this is tragedy as Khmer tragedy comes, entangled in class violence, national pride, and hope.\"\n-- Prumsodun Ok, author, dancer and choreographer\n\nSuon Sorin was born in Battambang, Cambodia in 1930. \"A New Sun Rises Over the Old Land\" is his only known work of fiction, and was the best-selling novel of the 1960s.

I wrote the essay in Indonesian and English, and a separate posting has been made for the English edition.

But the Hague-based Raden Saleh expert, Dr Marie-Odette Scalliet, has kindly provided new information from Dutch colonial archive and published (Netherlands-Indies press) sources which has enabled me to check and correct many of these family traditions with evidence-based sources.

Taylor. This full book is uploaded here while the Smithsonian website, where it was published online, is being revised.] This study documents for the first time a group of artifacts whose meaning and significance have, until now, been inadequately understood by scholars, and sometimes even misunderstood by the recipients of the gifts themselves---the presidents and people of the United States. Yet for both Thais and Americans these gifts truly are historic, artistic, and scientific treasures, through which the Kings of Thailand represented their nation, and its alliances with America through time. Nearly all sets of gifts, from the courtly nielloware, silks, musical instruments and weapons to the everyday basketry, tools, agricultural samples and fish traps, were accompanied by a Royal Letter listing the contents of the gift (in Thai and English), and explaining its significance. This catalog introduces those Royal Letters and their lists, for the first time, into the interpretation of the gifts.

Ray is traditionally considered to be an auteur and a cultural icon \u2013 his legacy being on the fringes of popular mainstream Indian cinema. The specifics of sound practice and the nature of sonic experience in his films, however, remain largely under-explored. In this context, I argue that Ray\u2019s treatment of sound in his films highlights a recognition of listening to place by means of a keen observation and recording of the site in monaural synchronised sound practice, which has created a precedence for realistic auditory settings later championed by Indian filmmakers in the contemporary digital era. Investigating how Ray\u2019s use of ambient sounds contributes to establishing an auditory setting and to constructing a sense of reality in his films, this article suggests that Ray initiated a tradition of audiographic realism in Indian cinema, which had hitherto been predominantly vococentric since the coming of sound in the 1930s. By situating Ray\u2019s sound work within the longer trajectories of sound practice in Indian cinema, this article contributes more widely to the global histories of film sound, and illustrates the diverse threads and traditions that comprise monaural sound practices beyond the more commonly mapped territories of European and American film history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63174532, "asset_id": 35912044, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5664301, "first_name": "Budhaditya", "last_name": "Chattopadhyay", "domain_name": "digitallernen", "page_name": "BudhadityaChattopadhyay", "display_name": "Budhaditya Chattopadhyay", "profile_url": "https://digitallernen.academia.edu/BudhadityaChattopadhyay?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5664301/2462679/10091882/s65_budhaditya.chattopadhyay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1169, "name": "Sound and Image", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_and_Image?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2106, "name": "Film Sound", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Sound?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2601, "name": "Film Music And Sound", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Music_And_Sound?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6634, "name": "Soundscape Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscape_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7212, "name": "Sound studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 8088, "name": "Sound", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 12444, "name": "Film History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 15250, "name": "Synchronization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Synchronization?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 16487, "name": "Southeast Asian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Cinema?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 16987, "name": "Sound Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_Design?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 19258, "name": "Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 22400, "name": "Indian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Cinema?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 39323, "name": "Film Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Music?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 43631, "name": "Asian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Cinema?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 51923, "name": "Indian Film Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Film_Industry?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 52745, "name": "Cinema Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 58521, "name": "Sound Recording", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_Recording?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 70430, "name": "Sound design, using ambience as a tool to help create an emotional response in film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sound_design_using_ambience_as_a_tool_to_help_create_an_emotional_response_in_film?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 75942, "name": "Atmosphere", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atmosphere?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 89909, "name": "Satyajit Ray", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Satyajit_Ray?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 96208, "name": "Ambience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ambience?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 170908, "name": "Indian Cinema, Bollywood, Film Studies, South Asia, Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Cinema_Bollywood_Film_Studies_South_Asia_Media?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 196474, "name": "Monaural", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monaural?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 198193, "name": "Film Sound and Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Sound_and_Music?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 328269, "name": "Soundscapes Aural Architecture Urban Acoustic Environments Sensory Geography Public Art and Policy Concepts of Place Sense of place + place experience Place-making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soundscapes_Aural_Architecture_Urban_Acoustic_Environments_Sensory_Geography_Public_Art_and_Policy_C?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 387216, "name": "Early sound film;

Instead, we can say that beauty (aesthetics) follows function, because the aesthetic quality of an object helps it carry out its function. Traditional artists from throughout Indonesia have imbued functional objects - those made for purposes other than being aesthetically pleasing - with aesthetic value. Yet it is difficult to identify any traditional Indonesian object that was made solely as 'art ', that is: to elicit an aesthetic response. \r\n     Indonesia 's traditional artworks often embody remarkable aesthetic uses and modifications of materials, and today many are recognised as great works of art with high art-market values. Yet, deciding whether particular objects are 'works of art' (let alone separating 'art' from 'craft') is only problematic for art markets or museums. These questions do not correspond to the thinking that originally created the objects, and these distinctions have never been important to the artists.\r\n     Throughout Indonesia, we find strong emphasis on the divinely regulated or moral aspects of aesthetics and the notion that violation of these canons will negate the social function of the object. Rather than creating a functional object then adding decorations, the maker includes the decorations as fundamental elements of an object - the absence of which would impair its ability to function.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56781894, "asset_id": 36829967, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 808, "name": "Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16903, "name": "Traditional Crafts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Crafts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 25370, "name": "Contemporary Indigenous Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Indigenous_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 29906, "name": "Craft Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Craft_Theory?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 36130, "name": "Prehistoric And Tribal Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_And_Tribal_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 43613, "name": "Craft", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Craft?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 53409, "name": "Arts and Crafts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_and_Crafts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 65038, "name": "Tribal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tribal_studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 250543, "name": "Primitive Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primitive_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 475178, "name": "Anthropology of Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Aesthetics?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1000113, "name": "Indigenous Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Visual_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 38734700, "title": "Fragile Traditions: Indonesian Art in Jeopardy", "created_at": "2019-04-07T12:59:30.763-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38734700/Fragile_Traditions_Indonesian_Art_in_Jeopardy?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_38734700", "summary": "This volume brings together a unique group of case studies about several endangered forms of Indonesian art. The essays assess the effects on this artistic heritage of certain national and international phenomena , especially the primitive art market and various kinds of private and institutional collecting. The authors, who have extensive experience in Indonesian communities, find that many vibrant art traditions in this region are threatened by these forces. Collections of indigenous art and material culture have always been recognized as sources of information about the people who produced the objects. Increasingly, collections and collecting institutions are also being analyzed as expressions of the cultural presumptions of the societies that are marketing or assembling the collections. This book, by contrast, investigates the effects of the market in collectible art on the small, indigenous communities where traditional artworks are produced.

regions in the so-called outer islands: Nias, the Batak and the Lampung regions of Sumatra, Sulawesi (Celebes), Kalimantan, the Lesser Sundas (Nusa Tenggara), the South-east Moluccas, and Irian Jaya (West Irian). Relatively unknown in the West, the outer islands include all of Indonesia's islands except Java (including nearby Madura) and Bali, the better-known inner islands that border the Java sea. \r\n\r\nThrough the chapters of this book, the reader will travel from Nias in the far west to Irian Jaya in the east, encountering artworks that are exemplars of indigenous Indonesian aesthetics as well as masterpieces as defined by a Western collector's aesthetic. These works and the accompanying discussions will also introduce the peoples who produce them. Throughout this region, art links village life with the supernatural; it honors ancestors, cements alliances, affirms political power, social rank and kin relationships, and, of course, it simultaneously surrounds with beauty the peoples who create it. Yet each regional style presents topics and problems peculiar to it. The format of this presentation will allow readers to understand the similarity as well as the diversity, finding in the art of each region recurring themes and styles that reflect the closely related histories of the peoples and the similar purposes for which all Indonesians create art.\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\nNote:  Book is out of print; available from used-book dealers, e.g.: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&cm_sp=SearchF-_-home-_-Results&an=taylor&tn=beyond+the+java+sea&kn=&isbn=\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57080326, "asset_id": 36715193, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1386, "name": "Art Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Theory?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 55426, "name": "Maluku", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maluku?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 181544, "name": "Papua", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 188347, "name": "Sulawesi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sulawesi?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 220936, "name": "Nusa Tenggara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nusa_Tenggara?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 221325, "name": "Sumatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumatra?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 231304, "name": "Melanesian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melanesian_studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 604747, "name": "West Papua - Irian Jaya - Indigenous and Nationalistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Papua_-_Irian_Jaya_-_Indigenous_and_Nationalistic_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 862905, "name": "Modern Indonesian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Indonesian_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1522903, "name": "Dongson Bronze Drum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dongson_Bronze_Drum?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 44519091, "title": "Cultural Connections and Shared Origins between Camp\u0101 and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b: A Comparison of Common Artistic and Architectural Motifs, ca. 7th-10th Centuries ce", "created_at": "2020-11-17T07:56:10.312-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44519091/Cultural_Connections_and_Shared_Origins_between_Camp%C4%81_and_Dv%C4%81ravat%C4%AB_A_Comparison_of_Common_Artistic_and_Architectural_Motifs_ca_7th_10th_Centuries_ce?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_44519091", "summary": "This chapter contributes to our understanding of the regional connectedness of the Southeast Asian mainland by identifying networks that linked Camp\u0101 with the Dv\u0101ravat\u012b culture of central and northeast Thailand. Commonalities of decorative detail in architecture, sculpture and, in particular, sema stones are taken as evidence of direct contact between these two regions of the Southeast Asian mainland. Care is made to distinguish between shared motifs resulting from the common iconographic vocabulary originating from India, and patterns stemming from intra-regional links. In this respect, the rare quality of the artwork produced at sites in Camp\u0101 and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b indicates that the work was done by a single school of artists that travelled between them in search of patronage and employment. Routes of travel are identified on this basis, particularly those that cross the Lao B\u1ea3o pass and go through Muang Fa Daed (Kalasin province, northeast Thailand). Indeed, it is argued that Muang Fa Daed was the centre of an important intermediate territory located between Camp\u0101 and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b that had multiple and complex interactions with both, as well as the key regional centre of Champassak.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64961683, "asset_id": 44519091, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 429888, "name": "Champa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Champa?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 43093477, "title": "Kinship and Procreation in a Pyu Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin Stone Relief from \u015ar\u012bk\u1e63etra", "created_at": "2020-05-18T03:40:40.187-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43093477/Kinship_and_Procreation_in_a_Pyu_Vi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87u_Ananta%C5%9B%C4%81yin_Stone_Relief_from_%C5%9Ar%C4%ABk%E1%B9%A3etra?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_43093477", "summary": "This paper examines closely a stone relief carving found in 1919 at the Pyu city of \u015ar\u012bk\u1e63etra in Myanmar, which appears to be an unusual variant of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin iconographic type-the lotus stem germinating from the reclining Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's navel sprouts not one, but three lotus seats, with a recursion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u now flanked by Brahm\u0101 on the right and \u015aiva on the left.

Abstract: This paper examines closely a stone relief carving found in 1919 at the Pyu city of \u015ar\u012bk\u1e63etra in Myanmar, which appears to be an unusual variant of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin iconographic type-the lotus stem germinating from the reclining Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's navel sprouts not one, but three lotus seats, with a recursion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u now flanked by Brahm\u0101 on the right and \u015aiva on the left. Only six images depicting this iconographic variant of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin have been found in Myanmar. Taking to heart Elizabeth Moore's calls to complicate the \"ethnic and linguistic homogeneity of 'Pyu culture' [which] has become entrenched in Burmese archaeology,\" this paper seeks to suggest alternative ways of thinking about such Pyu art.

The portfolio also includes a journal essay, a book chapter, a profile essay and one curatorial text.\n\nAs a way of writing photography, documenting entails three trajectories: (a) ethnography and oral history, (b) archiving and mapping, and (c) Asian inter-referencing. It is a method that I developed to historicise, with equal care and concern, the multitude of photographic practices in Southeast Asia. It works against the binary of art versus photography, and the prevailing tendency towards a linear historiography in order to valorise a particular practice.\n\nAs a way of making work, documenting consists of three overlapping approaches: (1) documenting as looking and thinking, (2) documenting as cataloguing, and (3) documenting as world-making. It foregrounds the affect of the photographic encounter in which the photographer and the photographed person(s) meet to perform and experience their desires, which may or may not result in the making of photographs.\n\nTo put the proposition of documenting to use, I attempt a revisionist account of salon photography in Southeast Asia. Documenting as method allows me to surface the agency of individual practitioners without losing sight of salon photography\u2019s relationship with political power during the shifting processes of nationalism, decolonisation and cold war. It helps me foreground Chineseness, which intersected the nation-building process, as an additional factor in the praxis of salon photography.\n\nAs a way of making work, documenting offers a method for me to unpack the spectre of Chineseness through my photographic encounter with the Chinese Muslims in Indonesia.

Produced by the indigenous peoples of the many islands that make up this western Pacific region, the works in the Richman Collection were brought together over a period of twenty years.

The circumstances of the Visnu\u2019s rediscovery in the early 1950s, as well as its subsequent \u201crestoration\u201d and preservation at Wat Dong Sak, are examined through reappraisal of documentary evidence, new field reconnaissance, interviews of local residents, and systematic examination of the sculpture itself. Detailed stylistic analysis and conjectural reconstruction of the sculpture\u2019s original appearance place the image within the broader development of the mitred Visnu iconographic type known from sites throughout Southeast Asia. With particular emphasis on the details of the headdress and garment, specific comparisons are made to related sculpture from Thailand, Arakan (Myanmar), Preangkorian Cambodia, and the Cham civilization of Vietnam. The Phong Tuek Visnu\u2019s idiosyncratic features and geographically dispersed stylistic relationships suggest a probable early 8th century date following the mid-to-late 7th century expansion of Khmer elites out of the Kampong Thom area of Cambodia. The Phong Tuek Visnu, therefore, provides valuable testimony of a particularly intense period of interactions spanning mainland Southeast Asia from Arakan in the west to central Vietnam in the east.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39258184, "asset_id": 13335906, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2116716, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Lavy", "domain_name": "hawaii", "page_name": "PaulLavy", "display_name": "Paul Lavy", "profile_url": "https://hawaii.academia.edu/PaulLavy?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2116716/1126242/4066700/s65_paul.lavy.jpg"}, {"id": 7366450, "first_name": "Wesley", "last_name": "Clarke", "domain_name": "ohio", "page_name": "WesleyClarke", "display_name": "Wesley S Clarke", "profile_url": "https://ohio.academia.edu/WesleyClarke?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7366450/10447110/11657149/s65_wesley.clarke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 147828, "name": "Art, Iconography and Religion (Hindu and Buddhist).", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Iconography_and_Religion_Hindu_and_Buddhist_?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 408818, "name": "Thailand archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 531926, "name": "Hindu art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 909261, "name": "Vaisnavism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vaisnavism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1209502, "name": "Dvaravati Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati_Period?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1807538, "name": "Preangkorian Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Preangkorian_Period?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 51392328, "title": "Identifying the transnational and transcultural aesthetics of Chinese diasporic art in Singapore : a study of Cheong Soo Pieng's works and experiences", "created_at": "2021-09-06T21:42:06.995-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51392328/Identifying_the_transnational_and_transcultural_aesthetics_of_Chinese_diasporic_art_in_Singapore_a_study_of_Cheong_Soo_Piengs_works_and_experiences?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_51392328", "summary": "This paper investigates Chinese diasporic modern art in Singapore through analysing Cheong Soo Pieng's (Xiamen, 1917 \u2014 Singapore, 1 July 1983) works and experiences before and after relocating from China to Singapore in 1946. Despite the extensive scholarship on the patterns of Chinese emigration and on the adaptation and behaviour of diasporic Chinese, there has been comparatively lesser attention directed to the examination of diasporic Chinese art practices globally, with existing research mainly focusing on diasporic Chinese contemporary art. Diasporic Chinese modern art globally remains overlooked, with only a few exceptions. The objective of this study is to consolidate the social, political and cultural complexities that diasporic Chinese artists have to navigate to forge their transcultural identities and transnational visual lexicons, and also to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Southeast Asian modern art history.\n\nThe history of art goes in tandem with the progress of society. The emphasis in this paper was to think about the epoch and the glocal circumstances in which an artwork was produced. Using the artist's travels as departure points, and then breaking the artist's oeuvre into thematic sections, while concurrently drawing in different social, political and cultural contexts, this three-pronged approach creates a structured and systematic methodology that can be utilised for the interdisciplinary study of Chinese diasporic art practices. \n\nUsing this approach, this study examines the multifaceted inspirations from which Cheong derived his imageries \u2014 Chinese, Japanese and Western painting aesthetics, Chinese oracle bond script, wayang kulit, different religions, motherhood, Po Mo splashed ink painting style, primordial chaos, colour field painting and geometricism. This inquiry demonstrates how Cheong merged various diverse influences to formulate his own hybrid identity. Adeptly navigating the complex intricacies of these influences enabled him to achieve a unique transnational and transcultural pictorial language.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69136586, "asset_id": 51392328, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 184194288, "first_name": "Anne", "last_name": "Goh", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "AnneGoh", "display_name": "Anne Goh", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/AnneGoh?f_ri=68573", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4404, "name": "Abstract Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abstract_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4950, "name": "Modern Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8228, "name": "Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20759, "name": "Abstraction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abstraction?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23769, "name": "Abstract Painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abstract_Painting?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 27025, "name": "18th-20th century Modern/Comtemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/18th-20th_century_Modern_Comtemporary_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 31591, "name": "Abstract Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abstract_Expressionism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 43804, "name": "Chinese contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_contemporary_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 83684, "name": "Abstract", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abstract?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 117463, "name": "Chinese Design and Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Design_and_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 209188, "name": "Chinese art history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_art_history?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 675173, "name": "Contemporary Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Chinese_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 798752, "name": "Chinese artists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_artists?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1991971, "name": "Singapore Modern Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Modern_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2502983, "name": "Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_diaspora_in_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2778006, "name": "Chinese contemporary artists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_contemporary_artists?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2797976, "name": "Singapore Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3692889, "name": "Cheong Soo Pieng", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cheong_Soo_Pieng?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 45511605, "title": "Claudio Cicuzza (ed.), Peter Skilling.

"summary": "The cultural sphere in Myanmar was for the past decades dominated by a rigid official discourse, still carved today, during a transitional period, in its unchanged, immobile institutional frame. Not only it is problematic being based on a former military regime\u2019s formulation, but it also lacks entire narrative layers, such as a definite artistic segment of the recent past. This absence uncovers the depth to which an intellectual imprint of a whole era has been blocked by censorship from accessing general awareness. Myanmar\u2019s current independent contemporary art scene developed underground on its own, rooted in this absent segment, and created an autonomous system to operate in. Through its artistic practices and infrastructure, it represents a genuine agenda coherent with the intrinsic cultural frame and context of Myanmar. The alternative discourse enabled by the scene, being a flexible, and inclusive site, is crucial for free expression, for building curiosity, but also for creating an open dialogue within society\u2019s diversity and for allowing narratives, that were consciously or unintentionally deleted by the official discourse, to (re)surface. The study reflects a hypothesis which understands the independent contemporary art scene as a mindful site enabling an alternative discourse within society and which contributes to the (re)definition and (re)access of absent artistic, and so cultural narratives, as well as to the maintaining of the art scene\u2019s integrity and continuity. As a result of the research, a mechanism of smart practices based on existing projects is offered as a reading tool for the site, also containing some specific suggestions for potential further development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60896930, "asset_id": 40617826, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18948600, "first_name": "Borb\u00e1la", "last_name": "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n", "domain_name": "ceu", "page_name": "Borb\u00e1laK\u00e1lm\u00e1n", "display_name": "Borb\u00e1la K\u00e1lm\u00e1n", "profile_url": "https://ceu.academia.edu/Borb%C3%A1laK%C3%A1lm%C3%A1n?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18948600/33979114/30052632/s65_borb_la.k_lm_n.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 445622, "name": "Curating contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating_contemporary_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 545153, "name": "Critical Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 74410628, "title": "Collecting the Arts of the Punjab: Art and Identity for the Sikh Diaspora in  Singapore and Beyond", "created_at": "2022-03-23T14:46:26.521-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74410628/Collecting_the_Arts_of_the_Punjab_Art_and_Identity_for_the_Sikh_Diaspora_in_Singapore_and_Beyond?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_74410628", "summary": "Citation: Collecting the Arts of the Punjab: Art and Identity for the Sikh Diaspora in Singapore and Beyond.

This loan, and the attention this exhibition is receiving in Singapore as well as internationally, are components of the growing international recognition of Sikh art, and the role it plays in diasporic Sikh communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83005117, "asset_id": 74410628, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19091, "name": "South Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 22151, "name": "Collecting (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collecting_Art_?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 24047, "name": "Indian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 26049, "name": "Sikh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sikh_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 199271, "name": "Punjab Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjab_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 43267831, "title": "DeCaroli & Lavy (eds.) 2020 - Across the South of Asia: A Volume in Honor of\nProfessor Robert L.

This mode of independent curating now constitutes an important base for exciting new research\u2014making use of diverse archives as well as other methodologies\u2014to study the often little-known histories of the region's modern arts, including its architecture, cinema, and photography. That such research is taking place in the context of independent contemporary curatorial practice is significant because it locates modern art history largely outside of large and state-funded institutions, including museums and universities, thus enabling the development and proliferation of art historical research in areas of Southeast Asia, including its mainland sub-regions, which have comparatively little funding and official infrastructure for the arts. This article explores the emerging practice of independent curating as (expanded) art history in Southeast Asia, through comparative discussion of three case studies: the Roung Kon Project in Phnom Penh, which researches histories of cinema in Cambodia; the Buddhist Archive of Photography in Luang Prabang, which researches histories of photography in Laos; and Spirit of Friendship in Ho Chi Minh City, which researches histories of artist groups in Vietnam.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63752175, "asset_id": 43445912, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

immediate aftermath of the death of Norodom Sihanouk on October 15, 2012, photographic portraits of the King-Father flooded the visual landscape of Cambodia. Photographs were displayed in public places and photo-montages were purchased and shared in markets, pagodas, and streets, and in the aterritorial spaces of the internet, particularly Facebook. The display of portraits of Sihanouk was not just a posthumous phenomenon; however, access to new photographic technologies radically altered the manufacture, sharing, and consumption of images. This article pays particular attention to the photo-posters of collected portraits that circumvented official channels, arguing that beyond just beautifying the king, these portraits became illustrative, didactic expressions of ideal leadership.

For Medalla and his colleagues, new developments in technology promised not only a shift in sculptural techniques and materials, but also a radical redefinition of art\u2019s imaginative integration into entirely new ecosystems, from the microscopic to the intergalactic. However, as with the most compelling articulations of futurism during the decade, Medalla\u2019s vision tampered the utopic charge of science fiction with a keen awareness of the material realities of the so-called \u2018developing\u2019 world from which he hailed. His projects concerned not only perceptual capacity, but also an ideological worldview: how to bridge the creative scientific outlook that marveled at new universes in nature with the instrumental approach to nature that drove developmentalist models of Third World progress? If Medalla deserves critical attention today, it is because he envisioned the technological turn in sculpture to be as vital to re-enchanting the world as to reconfiguring the orders by which the world was defined.

In it, Sharma writes of Singapore as \u2018a dangerously peaceful country\u2019, a country that touts the ways its highly engineered development takes place through ordered urbanization and rapid capital accumulation. Yet the seeds of this peace have germinated other, more painful affects, its urbanization and ostentatious prosperity creating fatalism, resentment and melancholy in their wake.\r\n\r\nThrough the works of twenty artists, Still Building suggests that this island country remains a knotty conundrum. For all its slick sophistication, the city remains in many ways a place and a culture that is under construction. While the official state narrative of how the country is shaped remains a pervasive influence, these artists have shown how urbanity is lived differently, that the social life of the city takes flight on paths the country cannot plan for.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 21802724, "asset_id": 1756913, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1675011, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Wee", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JasonWee", "display_name": "Jason Wee", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JasonWee?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1675011/580107/721065/s65_jason.wee.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 998282, "name": "Singapore Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 998284, "name": "Southeast Asia Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 998286, "name": "Singapore Film Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Film_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 998290, "name": "Southeast Asia Visualities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia_Visualities?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1005871, "name": "Singapore Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1005874, "name": "Art and Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_and_Urbanism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1005876, "name": "Art and the City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_and_the_City?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 42057679, "title": "BETWEEN TRADITION AND MODERNITY: WOMEN ARTISTS IN POST DOI MOI VIETNAM", "created_at": "2020-02-24T06:58:24.000-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42057679/BETWEEN_TRADITION_AND_MODERNITY_WOMEN_ARTISTS_IN_POST_DOI_MOI_VIETNAM?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_42057679", "summary": "This essay takes the form of an art-historical survey about Vietnamese women's representation in art from the early 20th century to post Doi Moi in the 1990s.

Nguyen\u2019s video, indirectly at least, gives this community a voice, and implicitly challenges Vietnam\u2019s policies towards such ethnic minorities, whose rights are often ignored. From a wider perspective, it explores the processes of remembrance and collective memory when a living culture is mythicized or locked down in museums.

A such, the artwork questions the role of the artists in today\u2019s society and their ability to reflect upon another culture, without exploiting or misreading it.

I begin by summarising references to Javanese presence in Ayutthaya and Bangkok in a range of primary and secondary sources. These confirm that, although located inland on a navigable river, Ayutthaya resembled the maritime city-states of the era. Drawing extensively on the work of Davisakd Puaksom, I consider the personalities and processes involved in the arrival, adoption, and adaption of the Javanese epic, Panji, best known in Thailand as Inao. Far from a cultural anomaly, I argue that Siam's Inao fetish is a reminder about the region's connectedness, and that Ayutthaya was strikingly similar to cosmopolitan Melaka.

But if Southeast Asia has firmed as a framework for organising contemporary art, it has not been favoured as a basis for interpreting or historicising it. As knowledge production in the region has surged, regionalism has waned. In this article, I review the historiography of Southeast Asian contemporary art to reveal a discontinuity between its pioneers, who were regionalists, and a new historicism whose premises are basically nationalist.

I discuss the art of Amron Omar (b. 1957) who,  since the 1980s, is widely regarded as one of Malaysia\u2019s most accomplished figurative artists, and Indonesia-born performance artist Melati Suryodarmo (b. 1969), who came to international prominence in the early 2000s. Through the unlikely coupling of Amron\u2019s and Suryodarmo\u2019s art, I explore how each artist \u2013 differently, but also similarly \u2013 negotiates the discomforting tension between the body and the self. In connecting the two artists, I also attend to unexplored methodological discomfort in developing contemporary Southeast Asian art history. This article challenges such epistemic discomfort, purposely invoking uncommon alignments to explore their generative potential for new readings of Southeast Asian art history and, therefore, help expand existing approaches and methods for engaging with Southeast Asian art, regionally.

I am honored to have been the curator of that collection since I \ufb01rst joined the Smithsonian in 1981. I hope also to convey here, to the readers of this newsletter, that there are many opportunities for students and other individuals to \ufb01nd out more about Smithsonian resources on Thailand\u2019s heritage, and even to become directly involved in the Smithsonian\u2019s programs for research and study of this topic through fellowships, internships, and in other ways. \r\n==================================================================\r\nSpecial issue of this widely distributed Embassy Newsletter, on STEAM education - that is, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) plus the Arts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59173124, "asset_id": 39050260, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 6093, "name": "Museum Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Education?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 11764, "name": "Internships (Active Learning)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internships_Active_Learning_?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 34545, "name": "Museum Collection history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Collection_history?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 50074, "name": "Ancient Seals and Sealings", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Seals_and_Sealings?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 52072, "name": "History of Collecting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Collecting?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 78350, "name": "Museum and Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_and_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 190128, "name": "Museum Collections (Research)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Collections_Research_?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 499449, "name": "Thai Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Study?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 38603383, "title": "The Bangkok Noir Movement - Christopher G.

The quantum world has a lesson: we must choose between measuring position and velocity of particle. Noir, for me, moves so fast, I can never nail down exactly where it is, where it has been or where it is going. It is a particle in motion smashing through the walls, consciousness and lives of people living in the City of Angels.\n\nEvery artistic movement is created by a group of writers, painters, photographers, filmmakers, and lyricists. While they mostly work in isolation from each other, they draw from the same material, and their creativity combines into a larger force than any one of them. In the case of the Bangkok Noir movement, the idea of a noir community started to take shape as these artistic individuals began to assemble in ever larger numbers about ten years ago. A number of factors, social and political, have come together to form a critical mass, allowing for the noir movement to not only take hold but to gain international attention. Mass media and mass tourism has helped to make the developmental changes into the kind of perfect storm that feeds the instability and insecurity that creates noir. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58678493, "asset_id": 38603383, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 716551, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Coles", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "ChrisColes", "display_name": "Chris Coles", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/ChrisColes?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/716551/243761/20873009/s65_chris.coles.jpg"}, {"id": 29348814, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Moore", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChristopherGMoore", "display_name": "Christopher G Moore", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChristopherGMoore?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29348814/8396737/9387891/s65_christopher.moore.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 199671, "name": "Bangkok", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 424747, "name": "Bangkok Noir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 536996, "name": "Noir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Noir?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3126733, "name": "Bangkok Noir Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir_Movement?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3172640, "name": "Christopher G.

The Ifugaos are wet-rice cultivators that have preserved the traditional culture better than any neighboring tribe of Northern Luzon, leave alone the lowlanders. They still practice dancing to the music of brass gongs \"gangha\". Despite the fact that the head-hunting is already out of use, ritual practices of the headhunting cycle have survived. In the cases of feud which still occur the Ifugaos use a sacred wooden gong \"balangbang\". The sound of this instrument is believed to trigger the new killings in the headhunting cycle. One can find in Ifugao such an idiosyncratic instrument as earth cither.\r\nPeter the Great Museum has a Jew's harp and three ritual clappers from Ifugao.\r\nThe Jew's harp \"bikong\" (N 2316-82) belongs to the collection of Ifugao objects collected by a missionary Mr.Turnball, purchased by the Museum in 1915. This type of Jew's harp is widely spread in the Philippines and in Indonesia. In Ifugao it is primarily used in courting, but also has a ritual use. It is regarded as an attribute of Halupe deities, most of which are the characters of the \"hudhud\", women's epic poetry.\r\nThree ritual or granary clappers \"palipal\" were collected by R.F.Barton (who worked in the Museum since 1930-1941) during his trip to Bitu, Ifugao in 1937. The clappers are used by dry-rice cultivators in planting. For the wet-rice cultivating population of Kiangan the clapper is an important a ritual instrument used in rice cycle rites.\r\nIn Ifugao mythology the clapper is connected with the deities of the Downstream Region, to whom the Ifugaos of old owe most of their rituals and skills. Interestingly enough, the clapper is to be found among the deities of winds, though it would be more natural to find some aerophone in the list. The Ifugao wording depicting the god of wind is very similar of that of the New Guinea Highlanders re sacred flutes. The Indonesian music instruments that combine the characteristics of aerophone and ideophone give a further hint towards the connection of the clapper and a flute.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37068660, "asset_id": 2973938, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2584335, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "V.

It focuses on the desire to travel and the experiences of being mobile in the mobile lives and works of Tintin Wulia (b. 1972) and an artist couple, Irwan Ahmett (b. 1975) and Tita Salina (b. 1973), hereinafter referred as a single entity as Ahmett Salina. Tintin\u2019s and Ahmett Salina\u2019s reasons to be always on the move are contingent on the globalization of contemporary art (both its market and discourse) as well as their personal history and individual aspirations. The subjects of this article seem to be stationed in what James Clifford called \u201ctransit lounge\u201d, a space in which translocal existences are \u201cdwelling in travel and submit their identities to \u2018routes\u2019 rather than \u2018roots\u2019 in a moving picture of a world that doesn\u2019t stand still\u201d.4 Clifford\u2019s image of a continually moving world runs parallel to the increase of mobility within the globalizing artworld. Here, travel and mobility performed by Tintin and Ahmett Salina are considered to have diasporic dimensions in their practices of displacement and interconnection with different cultural contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63488253, "asset_id": 43218917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6857076, "first_name": "Brigitta", "last_name": "Isabella", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BrigittaIsabella", "display_name": "Brigitta Isabella", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BrigittaIsabella?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6857076/3936788/14293702/s65_brigitta.isabella.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 261663, "name": "Indonesian contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_contemporary_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 40360873, "title": "Tradition and Pluralism in the New Age: the Ramakien Murals in the Temple of Emerald Buddha", "created_at": "2019-09-15T18:44:23.776-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40360873/Tradition_and_Pluralism_in_the_New_Age_the_Ramakien_Murals_in_the_Temple_of_Emerald_Buddha?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_40360873", "summary": "[Note: This paper is written in traditional Chinese]\n\tIn the corridor of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in the Grand Palace in Bangkok is the murals of Ramakien, which is the Thai version of Ramayana. The stories of Rama that Ramayana or Ramakien tells have gained tremendous popularity since its introduction to Thailand. Few people in Thailand would suspect why the images of this Hindu mythology occupy the entire corridor of a Buddhist temple. Besides the Ramakien Murals decorating the entire corridor, there are other visual elements of Ramakien in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Therefore, the Rama stories that belong to Hinduism must be significant in this royal Thai Buddhist temple, and its significance is worth further investigation.\n\tKingship and religions are closely related in Southeast Asia. Temples often occupy the prominent places in palaces. Very often these temples contain the images of Ramayana. The Ramayana relief in Angkor Wat is a well-known example. Thailand was once within the territory of the Khmer (Angkor) Empire and the culture of the former was much influenced by the latter. Angkorian architectural heritage can be seen in the palace structures of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. Ramayana stone relieves appear in these Angkor-influenced architectural remains. When it came to the late 18th century, Rama I established the Chakri Dynasty, compiled Ramakien, and commissioned the Ramakien Murals in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Although the elements of Ramayana have long embedded in Thai culture, for the Chakri Dynasty, making Ramakien stand out in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha might suggest strengthening kingship.\n\tThe Ramakien Murals have been repaired or repainted many times. Although the extant work may not be original, its artistic heritages can still be traced by analyzing it in current condition. By observing the Ramakien murals, one can easily see the influence from the West. This article suggests that the Western style and technique in the murals might come from 19th century British landscape painting. Besides Western influence, Thai domestic painting traditions are in the murals. Meanwhile, this article also suggests that Chinese influence is in the murals. Therefore, the Ramakien murals present a pluralistic cultural heritage in the inheritance of domestic artistic traditions and the exchanges with China and the West.\n\u6458\u8981\n\t\u570d\u7e5e\u6cf0\u570b\u66fc\u8c37\u5927\u7687\u5bae\u7389\u4f5b\u5bfa\u7684\u8ff4\u5eca\u4e0a\u7e6a\u6709\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u58c1\u756b\u3002\u300a\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u300b\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u6cf0\u570b\u7248\u7684\u300a\u7f85\u6469\u884d\u90a3\u300b\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u4eba\u7fc1\u7f85\u6469\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u5728\u6cf0\u570b\u5bb6\u55bb\u6236\u66c9\uff0c\u9bae\u5c11\u6709\u4eba\u61f7\u7591\u6b64\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u795e\u8a71\u6545\u4e8b\u5716\u50cf\u70ba\u4f55\u5145\u6eff\u4e00\u9593\u4f5b\u6559\u5bfa\u9662\u7684\u8ff4\u5eca\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u58c1\u756b\u88dd\u98fe\u6574\u500b\u8ff4\u5eca\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u7389\u4f5b\u5bfa\u5167\u9084\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u300a\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u300b\u7684\u8996\u89ba\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u898b\u5c6c\u65bc\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u7684\u300a\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u300b\u6545\u4e8b\u5728\u6b64\u4e00\u7687\u5bb6\u4f5b\u6559\u5bfa\u9662\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u3002\n\t\u6771\u5357\u4e9e\u7684\u738b\u6b0a\u8207\u5b97\u6559\u7dca\u5bc6\u7d50\u5408\uff0c\u795e\u5edf\u5e38\u662f\u7687\u5bae\u5167\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5efa\u7bc9\u3002\u6771\u5357\u4e9e\u7684\u5370\u5ea6\u6559\u795e\u5edf\u6642\u5e38\u53ef\u898b\u7f85\u6469\u884d\u90a3\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u5716\u50cf\uff0c\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u5433\u54e5\u5bfa\u7684\u7f85\u6469\u884d\u90a3\u6d6e\u96d5\u662f\u4e00\u8457\u540d\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002\u6cf0\u570b\u66fe\u70ba\u9ad8\u68c9\uff08\u5433\u54e5\uff09\u738b\u671d\u4e4b\u52e2\u529b\u7bc4\u570d\uff0c\u6587\u5316\u6df1\u53d7\u5176\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u7d20\u53ef\u6cf0\u8207\u5927\u57ce\u738b\u671d\u4e4b\u738b\u57ce\u5efa\u7bc9\u5747\u53ef\u898b\u5433\u54e5\u5efa\u7bc9\u50b3\u7d71\uff0c\u8a31\u591a\u53d7\u5433\u54e5\u5f71\u97ff\u7684\u5efa\u7bc9\u907a\u8de1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53ef\u898b\u7f85\u6469\u884d\u90a3\u6d6e\u96d5\u300218\u4e16\u7d00\u665a\u671f\u62c9\u746a\u4e00\u4e16\u5efa\u7acb\u537b\u514b\u91cc\u738b\u671d\uff1b\u7de8\u4fee\u6cf0\u570b\u7248\u7f85\u6469\u884d\u90a3\u300a\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u300b\uff1b\u4e26\u4e14\u65bc\u6574\u500b\u7389\u4f5b\u5bfa\u8ff4\u5eca\u5448\u73fe\u300a\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u300b\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u58c1\u756b\u3002\u50c5\u7ba1\u7f85\u6469\u884d\u90a3\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u65e9\u5df2\u6df1\u5165\u6cf0\u570b\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u537b\u514b\u91cc\u738b\u671d\u5728\u7389\u4f5b\u5bfa\u4e2d\u7a81\u986f\u300a\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u300b\uff0c\u6216\u8a31\u8207\u978f\u56fa\u738b\u6b0a\u6709\u95dc\u3002\n\t\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u58c1\u756b\u7d93\u904e\u591a\u6b21\u7684\u6574\u4fee\u8207\u91cd\u7e6a\uff0c\u96d6\u7136\u5df2\u7d93\u4e0d\u662f\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u907a\u8de1\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u53ef\u5f9e\u73fe\u5b58\u7684\u6a23\u8c8c\u63a8\u6572\u5176\u85dd\u8853\u7684\u6e90\u6d41\u3002\u89c0\u5bdf\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u58c1\u756b\uff0c\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u770b\u5230\u897f\u65b9\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8a8d\u70ba\u58c1\u756b\u4e0a\u7684\u897f\u65b9\u98a8\u683c\u8207\u6280\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f86\u81ea19\u4e16\u7d00\u82f1\u570b\u98a8\u666f\u756b\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u660e\u986f\u7684\u897f\u65b9\u5f71\u97ff\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6b64\u58c1\u756b\u4ecd\u53ef\u898b\u6cf0\u570b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u7e6a\u756b\u50b3\u7d71\uff0c\u540c\u6642\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e5f\u8a8d\u70ba\u6b64\u58c1\u756b\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u570b\u7e6a\u756b\u7684\u5f71\u97ff\u3002\u62c9\u746a\u5805\u58c1\u756b\u53ef\u8aaa\u898b\u8b49\u4e86\u66fc\u8c37\u5728\u85dd\u8853\u4e0a\u5c0d\u50b3\u7d71\u7684\u50b3\u627f\u4ee5\u53ca\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u3001\u897f\u65b9\u4e4b\u9593\u7684\u85dd\u8853\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u5448\u73fe\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u7684\u6587\u5316\u50b3\u7d71\u3002",

This study documents for the first time a group of artifacts whose meaning and significance have, until now, been inadequately understood by scholars, and sometimes even misunderstood by the recipients of the gifts themselves-the presidents and people of the United States. Yet for both Thais and Americans these gifts truly are historic, artistic, and scientific treasures, through which the Kings of Thailand represented their nation, and its alliances with America through time. Nearly all sets of gifts, from the courtly nielloware, silks, musical instruments and weapons to the everyday basketry, tools, agricultural samples and fish traps, were accompanied by a Royal Letter listing the contents of the gift (in Thai and English), and explaining its significance. This catalog introduces those Royal Letters and their lists, for the first time, into the interpretation of the gifts. This book will interest art-, social-, and diplomatic historians; anthropologists, linguists, and ethnomusicologists; students of Thai theater and culture; and all those who will appreciate the aesthetic quality of the gift objects or the very good stories those objects were meant to tell.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56726588, "asset_id": 36778580, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12785, "name": "History of International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Relations?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 924450, "name": "Thai Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 421661, "title": "One Year on the Scene: Contemporary Art in Indonesia", "created_at": "2011-01-24T23:11:44.376-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/421661/One_Year_on_the_Scene_Contemporary_Art_in_Indonesia?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_421661", "summary": "One Year on the Scene\nContemporary Art in Indonesia\n\nIndonesian Contemporary Art is an important feature of Indonesian identity and culture.

Bentley\nPublisher: Amsterdam University Press\nSeries: Visual & Material Culture, 1300-1700\n\nCombining strikingly new scholarship by art historians, historians, and ethnomusicologists, this interdisciplinary volume illuminates trade ties within East Asia, and from East Asia outwards, in the years 1550 to 1800. While not encyclopedic, the selected topics greatly advance our sense of this trade picture. Throughout the book, multi-part trade structures are excavated; the presence of European powers within the Asian trade nexus features as part of this narrative. Visual goods are highlighted, including lacquerwares, paintings, prints, musical instruments, textiles, ivory sculptures, unfired ceramic portrait figurines, and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian ceramic vessels. These essays underscore the significance of Asian industries producing multiples, and the rhetorical charge of these goods, shifting in meaning as they move. Everyday commodities are treated as well; for example, the trans-Pacific trade in contraband mercury, used in silver refinement, is spelled out in detail. Building reverberations between merchant networks, trade goods, and the look of the objects themselves, this richly-illustrated book brings to light the Asian trade engine powering the early modern visual cultures of East and Southeast Asia, the American colonies, and Europe.\n\nTable of contents: \nChapter One:  People and Things in Motion: The View from the East\nby Tamara H.

Also known as insular Southeast Asia, the region inconveniently crisscrosses many contemporary political boundaries. Its heartland lies in Indonesia, and indeed the Richman Collection is particularly rich in objects from Borneo and Sumatra. The same mountain chain that forms Sumatra's backbone dips under the sea as it crosses the unmarked border between Indonesia and India, then emerges farther north as the Nicobar and Andaman archipelagoes. Regional affinities also extend north of Indonesia throughout Southeast Asia's other great archipelagic nation, the Philippines, to the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan, and even to such mainland peoples as the Jorai of Vietnam and the peoples of the Naga hills in Assam, India.\r\n\r\nIsland Southeast Asia is the term increasingly used for the region that, in the earlier literature, was referred to as the Malay Archipelago, Indonesia, or Malaysia, in the broadest sense of those terms. The term Malay Archipelago was inadequate because Malays are only one of the region's hundreds of ethnic groups, and because Indonesia and Malaysia have now been adopted as names for nations. Island Southeast Asia has thus been increasingly accepted as a term for this culture area, even though it includes related mainland peoples as well. The region comprises one of the five standard parts of Oceania (the Pacific islands), the other four being Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Australia. The dual aspect of its identity is aptly expressed in its name, sprawled as it is within Oceania's island realm and yet historically in continuous contact with events and influences from the Asian mainland. The region minimally includes the modern nations of the Philippines, Indonesia (except Irian Jaya), Brunei, and the eastern part of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah). \r\n= = = = = = =\r\nNote: the full book is out of print but available online from the Metropolitan Museum of Art: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Art_of_Island_Southeast_Asia_The_Fred_and_Rita_Richman_Collection ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56792203, "asset_id": 36839339, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 25370, "name": "Contemporary Indigenous Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Indigenous_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 36130, "name": "Prehistoric And Tribal Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_And_Tribal_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 159045, "name": "Malaysian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 250543, "name": "Primitive Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primitive_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 539122, "name": "Philippine art and culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_art_and_culture?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 1933454, "title": "The Nanyang Artists: Eclectic expressions of the South Seas", "created_at": "2012-09-13T07:13:24.954-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1933454/The_Nanyang_Artists_Eclectic_expressions_of_the_South_Seas?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_1933454", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 27790084, "asset_id": 1933454, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2361333, "first_name": "Emelia", "last_name": "Ong", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "EmeliaOng", "display_name": "Emelia Ong", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/EmeliaOng?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2361333/744286/968877/s65_emelia.ong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 798751, "name": "Nanyang Artists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nanyang_Artists?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 798752, "name": "Chinese artists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_artists?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44466070, "title": "Searching for Sok : The Reamker of Khaol Master Pka Say", "created_at": "2020-11-09T21:00:38.543-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44466070/Searching_for_Sok_The_Reamker_of_Khaol_Master_Pka_Say?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_44466070", "summary": "Khaol, also romanized khol, is an all-male masked dance drama performing episodes from the Reamker, the Khmer version of the Ramayana.

Questions raised in those forums are often very rudimentary: how many women artists score a mention in the art history canon? How many works by women artists are in museum collections? How many women curators are there in the museum system? How many works by women artists are displayed in public spaces? Discussions on the position of women in art history and the production of knowledge within it never seem complete without those questions being posed. In Indonesia, debates on gender disparity in art history, especially in the Indonesian context, mostly occur in non-academic settings. Echoes of those deliberations hardly ever reach art academia, which should in reality bear most of the burden in broadening dialogue on gender issues in art. Indonesian artists often complain about the absence of specialised art history programs in art schools throughout the country. To make matters worse, there are not enough attempts to connect art history as a discipline with gender studies, something that should ideally be done collectively by educational institutions in Indonesia. This absence of institutional collaboration is the main reason why gender perspective is almost completely lacking in Indonesian art history. In the introduction to her book, Vision and difference: Feminism, femininity and the histories of art, Griselda Pollock puts forward one important question that we can use to kickstart a serious discussion on art and gender: will acknowledging more women artists in the art history canon automatically produce a more feminist art history? Pollock writes that women's studies should not be restricted to analysis of women's issues, but also put under the microscope social systems and ideologies-such as class and race-that perpetuate male domination over women in a world of unequal power relations between the sexes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62062549, "asset_id": 41938595, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

face of the Earth and in the history of the world. Until the late 1960\u2019s, Pattaya, about 70 miles southeast of Bangkok, was a sleepy fishing village.  Then the Vietnam War brought tens of thousands of young male American military personnel to a dozen or so bases in Thailand, including a large air base near Pattaya called U-Tapao. Always on the lookout for R&R entertainment, young American soldiers, airmen and sailors started hanging out at a few small beach bars in tiny Pattaya. Thais, who are very enterprenural and quick off the mark, immediately understood that more bars, clubs and girls for more young American soldiers, airmen and sailors meant more money. And so began Pattaya as a center for nightlife.  By the end of the Vietnam War, there were several hundred bars, clubs and \u201centertainment\u201d venues in Pattaya, mainly along Beach Road but also extending into a pedestrian-only area called Walking Street. After the war ended and the American soldiers, airmen and sailors disappeared, the era of Jumbo Jets and cheap air travel arrived. European, Australian and American men began arriving in Pattaya by the hundreds of thousands. More bars, clubs, \u201centertainment\u201d venues and more bargirls, ladyboys and even rentboys. And more money, a lot more money. Then the internet provided quick information and communication, ATM\u2019s provided endless cash, mobile phones became easy contact points and Viagra allowed for infinite desire. More hundreds of bars, clubs, \u201centertainment venues\u201d, hotels large and small. Then on top of the first wave of Europeans, Australians and Americans, hundreds of thousands of Japanese, Koreans, Taiwanese, Singaporeans. Then millions of Russians, followed by millions of Chinese, millions of Arabs, Iranians and finally, millions of South Asian males from India. Until Pattaya became the huge nightlife spectacle it is today with tens of thousands of bars, clubs and \u201centertainment\u201d venues, over ten million visitors per year and hundreds of thousands of sex workers to service them all. Mainly from Isan/NE Thailand but also from Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar. On a Friday night, there might be over a hundred thousand tourists, mainly male, just on Walking Street. From every country in Asia and every country on Earth. Neon density, high velocity, powerful audio systems playing dozens of overlapping music tracks. Cheap hotels, great food, tropical air, the beach, the Gulf of Thailand. And in every direction slim, cute, smiling girls, hungry ladyboys and rentboys.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60177757, "asset_id": 39965658, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 716551, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Coles", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "ChrisColes", "display_name": "Chris Coles", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/ChrisColes?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/716551/243761/20873009/s65_chris.coles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8601, "name": "German Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Expressionism?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22739, "name": "Sex Industry and Workers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_Industry_and_Workers?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 62098, "name": "Sex Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_Tourism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 81195, "name": "Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Expressionism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 123762, "name": "Nightlife", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nightlife?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 199671, "name": "Bangkok", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 993939, "name": "Chris Coles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chris_Coles?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1101251, "name": "German Expressionist Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Expressionist_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1542874, "name": "Nightlife Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nightlife_Tourism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2259021, "name": "Pattaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pattaya?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3126733, "name": "Bangkok Noir Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir_Movement?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3335158, "name": "Walking Street", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Walking_Street?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 39822565, "title": "\"Phnom Penh's Independence Monument and Vientiane's Patuxai\"", "created_at": "2019-07-14T22:44:27.813-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39822565/_Phnom_Penhs_Independence_Monument_and_Vientianes_Patuxai_?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_39822565", "summary": "\"Phnom Penh's Independence Monument and Vientiane's Patuxai: Complex Symbols of Postcolonial Nationhood in Cold War-Era Southeast Asia,\" by Roger Nelson.

The second section deals with the label of Abstract Expressionism/ist in relation to Malaysian painting. This entails a brief discussion of these terms in their Western cold war context, and further transformation in Malaysia.

It displaces the locus of cultural difference from highly Orientalized others located outside the metropolitan centers to diffuse populations dispersed across the globe\u201d (TCG, 368). Further, the \u201cdifferences between [Western] centers and [non-Western] margins\u201d are effaced, with non-Western subjection appearing \u201cas a market effect, rather than as the consequence of a Western political project\u201d (TCG, 369).\r\n\r\n\tThere is a risk, though, Coronil notes, that in the process of \u201creferring to capitalism by a single word (and in the singular) and attributing to it features that may give the impression that it is a bounded or self-willed entity, rather than as complex, contradictory, and heterogeneous process mobilized by the actions of innumerable social agents\u201d (TCG, 353).\r\n\r\n\tWhile Coronil\u2019s image of a West now dispersed into the globe is a cogent one, we must not allow this formulation to be so general that it loses its analytical usefulness. Not to inflect how various parts of the world relate and connect to capitalism now is indeed to make capitalism look like a \u201cself-willed entity\u201d and possibly even fails to let us see how \u201cinnumerable social agents\u201d respond to capitalist modernity as a complex phenomenon. Late capitalism may be propelling the world \u201ctoward ever more ever more immaterial domains\u201d under \u201cever more abstract forms of control,\u201d but the processes he writes about are not as \u201cabstract\u201d as he makes it out to be \u2014and neither do developing societies see their subjection as \u201cmerely\u201d a market effect, with their sense of (postcolonial) marginality or, for the more economically advanced, being semi-peripheral effaced.\r\n\r\n\tA number of East and Southeast Asian nations from the 1980s actually have benefited, we know, from the shift by the West into the globe, ranging from the capitalist mini-dragon Singapore to the not-quite-post-socialist Vietnam and, along with them, post-World Trade Organization China. They desire a continued or new part in the current global order. Such desires do not in themselves lead to a lessened sense of the present imperialist modality of domination\u2014even if such \u201cdomination\u201d now also requires some collusion from their \u201cvictims.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe economic and cultural dispersal of the West into the globe itself engenders new forms of cultural difference and production that can link various regional identities into what are (still) limited cosmopolitan versions of \u201cAsia\u201d that attempt to contend with their subordinate positions within what I will call the \u201cglobal West,\u201d and the cosmopolitan culture related with it. Western cosmopolitanism, it has been noted, \u201cis local while denying its own local character.\u201d Indeed, such cosmopolitanism serves \u201cas a relay for the center\u2019s values.\u201d  The values here naturally are the values of the Western metropole, urban centers with an intellectual and cultural predominance because of their wealth. The (now-defunct) East Asian Miracle gave some Asian urban centers the increased confidence that perhaps they could now be influentially cosmopolitan in the same way.\r\n\r\nThis essay will examine two Asian theater practitioners who have created \u201climited cosmopolitan\u201d versions of regional Asia that are connected to but simultaneously contend with the global West. They are Singapore\u2019s theater doyen, the late Kuo Pao Kun (1939-2002), and the rising intercultural theater director, Ong Keng Sen. Kuo\u2019s play, Descendants of the Eunuch Admiral (1995), written both in Mandarin-Chinese and English, worked to extend Singaporean cultural memory in the face of culturally fragmenting economic development by envisaging a fractured, non-statist Singapore-Asian and, indeed, global humanism, even as the playwright depicts the inescapability of servitude to the state and global markets. Ong directed the English-language version of Descendants in 1995 and 1996, and thereafter proceeded to direct a hugely ambitious \u201cintercultural\u201d Asian Lear project. In a way, Kuo\u2019s Descendants and intellectual reflections and Ong\u2019s self-conscious status as an Asian \u201cmodernized\u201d into speaking English as his native tongue enabled the Asian Lear that the Japan Foundation Asia Center (JFAC) produced in 1997 and 1999. JFAC financed its first play to the tune of U.S.$1.2 million as a way of conceiving a \u201cNew Asia\u201d out of various traditional Asian components. This was not a recapturing of a pre-modern past, but imagined a \u201cpresent moment of the past\u201d  and a \u201cmind of Asia\u201d more problematic than even T. S. Eliot\u2019s attempt at recuperating a war-fragmented \u201cmind of Europe.\u201d Producer Hata Yuki  wanted \u201cAsian artists to present a new direction for Asian theatre\u201d  and Ong, hailing from modernized and multi-ethnic Singapore, with the oldest official multicultural policy in the region, seemed the obvious choice to help show the way.\r\n\r\nThe relative success, challenges, or difficulties of such theatrical attempts to imagine such a cosmopolitan Asia must be considered within the already existing constraints of the logic of dispersed Western-now-globalized capitalist modernity in relation to culture. Lear\u2019s thrust, in particular, transpires within the desire of wealthier Asian nations to take their cultural place in the New World Order. While the production critically exceeds the instrumentalist logic of culture and race, as managed and homogenized by Singapore\u2019s People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) government in the interests of becoming modern, and also indicates some of the impasses in this statist identity politics, it does not subvert the state\u2019s identity strategies. Still, Lear is an intra-Asian (if not a South-South) rather than a North-South attempt to ground a pan-Asian space utilizing a cultural practice that tries to transcend national notions of collective memory and create cross-cultural connections. This means that while we should not think of the world in terms of the West and the Rest, neither should we think of it in any overtly direct way as \u201cthe West is all-in-all.\u201d Globalization dialectically fosters multiple cross-cultural and cross-border dialogues out \u201cthere\u201d by Asians within a potentially emerging Asian metropole in relation to the modern-capitalist part of the West inextricably in their midst.

Publics for art have been under-studied in this region, and rarely discussed in more nuanced terms than as being a \u2018general public\u2019 or \u2018ordinary people.\u2019 The essay argues for the need for an alternate vocabulary and terms of reference for thinking and speaking about the reception of art: one that is theoretically informed by and engaged with the multiplicity of discourses and publics in this part of the world. The essay provides a brief survey of the sangha\u2019s role in the development of modern art in Southeast Asia, as a constitutive agent in the articulation of modernity since the mid-nineteenth century, and then concentrates on the engagement of monks with contemporary art, since the 1990s. Key examples discussed include activities organised by Sa Sa Art Projects in Phnom Penh since 2010; the collection and programming of the Buddhist Archive of Photography in Luang Prabang; the practice of artist Orawan Arunrak since 2015; and the historiography of the Chiang Mai Social Installation and related festivals held during the 1990s. \n\nPublished in a special issue of World Art journal titled \"Contemporary Art Worlds and Art Publics in Southeast Asia\", guest edited by Michelle Antoinette and Francis Maravillas.

Published as part of the special issue \"Contemporary Art Worlds and Art Publics in Southeast Asia\" for World Art, coedited by Michelle Antoinette and Francis Maravillas. \n\nThis essay positions the rapidly changing field of contemporary art in Southeast Asia, and the shifting structure, dynamics and influence of the region's contemporary \u2018art worlds' and \u2018art publics\u2019. It seeks to open up new horizons and frameworks for understanding the particular character of art worlds and art publics in Southeast Asia by being especially attuned to the local contexts and histories of contemporary art in the region and their particular ecologies. We contend that while contemporary art worlds and art publics in Southeast Asia might bear similar structures and dynamics to contemporary art worlds and publics elsewhere, they are nevertheless indicative of culturally specific and localised developments. Indeed, the various past and present practices and mediation of art and its publics in the region are suggestive of the ways in which art worlds take on nuanced character and meaning in Southeast Asia, are diversely configured and imagined, and are multiply located and complexly interconnected. The worldliness of these practices are, moreover, indicative of the ways in which Southeast Asian artists continue to respond to the exigencies of the everyday and the political economy of survival in an increasingly challenging world.\n\nKeywords: Southeast Asian art, contemporary art, art worlds, art publics, regionalism, world-making", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64955331, "asset_id": 44514313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56956258, "first_name": "Dr Michelle", "last_name": "Antoinette", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "DrMichelleAntoinette", "display_name": "Dr Michelle Antoinette", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/DrMichelleAntoinette?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56956258/16482365/16829335/s65_dr_michelle.antoinette.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53583, "name": "Art Worlds", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Worlds?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 175825, "name": "Art and publics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_and_publics?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 508108, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1240986, "name": "Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1842019, "name": "Southeast Asian contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_contemporary_art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 43913771, "title": "Dhar, Parul Pandya, 2020. \"Art in Translation: Interpreting Icons and Narratives across the Indian Ocean,\"", "created_at": "2020-08-21T06:21:47.480-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43913771/Dhar_Parul_Pandya_2020_Art_in_Translation_Interpreting_Icons_and_Narratives_across_the_Indian_Ocean_?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_43913771", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67684942, "asset_id": 43913771, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 332132, "first_name": "Parul Pandya", "last_name": "Dhar", "domain_name": "du-in", "page_name": "ParulPandyaDhar", "display_name": "Parul Pandya  Dhar", "profile_url": "https://du-in.academia.edu/ParulPandyaDhar?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/332132/521279/29795141/s65_parul_pandya.dhar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7151, "name": "Connected History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Connected_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24047, "name": "Indian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2732479, "name": "Connected History of South and Southeast Asia, Historical Migration and Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Connected_History_of_South_and_Southeast_Asia_Historical_Migration_and_Diaspora?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 43487152, "title": "When Art was Political: Historicising Decolonisation and the Cold War in Southeast Asia through Curatorial Practice.

Focusing on shells and pearls exchanged within local and global networks, this monograph compares and connects Asian, in particular Chinese, and European practices of oceanic exploitation in the framework of a transcultural history of art with an understanding of maritime material culture as gendered. Perceiving the ocean as mother of all things, as womb and birthplace, Chinese and European artists and collectors exoticized and eroticized shells' shapes and surfaces. Defining China and Europe as spaces entangled with South and Southeast Asian sites of knowledge production, source and supply between 1500 and 1700, the book understands oceanic goods and maritime networks as transcending and subverting territorial and topographical boundaries. It also links the study of globally connected port cities to local ecologies of oceanic exploitation and creative practices.\n\nFor more info, see

In the first decade of post-Reformasi era, groups\nof Yogyakarta\u2019s street artists have been exploring street art as means for activating community\nengagement and political involvement. Alas, big corporations, with the blessings from the\nmunicipal authority, have devalued street art by co-opting it for vulgar advertising. Street wall-\n-the canvas of the commons\u2014becomes the site where the visual struggle of street artists\nagainst the commercialization of public infrastructure distinctly appears.\nBeyond the aesthetico-political resilience at play in the street walls of Yogyakarta,\nseveral artists groups and networks have also initiated performative interventions along the city\nstreets to provoke discussions around the massive construction of malls and hotels, which has\ncaused agrarian conflict and socio-environmental problems over the past decade. Some art\nprojects discussed in this paper are also noteworthy for creating spaces for critical knowledge\nproduction through history from below and alternative mapping methods in order to counter\nthe hegemonic vision of state-capitalist urban planning.\nThis paper attempts to ruminate on questions around the relationship between the\naesthetics and the politics of reclaiming public spaces by analyzing urban art practices in\nYogyakarta. In what ways art projects in urban setting reflect local social conditions two\ndecades after 1998 Reformasi? How does art community connect to other social forces in the \n12\non-going project of urbanity? What politics does the aesthetic ideology of urban art enable?\nWhat are the limitations and challenges of art practices that were shaped by the will for\nparticipatory democracy?\nMaking Use of Politics: Urban Poor Movement ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63488370, "asset_id": 43219038, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6857076, "first_name": "Brigitta", "last_name": "Isabella", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BrigittaIsabella", "display_name": "Brigitta Isabella", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BrigittaIsabella?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6857076/3936788/14293702/s65_brigitta.isabella.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16892, "name": "Street Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Street_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20868, "name": "Theory and Practice of Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_and_Practice_of_Visual_Arts?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 85471, "name": "Citizen participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizen_participation?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 104928, "name": "Yogyakarta", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yogyakarta?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 42414000, "title": "Layers of Cultural History in Monuments of Vientiane, Laos", "created_at": "2020-03-30T18:32:20.359-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42414000/Layers_of_Cultural_History_in_Monuments_of_Vientiane_Laos?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_42414000", "summary": "The feature attends to the elements of the cultural history of Laos as reflected in its monuments.

Ideas of modernizing nation, temporal palimpsest, the architecture of Buddhist-socialist cosmology, and elastic fantastic national time are annaounced in this short article ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62580709, "asset_id": 42414000, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62890533, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Koshcheeva", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "AnnaKoshcheeva", "display_name": "Anna Koshcheeva", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/AnnaKoshcheeva?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62890533/18472227/18433355/s65_anna.koscheeva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 54320, "name": "LAOS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LAOS?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 148028, "name": "Monuments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monuments?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 181377, "name": "Laos, southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 472947, "name": "Laos area studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_area_studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1126123, "name": "French Colonial History In Laos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Colonial_History_In_Laos?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1487747, "name": "History of Laos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Laos?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 40184346, "title": "Ada Apa Dengan Tengkorak", "created_at": "2019-08-27T02:04:02.474-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40184346/Ada_Apa_Dengan_Tengkorak?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_40184346", "summary": "Essay by Nur Hanim Khairuddin", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60407618, "asset_id": 40184346, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 116639670, "first_name": "Benjamin", "last_name": "Hampe", "domain_name": "uib", "page_name": "BenjaminHampe", "display_name": "Benjamin M Hampe", "profile_url": "https://uib.academia.edu/BenjaminHampe?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/116639670/30897134/28802351/s65_benjamin.hampe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11469, "name": "Curating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19161, "name": "Curatorial Studies and Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Studies_and_Practice?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22832, "name": "Curatorial Practice (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Practice_Art_?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81272, "name": "Curatorial Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Practice?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 159045, "name": "Malaysian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 445622, "name": "Curating contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating_contemporary_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1240986, "name": "Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1320361, "name": "Contemporary Malaysian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Malaysian_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 38616011, "title": "\"The Color of Noir\" -

Items from the collection were used to illustrate his History of Java (1817), and more would have been used in planned works which he did not live long enough to complete. This paper addresses his motivation for collecting, and the influences \u2013 political and personal - that may have affected this practice. \nRaffles\u2019 writing displays a genuine interest in the people and cultures of Java however, he was not obviously someone who collected purely for the thrill of collecting. He tended to collect systematically and with a purpose in mind. British political and scholarly competition with France and Holland played a part in his practice, as did his Enlightenment ideals and the prospect of future trade. Always influenced by brilliance in others, he was encouraged to collect (and translate) Malay manuscripts by the polyglot Dr John Leyden. From the naturalist Dr Thomas Horsefield he learned much about the collecting and accurate recording of specimens. The crushing of a possible rebellion through the sacking of the Yogyakarta kraton in June1812 led to the removal of many old manuscripts along with fine royal krises. His membership of the freemasons very likely also affected the depth of his interest in Hindu-Buddhist monuments, and he wanted to demonstrate through his acquisitions the antiquity and sophistication of Javanese culture. All these factors, combined with the effects of his family background, were to play a part in his collecting practice.\n\n\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58549008, "asset_id": 38482676, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23499994, "first_name": "Miranda", "last_name": "Bruce-Mitford", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "MirandaBruceMitford", "display_name": "Miranda Bruce-Mitford", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/MirandaBruceMitford?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23499994/24750473/23605390/s65_miranda.bruce-mitford.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 462033, "name": "Thomas Stamford Raffles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thomas_Stamford_Raffles?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3151058, "name": "the Raffles Collection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/the_Raffles_Collection?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 6243694, "title": "Review of \"Illuminating the Life of the Buddha.

This object had not been located during prior research about the Smithsonian\u2019s Thai royal gifts to the USA; Arts of Asia played a role in our recently finding it.\r\nGifted by the King of Siam (Thailand) to the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876, this large so-called \u201cRoyal Seal\u201d (as it was named in the original 1876 Exposition\u2019s gift lists) is made of lacquered wood with layers of gilded plating. It is in composition a very Western-style coat of arms, whose component elements, however, are all traditional Thai royal symbols. Its escutcheon\u2019s three subdivisions show Erawan, the three-headed elephant, a single elephant , and the crossed kris daggers, representing respectively central, northern, and southern Thailand. Above the shield are the seven-tiered royal umbrellas; below is a Pali motto sometimes translated \u201cUnity brings happiness\u201d. The elephant lion is seen on the royal seal\u2019s dexter side (on the left as we view it), while on the opposite (sinister) side is the king of lions. These mythical animals represent respectively the Ministry of Defence (military) and the Ministry of Interior within the royal government. \r\n*See publisher's website for information on purchasing full journal:  https://www.artsofasianet.com/back_issues/", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61542723, "asset_id": 41254840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4347, "name": "Pali literature & language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pali_literature_and_language?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 7063, "name": "History of Museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Museums?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 78350, "name": "Museum and Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_and_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 99127, "name": "Thai politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_politics?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 148083, "name": "World's Fairs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worlds_Fairs?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 204034, "name": "Sacred and divine kingship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sacred_and_divine_kingship?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 517050, "name": "Thai monarchy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_monarchy?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 40617602, "title": "\"A Unique Chinese Silver Vessel of the 17th Century\"", "created_at": "2019-10-14T06:38:28.413-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40617602/_A_Unique_Chinese_Silver_Vessel_of_the_17th_Century_?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_40617602", "summary": "Only in recent years has it emerged that highly sophisticated silver was produced in China for export to Europe as early as the 1680s, as documented in marked pieces (Peabody Essex Museum and very recently Versailles).

I analyse some short, independently made film and video works, each of which deals with minor (and/or obsolete) languages, and marginal identities, which have been suppressed in monolithic constructions of modern, national history. I focus on the subtitle as the site of a subversive play that not only undermines the hegemony of official-national language, but might also destabilize the transnational circuits and structures of exhibition in which such moving images increasingly circulate. With reference to anthropologically informed theories of mediation and Jacques Derrida\u2019s figure of the parergon, I\nhighlight how tactical translation and mistranslation operate at both formal and linguistic levels. Finally, in a detailed reading of Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s short film 'The Anthem' (2006), I explore the still more\nsubversive possibilities when the cinematic parergon itself is subjected to such formal re-framing. This essay was later revised as \u2018Unframing the Nation: Parergon and Radical Allegory\u2019 in David Teh, \u201cThai Art: Currencies of the Contemporary\u201d (Cambridge, MA and London: MIT Press, 2017).

Distorted, non-realistic, exaggerated colors, a little bit weird. And in the Bangkok Night, the girls in the bars are sometimes referred to as \u201cflowers\u201d and the men who are chasing them are sometimes referred to as \u201cbutterflies\u201d. By necessity, flowers are colorful and heavily scented. In order to better attract the bees, insects and butterflies they depend on for pollination and reproduction. Butterflies are also often very colorful and their color patterns are an important element in butterfly male-female attraction and stimulating the urge to reproduce. Both flowers and butterflies have relatively short lifespans so the urgency of attraction, pollination and reproduction is at the forefront of their daily existence. Humans put a high value on flowers, despite their transient nature, using them around births, marriages, deaths, Valentine\u2019s Day and Spring Fertility holidays like Easter.

artistic practices after the Second World War, Fluxus emerged in the 1960s comprising a diverse and dispersed international community of artists. Their works were bound by creative exchanges of found objects, mail art and instruction-based performances open to re-enactments by others. While Fluxus activities have been extensively studied in relation to Western Europe, North America and East Asia, this paper argues that Fluxus 'resonances', or parallel developments in practices and concepts, may be charted within Southeast Asian visual art and performative practices since the 1960s. Seen alongside Fluxus resonances across Latin America and Eastern Europe, a study of Fluxus in Southeast Asia reveals a performative 'translation' of ideas and practices which continue to survive in the work of artists such as Philippines-based Judy Freya Sibayan.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84073328, "asset_id": 76333884, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2992294, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Bentcheva", "domain_name": "hausderkunst", "page_name": "EvaBentcheva", "display_name": "Eva Bentcheva", "profile_url": "https://hausderkunst.academia.edu/EvaBentcheva?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2992294/987598/32140715/s65_eva.bentcheva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5463, "name": "Performance Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6013, "name": "Performativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performativity?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12701, "name": "Fluxus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fluxus?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 51218317, "title": "Curatorial essay | BAGYI AUNG SOE (1923\u20131990): Juggling Paradoxes in the Here & the Now", "created_at": "2021-09-03T19:09:50.215-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51218317/Curatorial_essay_BAGYI_AUNG_SOE_1923_1990_Juggling_Paradoxes_in_the_Here_and_the_Now?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_51218317", "summary": "https://readymag.com/bagyiaungsoe/essai/\r\nAlong with \u201cModern Burmese Painting According to Bagyi Aung Soe\u201d from the Journal of Burma Studies (2005/06) and a selection of texts by the artist, this essay \u201cBAGYI AUNG SOE (1923\u20131990): Juggling Paradoxes in the Here & the Now\u201d was intended for the publication accompanying the exhibition, BAGYI AUNG SOE (1923\u20131990), scheduled at Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne - Centre Pompidou in Galerie 0 from December 2020 to February 2021. The exhibition was rescheduled to February 10 \u2013 May 3, 2021 [and extended till August 23, 2021] due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with various setbacks thwarting the realisation of the anticipated publication. Independently of the exhibition\u2019s hosting institution, a decision was made to electronically publish this curatorial essay for four reasons: in line with Bagyi Aung Soe\u2019s credo, to make widely accessible this text on the appreciation and legacy of his practice and oeuvre three decades after his passing; to spur reflection, discussion and further research; to register this exhibition marking a milestone in the history of modern Burmese art with which Aung Soe\u2019s life and work is intertwined; and finally, to explore new possibilities of knowledge-making via alternative publishing with fellow students of art and art history: Issa Sng Yi Xian, Toby Wu and Zune Ei Htet. This essay includes images of works and documents other than the exhibition\u2019s selection numbering more than three hundred.

It covers a period of expanding networks and cross-cultural encounters from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. \n\nThe book examines the distinctiveness of these shrines, and highlights their interconnections, and their role in social integration in South and Southeast Asia. By drawing on data from shipwreck sites, the author elaborates on the material and religious intersections and transmissions between cultures across the seas. Many of these coastal shrines survived into the colonial period when they came to be admired for their aesthetic value as \u2018monuments\u2019. As nation states of the region became independent, these shrines were often inscribed on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List on account of their Outstanding Universal Values. The book argues that in the 21st century there is a need to promote the cultural connectivity of the past as transnational heritage on UNESCO\u2019s global platform to preserve and protect our shared heritage.   \n\nThe volume will be essential reading for academics and researchers of archaeology, anthropology, museum and heritage studies, history of South and Southeast Asia, religious studies, cultural studies, and Asian studies.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63989751, "asset_id": 43687098, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10104, "name": "Ancient Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Religion?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12381, "name": "Indian ancient history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_ancient_history?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 24057, "name": "Indian Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Culture?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 974836, "name": "Ancient Indian Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Indian_Religion?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 43401335, "title": "Matters of life and death", "created_at": "2020-06-21T17:06:54.408-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43401335/Matters_of_life_and_death?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_43401335", "summary": "'The living need light the dead need music' was produced by The Propeller Group for Prospect, New Orleans Triennial in 2014.

Not exactly shining examples of First World bliss, they are often grotesquely overweight, dressed in a shabby assortment of sweat stained t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops, and weighted down with knapsacks, cameras and shopping bags filled with worthless knick knacks. Many of them are drunk and jetlagged, their faces showing the pain of unfulfilled and despairing lives.What these First World Ambassadors are looking for in the primordial mire of Patpong is an indecipherable mystery, even to themselves. As for the Thais, Patpong\u2019s simply a place to work and make money. No matter how strange and shoddy the endless river of foreign tourists may look, by some set of circumstances very few Thais comprehend, these primitive beings are usually loaded with cash and happy to spend it on items which appear to be completely unnecessary. Counterfeit watches that last only a few months, girls who don\u2019t actually want to have sex, ladyboys who are not even girls but do want to have sex and an endless stream of beer that will pass through their bloated bodies in less than an hour.At some point, the Patpong District will be torn down to make way for gleaming hi-rise offices and whatever Patpong is presently thought to be or actually was will gradually recede into the realm of mythic recollection, a moment in time between Bangkok\u2019s murky Third World past and its bright First World future.

Traditional methods of production change to meet the needs of a voracious outside market, and in some cases demand for authenticity and antiquity causes the veritable strip-mining of a region's artistic heritage. This has occurred in many Southeast Asian communities. \n   \"Fragile Traditions\" focuses on the complex effects of the primitive art market and various kinds of private and institutional collecting on the vibrant art traditions of Indonesia. It explores the historical context and impact of Indonesia's transformation from colonial to national government, together with the massive effects of the introduction of popular education and the accompanying religious conversions and reformations. The contributors bring to this volume a wealth of first-hand experience and diverse backgrounds in anthropology, art history, museum curation, and development.

The first is the inaugural edition of Elevations Laos, an exhibition of contemporary Southeast Asian art. The second is Lao Art Season, curated by the Laotian Misouda Heuangsoukkhoun. Where the former seeks to foster exchange between Laotian artists and those elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the latter facilitates connections between artists in Laos as well as the Isaan region of Northern Thailand. Both are highly anticipated events for the Laotian art community, providing opportunities for international dialogue and exchange, but also for local audiences to see the domestically produced, socially engaged contemporary art which is more often showcased elsewhere.

This consolidation has engendered a burst of scholarly activity, in line with the improving prospects of Asian art history generally and notwithstanding a lack of dedicated academic structures where the region is concerned. But if Southeast Asia has firmed as a framework for organising contemporary art, it has not been favoured as a basis for interpreting or historicising it. As knowledge production in the region has surged, regionalism has waned. In this article, I review the historiography of Southeast Asian contemporary art to reveal a discontinuity between its pioneers, who were regionalists, and a new historicism whose premises are basically nationalist. Reflexive consciousness of region \u2013 and of contemporaneity as a regional phenomenon \u2013 is advanced as an under-utilised interpretive device and a bulwark against hegemonic and monolithic art histories.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5364262, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Teh", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "DavidTeh", "display_name": "David Teh", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/DavidTeh?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5364262/28261722/26457451/s65_david.teh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10871, "name": "Regionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regionalism?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14992, "name": "World Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 42601, "name": "Contemporary Asian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Asian_art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 45994, "name": "Biennales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biennales?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 81613, "name": "Critical Regionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Regionalism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 153010, "name": "Contemporaneity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporaneity?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1240986, "name": "Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 78373390, "title": "Varieties and Origins of Kampai Island Glass Beads", "created_at": "2022-05-03T17:44:43.689-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78373390/Varieties_and_Origins_of_Kampai_Island_Glass_Beads?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_78373390", "summary": "Manik-manik kaca yang ditemukan di berbagai situs arkeologi di Asia Selatan dan Asia Tenggara antara abad 1 dan 13 umumnya disebut sebagai manik-manik kaca Indo-Pasifik.

Data yang dikumpulkan dari manik-manik kaca diperoleh dari penggalian arkeologi di Pulau Kampai. Dalam menganalisis varietas manik-manik kaca, penelitian ini mengkarakterisasi varietas manik-manik kaca Pulau Kampai berdasarkan tipologi dan frekuensi, yaitu manik-manik kaca polos dan manik-manik kaca berlekuk. Sejumlah manik-manik kaca ini dianalisis di laboratorium untuk mengidentifikasi komposisi bahan. Dalam menentukan asal produksi manik-manik kaca, penelitian ini menggunakan metode komparatif pada beberapa penelitian yang terpublikasi.

Since then, the research on Vietnam War photography has focused mainly on the works of Euro-American photographers, sometimes setting them apart from those who worked for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. This paper takes a different approach by attempting a comparative reading of two iconic photobooks produced ostensibly to represent the viewpoints of the two Vietnams. The first photobook is \"Viet Nam in Flames\" (published c. 1969), involving photographers Nguy\u1ec5n M\u1ea1nh \u0110an (1925-2019) and Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea1nh (1927-2017). The second book is \"War Time Photos\" (published in 2000) by L\u00e2m T\u1ea5n T\u00e0i (1935\u20132001). While recognising the imprint of politics dividing both Vietnams, this paper attempts to resurface the parallel (and diverging) contexts that informed the production and afterlife of both photobooks. This is made possible by tracing the biographies of the photographers involved, their participation in the global milieu of salon photography, how they understood their involvements in the war efforts, and their lives after reunification. This reading aims to complicate our dichotomous impression of two Vietnams and to unpack the reach (and limits) of politics in photographic production.  \r\n\r\n*\r\n\r\nView the video recording of this presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmycnhGQJZA  ", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21711245, "first_name": "Wubin", "last_name": "Zhuang", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WubinZhuang", "display_name": "Wubin Zhuang", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WubinZhuang?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21711245/5968259/6773821/s65_wubin.zhuang.jpg_oh_3e2cc8cc43af29d60ba22be09270ee5f_oe_551b1a19___gda___1427445669_b93aa5e85cb44642ac77dc4b4b1cab55"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1589, "name": "Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3356, "name": "Propaganda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Propaganda?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7396, "name": "Vietnamese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 10503, "name": "Photography Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography_Theory?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 13355, "name": "Vietnam War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam_War?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 19022, "name": "Documentary Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Photography?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 20079, "name": "History of photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_photography?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 41266, "name": "Photobook", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photobook?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 158455, "name": "Vietnamese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_studies?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 38621612, "title": "Chris Coles Bangkok Neon: Beacons in the Boozy Night - Paul Dorsey THE NATION", "created_at": "2019-03-24T17:48:42.299-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38621612/Chris_Coles_Bangkok_Neon_Beacons_in_the_Boozy_Night_Paul_Dorsey_THE_NATION?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_38621612", "summary": "As the sun sets, the Bangkok Night and its fabulous Neon comes to life.

Very few cities anywhere on this planet have the number and variety of signs as are spread across the vastness of the Bangkok Night.

"dom_id": "work_37749381", "summary": "This talk explores how the notion of \u2018experimentalism\u2019 \u2013 a term circulated in numerous guises - has underpinned trajectories of performance art in Southeast Asia since the 1960s. It focuses on its early iterations in the Philippines and Indonesia. Between the 1960s and 1980s, these two nations saw the emergence of a number of conceptually and performance-leaning practices within the visual arts. Often described as \u2018experiments\u2019 within the contemporary, these works were intended to surmount the boundaries of fine art and trigger greater discursive production. However, they also served to navigate the cultural politics of the dictatorial Marcos (1965-86) and Suharto (1967-98) regimes. This talk argues that while these practices yielded formal similarities, their political motivations differed substantially across the two nations. In the Philippines, early proponents of conceptual and performance art often straddled the divide between independent \u2018experimental\u2019 practices, and government-championed forms of abstraction, installation and site-specific art. In contrast, in Indonesia the evolution of \u2018experimentalism\u2019, particularly as it has been associated with the works of Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru (Indonesian New Art Movement), agitated for greater social and political consciousness. Highlighting these differences, this talk calls for a tracing of performance art histories through the lens of \u2018experimentalism\u2019, which accounts for interconnections and parallel streams of interest (as opposed to linear progressions), as well as specific national contexts and dynamics.

A range of art historical methodologies will be discussed. Through readings, discussions, and museum visits, students will learn to think critically and independently while gaining new knowledge. Students will also have the opportunity to examine original and replica works of Asian art in St. John\u2019s Chin Ying Asian Library collection. This activity is intended to build their confidence and skill in making first-hand observations and description of artwork, and it will be linked to a research and exhibition design project in which students will draw upon their experiences visiting and critiquing exhibitions of Asian and Pacific art in New York City.

exhibitions reflecting on aspects of Filipino existence: Mark Salvatus\u2019s \u2018Crackling for a Piece of the Moon\u2019 and Christina Lopez\u2019s \u2018Pro Forma\u2019. Salvatus uses a topographical point of view to survey land and space, from his early life in the province to living as an artist in the city. He subtly presented access to land, home, and social justice in works of paper, found objects, and acrylic scratches. Meanwhile, Lopez explores ways of visualizing big data and the vagueness and abstractions of algorithms. She worked on the technologies and ideas used in manufacturing perception that spilled over in the country\u2019s elections. Surprisingly, despite the different trajectories explored in the exhibitions, from the tactility of land to the concept of data, both artists reveal nuances in the lived reality of our experiences, including unequal access to an acceptable quality of life, continuous oppression and exploitation, and deeply embedded social injustice.

I analyse some short, independently made film and video works, each of which deals with minor (and/or obsolete) languages, and marginal identities, which have been suppressed in monolithic constructions of modern, national history. I focus on the subtitle as the site of a subversive play that not only undermines the hegemony of official-national language, but might also destabilize the transnational circuits and structures of exhibition in which such moving images increasingly circulate. With reference to anthropologically informed theories of mediation and Jacques Derrida\u2019s figure of the parergon, I highlight how tactical translation and mistranslation operate at both formal and linguistic levels. Finally, in a detailed reading of Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s short film &amp;#39;The Anthem&amp;#39; (2006), I explore the still more subversive possibilities when the cinematic parergon itself is subjected to such formal re-framing.

By this reckoning,  the notion of \"tradition\" can no longer be regarded simply as antithetical to modernity but must be seen, rather, as a constitutive part of what forges  c such modernity. In this vein, \"contemporary art\" must acknowledge the plural and manifold artistic practices of people the world over and recognize that the \"traditional\" may exist contiguously and even find presence in contemporary art and life.Thus, contemporary Southeast Asian art offers the potential for pushing the parameters of contemporary  art more generally (the means by which we define it, including its modes, media, styles and conditions of reception, among other formalist and affective considerations of aesthetics) so as to encompass those kinds of living \"folk\"or traditional\" art that are less readily translatable to pre-existing frames of \"internationalist\" avant-garde art practices with their Euro-American inheritances and biases.\" Excerpt from Michelle Antoinette, \"The Shifting Art-Historical Field for Southeast Asia: Tradition, Modernity and \"The Contemporary'\", Japan Foundation Asia Center Art Studies #03, 2017, pp.92-93 (originally published in Michelle Antoinette, Reworlding Art History: Contemporary Southeast Asian Art after 1990, Rodopi/Brill 2014).\n\nPart of an anthology of texts produced by the Japan Foundation Asia Centre and edited by Patrick D.

A number of factors, social and political, have come together to form a critical mass, allowing for the noir movement to not only take hold but to gain international attention. Mass media and mass tourism has helped to make the developmental changes into the kind of perfect storm that feeds the instability and insecurity that creates noir.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58692602, "asset_id": 38615967, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 716551, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Coles", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "ChrisColes", "display_name": "Chris Coles", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/ChrisColes?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/716551/243761/20873009/s65_chris.coles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8601, "name": "German Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Expressionism?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 81195, "name": "Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Expressionism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 123762, "name": "Nightlife", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nightlife?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 424747, "name": "Bangkok Noir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1101251, "name": "German Expressionist Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Expressionist_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3126733, "name": "Bangkok Noir Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir_Movement?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3174721, "name": "nightlife art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/nightlife_art?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 38603474, "title": "Berlin to Bangkok Nightline - Jade Conrad - ENCOUNTER MAGAZINE", "created_at": "2019-03-21T22:03:54.436-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38603474/Berlin_to_Bangkok_Nightline_Jade_Conrad_ENCOUNTER_MAGAZINE?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_38603474", "summary": "When Expressionism as a movement and as a painting style first appeared in Germany in the beginning of the 20th century, it was not only a reaction to the previous reigning era of Impressionism in art, it was also a response to a widespread anxiety about humanity\u2019s increasingly discordant relationship with the world and the loss of feelings of authenticity and spirituality. Capitalism was on the rise, rapid urbanization shattered the safety of traditional social molds and it\u2019s by-products, alienated, wandering, suffering individuals sprawled across the city of Berlin and by the 1920\u2019s, the rest of Europe.\n\nThe subjects depicted by the Expressionist artists like Beckmann, Nolde and Kirchner were very often the creatures of the night, the decadent consumers, drinkers and customers of the bars, brothels and dance halls, the prostitutes, dancers and cheap street girls, all tired, weary, troubled, horrible and horrified. And apparently all having fun, or at least pretending to have fun, while the world was falling apart\u2026Expressionism grew later into the abstract expressionism confirming perhaps that the more senseless the world is, the more abstract the art becomes.\n\nThe last we saw of Expressionism was, again starting in Germany, the Neo-Expressionist School of the 1980\u2019s. And then \u2013 surprisingly, but not at all unlikely, another Expressionist artist surfaced in Bangkok. Chris Coles is an American painter who worked in a movie industry before settling in Bangkok in the late 1990\u2019s \u2013 to paint. He is a member of the Bangkok Noir Movement and the only painter among the well known artists who gather around it, like the writers John Burdett and Christopher Moore.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59839110, "asset_id": 38603474, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 716551, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Coles", "domain_name": "brown", "page_name": "ChrisColes", "display_name": "Chris Coles", "profile_url": "https://brown.academia.edu/ChrisColes?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/716551/243761/20873009/s65_chris.coles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8601, "name": "German Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Expressionism?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 62098, "name": "Sex Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_Tourism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 81195, "name": "Expressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Expressionism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 123762, "name": "Nightlife", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nightlife?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 199671, "name": "Bangkok", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 424747, "name": "Bangkok Noir", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1101251, "name": "German Expressionist Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Expressionist_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1542874, "name": "Nightlife Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nightlife_Tourism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3126733, "name": "Bangkok Noir Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok_Noir_Movement?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 36413378, "title": "El neosurrealismo en el sudeste asi\u00e1tico: Vida y obra de Nguyen Dinh Dang II (Jap\u00f3n: libertad y cr\u00edtica)", "created_at": "2018-04-15T13:25:55.749-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36413378/El_neosurrealismo_en_el_sudeste_asi%C3%A1tico_Vida_y_obra_de_Nguyen_Dinh_Dang_II_Jap%C3%B3n_libertad_y_cr%C3%ADtica_?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_36413378", "summary": "Resumen:\nSe retoma la segunda parte del estudio de la obra de Nguyen Dinh Dang mediante este art\u00edculo.

The second block, the life of the painter in Japan, is the one that will be discussed next. Accompanying \"Japan\" with the words \"freedom\" and \"criticism\", it is intended to refer to how Dinh Dang's art strips of its Vietnamese ties to become a means of free expression. The neosurrealist figuration will be chosen to represent its peculiar world. In addition, during this period from the decade of the 90s to today, the physicist converts many of his subjects into direct reflections of his life. \"Criticism\" is thus the conventional means of protest in the linens of Dinh Dang.\n\nThus, the work will be structured in two key axes to understand the new stage of Dinh Dang, included by dates. Through this article we will study the period that goes from 1994, that is, the arrival of the artist to the Nation of the Rising Sun, until the turn of the century. Second, the following research will focus between 2000 and 2016; last work of the author to this day.\n\nBoth axes will be formed by a meticulous study of the style and theme that Dinh Dang chooses during his artistic career. The tour of various works will be the basis for explanations. Before, you will begin with a general introduction to facilitate the understanding of your complete work.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 80573523, "first_name": "Andrea", "last_name": "Garc\u00eda Casal", "domain_name": "uniovi", "page_name": "AndreaGarc\u00edaCasal", "display_name": "Andrea Garc\u00eda Casal", "profile_url": "https://uniovi.academia.edu/AndreaGarc%C3%ADaCasal?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/80573523/21683850/28685100/s65_andrea.garc_a_casal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4951, "name": "Surrealism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surrealism?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33789, "name": "Vietnamese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69862, "name": "Vietnamese Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 398617, "name": "Contemporary Japanese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Japanese_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 486448, "name": "History of Vietnamese Culture and Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Vietnamese_Culture_and_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 603978, "name": "European History of Art.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_History_of_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 653443, "name": "Neosurrealism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neosurrealism?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 682188, "name": "Surrealismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surrealismo?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1161989, "name": "Southest Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southest_Asia?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1428565, "name": "Arte Europeo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arte_Europeo?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1507980, "name": "Arte Asi\u00e1tico", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arte_Asiatico?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 1539079, "name": "Vietnamese painters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_painters?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2161666, "name": "Arte Asi\u00e1tico Contempor\u00e1neo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arte_Asi%C3%A1tico_Contempor%C3%A1neo?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2553235, "name": "vietnamese painting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/vietnamese_painting?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 2935239, "name": "Arte Vietnamita", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arte_Vietnamita?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3090439, "name": "Nguyen Dinh Dang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nguyen_Dinh_Dang?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 3090441, "name": "Neosurrealismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neosurrealismo?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 36666471, "title": "Instruments of Diplomacy: 19th Century Musical Instruments in the Smithsonian Collection of Thai Royal Gifts", "created_at": "2018-05-18T13:33:19.216-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36666471/Instruments_of_Diplomacy_19th_Century_Musical_Instruments_in_the_Smithsonian_Collection_of_Thai_Royal_Gifts?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_36666471", "summary": "This paper discusses two groups of musical instruments gifted by Thai Monarchs to the United States: six instruments accompanying the Harris Treaty (1856) and nineteen instruments sent for Philadelphia\u2019s Centennial Exposition (1876). We suggest that the selection of these pieces was primarily for aesthetic quality or display, not for their acoustic properties. Though they are visually impressive, sometimes a single item was given of normally paired instruments; some pairs given are not of matching design; non-visible components required to play them were originally missing; and one cannot assemble the instruments given into most traditional ensembles. Yet they served well as symbols, in King Mongkut\u2019s words to U.S. President Pierce, of \u201cheartful and true friendship\u201d and to confirm the \u201cpower in manufactures\u201d of Thailand\u2019s \u201cworkmen and artists.\u201d We conclude by briefly contrasting these with the instruments presented to the Library of Congress by King Bhumipol Adulyadej, Rama IX (a musician

Artists, cultural critics, and policy makers raised questions regarding the national character of realist and abstract modes of landscape representation, as well as the suitable pictorial and sentimental content of such works. This paper examines an avant-garde response to the landscape debate through Redza Piyadasa\u2019s The Great Malaysian Landscape, the winning entry to the 1972 national art competition. An early example of conceptual art in Malaysia, Piyadasa\u2019s piece literalizes the constitutive elements of landscape painting through stenciled text that labels the picture, frame, title, signature, and surface of the work as such. I argue that the deadpan aesthetic of this work signals the waning of landscape as an artistic genre that can be mobilized for unifying public sentiment through the aesthetic of the picturesque. Instead, Malaysian artists in the 1970s contested the function of landscape as a technology of representational mastery, and instead approached landscape as a contested terrain of cultural representation through the lens of sociology and information theory. Detached from the cultivation of public belonging, the landscape became a key conceptual term in the artistic response to urbanization and the instrumentalization of nature as a resource for national development.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 442287, "first_name": "Chanon Kenji", "last_name": "Praepipatmongkol", "domain_name": "mcgill", "page_name": "ChanonKenjiPraepipatmongkol", "display_name": "Chanon Kenji Praepipatmongkol", "profile_url": "https://mcgill.academia.edu/ChanonKenjiPraepipatmongkol?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/442287/142327/17516575/s65_chanon_kenji.praepipatmongkol.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9454044, "title": "Considerations on Cover Versions (2012)", "created_at": "2014-11-23T01:47:25.491-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9454044/Considerations_on_Cover_Versions_2012_?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_9454044", "summary": "A review esssay of Song-Ming Ang's Cover Versions exhibition for Future Perfect's Talk Back \u2013 Singapore Intensive Blog.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4104532, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Wong", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WongMark", "display_name": "Mark Wong", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WongMark?f_ri=68573", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 101917, "name": "Popular Music and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music_and_Culture?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 490215, "name": "CONTEMPORARY SOUTHEAST ASIAN ART", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CONTEMPORARY_SOUTHEAST_ASIAN_ART?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 8428331, "title": "We Have Never Known Nature: PIPELINE issue 44", "created_at": "2014-09-21T18:33:24.912-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8428331/We_Have_Never_Known_Nature_PIPELINE_issue_44?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_8428331", "summary": "Like over-familiar things, nature appears immediate and self-evident when summoned by artists to our attention.

At the same time, certain markers of 'ethnicity' or recognisable cultural icons\u2014such as the Buddha or Asian scripts\u2014have been common features in the artworks by internationally successful artists from Asia. This paper focuses on artists born in Asia who have moved between different countries and/or traditions, and explores how they have worked to deal with the issues of identity through and in their work. By reflecting on the experience of curating two exhibitions of works by artists with connections to Asia to different audiences in Argentina and Australia, the paper considers in what ways nomadic figures in the global artworld operate as 'cultural translators' who may act as local representatives and as transcultural agents. While competent in both source and target 'languages' of translation, the paper will examine how their fluency is influenced by movement and by interactions between the dynamics of local and global, and of traditional and modern.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99408, "first_name": "Fuyubi", "last_name": "Nakamura", "domain_name": "ubc", "page_name": "FuyubiNakamura", "display_name": "Fuyubi Nakamura", "profile_url": "https://ubc.academia.edu/FuyubiNakamura?f_ri=68573", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99408/27419/49707032/s65_fuyubi.nakamura.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1589, "name": "Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8232, "name": "Anthropology Of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_Of_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28954, "name": "Japanese contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_contemporary_art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42601, "name": "Contemporary Asian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Asian_art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 218221, "name": "Japanese calligraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_calligraphy?f_ri=68573"}, {"id": 429524, "name": "History of Books, Printing, and Publishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Books_Printing_and_Publishing?f_ri=68573"}]}, {"id": 841665, "title": "Where Gods and Kings Cavort: The Great Temple Complex at Panataran", "created_at": "2011-08-18T04:46:39.759-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/841665/Where_Gods_and_Kings_Cavort_The_Great_Temple_Complex_at_Panataran?f_ri=68573", "dom_id": "work_841665", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31429543, "asset_id": 841665, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 118262, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Markel", "domain_name": "lacma", "page_name": "StephenMarkel", "display_name": "Stephen Markel", "profile_url": "https://lacma.academia.edu/StephenMarkel?f_ri=68573", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=68573", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 431260, "title": "Fluch oder Segen?
