To collect the empirical data, a survey was conducted in two fishing communities situated adjacent to hilsa sanctuaries, which was further informed by semi-structured interviews with other fishery stakeholders in the region. The analysis shows that conflicts in the hilsa fishery are related to a number of factors such as increased competition over fishing space and irregularities in distribution of economic incentives. Conflicts in the fishery negatively affect the well-being of hilsa fishers and lead to increased social tension in the communities. Thus, a challenge for policy makers is to find a solution that benefits both the fishery conservation and poverty reduction. Based on the findings, the present study submits that a balance of fishery conservation and poverty reduction could be achieved by augmenting co-operative relationship that exists among different stakeholders in ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 101735950, "asset_id": 101104059, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 267981548, "first_name": "Naimul", "last_name": "Islam", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NaimulIslam157", "display_name": "Naimul Islam", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NaimulIslam157?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/267981548/118773074/108086776/s65_naimul.islam.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4711, "name": "Fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23848, "name": "Aquaculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aquaculture?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 100949633, "title": "Bangladesh-Japan Relations: Past, Present and Future", "created_at": "2023-04-29T02:36:02.185-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/100949633/Bangladesh_Japan_Relations_Past_Present_and_Future?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_100949633", "summary": "Bangladesh and Japan relations marked fifty years of their diplomatic relations on 10 February 2022.

It focuses on four key questions: How have Bangladesh-Japan relations evolved and developed in the last fifty years? What factors or issues have motivated to develop the bilateral relations? In this case, how far have the compulsions of geopolitics influenced the contours of bilateral relations between the two countries? How can Bangladesh-Japan partnership be strengthened beyond fifty years? This article argues that Bangladesh and Japan maintain warm relations at bilateral, regional and global scales.

Within the broader IOR, the BoB remains the key portal for enhanced bilateral and multilateral engagements. The recent policy initiatives of China, India, USA, Australia and Japan in the IOR and the Bay region specifically indicated growing strategic rivalries. This has serious ramifications for the security and development potentials for Bangladesh. The great powers will try to suggest policy inputs for Bangladesh, the latter may not only will face pressures with regard to policy independence but also be constrained and might succumb possibly to these pressures. Due to the burgeoning rivalry among the great powers, Bangladesh will encounter difficulties in policy independence. Thus, Bangladesh's preferred policy posture to tackle the great power rivalry should be and in fact has been an independent, non-aligned one. After 50 years of its independence, some domestic sources are seen to highlight Bangladesh's weakness, some analysts have underscored Bangladesh's strengths in courting major great powers. This article shows what challenges are it facing, how it has responded so far, and some recommendations about what it shall continue to carry its legacy of strategic hedging in the coming decades to

The climatic factors include sedimentations, inundation stress and increased salinity at landward zones. Pandanus trees face high level of mortality due to increased salinity. The nut development of coconut tree is affected by water stress which resulted in a small number of nuts, empty nuts or elongated nuts. The major threats to the corals are high levels of sedimentation, cyclones, storm surges and beach erosion.

The study begins with a description of the Tok Takia Complex which consists of a mosque that once was a Buddhist temple and a maqam where Tok Takia was buried in 1579, before introducing references to the former in Thai primary sources. Although we address details about Qadriyyah presence across the Bay of Bengal, we first reconstruct the geopolitical and commercial developments from the late fifteenth century contributing to the growth of Muslim\u2014and specifically, Kling Muslim\u2014 presence in Ayutthaya mentioned in a range of Siamese and Portuguese primary sources.

Hooghly estuary was sampled at 2 stations, at Kolkata and ca. 60 km downstream. Mangrove dominated Matla estuary was investigated along a N-S transect. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen, PO4 3and DON concentrations were low, especially for the Hooghly site at Kolkata. Human influence, however, was revealed by the more labile nature and elevated concentrations of amino acids in Kolkata. Release of nutrients from particulate matter during estuarine transport resulted in higher NO3 and PO4 3concentrations downstream Kolkata.

Therefore, single TS-combinations cannot be used to define surface water masses. The solution to the definition of surface water masses is the temperature/salinity time diagram (TS-time diagram) and/or the temperature/chlorophyll time diagram (TC-time diagram). This work establishes a systematic definition of regional water masses in the surface layer of the tropical Indian Ocean based on TC-time and TS-time diagrams of mean and standard deviation for 5\u00b0 squares. This classification is based on an analysis of the ratios between semi-annual and annual amplitudes of temperature and a multiple regression analysis between temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll, with Ekman pumping, components of pseudo-stress wind, wind magnitude and net-down-freshwater-flux. Four water masses are identified for the surface of the Indian Ocean: The Arabian Sea Surface Water (ASSW), the Bay of Bengal Surface Water (BBSW), the Equatorial Indian Surface Water (EISW) and the Southern Indian Surface Water (SISW).

In this introduction we contend that the radicalism of the age of revolution can best be viewed as a geographically connected process, and that the maritime world was central to its multiple eruptions and global character.

This study discusses the current farming and trading of seabass in Bangladesh&#39;s coastal districts. Seabass fry is collected from rivers and estuarine areas, grown in hatcheries or ponds, and sold to farmers in large sizes. Some farmers cultivate this fry in mixed fish culture ponds in the extensive method; some farmers cultivate them with carp fish in a semi-intensive method. Seabass feeds only live feed (Tilapia and carp fishes fry); continuous supply is difficult and expensive. In these ponds, seabass is cultiv...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 99129806, "asset_id": 97534679, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17315572,

economic activities in Bangladesh highlighting the present capacity and prospect of these areas which will pay dividends in the future. Bangladesh Navy (BN) is a strong pillar for Blue Economy activities in Bangladesh. Besides, providing traditional security at sea, BN is engaged in fishery protection duties which yield substantially to the marine reserve. With the expansion of marine economic activities, BN has also increased its benign duties in manifolds. In the last decade, BN has progressed a lot in terms of capacity building and ocean related activities. Thus, this paper critically dissects all the dimensions that BN is contributing to the blue economy of Bangladesh. Finally, it suggests a few areas where BN needs to focus its endeavor by expanding naval support towards blue economic growth as well as accomplishing the national maritime objectives of Bangladesh.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98845965, "asset_id": 97142098, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 184080605, "first_name": "Md Minarul", "last_name": "Hoque", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Minarul_Hoque", "display_name": "Md Minarul Hoque", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Minarul_Hoque?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/184080605/110453839/99701152/s65_md_minarul.hoque.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 284, "name": "Hydrology/Hydrography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hydrology_Hydrography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 415, "name": "Oceanography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oceanography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48532, "name": "Maritime Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Security?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 96849984, "title": "Mutiny and Maritime Radicalism in the Age of Revolution: An Introduction", "created_at": "2023-02-13T13:53:54.459-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/96849984/Mutiny_and_Maritime_Radicalism_in_the_Age_of_Revolution_An_Introduction?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_96849984", "summary": "The essays collected in this volume demonstrate that during the age of revolution (1760s\u20131840s) most sectors of the maritime industries experienced higher levels of unrest than is usually recognized. Ranging across global contexts including the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans as well as the Caribbean, Andaman, and South China Seas, and exploring the actions of sailors, laborers, convicts, and slaves, this collection offers a fresh, sea-centered way of seeing the confluence between space, agency, and political economy during this crucial period. In this introduction we contend that the radicalism of the age of revolution can best be viewed as a geographically connected process, and that the maritime world was central to its multiple eruptions and global character. Mutiny therefore can be seen as part of something bigger and broader: what we have chosen to call maritime radicalism, a term as well as a concept that has had virtually no presence in the literature on the revolutiona...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98633073, "asset_id": 96849984, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38392691, "first_name": "Hamish", "last_name": "Maxwell-stewart", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HamishMaxwellstewart", "display_name": "Hamish Maxwell-stewart", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HamishMaxwellstewart?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4121, "name": "Atlantic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_World?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4652, "name": "French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Revolution?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 15573, "name": "American Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Revolution?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 27533, "name": "Atlantic history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_history?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 48814, "name": "Indian Ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 66183, "name": "Britain and French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Britain_and_French_Revolution?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 202979, "name": "Amistad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amistad?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 257992, "name": "Historical Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 405669, "name": "Cura\u00e7ao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cura%C3%A7ao?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 642554, "name": "Atlantic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_History-18?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 993590, "name": "Mutiny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mutiny?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 96839621, "title": "Genetic variation of Parapenaeopsis sculptilis (Decapoda, Penaeidae) and reassessment of the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Parapenaeopsis based on mitochondrial DNA variation", "created_at": "2023-02-13T09:50:26.971-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/96839621/Genetic_variation_of_Parapenaeopsis_sculptilis_Decapoda_Penaeidae_and_reassessment_of_the_phylogenetic_relationships_within_the_genus_Parapenaeopsis_based_on_mitochondrial_DNA_variation?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_96839621", "summary": "The genus Parapenaeopsis is an important group of marine shrimps for wild capture in the Indo-West Pacific region.

Even though farming began many years ago, progress in overcoming obstacles of only natural sources for hatchlings, supplemental feeding, and knowledge on advanced farming management in seabass farming at the field level has been prolonged. This study discusses the current farming and trading of seabass in Bangladesh's coastal districts. Seabass fry is collected from rivers and estuarine areas, grown in hatcheries or ponds, and sold to farmers in large sizes. Some farmers cultivate this fry in mixed fish culture ponds in the extensive method; some farmers cultivate them with carp fish in a semi-intensive method. Seabass feeds only live feed (Tilapia and carp fishes fry); continuous supply is difficult and expensive. In these ponds, seabass is cultivated in the traditional method in 18-20 months, weighing 7-8 kg, and in the advanced traditional method in 1 year, weighing 2-3 kg. The profit percentage of seabass farming with the semiintensive method is 77.42%. To expand this profitable fish farming, it is crucial to acclimate the fish to induced breeding and supplemental food. The institutions involved should not work in isolation but rather collaborate on developing induced breeding techniques and expanding seabass farming. In this case, prosperous seabass farming countries' experience can be applied.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98227354, "asset_id": 96286223, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1804079, "first_name": "International Journal of Agricultural Research,", "last_name": "Innovation and Technology (IJARIT)", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ijarit", "display_name": "International Journal of Agricultural Research, Innovation and Technology (IJARIT)", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ijarit?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1804079/2181882/2557972/s65_international_journal_of.agricultural_research_innovation_technology.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4711, "name": "Fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23848, "name": "Aquaculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aquaculture?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 332065, "name": "Seabass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seabass?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 96222711, "title": "Influence of Land Use Land Cover on Cyclone Track Prediction \u2013 A Study During Aila Cyclone", "created_at": "2023-02-03T02:50:48.846-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/96222711/Influence_of_Land_Use_Land_Cover_on_Cyclone_Track_Prediction_A_Study_During_Aila_Cyclone?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_96222711", "summary": "Land-surface processes are one of the important drivers for weather and climate systems over the tropics.

This paper deals with the description of the specimen and reporting of the Neomerinthe rotunda Chen, 1981 from the Indian waters for the first time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97856461, "asset_id": 95765286, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5010784, "first_name": "Dipanjan", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "wbsubregistration", "page_name": "DipanjanRay", "display_name": "Dipanjan Ray", "profile_url": "https://wbsubregistration.academia.edu/DipanjanRay?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5010784/2175727/2551232/s65_dipanjan.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7710, "name": "Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17635, "name": "Marine biodiversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_biodiversity?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 72539, "name": "Actinopterygii", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Actinopterygii?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 79742, "name": "Fishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fishing?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 109828, "name": "Fauna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fauna?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 173285, "name": "Fishery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fishery?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 195890, "name": "Genus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genus?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 197216, "name": "Coastal ecology and marine biodiversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_ecology_and_marine_biodiversity?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 299368, "name": "Scorpaenidae", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scorpaenidae?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1118109, "name": "Visakhapatnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visakhapatnam?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 95744473, "title": "Artisanal Fishing Crafts and Gears of Coastal Bangladesh", "created_at": "2023-01-26T09:12:16.295-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/95744473/Artisanal_Fishing_Crafts_and_Gears_of_Coastal_Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_95744473", "summary": "This chapter presents the diversity and characterization of the common fishing crafts and gears used in the coastal artisanal fishery of Bangladesh. The coastal artisanal fishery of Bangladesh is a multi-gear, multi-craft, and multi-species fishery with small, traditional fishing crafts equipped with low-tech gears requiring labour-intensive fishing methods. Crafts are mostly traditional wooden boats with an increasing trend of mechanization, which varies in their construction and equipment in terms of size, engine power, and gear handling systems based on the area of operation and type of gear to be operated. Gears are mostly low-tech traditional types based on labour-intensive methods of operation. Many have remained the same for centuries, while others have been modernized through long modification processes in synchronization with the changes in the target fish, climatic and environmental conditions, and socioeconomic and sociocultural features over time. The fisherfolks choose different devices depending on the fishing area, target species, availability and price of the construction materials, and the applicable regulative and legislative issues in the region. Monitoring the current state and evolution of fishing crafts and gears throughout time and identifying the reasons for switching and mode of adoption to a specific device, is critical to understanding and managing the artisanal coastal fisheries of Bangladesh.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97841531, "asset_id": 95744473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25700039, "first_name": "Md.

sediments, surface water, and aquatic organisms, including seafood, and thus transferred to food chains. This paper summarizes the emerging concern of microplastic pollution and highlights mitigation policies and action plans in the Sundarban Delta regions in Bay of Bengal. Sundarban is the largest mangrove forest with vibrant and rich biodiversity, facing severe threats because of human activities and climate change. Anthropogenic plastic litter has been found in the Bay of Bengal and thus also in Sundarban, which can cause substantial threats to mangrove forests. More than 56 tons of plastic wastes were found in the Sundarban immediately after the cyclone 'Amphan' in 2020 due to unregulated relief packaged materials using plastics. Interestingly, microplastics have also been found in the Bay of Bengal and Sundarban, ultimately transported from various rivers and waved off to the Sundarban mangrove. It has been observed that 4 million tonnes of microplastics have been discharged annually from various rivers of India and Bangladesh to Sundarban and the Bay of Bengal. Trophic transfer of microplastics and their bioaccumulation can result in significant ecological damage to the Sundarban delta. Although the governments of India and Bangladesh have been taking different policy measures for protecting the mangrove forest areas, more policy interventions are required to tackle emerging contaminants like microplastics. Other issues may also arise from huge load of microplastics, such as degradation of natural resources, unsustainable livelihoods, and poverty. In this regard, joint initiatives of both countries are required to consider pollution risk assessments, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97204834, "asset_id": 94862980, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253217, "first_name": "Sayan", "last_name": "Bhattacharya", "domain_name": "nalandauniv", "page_name": "SayanBhattacharya", "display_name": "Sayan Bhattacharya", "profile_url": "https://nalandauniv.academia.edu/SayanBhattacharya?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253217/99221/38595203/s65_sayan.bhattacharya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 73296, "name": "Tocicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tocicology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 344854, "name": "Sundarbans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sundarbans?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1281089, "name": "Microplastics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Microplastics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 94482823, "title": "Evaluation of WRF-Predicted Near-Hub-Height Winds and Ramp Events over a Pacific Northwest Site with Complex Terrain", "created_at": "2023-01-06T15:43:17.205-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/94482823/Evaluation_of_WRF_Predicted_Near_Hub_Height_Winds_and_Ramp_Events_over_a_Pacific_Northwest_Site_with_Complex_Terrain?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_94482823", "summary": "One challenge with wind-power forecasts is the accurate prediction of rapid changes in wind speed (ramps).

In cephalopods, Loligo recorded the maximum TPH (av. 14.87 \u00b5g g-1) while Metapenaeus dobsoni recorded the maximum TPH (av. 13.18 \u00b5g g-1) among crustaceans. The concentration of TPH recorded in the present study were higher than the reported values from other studies in Bay of Bengal but were comparable with those of other Indian coast and Gulf water.

We1 investigate the interannual variability of post-monsoonal (October to December) BoB LLCs and their teleconnection with El Ni \u0303no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). It is found that the years with the fewer number of BoB LLCs are associated with anomalous equatorial easterlies that are largely connected with the El Ni \u0303no and positive IOD. Likewise, equatorial westerly phases, often associated with the La Ni \u0303na and negative IOD years, favour the LLC formation by providing the initial spin-up required for cyclogenesis. This teleconnection between ENSO and BoB TC frequency is confined in the low-latitudinal region with little influence for cyclogenesis north of 10\u00b0N during ENSO and IOD except during negative IOD. These results may help extend the lead time and improve the seasonal prediction of BoB TCs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95363463, "asset_id": 92325023, "asset_type": "Work",

alien fish species for aquaculture has become a common practice in Bangladesh. In this study, the socio-economic factors responsible for alien species adoption by fish farmers in Bogra District of Bangladesh were investigated. Data on adoption and socio-economic factors were collected from randomly selected 110 fish farmers. A multiple regression model was used to determine the factors influencing the adoption of alien fish species. The majority of the respondents (62.7%) belong to the moderate adoption category. The results showed that socio-economic factors such as commercialization, social participation, innovativeness, knowledge significantly affected fish farmers decision to adopt alien species. A stepwise regression analysis reveals that farmers knowledge on aquaculture is the deterministic factor regarding adoption. The trend of adopting alien fish species is not a concern limited to the study area, rather it reflects the general scenario of the aquaculture indust...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

The 85\uf0b0E Ridge, located in the Bay of Bengal extends from the Mahanadi Basin in north Bay of Bengal to the Afanasy Nikitin seamounts in equatorial Indian Ocean for a distance of about 2500 km (Figure 1). This is an enigmatic geological feature as it possesses inexplicable gravity and magnetic signatures.

demonstrate that during the age of revolution (1760s\u20131840s) most sectors of the maritime industries experienced higher levels of unrest than is usually recognized. Ranging across global contexts including the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans as well as the Caribbean, Andaman, and South China Seas, and exploring the actions of sailors, laborers, convicts, and slaves, this collection offers a fresh, sea-centered way of seeing the confluence between space, agency, and political economy during this crucial period. In this introduction we contend that the radicalism of the age of revolution can best be viewed as a geographically connected process, and that the maritime world was central to its multiple eruptions and global character. Mutiny therefore can be seen as part of something bigger and broader: what we have chosen to call maritime radicalism, a term as well as a concept that has had virtually no presence in the literature on the revolutiona...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 94528025, "asset_id": 91163222, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2186054, "first_name": "Lex", "last_name": "Heerma van Voss", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LexHeermavanVoss", "display_name": "Lex  Heerma van Voss", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LexHeermavanVoss?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2186054/702480/872475/s65_lex.heerma_van_voss.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4121, "name": "Atlantic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_World?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4652, "name": "French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Revolution?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 15573, "name": "American Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Revolution?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 27533, "name": "Atlantic history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_history?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 48814, "name": "Indian Ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 66183, "name": "Britain and French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Britain_and_French_Revolution?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 202979, "name": "Amistad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amistad?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 257992, "name": "Historical Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 405669, "name": "Cura\u00e7ao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cura%C3%A7ao?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 642554, "name": "Atlantic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_History-18?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 993590, "name": "Mutiny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mutiny?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 91128232, "title": "United Nations: The South Asian Story", "created_at": "2022-11-19T03:18:44.576-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/91128232/United_Nations_The_South_Asian_Story?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_91128232", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 94503326, "asset_id": 91128232, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 110198825, "first_name": "Abhishekh", "last_name": "Ganesh", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AbhishekhGanesh", "display_name": "Abhishekh Ganesh", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AbhishekhGanesh?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/02e9a7ce5a1df69dd214841acede5df2?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2748398, "name": "Uri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uri?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 90803884, "title": "On the management of single fish species of hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) resources of Bangladesh", "created_at": "2022-11-14T23:12:24.791-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/90803884/On_the_management_of_single_fish_species_of_hilsa_shad_Tenualosa_ilisha_resources_of_Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_90803884", "summary": "Hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) belonging to the family Clupeidae is a diadromous migratory fish species.

In general, this has been attributed to the isostatic overcompensation of the ridge due to overburden sediment load. In this work we attempted to know; whether, the present day oceanic lithosphere, juxtaposed to the Eastern Continental Margin of India (ECMI), holds the vestiges of lithospheric stretching due to erstwhile India-Antarctica rifting? If so, how much is the gravity effect of post rift lithospheric subsidence contributed to the excess negative gravity field of later emplaced 85oE Ridge. Secondly, does the 85oE Ridge is a crustal mass anomaly? Or as envisaged, was it originated from the Crozet hotspot? We address these issues by using satellite altimeter-derived gravity anomaly and its analytical upward continuation anomalies with forward modeling of ship-borne data.

It has six distinct different morphologies and sizes of styles, in addition to the typical gently curved stout and thin styles characteristic of Stylissa, and two different morphologies of strongyloxeas and rare strongyles. Stylissa carteri (Dendy, 1889) was reported previously from India (Gulf of Mannar and Pearl Banks of Tuticorin) and is redescribed here from populations in Palk Bay, east coast of India, in addition to Muttom, Vizhinjam and Lakshadweep islands, which are the first records of S. carteri from the west coast of India. \u00a0", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98825913, "asset_id": 90086585,

"Introduction In the marine ecosystems, ciliates have been renowned as a dominant group in microzooplankton and serve as an efficient link between the microbial loop and metazoan food web. Oligotrich ciliates generally dominate microzooplankton communities in both marine and freshwater habitats. They are ubiquitous in the ocean surface and usually take over the planktonic ciliate communities. Aloricate oligotrich ciliates exist in higher numbers and consume considerable quantities of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial production. The genera of oligotrich ciliates like Strombilidium and Strombidium are prominent components of microzooplankton in planktonic communities . Strombidium genus has been recognized as a diverse group in the oligotrichs. Although around 80 species of Strombidium have been recorded till date, many of them lack morphological details that need further investigation.

Analysis of the four different Burmese versions of the Matthean Lord's Prayer reveals how Percoto provided key terminology and phraseology for Chater and Judson. Chater's translation reveals weaknesses typical of the William Carey/Serampore Bible translations. Judson's 1817 translation contains weaknesses also seen in Chater's work, but by 1832 these weaknesses had been addressed, resulting in a much-improved translation that is virtually the same as Judson's final Bible translation (1840) that is widely used in Myanmar today.

Such grey areas will arise whenever the entitlements of two States to the continental shelf extend beyond 200 nautical miles and relevant circumstances call for a boundary somewhere other than the equidistance line, at or beyond the 200 nautical miles limit, in order to provide an equitable delimitation. The grey areas discussed in the article are the outcome of litigations in the dispute concerning delimitation of the maritime boundary between Bangladesh and Myanmar, decided by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary Arbitration between Bangladesh and India that went before an arbitral tribunal. Grey areas create practical inconveniences concerning the enforcement and management of natural resources. These need to be resolved through specific agreement or the establishment of appropriate cooperative arrangements. The main goal of this article is to explain the phenomenon and ask whether grey areas create more problems than they solve. It is argued that grey areas are justifiable in special circumstances. In the Bay of Bengal-due to its geography-it was necessary to adjust the provisional equidistance line between the parties involved to reach an equitable solution. In brief, the grey areas in the Bay of Bengal were a necessary inconvenience because they were a precursor to an equitable solution.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 90188012, "asset_id": 85511447, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9793550, "first_name": "Bjarni M\u00e1r", "last_name": "Magn\u00fasson", "domain_name": "bifrost", "page_name": "BjarniM\u00e1rMagn\u00fasson", "display_name": "Bjarni M\u00e1r Magn\u00fasson", "profile_url": "https://bifrost.academia.edu/BjarniM%C3%A1rMagn%C3%BAsson?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9793550/3058876/3596858/s65_bjarni_m_r.magn_sson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8869, "name": "Law of the Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_of_the_Sea?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82701, "name": "Maritime Boundary Delimitation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Boundary_Delimitation?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 793388, "name": "International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Tribunal_for_the_Law_of_the_Sea?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 85283726, "title": "Bay of Bengal as a Microcosmic Model for Law of the Sea in the Indian Ocean", "created_at": "2022-08-21T08:43:18.226-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/85283726/Bay_of_Bengal_as_a_Microcosmic_Model_for_Law_of_the_Sea_in_the_Indian_Ocean?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_85283726", "summary": "This paper examines the Bay of Bengal as a model for law of the sea in the Indian Ocean when considering the interest of an open Indo-Pacific for the connectivity of its maritime waterways.

The differences between the forcing of these two frequencies reveal a dipole pattern of salinity change with a positive salinity deviation (1~2 PSU) offshore of the Yangtze River estuary, and a negative deviation (-1~-0.5 PSU) along the Jiangsu Coast. Further dye tracking experiments confirm that diurnal forcing strengthened the northwestward longshore freshwater transport (NLFT) of the Yangtze River by 5.2\u00d7109 m3 and reduced the mean water age of 7 days. Sensitivity experiments using different forcing combinations suggest that the diurnal wind, i.e. the land-sea breeze, is the key to develop the dipole pattern of salinity change and the NLFT.

nets, which can damage the seabed ecosystem. Fishermen fight through various demonstrations. Finally, the government gave temporary permission to use cantrang.The problem in this research is how can the permit for the use of cantrang nets continue during the transition period until later the permit is revoked, there is no turmoil or conflict between fishermen? To overcome this problem, a need assessment step must be done.The long-term goal of this research is to study and make social engineering in terms of capture fisheries&#39; policies to improve the welfare of fishermen through conservation of mari...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88510948, "asset_id": 83006482, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7833389, "first_name": "Nugroho", "last_name": "Brata", "domain_name": "ach", "page_name": "NugrohoBrata", "display_name": "Nugroho Brata", "profile_url": "https://ach.academia.edu/NugrohoBrata?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7833389/2836277/3311150/s65_nugroho.brata.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 26, "name": "Business", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94651, "name": "EAI", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/EAI?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 82993677, "title": "Improved Bathymetric Dataset and Tidal Model for the Northern Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2022-07-11T23:32:02.888-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82993677/Improved_Bathymetric_Dataset_and_Tidal_Model_for_the_Northern_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_82993677", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88503248, "asset_id": 82993677, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16091197, "first_name": "yann", "last_name": "krien", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "yannkrien", "display_name": "yann krien", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/yannkrien?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 415, "name": "Oceanography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oceanography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18203, "name": "Marine Geodesy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_Geodesy?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 162010, "name": "Geomatic Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geomatic_Engineering?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 769175, "name": "Bathymetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bathymetry?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1660649, "name": "Bay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 82786096, "title": "A comparative evaluation of the gravity signatures over a part of the western Indian offshore for lithospheric studies", "created_at": "2022-07-08T02:35:34.527-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82786096/A_comparative_evaluation_of_the_gravity_signatures_over_a_part_of_the_western_Indian_offshore_for_lithospheric_studies?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_82786096", "summary": "Three different satellite gravity data e.g. Hwang gravity (High Resolution), GRACE gravity and ERS-1 gravity over the Bombay High region in the western Indian offshore were examined in the present study.

The current study used NDWI an MNDWI to delineate land and water boundary to extract the shoreline and also used some overlay analysis to measure the erosion-accretion. DSAS extension is used for analyzing the shifting of the shoreline. The results (1990-2015) show that the island has 1192 hectares of land accreted during this time period, and about 1 km of its shoreline lost during this time period as it has broken in few places. Most accretion found in the northwestern part and erosion in southeastern and southwestern part. The study area was divided into four different segments and about 115 transects were constructed, of which about 74 shows the seaward movement and 44 shows landward movement. Seaward movement and rate of shoreline shifting is higher in the northwestern...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88365872, "asset_id": 82769120, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

"dom_id": "work_82618527", "summary": "Article Type: Research Paper Purpose-In the Indian Ocean Region, the Bay of Bengal is re-emerging economically and strategically. The region has become a theater of strategic power play due to its strategic relevance, the presence of critical SLOCs, and the strong economic prospects of several adjoining states. India is the region's largest naval power, and it strives to maintain a rule-based maritime order. In this regard, this research aims to investigate possible strategies for India for becoming a regional net security provider. Design, Methodology, Approach-The content analysis approach has been used to prepare the paper. Findings-As key forces in the region fight for strategic and economic initiatives, the Bay of Bengal's strategic importance will only increase. As a result of these advantages, rival states' naval capabilities and presence in the Indo-Pacific will be enhanced. Along with a pervasive sense of competitiveness in the region, there are more opportunities for friendly nations to collaborate. India must be willing to try new things and let go of old inhibitions when it is needed. It must pursue principles like burden-sharing and fully utilize the friendly navies eager to assist India's position in the area. India would have to manage its relations with China as it continues to construct a bay community. The Sino-Indian dynamic will have a profound impact on the region's growing security architecture in the maritime sphere. India must work on building trust, strengthening, and diversifying its engagement with partner countries, and continue its HADR role to further calibrate its position in the region. By strengthening its engagements, India would be able to shift from a reactive to a proactive policy. Practical Implications-This paper argues that India may consolidate its influence 48 Journal of Territorial and Maritime Studies, Summer/Fall 2022 and position in the Bay of Bengal area through concentrated efforts to cooperate with like-minded partners, further enhancing its maritime diplomacy through the use of soft and hard power, and effective coordination with BIMSTEC.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88265485, "asset_id": 82618527, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48706163, "first_name": "Alik", "last_name": "Naha", "domain_name": "wbsubregistration", "page_name": "AlikNaha", "display_name": "Alik Naha", "profile_url": "https://wbsubregistration.academia.edu/AlikNaha?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48706163/12816642/88314772/s65_alik.naha.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48532, "name": "Maritime Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Security?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1002942, "name": "Indian Ocean Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Region?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 82524611, "title": "Blue economy and Bangladesh: lessons and Policy imPlications", "created_at": "2022-07-03T21:55:57.596-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82524611/Blue_economy_and_Bangladesh_lessons_and_Policy_imPlications?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_82524611", "summary": "In recent times, Blue Economy is emerging as an alternative development paradigm that balances economic use of oceans with environmental sustainability.

We investigate the interannual variability of post-monsoonal (October to December) BoB LLCs and their teleconnection with El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). It is found that the years with the fewer number of BoB LLCs are associated with anomalous equatorial easterlies that are largely connected with the El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD. Likewise, equatorial westerly phases, often associated with the La Ni\u00f1a and negative IOD years, favour the LLC formation by providing the initial spin-up required for cyclogenesis. This teleconnection between ENSO/IOD and BoB TC frequency is confined in the low-latitudinal region with little influence for cyclogenesis north of 10\u00b0N during ENSO and IOD except during negative IOD. These results may help extend the lead time and improve the seasonal prediction of BoB TCs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86750521, "asset_id": 80333225, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41431985, "first_name": "SHINTO", "last_name": "ROOSE", "domain_name": "iisc", "page_name": "SHINTOROOSE", "display_name": "SHINTO ROOSE", "profile_url": "https://iisc.academia.edu/SHINTOROOSE?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41431985/13250516/70977232/s65_shinto.roose.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 40030, "name": "Tropical cyclones", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tropical_cyclones?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48814, "name": "Indian Ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 200246, "name": "ENSO", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ENSO?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 240379, "name": "Indian Ocean Dipole", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Dipole?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 80206669, "title": "Chapter One-", "created_at": "2022-05-29T12:50:20.330-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80206669/Chapter_One_?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_80206669", "summary": "\n\n\tThe Atlas of Maritime Silk Road Buddhism by Prof Lewis Lancaster contains a series of lectures he presented at the Department of Religious Studies for the University of the West in California.

This impact is severe in the coastal region. Proper water resources management is must in this problematic area. The coastal belt of Bangladesh is under a polder system. This system protects the mass people from great threats of natural and man maid calamities over the time. Human requirement of water is increasing day by day as life is getting better and better. So, a good management is required to augment the water resources. This research is aimed at filling the gaps in existing knowledge and management of Bangladesh&amp;amp;#39;s surface water resources. One of the challenges facing water managers understands how changing land use and land cover, evaporation and floods impact surface water resources. We are developing tools and methods to manage the increased pressure on water resources from different users and the competition for water between competing uses including interception from vegetation (such as plantation forestry or farming). Surface water resources are replenished by floodplain inundation and groundwater recharge from landscapes, but these events are episodic so the dynamics of the water balance need to be understood to fully appreciate the implications of variable and changing climate.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86156947, "asset_id": 78713748, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 100379254, "first_name": "Rupayan", "last_name": "Saha", "domain_name": "utsa", "page_name": "RupayanSaha", "display_name": "Rupayan Saha", "profile_url": "https://utsa.academia.edu/RupayanSaha?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/100379254/22687960/21863893/s65_rupayan.saha.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13193, "name": "Surface Water Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surface_Water_Modeling?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21340, "name": "Water Resources engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_Resources_engineering?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 87756, "name": "Integrated Coastal Zone Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integrated_Coastal_Zone_Management?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1393114, "name": "Surface Water Assesment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surface_Water_Assesment?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 78471313, "title": "Islands in Flux: The Andaman and Nicobar Story", "created_at": "2022-05-04T18:21:42.400-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78471313/Islands_in_Flux_The_Andaman_and_Nicobar_Story?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_78471313", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85507837, "asset_id": 78471313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1219553, "first_name": "Pankaj", "last_name": "Sekhsaria", "domain_name": "iitbombay", "page_name": "PankajSekhsaria", "display_name": "Pankaj Sekhsaria", "profile_url": "https://iitbombay.academia.edu/PankajSekhsaria?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1219553/2916270/36565399/s65_pankaj.sekhsaria.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27085, "name": "Tsunami", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tsunami?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33662, "name": "Earthquake", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Earthquake?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 447675, "name": "Nicobar Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nicobar_Islands?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 516018, "name": "Andaman and Nicobar islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andaman_and_Nicobar_islands?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 2318405, "name": "Science Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_Culture-1?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 78344053, "title": "Report of workshop on \"Poverty alleviation and livelihood security among the coastal fishing communities - market and credit access issues", "created_at": "2022-05-03T09:23:31.332-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78344053/Report_of_workshop_on_Poverty_alleviation_and_livelihood_security_among_the_coastal_fishing_communities_market_and_credit_access_issues?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_78344053", "summary": "This report synthesises information from the literature and key informants on agricultural production and soil fertility in Malawi and proposes options for investment in this area. The main points, highlighted below, were presented to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation&#39;s Soil Fertility Round Table in Lilongwe in June 1998. Malawi&#39;s situation is far from secure with its high population density and growth rate, land shortages, malnutrition, decreasing life expectancy and deteriorating infrastructure. The country has recently experienced some extreme shocks and changes - repeated droughts, democratisation, devaluation and liberalisation.

To set out the trajectory, this article starts by identifying the strategic geography of the Bay of Bengal in the Indo-Pacific fulcrum, one prism through which to view the evolving international relations of the region. In doing so, the article discusses the factors that drive the evolving significance of the Bay for its littoral states and great powers. Then the focus shifts toward another prism\u2014the nontraditional security issues including economy, ecology, and connectivity, which are of deep interest to all the littoral states. These factors can drive cooperation. This review of the hard and soft elements of the strategic environment of the Bay of Bengal suggests strong cohesion of the regional states is the key to mutual prosperity.

The developments of this period provide important insights into the shifting patterns of Indian migration, labor regimes, (im)migrant-native relations, and the rise of xenophobic politics in the region. Given the historical importance of migration and the persistence of xenophobia in Burma, a study of migrant labor within the emerging nationalist politics of the interwar period is crucial. This period witnessed provocative but well-established questions concerning Indian migration: whether Indian migrants were supplementary or surplus, whether they were filling a void or generating local competition, whether colonial policies regarding Indian migration and their work and life in the colony were exclusionist or assimilatory, whether Indians shared a harmonious relationship of peaceful co-existence with the \u2018indigenous\u2019 community, and whether they were they \u2018well off\u2019 in Burma. This article focuses on the interwar interactions between empires, colonies, and capital in the Bay of Bengal rim and transatlantic economies, as well as the intersections between the reordering of the global economy, ethnocentric nationalism, migrants\u2019 changing lives and the patterns and system of Indian migration. The intersections between emerging nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiments reflected in the many ethnic riots of this period provide historical precedents to the persisting alt-right politics, xenophobia, ethnic injustice, and racial-religious bigotry perpetrated against minorities and migrants in Burma - the Rohingyas being a major target of this xenophobic nationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83077808, "asset_id": 75220913, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24918320, "first_name": "RITESH", "last_name": "JAISWAL", "domain_name": "uzh", "page_name": "RITESHJAISWAL", "display_name": "RITESH K U M A R JAISWAL", "profile_url": "https://uzh.academia.edu/RITESHJAISWAL?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24918320/6747408/18175030/s65_ritesh.jaiswal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 13144, "name": "Indian Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

Metal concentrations recorded in the Bay of Bengal zooplankton may be used as background levels for future studies, a body of water about which information is still very scarce.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81990259, "asset_id": 73485273, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51470466, "first_name": "Rejomon", "last_name": "George", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RejomonGeorge", "display_name": "Rejomon  George", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RejomonGeorge?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51470466/37192612/31561950/s65_rejomon.george.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6305, "name": "Bioaccumulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioaccumulation?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7710, "name": "Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9095, "name": "Trace Metals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trace_Metals?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187216, "name": "Zooplankton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooplankton?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1494552, "name": "River Discharge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/River_Discharge?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1957240, "name": "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ENVIRONMENTAL_SCIENCE_AND_MANAGEMENT?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 73478670, "title": "Ocean Acidification: Summary for Policymakers", "created_at": "2022-03-10T07:53:32.050-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73478670/Ocean_Acidification_Summary_for_Policymakers?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_73478670", "summary": "The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) was launched in 1987 to coordinate international research on global-scale and regional-scale interactions between Earth&#39;s biological, chemical and physical processes and their interactions with human systems.

Four countries, such as the United States, Japan, India and Australia, have formalized its launching, presumably to constrain China. Although its launching statement talks about lofty ideas, it is basically geared to go for hard power at crunch time. The United States is providing its nuclear submarine technology to Australia so it has become a cause of concern for China. India, obviously, is an active member of the QUAD as the geopolitics of the region dictates so. It has intractable problems, rooted in history, with both China and Pakistan. Nepal is tilting towards China geopolitically. Sri Lanka has huge Chinese investments but India is also focused to control it. Bangladesh, though a small country, is sandwiched between China and India. As the indications suggest, Bangladesh may not join the QUAD as it would seriously impair its relations with China. Bangladesh has to play a smart game of following an equidistance policy or neutrality. Getting entangled in the geopolitics/ fight between China and India may not bode well for Bangladesh. Playing high quality diplomacy supported by a technologically savvy military can be its existential option.

As a result, Kling merchants began arriving in Ayutthaya in greater numbers via the new network of Siamese-controlled ports and portages. Moreover, this study demonstrates the utility of greater synergy among South Asian, Southeast Asian, Thai, and Malay Studies through focusing on the exonyms employed in primary and secondary sources. Finally, this article contends that Ayutthaya's ethnic and religious cosmopolitanism was impacted by the arrival of South Asian Muslims, referred to as Kling in the Malay World and Khaek in Siam, approximately one century before Persians arrived in greater numbers.

However, international community has been performing its refugee mandate in an ostensible manner that is insufficient and contemptuous to their basic rights and dignity. Today, refugees have been grappling with scorn, suspicion and skepticism of national governments in their quest for durable solutions to human displacement and migration.

It is this matter of processing which forms the focus of this paper. In particular two issues warrant detailed examination. These are the passage of time between apprehension and court appearance, and the increasing practice of the prosecution to seek jail terms for what are, in substance, regulatory fisheries offences. The issue of default imprisonment for non payment of fines is also examined. There has been an emerging practice, where there is evidence of the resistance of arrest, to charge FFV crew under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) rather than section 108(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (Cth).

It is a paramilitary force which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs. Its officers are transferred from the Bangladesh Navy. The Bangladesh Coast Guard also performs the duty of maritime boarder security of Bangladesh. The headquarters is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Currently the coast guard has 1,282 personnel and 57 ships. A huge modernization plan named Coast Guard Goal 2030 has been undertaken to enhance its capabilities.\nThe Bangladesh Navy had been performing the duties of a Coast Guard in addition to own duties of maritime defense since the independence of Bangladesh. As time passed, the growing responsibility and workload became inconvenient for the Bangladesh Navy, with the increasing volume of policing duties at sea taking away from its primary role. The emergence of the Bangladesh Coast Guard was the result of the growing awareness in the Government for the requirement of a separate service to enforce national laws in the waters under national jurisdiction and ensure safety of life and property at sea. Following this the Coast Guard Act 1994 was passed by the Parliament in September 1994. Formally the Bangladesh Coast Guard in its present shape came into being on 14 February 1995 and started operational activities with two patrol craft received from Bangladesh Navy. The force is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Home Affairs.\nThe Bangladesh Coast Guard motto is \u2018Guardian at Sea\u2019. The Bangladesh Coast Guard is a unique force that carries out an array of civil and military responsibilities touching almost every facet of the Bangladesh maritime environment. The force now has a zone, three bases, 18 stations, 10 outpost, 57 different categories of water vessels and eight pontoons along with 1,282 manpower.

Early on in the development of synthetic fi bre, the big multinational companies like Du Pont and I G Farben pushed the market based on the great demand for synthetic fi bre nets.

"The essays collected in this volume demonstrate that during the age of revolution (1760s\u20131840s) most sectors of the maritime industries experienced higher levels of unrest than is usually recognized. Ranging across global contexts including the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans as well as the Caribbean, Andaman, and South China Seas, and exploring the actions of sailors, laborers, convicts, and slaves, this collection offers a fresh, sea-centered way of seeing the confluence between space, agency, and political economy during this crucial period. In this introduction we contend that the radicalism of the age of revolution can best be viewed as a geographically connected process, and that the maritime world was central to its multiple eruptions and global character. Mutiny therefore can be seen as part of something bigger and broader: what we have chosen to call maritime radicalism, a term as well as a concept that has had virtually no presence in the literature on the revolutiona...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73330745, "asset_id": 59375436, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58821256, "first_name": "Hamish", "last_name": "Maxwell-Stewart", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HMaxwellStewart", "display_name": "Hamish Maxwell-Stewart", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HMaxwellStewart?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58821256/43023562/34327042/s65_hamish.maxwell-stewart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4121, "name": "Atlantic World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_World?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4652, "name": "French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Revolution?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 15573, "name": "American Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Revolution?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 27533, "name": "Atlantic history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_history?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 29329, "name": "Mutiny and Military Unrest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mutiny_and_Military_Unrest?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 62138, "name": "Cape Town", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cape_Town?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 66183, "name": "Britain and French Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Britain_and_French_Revolution?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 184047, "name": "New South Wales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_South_Wales?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 202979, "name": "Amistad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amistad?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 257992, "name": "Historical Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 405669, "name": "Cura\u00e7ao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cura%C3%A7ao?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 642554, "name": "Atlantic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_History-18?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 58836553, "title": "A modified Kain-Fritsch scheme and its application for the simulation of an extreme precipitation event in Vietnam", "created_at": "2021-10-18T07:56:30.090-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/58836553/A_modified_Kain_Fritsch_scheme_and_its_application_for_the_simulation_of_an_extreme_precipitation_event_in_Vietnam?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_58836553", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73055064, "asset_id": 58836553, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 163093476, "first_name": "Tran", "last_name": "Tien", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TranTien124", "display_name": "Tran Tien", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TranTien124?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60285, "name": "Atmospheric sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atmospheric_sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 58212559, "title": "Can Pre-Storm Errors in the Low-Level Inflow Help Predict Spatial Displacement Errors in MCS Initiation?", "created_at": "2021-10-15T13:19:39.664-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/58212559/Can_Pre_Storm_Errors_in_the_Low_Level_Inflow_Help_Predict_Spatial_Displacement_Errors_in_MCS_Initiation?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_58212559", "summary": "The Great Plains low-level jet (LLJ) is a contributing factor to the initiation and evolution of nocturnal Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) in the central United States by supplying moisture, warm air advection, and a source of convergence.

The most studied downbursts are those occurring in the United States and continental Europe, but they can happen globally.

This stratification is driven by the salinity difference between the fresh surface waters of the northern bay and the supply of warm, salty water by the Southwest Monsoon Current (SMC). Despite the influence of the SMC on monsoon dynamics, observations of this current during the monsoon are sparse. Using data from high-resolution in situ measurements along an east\u2013west section at 8\u00b0N in the southern BoB, we calculate that the northward transport during July 2016 was between 16.7 and 24.5 Sv (1 Sv \u2261 106 m3 s\u22121), although up to \u2154 of this transport is associated with persistent recirculating eddies, including the Sri Lanka Dome.

However, summer and autumn showed the same highest average concentration of 0.31mg/m3. The relation between SST (daytime and nighttime) and Chl-a data was examined. The daytime and nighttime SST were negatively associated with Chl-a in the autumn to winter seasons, which means Chl-a concentration declined with SST increase.

Nine marketing channels were found in the retail markets and the shortest channel was observed when consumers directly bought fish from the producers. Most of the retailers were 30-45 years old whereas, 40% had no opportunity to receive institutional education though all of them can sign their name. In the retail markets, most of the fishes were sold without ice. Moreover, a total of 93 species were found whereas 65.59, 10.75, 9.68 and 13.98% were inland fish, marine fish, exotic fish and crustacean species, respectively. Perciformes (29.03%) outnumbered the other 11 orders and Cyprinidae was represented as dominant following 38 families. Most of the fish and shellfishes were (73.12%) available from capture fisheries and the fishes were harvested from nearby rivers of the study area. In the markets 37, 10, 8 and 6 inland species were in the least concern, near threatened, endangered and vulnerable category, respectively in the aspect of their biodiversity status in Bangladesh. Among the inland fishes, 39 species were small indigenous fish species (SIS) and demands for riverine fishes were higher than the culture fishes. The price of most of the fish and shellfishes were within 251 to 500 BDT per kg whereas, the maximum price of Tenualosa ilisha was higher than 750 BDT kg. Thirteen major constraints in the fish markets were 1 identified by the fish traders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69878040, "asset_id": 52775734, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30869368, "first_name": "Mohammad", "last_name": "Rashed", "domain_name": "sau-bd", "page_name": "MohammadRashed", "display_name": "Mohammad Rashed", "profile_url": "https://sau-bd.academia.edu/MohammadRashed?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30869368/9021385/38757830/s65_mohammad.rashed.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 683695, "name": "FISHERIES ECONOMICS AND MARKETING", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/FISHERIES_ECONOMICS_AND_MARKETING?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 52656335, "title": "Socioeconomic Assessment and Monitoring", "created_at": "2021-09-17T11:13:43.926-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/52656335/Socioeconomic_Assessment_and_Monitoring?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_52656335", "summary": "This is a report of the Community based Socioeconomic Monitoring program carried out\nin Vidathativu village from March to June 2015 under the Mangrove Conservation and\nManagement Project supported by GEF Small grants Programme and the SocMon capacity\nbuilding program supported by BOBLME.\nThe program was initiated with the premise that long term sustainability for coastal\necosystem management and monitoring programs can be ensured, if the local community\nparticipate and feel a sense of ownership in the program.\nAn additional benefit of this program is that it serves as both a capacity building and an\nawareness building program for the local communities who are directly involved in using\nthe ecosystem goods and services and those who are involved in monitoring them.\nThe project was carried out in partnership with a civil society group called the Community\nAid Foundation and the SOCMON Mannar group.\nBy monitoring the Vidathaltivu community\u2019s dependence on the ecosystem goods and\nservices, and their perceptions on the current status of the ecosystem goods and services,\nwe are able to arrive at a comprehensive mapping of coastal ecosystem related\nactivities of the Vidathathivu fishermen and derive several types of information:\na) Livelihood dependence on ecosystem goods and services\nb) Poverty and dependence on ecosystem goods and services\nc) Conflicts/ co-operation for using the same space and anthropogenic stress on the\nvarious lagoon habitats\nd) Perception of the stakeholders regarding resource status, conservation and MPA\u2019s.\nWhere possible the socioeconomic monitoring information has been supplemented with\nbiophysical monitoring information, as available from the CCD and IUCN reports.Management\nadvice has been provided on the basis of our findings.\nThis report is divided into 8 chapters.\nChapter 1, introduces the reader to the Mannar district and the goals and objectives of\nthis project\nChapter 2 explains how the project was carried out and the methods used for data collection.\n!8\nChapter 3 contains a short history of the Vidathalthivu village, the displacement and migration\nof the people and its social and ecological profile .\nChapter 4: describes the infrastructure services available in the village, business development\nstrategies of the community and their perception of wealth and poverty status\nand household demography.\nChapter 5: describes the coastal and marine activities of the Vidathalthivu community\nand describes the seasonality of resource use in a seasonal calendar and resource-activity\nmaps developed by the stakeholders themselves, place names for fishing grounds\nand explains the perceptions of the local people on the state of the fishing grounds, it\nalso includes a fisher stakeholder analysis and describes the market chain.\nChapter 6: presents the community perceptions towards they ecological resources and\ntheir management.\nChapter 7: Introduces the reader to the Management body that governs resource use in\nthe coastal areas.

The Ram Sethu is an aquapelagic zone, not merely in geo-historical terms but also in psychological ways, that is largely experienced in the Indian consciousness through evolution of ancient folkloric motifs in contemporary media-loric polemic. As an aquapelagic imaginary, or indeed a performed aquapelago, the Ram Sethu is sustained by accumulating epistemic plurality from multiple geological, secularist, sacred and environmentalist interpretations. This epistemological plurality or transcendence of (geo-)logocentric meanings is an inevitable function of aquapelagic imaginaries, even more so of the Ram Sethu, which is reproduced by multiple determinate negations of religion (negating ambitions of economic development), developmentalism (negating themes of environmental sustainability), and environmentalism (negating majoritarian discourses of what constitutes the sacred).

Chinese and Indian defensive and offensive actions are characterized by complex historical and political enmity, and the maritime dilemma has resulted from a lack of understanding of each other\u2019s intents. The dilemma has the potential to spiral out of control and spread to other littoral actors, making it a cascading one, in the Bay of Bengal. The dilemma will result in breaking out more aggressive and frequent clashes and even war where these powers, and the littorals may tempt to take it into the maritime realms. This monograph shows why the dilemma exists in the first place with the help of defensive realism, a subvariant of the neorealist school of thought in international relations theories. The monograph argues, with the help of a variant of the game theory, namely prisoner\u2019s dilemma, that they are less likely to cooperate with each other on maritime security issues, rather pursue the littorals separately to be in strategic alliances with an aim to balance off each other\u2019s influences in the region.

The Bay of Bengal region, which is gradually coming under the focus of international politics in the 21st Century, is also experiencing a number of non-traditional threats that need to be recognized and resolved through transnational cooperation.

Additional publications address potential environmental, economic, and social implications for Florida. \u00a0", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67931837, "asset_id": 49625239, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37641342, "first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Krimsky", "domain_name": "florida", "page_name": "LisaKrimsky", "display_name": "Lisa Krimsky", "profile_url": "https://florida.academia.edu/LisaKrimsky?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2200733, "name": "EDIS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/EDIS?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49622919, "title": "Surface Winds at Landfall of Hurricane Andrew (1992)\u2014A Reply", "created_at": "2021-07-08T15:37:59.828-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49622919/Surface_Winds_at_Landfall_of_Hurricane_Andrew_1992_A_Reply?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_49622919", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67930830, "asset_id": 49622919, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 187971734, "first_name": "Da-Lin", "last_name": "Zhang", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DaLinZhang1", "display_name": "Da-Lin Zhang", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DaLinZhang1?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 60285, "name": "Atmospheric sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atmospheric_sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49488040, "title": "Some population parameters of Bengal yellowfin seabream, Acanthopagrus longispinnis (Val.), from Hatiya Island, Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2021-07-01T00:53:05.429-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49488040/Some_population_parameters_of_Bengal_yellowfin_seabream_Acanthopagrus_longispinnis_Val_from_Hatiya_Island_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_49488040", "summary": "Size frequency, length-weight relationships (LWRs), length-length relationships (LLRs), and relative condition factor (K n) was studied in an estuarine fish the Bengal yellowfin seabream, Acanthopagrus longispinnis (Val.), from Hatiya Island in the Meghna River estuary. Specimens were caught with fixed purse nets of two mesh sizes (0.2 to 0.5 inch and 2.0 to 2.5 inch) from January to March 2020. The total body length of A. longispinnis ranged between 5.8 and 9.3 cm throughout the sampling period. The length-weight relationships for A. longispinnis was highly significant (p < .001), and the adjusted r 2 value was 0.921. The calculated growth coefficient (b) for A. longispinnis was 3.163, which indicated a hyper-allometric growth pattern. The length-length equation TL = 1.1384 SL + 0.4899 for unsexed A. longispinnis was highly significant (p = 0.001, r 2 = 0.951). There were no significant variations in relative condition factors among the specimens of different length classes (5.5-9.5 cm). No information regarding length-weight or length-length relationships for A. longispinnis was previously reported in FishBase. Our estimated LWR and LLR parameters for A. longispinnis can be useful for management and conservation purposes of this estuarine species.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67828638, "asset_id": 49488040, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1086420, "first_name": "Dr. Mohammad Abdul Momin", "last_name": "Siddique", "domain_name": "nstu", "page_name": "DrMohammadAbdulMominSiddique", "display_name": "Dr. Mohammad Abdul Momin Siddique", "profile_url": "https://nstu.academia.edu/DrMohammadAbdulMominSiddique?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1086420/376775/48068837/s65_dr._mohammad_abdul_momin.siddique.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 14490, "name": "Fisheries Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries_Biology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17535, "name": "Fish population dynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fish_population_dynamics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1253987, "name": "Length - Weight Relationships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Length_-_Weight_Relationships?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2657331, "name": "Estuarine and Coastal Fishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Estuarine_and_Coastal_Fishes?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49140680, "title": "A modified Kain-Fritsch scheme and its application for the simulation of an extreme precipitation event in Vietnam", "created_at": "2021-06-06T01:19:07.753-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49140680/A_modified_Kain_Fritsch_scheme_and_its_application_for_the_simulation_of_an_extreme_precipitation_event_in_Vietnam?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_49140680", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67531184, "asset_id": 49140680, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63966542, "first_name": "Tran", "last_name": "tan tien", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Trantantien", "display_name": "Tran tan tien", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Trantantien?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60285, "name": "Atmospheric sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atmospheric_sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 48927890, "title": "In-situ datasets of important physical and bio-chemical parameters in the continental shelf of the northern Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2021-05-15T11:20:57.793-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48927890/In_situ_datasets_of_important_physical_and_bio_chemical_parameters_in_the_continental_shelf_of_the_northern_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_48927890", "summary": "Data equipped with this article were collected from Northern Bay of Bengal (NBoB) wrapping both the eastern and west- ern coast for CTD and sediment samples and only the eastern coast for water sampling. In-situ data of physical parameters, heavy metals, elements, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), nutri- ents, chlorophyll-a and phaeopigment were sampled across the shallow continental shelf. These data were assembled from 15 CTD points, 76 water samples, and 10 surface sed- iment samples adjacent to Bangladesh coast. Vertical CTD profiles were collected for Temperature ( \u00b0C), Salinity (PSU), Density (kg m \u22123 ), Turbidity (NTU), Fluorescence (mg m \u22123 ), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO, mg/l). Heavy metals (mg/l) of water column enlisted as Calcium (Ca), Cadmium (Cd), Cop- per (Cu), Cobalt (Co), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Magnesium(Mg), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn). Total Organic Car- bon (TOC) was measured as Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) in ppm. Measurements of Chlorophyll - a, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Ammonia, Silica and Phaeopigment were taken from 76 water sampling points. The survey was con- ducted with the assistance of a fishing vessel \u2018Agro food-4 \u2018of \u2018Sea Resource Ltd.\u2019 lengthening a fishing period from Jan- uary to February (in winter), 2016. SBE 19 plus V2 CTD ma- chine was deployed for sampling of vertical physical features, Niskin sampler of HYDRO-BIOS consisting of a non-metallic interior was used to collect water sample. Sediment was col- lected by Van Veen Grab sampler with built-in messenger. Water samples were analyzed following the standard pro- cedure in the laboratory to access in-situ data. The shallow coastal and offshore regions of Bangladesh support for vast biological resources to its adjacent inhabitants. Therefore, un- derstanding the influence of physico-chemical properties on other biological resources in coastal ecosystem is a crucial one to investigate. However, the shelf region of the BoB has a lack of in-situ baseline or reference data to compare with in terms of ocean biogeochemistry. Thus, these datasets can be utilized for further reference and also in validating other remotely-sensed physico-chemical parameters in this region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67331005, "asset_id": 48927890, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44634583, "first_name": "Abdullah -Al-", "last_name": "Hasan", "domain_name": "univdhaka", "page_name": "AbdullahAlHasan", "display_name": "Abdullah -Al- Hasan", "profile_url": "https://univdhaka.academia.edu/AbdullahAlHasan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44634583/11865640/72132820/s65_abdullah_-al-.hasan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16691, "name": "Physical Oceanography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physical_Oceanography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406850, "name": "Marine Environment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_Environment?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 528641, "name": "Biological and Physical oceanography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_and_Physical_oceanography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 48781621, "title": "Fishing in the Troubled Waters: Fishermen Issue in India\u2013Sri Lanka Relations", "created_at": "2021-05-05T22:38:39.844-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48781621/Fishing_in_the_Troubled_Waters_Fishermen_Issue_in_India_Sri_Lanka_Relations?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_48781621", "summary": "India\u2019s relations with its neighbours in the maritime domain have received less scholarly attention.

Sri Lanka is chosen as a case, not only because the island state is India\u2019s closest maritime neighbour but also due to the existence of deep interactions between the two countries in diverse fields both at governmental and non-governmental levels. In the maritime domain, in the present context, technically speaking, there is no problem between the two countries.

"summary": "Data equipped with this article were collected from Northern Bay of Bengal (NBoB) wrapping both the eastern and west- ern coast for CTD and sediment samples and only the eastern coast for water sampling. In-situ data of physical parameters, heavy metals, elements, Total Organic Carbon (TOC), nutri- ents, chlorophyll-a and phaeopigment were sampled across the shallow continental shelf. These data were assembled from 15 CTD points, 76 water samples, and 10 surface sed- iment samples adjacent to Bangladesh coast. Vertical CTD profiles were collected for Temperature ( \u00b0C), Salinity (PSU), Density (kg m \u22123 ), Turbidity (NTU), Fluorescence (mg m \u22123 ), and Dissolved Oxygen (DO, mg/l). Heavy metals (mg/l) of water column enlisted as Calcium (Ca), Cadmium (Cd), Cop- per (Cu), Cobalt (Co), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Magnesium(Mg), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb), and Zinc (Zn). Total Organic Car- bon (TOC) was measured as Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC) in ppm. Measurements of Chlorophyll - a, Nitrate, Nitrite, Phosphate, Ammonia, Silica and Phaeopigment were taken from 76 water sampling points. The survey was con- ducted with the assistance of a fishing vessel \u2018Agro food-4 \u2018of \u2018Sea Resource Ltd.\u2019 lengthening a fishing period from Jan- uary to February (in winter), 2016. SBE 19 plus V2 CTD ma- chine was deployed for sampling of vertical physical features, Niskin sampler of HYDRO-BIOS consisting of a non-metallic interior was used to collect water sample. Sediment was col- lected by Van Veen Grab sampler with built-in messenger. Water samples were analyzed following the standard pro- cedure in the laboratory to access in-situ data. The shallow coastal and offshore regions of Bangladesh support for vast biological resources to its adjacent inhabitants. Therefore, un- derstanding the influence of physico-chemical properties on other biological resources in coastal ecosystem is a crucial one to investigate. However, the shelf region of the BoB has a lack of in-situ baseline or reference data to compare with in terms of ocean biogeochemistry. Thus, these datasets can be utilized for further reference and also in validating other remotely-sensed physico-chemical parameters in this region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66213008, "asset_id": 46037009, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 190939827, "first_name": "Most Israt Jahan", "last_name": "Mili", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MostIsratJahanMili", "display_name": "Most Israt Jahan Mili", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MostIsratJahanMili?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 28047010, "first_name": "Kazi Belayet", "last_name": "Hossain", "domain_name": "xmu", "page_name": "Kazi", "display_name": "Kazi Belayet Hossain", "profile_url": "https://xmu.academia.edu/Kazi?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28047010/19886108/19699384/s65_kazi_belayet.hossain.jpg"}, {"id": 43979782, "first_name": "Sultan Al", "last_name": "Nahian", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SNahian", "display_name": "Sultan Al Nahian", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SNahian?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43979782/36259420/31122741/s65_sultan_al.nahian.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 80421, "name": "Chemical oceanography,Environmental and Marine Geochemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemical_oceanography_Environmental_and_Marine_Geochemistry?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 528641, "name": "Biological and Physical oceanography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_and_Physical_oceanography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 626774, "name": "CTD", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CTD?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 672960, "name": "Marine Data", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_Data?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1664348, "name": "Marine-Derived Nutrients", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine-Derived_Nutrients?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 45294413, "title": "Co-operative maritime diplomacy to curb transnational maritime crimes in Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2021-03-01T20:06:06.707-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45294413/Co_operative_maritime_diplomacy_to_curb_transnational_maritime_crimes_in_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_45294413", "summary": "\"Diplomacy\" is a term widely used in both the analysis and practice of international relations. As an approach to the topic, it\"s worth understanding a few definitions in the launch. \"Diplomacy\" is basically the management of international relations. Therefore, maritime diplomacy is the management of international relations through the maritime domain (Miere, 2014, p. 7). The cooperative maritime diplomacy could be further elaborated as an attempt to support soft power through the use of hard power assets. It is not only naval components engaged in these events; coast guard; maritime constabulary agencies can also undertake maritime diplomatic operations. In my opinion, cooperative maritime diplomacy could be used as a tool to curb transnational organized crimes. This area of study encompasses a spectrum of activities such as maritime conferences, port visits, combine maritime exercises, civil maritime activities, combine operations, combine patrol, intelligence operations, maritime surveillance etc. According to the readings, maritime diplomacy is largely neglected in academic literature and rarely witness studies relevant to the Sri Lankan maritime domain in present day literature. The use of maritime diplomacy can reflect the international order changes and reduce the international tension. This area has specifically put on attention over combine maritime operations and sharing maritime intelligence to conduct operations.

It is predicted that coral reefs could extinct soon from the world. Bangladesh has only one coral Island named Saint Martin, locally known as 'Narikel Jinjira'. This is one of the most popular tourist spots in Bangladesh, entertaining thousands of tourists per year due to its unique landscape, blue water, and coral colonies' presence. This Island lost most of the coral in recent times. The coral reef ecosystem management needs to focus on the reformation of the legal and institutional frameworks for enhancing the local administration's capabilities to address the adverse effects of the stressors and promote the ecosystem services by improving the resilience. The study aims at analysing the existing institutional and legal frameworks for conserving the coral reefs. To collect data, fieldwork was conducted at Saint Martin Island and Teknaf Upazila. The related literature on legal documents was reviewed critically. It is found that despite having legal mechanisms and institutional frameworks, non-compliances with laws and poor coordination among different sectors are widespread, resulting in severe degradation of coral resources. In most of the laws, robust institutional arrangements were ignored. The study recommends integrating the legal and institutional frameworks governing the environment, tourism, and fisheries sectors. Effective marine governance, increasing coordination among different sectors, amending some existing rules, and activating MCS (monitoring, control, surveillance) system can improve the scenario.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65933918, "asset_id": 44829325, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16534762, "first_name": "Md.

Today, the oceans and the seas around us are bristling with activities. These activities range from trade, fishing, offshore gas, offshore wind farms, exploration activities for deep seabed mining, marine scientific research, offshore solar farms, submarine cable lying, and many more activities both benign and offensive. For all these activities to be possible, there exists a need for knowing and mapping of the ocean surface and the ocean floor so that the planned activity at sea can be executed in a manner and to the extent that it is successful and does not cause harm to either humans or equipment. Such knowledge of the Maritime Domain that allows the execution of an activity at sea with ease and finesse may be called as the Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and is necessarily not limited to the security construct alone.\r\nSince the oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the Earth\u2019s surface and is ever so dynamic, MDA cannot be achieved by one single entity of a nation or a person. Though nations and organisations have tried it alone, they have realised that a cooperative mechanism provides a better, more accurate and more expansive MDA.

Several seasons of excavation at the site resulted in the discovery of a brick-built complex architectural composition, exuberantly decorated with stucco sculptures,\ndecorative motifs, and designed bricks. The reconstructed plan of the structure hinted at the existence of a set of two monasteries at the site. Renewed excavation by the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums,\nGovernment of West Bengal, under the direction of Amal Roy further resulted in the discovery of, inter alia, a set of fragmented inscribed clay tablets the writings on which remained a challenge, though their physical\nconstitution fairly suggested them to be monastic sealings.

In 2012 and 2013, the Sri Lankan government issued fuel subsidy to motorised fishing vessels due to high fuel prices. Non-motorized fishing vessels owners did not receive the subsidy. This study covers the impacts of fuel subsidy in Sri Lanka coastal fishery, no previous study were found with similar analyses. This project aims to provide such study, the paper is divided into three parts: Firstly, evaluation of the impact of fuel subsidy on fishing effort and vessels profit in Jaffna coastal fisheries in Sri Lanka. Secondly, asses quality of Sri Lanka coastal fisheries data as input to fuel subsidy methods. Thirdly, identify suitable ways to improve data quality and estimate the cost of modification. Six different types of fishing vessels are engaged in fishing activities in Sri Lanka marine fisheries sector; four types of motorised fishing vessels and two types of non-motorized fishing vessels. For the evaluation, monthly coastal fisheries data were collected from three landing sites from the Department of Fisheries in Jaffna. Suitable methods for the evaluation were obtained by reviewing the literature of fuel subsidy in the fisheries sector. Analyses of available data in Sri Lanka coastal fisheries reveal the current data not to be sufficient as input to fuel subsidy methods. The number of vessel groups was skewed from one period to another (shifted), the catch by landing sites could not be separated by fishing vessels, and the data of fishing cost was missing (i.e. fishing hours and amount of fuel consumption). As a recommendation, the author suggests three data collection methods to improve the data quality as a base to the scientific decision in the coastal fisheries. Recommended methods were grouped by the technology needed. The advanced complete enumeration is the most technological method, it is designed to monitor the fishing vessels, fishing activities and landing sites with 24 hours surveillance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64657452, "asset_id": 44278807, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42062557, "first_name": "Ragavan", "last_name": "Nadarajah", "domain_name": "universityofjaffna", "page_name": "Ragavan", "display_name": "Ragavan Nadarajah", "profile_url": "https://universityofjaffna.academia.edu/Ragavan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42062557/13159097/14461945/s65_ragavan.nadarajah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10001, "name": "Fisheries Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries_Management?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24739, "name": "Fisheries Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries_Economics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34743, "name": "Small scale fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Small_scale_fisheries?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44276407, "title": "Overview on tropical cyclone over Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2020-10-11T20:43:03.526-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44276407/Overview_on_tropical_cyclone_over_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_44276407", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64654642, "asset_id": 44276407, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148382599, "first_name": "Ishrat Jahan", "last_name": "Eva", "domain_name": "dhakauniversity", "page_name": "IshratJahanEva", "display_name": "Ishrat Jahan Eva", "profile_url": "https://dhakauniversity.academia.edu/IshratJahanEva?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148382599/40874753/98638431/s65_ishrat_jahan.eva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 157915, "name": "Cyclone Sidr", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyclone_Sidr?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1729670, "name": "Tropical Cyclone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tropical_Cyclone?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44272725, "title": "Threatened Fishes and other aquatic animals of Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2020-10-11T05:17:17.924-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44272725/Threatened_Fishes_and_other_aquatic_animals_of_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_44272725", "summary": "The Bay of Bengal (BoB) is the north-eastern extended part of the Indian Ocean, lies north of 6\u00b0N latitude and west of about 95\u00b0E longitude, the Andaman Sea and Andaman Islands excluded (IHO 1953).

The fi shermen's tests showed an increase in catches which were measured up to 400% compared with natural fi bre nets, while the State was a more reluctant supporter of the new materials. Early on in the development of synthetic fi bre, the big multinational companies like Du Pont and I G Farben pushed the market based on the great demand for synthetic fi bre nets.

The environmental factors behind bacterial community composition and Vibrio distribution were investigated in an estuarine system of a cholera-endemic region in the coastline of Bangladesh. Higher temperatures and sewage pollution were important drivers of the abundance of toxigenic Vibrio cholerae. A closer relation between non-culturable Vibrio and particulate organic matter (POM) was inferred during the post-monsoon. The distribution of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Vibrio genus was likely driven by salinity and temperature. The resuspension of sediments increased Vibrio abundance and organic nutrient concentrations. The \u03b4 13 C dynamic in POM followed an increasing gradient from freshwater to marine stations; nevertheless, it was not a marker of sewage pollution. Bacteroidales and culturable coliforms were reliable indicators of untreated wastewater during pre and post-monsoon seasons. The presumptive incorporation of depleted-ammonium derived from ammonification processes under the hypoxic conditions, by some microorganisms such as Cloacibacterium and particularly by Arcobacter nearby the sewage discharge, contributed to the drastic 15 N depletion in the POM. The likely capacity of extracellular polymeric substances production of these taxa may facilitate the colonization of POM from anthropogenic origin and may signify important properties for wastewater bioremediation.

Yet, our understanding of the drivers of multi-decadal variability of the ISM is far from being complete. In this context, large-scale forcing of ISM rainfall variability with multi-decadal resolution over the last two millennia is investigated using new records of sea surface salinity (\u03b418Ow) and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) from the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Higher \u03b418Ow values during the Dark Age Cold Period (1550 to 1250 years BP) and the Little Ice Age (700 to 200 years BP) are suggestive of reduced ISM rainfall, whereas lower \u03b418Ow values during the Medieval Warm Period (1200 to 800 years BP) and the major portion of the Roman Warm Period (1950 to 1550 years BP) indicate a wetter ISM. This variability in ISM rainfall appears to be modulated by the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) via changes in large-scale thermal contrast between the Asian landmass and the Indian Ocean, a relationship that is also identifiable in the observational data of the last century. Therefore, we suggest that inter-hemispheric scale interactions between such extratropical forcing mechanisms and global warming are likely to be influential in determining future trends in ISM rainfall.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64149160, "asset_id": 43829777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2439067, "first_name": "Champoungam", "last_name": "Panmei", "domain_name": "iitr-in", "page_name": "ChampoungamPanmei", "display_name": "Champoungam Panmei", "profile_url": "https://iitr-in.academia.edu/ChampoungamPanmei?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2439067/766279/9452851/s65_champoungam.panmei.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 30505, "name": "Planktonic Foraminifera", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Planktonic_Foraminifera?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 140523, "name": "Indian summer monsoon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_summer_monsoon?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 481383, "name": "Stable oxygen isotopes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_oxygen_isotopes?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2630302, "name": "Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atlantic_Multidecadal_Oscillation_AMO_?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 3735614, "name": "Mg/Ca-derived SST ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mg_Ca_derived_SST?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 43536418, "title": "Recentering the Bay of Bengal Connected spaces in an inter-Asian bordersea", "created_at": "2020-07-06T20:52:40.109-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43536418/Recentering_the_Bay_of_Bengal_Connected_spaces_in_an_inter_Asian_bordersea?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_43536418", "summary": "FOCUS for IIAS Newsletter Spring issue 2020\nThe interconnected world history of the Bay of Bengal is re-enacted in people\u2019s memories,\nhabits and everyday practices.

Although studies reported formalin contamination in many different commercial large table fish's items but research pinpoints the formalin contamination in Small Indigenous Species (SIS) of fishes are scant. The present study was aimed at detecting the presence of formalin in SIS from different fish markets of Sylhet Sadar Upazila, Bangladesh. Five SIS taxa explicitly Coricaso borna (Kachki), Amblypharyngodon mola (Mola), Gudusia chapra (Chapila), Mystus tengra (Tengra), Puntius ticto (Tit punti) were purposely sampled during winter season (November to December, 2014) and summer (May to June, 2015) from eight fish markets for the detection of formalin content by using formalin testing kit developed by Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR). A total of 160 SIS individuals were collected, where 50 samples were contaminated with formalin in which 32 samples (40%) were in summer and 18 (22.5%) in the winter season. The rate of formaldehyde contamination was higher in C. soborna (100% both in summer and winter) followed by G. chapra (75% in summer and 12.5% in winter) and A. mola (50% in summer and 0% in winter) respectively. The formalin contamination was found statistically significant (P value <0.05) for Chapila and Mola in both season. It is, therefore, strongly recommended to ensure the institutional and government support and extension aids for improving the formalin testing methods, marketing systems and market facilities that can ensure a good quality fresh/safe fish in the markets for consumers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63083642, "asset_id": 42847569, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32088401, "first_name": "Md.

The primary cause for this problem is due to natural and manmade catastrophes that happen frequently. When a disaster occurs, people in the low-income group become homeless and unemployed. The government helps them by providing permanent shelter, but due to poverty and lack of employment, the victims rent out the spaces provided to them to make a living and in turn they choose to live in slums. Hence, the most affected people are fishermen and they live by the coast. The slum population increases rapidly along the coast which changes the urban fabric of the city and the Karnafully coastline. This study aims to improve the lifestyle of the fisherman community in an incremental manner by developing the 'Delipara' slum area-that currently has informal settlements occupied by the fishermen families. Observation, data collection & analysis have been used as research methodology for this study. The proposed permanent shelter modules along with a community core will help in community redevelopment that facilitates transition from informal settlements into permanent settled neighborhoods. The social community will benefit from the on-site facilities by creating an opportunity for psychological healing through community support and social harmony.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62515011, "asset_id": 42356218, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52542461, "first_name": "Sajia", "last_name": "Niha", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SajiaNiha", "display_name": "Sajia Niha", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SajiaNiha?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 594115, "name": "Incremental Development in Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Incremental_Development_in_Housing?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3601662, "name": "Environment Friendly Low Cost Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environment_Friendly_Low_Cost_Housing?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42270543, "title": "Flags for sale: An empirical assessment of flag of convenience desirability to foreign vessels", "created_at": "2020-03-20T07:20:03.873-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42270543/Flags_for_sale_An_empirical_assessment_of_flag_of_convenience_desirability_to_foreign_vessels?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_42270543", "summary": "Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing costs the global economy tens of billions of US dollars annually, although accurate estimates of the current extent of this activity remain uncertain. Those that break or avoid fisheries management rules often employ tactics, such as registering their vessels under foreign flags (commonly known as \"flags of convenience\" (FoCs)), to carry out their often illegal activities. The practice of using FoCs by fishing vessels impedes prevention efforts to effectively deter or eliminate IUU fishing. While literature has proposed a large number of factors explaining why certain flags are more desirable than others, an empirical assessment of these proposed factors has not yet been made. This research, therefore, fills this gap by empirically evaluating 38 such factors. Results show that desirable flags are flags of countries that are largely non-cooperative with international efforts to sustainably manage shared fish stocks and prevent IUU fishing, regardless of their ratification of major international agreements. The same flags are easy to acquire and allow fishing vessels access to a large number of countries' exclusive economic zones and areas managed by regional fisheries management organizations.

The present study assessed livelihood status of the hilsa fishers employing household interviews, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), and key informant interviews from July to October, 2018. Main livelihood activities were fishing; fish drying, fish trading, net mending, boat making and repairing activity, agriculture, small business and daily labor. Among total 288 households, 150 were exclusively involved in fishing, 110 fishing and other agricultural farming and only 28 were involved in small business. Maximum number of fishers (39%) belonged to the age group of 31 to 40 years, 21% belonged to the age group of 21 to 30 years. fishers' annual income ranged from 32000 + 510 BDT to 48000 + 750 BDT whereas 10% had annual income 100,000 + 1120 BDT. The overall livelihood status of the hilsa fishers was not satisfactory due to some social and economic constraints like increasing fishers' number, low income, lack of alternative income generating activities, loan problems, piracy, price hike and conflicts with stakeholders for resources. Effective initiatives and their proper implementations are very crucial to improve the livelihood of the fishers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62032440, "asset_id": 41904610, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22101112, "first_name": "Atiqur Rahman", "last_name": "Sunny", "domain_name": "sust", "page_name": "AtiqurSunny", "display_name": "Atiqur Rahman Sunny", "profile_url": "https://sust.academia.edu/AtiqurSunny?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22101112/18050113/18051719/s65_atiqur.sunny.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9769, "name": "Sociology of Fisheries and Aquaculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Fisheries_and_Aquaculture?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10001, "name": "Fisheries Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries_Management?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40021, "name": "Coastal Zone Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_Zone_Management?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41408, "name": "Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecosystem-Based_Fisheries_Management?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41409, "name": "Climate Impacts to Fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Impacts_to_Fisheries?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 67731, "name": "Sustainable Livelihoods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Livelihoods?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 226330, "name": "Socioeconomic Status", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socioeconomic_Status?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 41854350, "title": "Sri Lanka and BIMSTEC: Past, Present and Prospects for the Future", "created_at": "2020-02-04T06:59:09.667-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41854350/Sri_Lanka_and_BIMSTEC_Past_Present_and_Prospects_for_the_Future?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_41854350", "summary": "The paper analyses Sri Lanka\u2019s role in the BIMSTEC in the context of the evolving dynamics among the member countries, the securitised nature of the Bay of Bengal and the climatic conditions that are increasingly affecting the region.

The wide use of a conversion factor of 1.724 (LOI:OC) oversimplifies the relationship between LOI and OC, and may lead to significant biases in estimating global sediment carbon stocks in 'blue carbon' ecosystems. We estimated sediment OC using LOI at different mangrove and saltmarsh sites in Hong Kong. OC of matched samples from the same sites was independently measured using an elemental analyzer. The sites are mostly typical mineral sediments with LOI less than 8%. The conversion factors of LOI:OC are 5.376 and 4.673 for mangroves and saltmarshes, respectively. This means the use of the common conversion factor will overestimate mangrove and saltmarsh sediment carbon stocks by 212% and 171%, respectively, in our studied sites. We also found that LOI can be used to estimate leaf and root OC (organic nitrogen) by conversion factors of 2.978 (12.837) and 1.737 (27.027), respectively. Our results highlight the urgency to correct the bias in estimating OC and carbon stocks from LOI in 'blue carbon' ecosystems, and the potential of using LOI for estimating leaf and root OC and organic nitrogen. The difference in the conversion factors between mangroves and saltmarshes, and between mineral and organic sediments should be taken into account when estimating OC from LOI for these wetlands.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61755407, "asset_id": 41601701, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4059208, "first_name": "Xiaoguang", "last_name": "Ouyang", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "XiaoguangOuyang", "display_name": "Xiaoguang Ouyang", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/XiaoguangOuyang?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4059208/1554641/18899849/s65_xiaoguang.ouyang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 402, "name": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Science?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10299, "name": "Mangrove Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mangrove_Ecology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 211315, "name": "Elemental and Isotopic Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elemental_and_Isotopic_Analysis?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 454574, "name": "Soil Organic Carbon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soil_Organic_Carbon?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 556082, "name": "Forest Carbon Stock", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forest_Carbon_Stock?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 769183, "name": "Saltmarsh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Saltmarsh?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 41169485, "title": "Dissertation Workshop", "created_at": "2019-12-03T06:58:12.587-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41169485/Dissertation_Workshop?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_41169485", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61409611, "asset_id": 41169485, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4180569, "first_name": "Rage", "last_name": "Taufika", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "RageTaufika", "display_name": "Rage Taufika", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/RageTaufika?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4180569/1636317/31373336/s65_rage.taufika.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 939415, "name": "Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Illegal_Unreported_and_Unregulated_IUU_Fishing?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41036412, "title": "Strategic Shift in Foreign Policy Since 2014", "created_at": "2019-11-23T12:08:50.868-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41036412/Strategic_Shift_in_Foreign_Policy_Since_2014?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_41036412", "summary": "The centralisation of this research is panelised on \u2018Indian Foreign Policy\u2019 since 2014, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s policies are substantially abided to the minimal.

They appear in a small temple built by the Cantonese community in an iconic building on Black Burn Lane in central Kolkata (Figure 6.1), India,1 where the research for this essay started. It became clear in the course of the research that these two buddhas were part of the connected history of the emigrants from Sihui city \u56db\u6703\u5e02 in Guangdong Province in the present-day People's Republic of China who settled in the Malay Peninsula and India during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This essay examines the emergence and evolution of the Ruan-Liang legends in Sihui, the spread of the temples dedicated to the two buddhas to several towns of Malaysia and in Kol-kata, and the reclaiming of the Ruan-Liang heritage by the city of Sihui in recent years. This examination is undertaken in the wider contexts of mobility, the localization of religious beliefs, and the emergence of mixed identities and heritages. The essay attempts to explain the ways in which the migrants from Sihui came to terms with their local surroundings, made efforts to preserve their distinct sub-regional/speech group identity among the other Chinese settlers , and addressed their need for divine protection and spiritual support. With each move, the new heritage produced by these migrants sought a 're-course to the past' ,2 was adjusted to the present and forged new linkages to shape the future. All this involved engaging with local circumstances, sustaining imaginary connections to the ancestral homeland and fulfilling the other-worldly needs of the members of the migrant community. The mixed heritages produced by these migrants eventually became entangled with the present-day circumstances of their ancestral homeland, which, in turn, has had to come to terms with the experiences and expectations of its overseas communities. As a consequence, it is argued, the heritage of Sihui city has also become a mixture of local and overseas experiences and expectations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61040799, "asset_id": 40759483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4389655, "first_name": "Tansen", "last_name": "Sen", "domain_name": "shanghai-nyu", "page_name": "TansenSen", "display_name": "Tansen Sen", "profile_url": "https://shanghai-nyu.academia.edu/TansenSen?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4389655/1777949/4982288/s65_tansen.sen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 40623464, "title": "Blue Economy", "created_at": "2019-10-14T22:00:08.499-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40623464/Blue_Economy?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_40623464", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60902774, "asset_id": 40623464, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96044933, "first_name": "Khairul", "last_name": "Islam", "domain_name": "jkkniu", "page_name": "KhairulIslam", "display_name": "Khairul Islam", "profile_url": "https://jkkniu.academia.edu/KhairulIslam?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/96044933/34027382/30075424/s65_khairul.islam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 238899, "name": "Blue Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blue_Economy?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40507859, "title": "FISHERIES DIVERSITY AROUND NIJHUM DWIP ISLAND OF BANGLADESH IN RELATION TO SOME ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS", "created_at": "2019-10-02T22:56:21.673-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40507859/FISHERIES_DIVERSITY_AROUND_NIJHUM_DWIP_ISLAND_OF_BANGLADESH_IN_RELATION_TO_SOME_ENVIRONMENTAL_PARAMETERS?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_40507859", "summary": "Nijhum Dwip Island drew a remarkable attraction in terms of its biodiversity conservation.

Among the fish species included in the analysis, Liza sp. Johnius argentatus, Coilia dussumieri, and Odontamblyopus rubicundus showed affinity to high salinity and Metapenaeous monoceros showed direct relationship with temperature. The species Trypauchen vagina and Peaneous monodon were also found directly related to pH. Other species did not show any strong affinity with higher values of any environmental variables. Environmental influence was more extensive during pre-monsoon season when salinity fluctuation leads to an increase in diversity.

The paper also investigates changes of land uses (vegetation, settlement pattern, agricultural land, water bodies) in course of time using RS and GIS for the last fifty years. It also made efforts to find out scenario of land erosion and land accretion along the coastal shoreline of Bay of Bengal which demark the changes of shoreline as well as nature of Bay of Bengal. The study intended to draw a scenario of human-nature interaction align with geomorphological dynamics and sea level changes caused by climate induced extremities. The geomorphological characteristic of the coastal areas of Bangladesh is highly dynamic where geological subsidence and rising sea level is experienced in the last fifty years along with land erosion and accretion with different rates remain a constant phenomenon. This study focuses on the whole coastal zone including western, central and eastern which comprises the 720 km coastal area of the country. This study uses the past 25 year Landsat satellite images and sea level data. This research shows that that the rate of accretion and erosion are changing coastal geomorphological features in the whole coastal shoreline and also reshaping shore characteristics especially in the central coastal area. It also reveals that river trajectory is changing with notable characteristics in the coastal districts especially in the western and central coastal districts which reshaping the human settlement pattern, vegetation coverage especially the unique mangrove forest Sundarbans and agricultural lands in the whole coastal areas. Overlaying geological subsidy and sea level rising data, the study shows that western coastal region is going to be dried up in the next 25 years that\u2019s why saline characteristics will reduce for mangrove suitability in the Sundarbans areas which is major threat for existence of the unique mangrove forest Sundarbans. On the other hand, overlaying geological subsidy and sea level rising data, the study illustrates that eastern coastal region will submerge due to increasing tidal inundation and will go to permanently water logged in the next 25 years for which climate induced displaced will placed for the whole eastern coastal districts. The existence of Saint Martin, the only coral reef island of Bangladesh is under threat for this climate induced sea level rise and geological subsidy experience. \n\nKey words: Coastal belt, Bangladesh, dynamics, climate induced displacement, sea level rise\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59771493, "asset_id": 39614663, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 68594404, "first_name": "Abdur", "last_name": "Rahaman", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AbdurRahaman16", "display_name": "Abdur Rahaman", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AbdurRahaman16?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/68594404/18119069/25938288/s65_abdur.rahaman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6808, "name": "Coastal Geomorphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_Geomorphology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7808, "name": "Mangroves", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mangroves?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 249747, "name": "Coral", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coral?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 874796, "name": "Climate Chnage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Chnage?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 39176436, "title": "Climate Variations in Coastal Andhra: Their Causes,\nImpacts and Solutions for Fisher\u2019s Livelihoods", "created_at": "2019-05-18T08:32:44.330-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39176436/Climate_Variations_in_Coastal_Andhra_Their_Causes_Impacts_and_Solutions_for_Fisher_s_Livelihoods?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_39176436", "summary": "Climate variability is a serious concern for fishermen in near term and long term.

Nevertheless, there are hotspots of high chlorophyll in the BoB where the monsoonal forcings are strong enough to break the stratification; one such region is the southern BoB, east of Sri Lanka. A recent field programme conducted during the summer monsoon of 2016, as a part of the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE), provides a unique high-resolution dataset of the vertical distribution of chlorophyll in the southern BoB using ocean gliders along with shipboard conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) measurements. Observations were carried out for a duration of 12-20 days, covering the dynamically active regions of the Sri Lanka Dome (SLD) and the Southwest Monsoon Current (SMC). Mixing and up-welling induced by the monsoonal wind forcing enhanced surface chlorophyll concentrations (0.3-0.7 mg m \u22123). Prominent deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM; 0.3-1.2 mg m \u22123) existed at intermediate depths (20-50 m), signifying the contribution of subsurface productivity to the biological carbon cycling in the BoB. The shape of chlorophyll profiles varied in different dynamical regimes; upwelling was associated with sharp and intense DCM, whereas mixing resulted in a diffuse and weaker DCM. Within the SLD, open-ocean Ekman suction favoured a substantial increase in chlorophyll. Farther east, where the thermocline was deeper, enhanced surface chlorophyll was associated with intermittent mixing events. Remote forcing by the westward propagating Rossby waves influenced the upper-ocean dynamics and chlorophyll distribution in the southern BoB. Stabilizing surface freshening events and barrier-layer formation often inhibited the generation of surface chlorophyll. The pathway of the SMC intrusion was marked by a distinct band of chlorophyll, indicating the advective effect of biologically rich Arabian Sea waters. The region of the monsoon current exhibited the strongest DCM as well as the highest column-integrated chlorophyll. Observations suggest that the persistence of DCM in the southern BoB is promoted by surface oligotrophy and shallow mixed layers. Results from a coupled physical-ecosystem model substantiate the dominant role of mixed layer processes associated with the monsoon in controlling the nutrient distribution and biological productivity in the southern BoB. The present study provides new insights into the vertical distribution of chlorophyll in the BoB, emphasizing the need for extensive in situ sampling and ecosystem model-based efforts for a better understanding of the biophysical interactions and the potential climatic feedbacks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58864417, "asset_id": 38775241, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32466632, "first_name": "Adrian", "last_name": "Matthews", "domain_name": "eastanglia", "page_name": "AdrianMatthews", "display_name": "Adrian Matthews", "profile_url": "https://eastanglia.academia.edu/AdrianMatthews?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32466632/9713129/36975897/s65_adrian.matthews.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 610554, "name": "Ocean Dynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ocean_Dynamics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 776083, "name": "Chlorophyll-A", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chlorophyll-A?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38759639, "title": "Australia and Sri Lanka Deepen Naval Cooperation", "created_at": "2019-04-10T00:00:02.072-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38759639/Australia_and_Sri_Lanka_Deepen_Naval_Cooperation?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_38759639", "summary": "Australia\u2019s biggest ever defence engagement with Sri Lanka in March 2019 marks the steady expansion of intra-regional security cooperation in the Indian Ocean.

late eighteenth century a Scotsman returned from Bengal with one of the largest private libraries of Persian texts collected in the Subcontinent. Among those manuscripts were several volumes of translations of Arakanese and Pali texts into Persian, as well as quasi ethnographic accounts on Buddhism as it was practiced in what is seen today as the frontier region between South and Southeast Asia. In this article I look at this archive and the historical moment that surrounds its making in the perspective of the development of Buddhist studies. This large corpus of texts happened to be a false start in the history of the study of Therav\u0101da Buddhism, but it constitutes a unique source to learn about local forms of Buddhism on the eve of the fall of the Arakanese kingdom and the integration of its religious institutions within the Burmese sangha. While discussing a selection of texts from this vast corpus, I pay special attention to the culturally layered transmission of knowledge on Arakanese Buddhism via the work of Bengali munsh\u012bs\n(i.e., Persian secretary). I argue that this layered transmission caused the almost immediate obsolescence of this corpus as a source of information in the early colonial context. However, for the cultural historian, those Persian texts contrast with the then emerging institutionalised orientalist discourses and offer a new vantage point for the study of Arakanese Buddhism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58511518, "asset_id": 38448756, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8489787, "first_name": "Thibaut", "last_name": "d'Hubert", "domain_name": "chicago", "page_name": "ThibautdHubert", "display_name": "Thibaut d'Hubert", "profile_url": "https://chicago.academia.edu/ThibautdHubert?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8489787/11138863/12430500/s65_thibaut.d_hubert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35356, "name": "Persian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43430, "name": "Arakanese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arakanese_History?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 150085, "name": "Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengal?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 38401671, "title": "Book Review of Sunil Amrith's Crossing the Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2019-02-20T19:55:40.224-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38401671/Book_Review_of_Sunil_Amriths_Crossing_the_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_38401671", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58459175, "asset_id": 38401671, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2673250, "first_name": "APARNA", "last_name": "VAIDIK", "domain_name": "ashokauniversity", "page_name": "APARNAVAIDIK", "display_name": "APARNA VAIDIK", "profile_url": "https://ashokauniversity.academia.edu/APARNAVAIDIK?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38376936, "title": "MIGRATING SONGS CONNECTING THE OCEAN: DISPLACEMENT, BENGALI IDENTITY, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF HOMELAND", "created_at": "2019-02-18T02:42:59.656-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38376936/MIGRATING_SONGS_CONNECTING_THE_OCEAN_DISPLACEMENT_BENGALI_IDENTITY_AND_THE_PERFORMANCE_OF_HOMELAND?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_38376936", "summary": "Agriculturist families of low-caste refugees from East Bengal have resettled since 1949 in the Andaman\nIslands, bringing along rich repertoires of songs and oral narratives.

"A constant spiral downward has exerted enormous impacts on the workers in developing nations: their shifts increase in length, their working conditions suffer, and their wages stagnate.  Though many investigations have brought the attention of the textile and technological industry to the publics\u2019 attention, even a more basic industry is dominated by terrible labour practices, culminating in the dual scourge of human trafficking and slavery.  In Thailand, amongst many other Southeast Asian nations, human trafficking and slavery remain rampant staples of means of competing in a globalized economy. Instead of just providing a location for reduced benefits, wages, and labour regulations (i.e. input costs), they offer the supply chains for MNCs an input that costs nothing, has no protections, and works relentlessly to fulfil increasing demands from advanced economies.  Specifically, this paper will examine the fishing industry in Thailand (shrimp production and fishing vessels), where rampant abuses of migrant workers have been revealed by multiple investigative journalists.  In this industry, rapid expansion has occurred in the past few decades due to increased demand driven by lower prices, cheaper transportation costs (with fuel and frozen shipment containers), and elimination of trade tariffs. What could be a potential source of reliable and renewable income for the developing nation has turned into a means for increasing consumer surplus in advanced economies and enriching various MNCs (and local subsidiaries) instead of the workers and their local communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58069725, "asset_id": 38045315, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1836883, "first_name": "Adam", "last_name": "Renner", "domain_name": "binghamton", "page_name": "AdamRenner", "display_name": "Adam Renner", "profile_url": "https://binghamton.academia.edu/AdamRenner?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1836883/625422/20226095/s65_adam.renner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3180, "name": "International Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Trade?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5432, "name": "Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Slavery?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6276, "name": "International Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Political_Economy?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 6369, "name": "Human Trafficking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Trafficking?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 37950668, "title": "APPENDIX III BUDDHIST CULTURAL LINKAGES BETWEEN BENGAL AND SOUTH EAST ASIA", "created_at": "2018-12-10T11:13:49.573-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37950668/APPENDIX_III_BUDDHIST_CULTURAL_LINKAGES_BETWEEN_BENGAL_AND_SOUTH_EAST_ASIA?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_37950668", "summary": "Bengal, covering the Ganga delta and the trans-Meghna zones up to the south-easternmost parts of Bangladesh, (for details see the chapter on Historical Geography) was ideally suited to linkages with Southeast Asia from remote times. The extensive Bengal coast, from Suhma to Harikela sub-regions, covered the entire delta-the largest delta in the world. The fluvial network paves the way for riverine communications between the coast and the interior. There is little doubt that the Bengal/Ganga delta provides the landlocked Ganga plains with the crucial outlet to the Bay of Bengal. The Bay of Bengal network is inextricably interlocked with the mainland and maritime Southeast Asia. On the other hand, the close proximity of Harikela with Arakan offers the overland corridor to mainland Southeast Asia. In no other zones of the subcontinent this combination of the overland and maritime networks with Southeast Asia is offered by geography. This unique natural endowment made Bengal one of the most significant areas for sustained interactions with Southeast Asia (see the section on trade in the chapter on Economic Life). There is a growing body of literature on the history of the cultural interactions between these two areas with a particular thrust on the role of Buddhism as the pivotal feature of this network. Bengal, along with Bihar, is noted for the flourishing condition of Buddhism and this area marked one of the last bastions of Buddhism from the 10th century CE onwards, when in the greater parts of the subcontinent Buddhism had started to fade out gradually. The 600-1300 CE phase will particularly figure in our present discussion. As during this period outstanding Buddhist monasteries emerged and flourished at Nalanda, Vikramaxila, Somapura and Mainamati, it is only natural that Bengal's Buddhist network with Southeast Asia is often studied from the point of these premier Buddhist centres in Bihar, northern and southeastern Bengal (Magadha, Abga, Pundra and Samatata regions). Recent decades have also brought to light the importance of the trans-Meghna tracts (Samatata and Harikela) in this Buddhist network. This historiographical shift will be addressed in our present effort. One should clearly underline here that our survey of the Buddhist network between", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57964790, "asset_id": 37950668, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3015903, "first_name": "Suchandra", "last_name": "Ghosh", "domain_name": "uohyd", "page_name": "SuchandraGhosh", "display_name": "Suchandra Ghosh", "profile_url": "https://uohyd.academia.edu/SuchandraGhosh?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3015903/993554/35484184/s65_suchandra.ghosh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 37858741, "title": "(Updated on 13 December 2018) WAY AHEAD FOR THE INDO-PACIFIC  \r\n(PART 4: Balance of Comprehensive Power & Regional Capacity Building)", "created_at": "2018-11-27T00:33:31.679-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37858741/_Updated_on_13_December_2018_WAY_AHEAD_FOR_THE_INDO_PACIFIC_PART_4_Balance_of_Comprehensive_Power_and_Regional_Capacity_Building_?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_37858741", "summary": "This is the 4th part of the presentation on 'The Indo-Pacific: New Geopolitics of the Asian-centred Rim-land and the Way Forward', which examines in detail the recommendations with  regard to maintaining a favourable and stable regional balance of power.

It gives the error estimates for satellite remote sensing data based on comparison of those data with the data of field measurements of the shoreline coordinates. It has been established that the accuracy of shoreline extraction from optical image could be that of only several metres. It is shown how the Change Detection algorithm can be used to detect spatio-temporal coastline changes on multi-temporal images. The analysis of the quantitative assessment of changes in the area of erosion and accretion on the Sambia Peninsula coast during the research period of 2010-2017 showed the prevalence of abrasive processes over accumulative ones, which has also been confirmed by field observations during coastal zone surveys conducted after storms in 2012-2017.

India is the largest economy of the group, followed by Thailand, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. However, despite being in existence for two decades with a detailed work agenda for cooperation and political congeniality among members, BIMSTEC has hardly progressed. Hopes of the grouping picking up momentum have increased after its 4 th Summit in Nepal on 30 and 31 August 2018 which resulted in important decisions like intra-member energy grid connectivity. Prospects of a BIMSTEC free trade agreement (FTA) also appear brighter. This paper reflects on the composition, potential, priorities and recent developments for BIMSTEC. Concerns over regional geopolitics impeding progress continue to remain. Fast progress also requires the members prioritising the BIMSTEC agenda, particularly on the FTA. As the grouping's largest economies, India and Thailand need to be proactive in this regard. Nevertheless, the positive outcomes from the 4th Summit, as well as encouraging developments like improvement in intra-member transport connectivity, are important steps forward. The main challenge for BIMSTEC is to avoid getting marginalised in the current Asian regionalism discourse dominated by other large upcoming connectivity projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative and the Free and Open Indo-Pacific.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57538161, "asset_id": 37561346, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 94547780, "first_name": "Institute of South Asian Studies", "last_name": "NUS", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "ISASNUS", "display_name": "Institute of South Asian Studies NUS", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/ISASNUS?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/94547780/20702808/35769598/s65_institute_of_south_asian_studies.nus.png"}, {"id": 84811834, "first_name": "Silvia", "last_name": "Tieri", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "STieri", "display_name": "Silvia Tieri", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/STieri?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/84811834/20051928/19822936/s65_silvia.tieri.jpg"}, {"id": 95201961, "first_name": "Amitendu", "last_name": "Palit", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AmitenduPalit", "display_name": "Amitendu Palit", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AmitenduPalit?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 97359702, "first_name": "Rahul", "last_name": "Choudhury", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RahulChoudhury14", "display_name": "Rahul Choudhury", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RahulChoudhury14?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16946, "name": "Nepal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nepal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 97103, "name": "Free trade agreements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_trade_agreements?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 106646, "name": "Bhutan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhutan?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 226366, "name": "Connectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Connectivity?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 3022834, "name": "The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Bay_of_Bengal_Initiative_for_Multi-Sectoral_Technical_and_Economic_Cooperation_BIMSTEC_?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 37544933, "title": "\"A Persian Account of the Religious Customs of the Magh (Arakanese) from Early Colonial Bengal\"", "created_at": "2018-10-07T08:13:32.995-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37544933/_A_Persian_Account_of_the_Religious_Customs_of_the_Magh_Arakanese_from_Early_Colonial_Bengal_?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_37544933", "summary": "The document presented in this article is a quasi-ethnographic account of the religious customs of the Magh (i.e. Arakanese), which was most probably collected on the basis of firsthand observations made in the region of Chittagong, in southeastern Bengal, sometime in the 1780s, or early 1790s.

It was one of the highest achievements of the UN and states around the world which were able to agree on such a high degree of idealism and not that easy implementation of its provisions. The beginning of the era of the modern world in the sixteenth century saw the expansion of Europe into the Americas and subsequent development of the world system in which Europe became the center of the new world. Attempts were made at that time in order to regulate and maintenance some kind of a new peace and order covering the areas that include major oceans, seas, and land. The legal models and arrangements in the fifteenth century through the end of the eighteenth century in the Atlantic world suggest a different shape and meaning of global interconnectedness in this period. The world stretching from the Iberian Americas, to Christian Europe, coastal and Islamic Africa, and into the vast Indian Ocean world formed part of a single international legal regime. Broad structural similarities in the ways that power and identity were defined in the institutional order made these culturally diverse regions mutually intelligible for travelers and traders, thereby undergirding global economic interconnections (Benton 2002, 79). Thus, the 1982 Convention was not the first attempt of a single international legal regime. But the significant point is its inception and development was not done or dreamt by the major world powers in the West like in the past history. Interestingly, this time it was the majority of non-West and less advanced states and countries especially from African, Caribbean and archipelagic areas, which do not represent the maritime interests of the world, which were the first ratifies of the Convention and took part to move the Convention to its full realization (Matics 1994,129). The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) thus was historically the most ambitious attempt ever made at global law reform. It aims at the political behavior of member states regarding the conduct for the seas (Gold 1992, 85). Thus, the 1982 Convention was aptly described as the \" Constitution for the international community in the field of maritime affairs \" (Kriangsak 1992).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57449081, "asset_id": 37479883, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 373824, "first_name": "Thanet", "last_name": "Aphornsuvan", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "ThanetAphornsuvan", "display_name": "Thanet Aphornsuvan", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/ThanetAphornsuvan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/373824/115364/135145/s65_thanet.aphornsuvan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37289182, "title": "Availability of fish species in fish markets and fish marketing in Noakhali district, Bangladesh", "created_at": "2018-08-25T02:35:31.937-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37289182/Availability_of_fish_species_in_fish_markets_and_fish_marketing_in_Noakhali_district_Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_37289182", "summary": "The present study was conducted to know the fish markets and marketing practices in Noakhali district for a period of 5 months; November 2014 to March, 2015.

The average cost by a retailer to trade fish was estimated at Tk. 171.6 /day. This cost included rent of trading spot, ice and local transportation. The average income of retailers in three markets was estimated at Tk. 640/day/retailer. It was found that 21% of fish supplied in the markets were carps (Indian and Exotic), 17.3% marine fish, 15.7% hilsa, 12.7% catfish, 11.3% small fish, 11% Tilapia and pungus, 7% others mix species and 4% prawn. It was reported that availability fish species in three different markets round the year ranged from 55 to 72. However, during the study period, a total of 39 fish species under 24 families were found in three markets. It was found that marine fish comprises average 33% and freshwater fish comprises average 67% in the three markets. The price of fish depends on market structure, species quality, size, weight and season. The price of galda and bagda were varied from 580\u00b110 to 560\u00b18 Tk. /kg, and 370\u00b110 to 350\u00b15 Tk. /kg respectively. The price of catla, tilapia, ilish, Thai pangus and silver carp were varied from 390\u00b110 to 360\u00b18 Tk. /kg, 165\u00b15 to 150\u00b18 Tk. /kg, 900\u00b110 to 860\u00b15 Tk. /kg, 140\u00b110 to 125\u00b15 Tk. /kg, and 160\u00b18 to 155\u00b15 Tk./kg, respectively. In Noakhali, around 50-180 retailers were involved in each market. It was found that the daily supply of fish in Municipal market, Datter hat and Sonapur was about 12-13, 7-8 and 2.5-3ton, respectively. Inadequate infrastructure, transportation, shortage of ice in peak season, hygienic condition and packaging facilities were cited as main constraints. It was found that 80% of the fish retailers have improved their livelihood status through fish trading to a certain degree.

By exploring modern-day slavery in the Southeast Asian fishing industry, this paper may fill a research gap within the study of human trafficking as well as sharpen our awareness of slavery practices, not only in the sex industry, but also in workplaces like fishing vessels and seafood processing factories. This paper will argue that the proximity of modern slavery to sexual exploitation and the lack of differentiation between smuggling and trafficking crime has led to the ignorance of contemporary slavery practices in other sectors.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57117469, "asset_id": 37166203, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1279697, "first_name": "Zezen", "last_name": "Mutaqin", "domain_name": "uin-jkt", "page_name": "zezenmutaqin", "display_name": "Zezen Mutaqin", "profile_url": "https://uin-jkt.academia.edu/zezenmutaqin?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1279697/469591/28366859/s65_zezen.mutaqin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6369, "name": "Human Trafficking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Trafficking?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36895606, "title": "Law Enforcement on Illegal Fishing by Foreign Fishing Vessels within Indonesia's Exclusive Economic Zone.docx", "created_at": "2018-06-22T07:58:20.623-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36895606/Law_Enforcement_on_Illegal_Fishing_by_Foreign_Fishing_Vessels_within_Indonesias_Exclusive_Economic_Zone_docx?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_36895606", "summary": "Indonesia is a country with a vast archipelago of land and sea. The number of territorial waters owned by Indonesia resulted in the number of fish that are very feasible to be consumed to be caught by illegal fishers. The research aims to understand and analyse further about the implications of law enforcement on illegal fishing by foreign fishing vessels within Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone. By using the normative legal research, the result of the research shows that Indonesian Government has made a proper regulation and appropriate law enforcement to combat the illegal fishing in the Indonesia\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone. The result shows that there are many factors that make a lot of illegal fishing are still happening. Although Indonesian Government has made a proper law, there are still some law enforcers who did not execute their tasks accordingly. Indonesia has ratified the UNCLOS 1982 based on Law No. 17 Year 1985 and it makes the UNCLOS 1982 has become a binding law for Indonesian Government. In Law No. 5 Year 1983 on Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), it stated on the sovereignty of the territorial waters of the Republic of Indonesia, and therefore it is illegal for foreign fishing vessels to fish around the Indonesia\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone without any permit. The research suggests that Indonesian Government should make a completion of fishery licensing system and mechanism. And also Indonesian Government must make more patrols around the Indonesia\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone to have more prevention towards the illegal fishers. \n\n\nKeywords: illegal fishing, Indonesia\u2019s exclusive economic zone, law enforcement\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56847577, "asset_id": 36895606, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 80548699, "first_name": "Dean", "last_name": "Adams", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DeanAdams8", "display_name": "Dean Adams", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DeanAdams8?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36884992, "title": "Falling through the Net: A survey of basic labour rights among migrants working in Thailand's fishing sector", "created_at": "2018-06-21T01:23:52.477-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36884992/Falling_through_the_Net_A_survey_of_basic_labour_rights_among_migrants_working_in_Thailands_fishing_sector?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_36884992", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56837800, "asset_id": 36884992, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4441521, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "cedep", "page_name": "DanielMurphy", "display_name": "Daniel  Murphy", "profile_url": "https://cedep.academia.edu/DanielMurphy?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4441521/5086457/5832191/s65_daniel.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6369, "name": "Human Trafficking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Trafficking?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 29170, "name": "Burma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burma?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 79742, "name": "Fishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fishing?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 225868, "name": "Forced Labor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_Labor?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 939415, "name": "Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Illegal_Unreported_and_Unregulated_IUU_Fishing?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 36804964, "title": "India's New Geopolitical Paradigm and Reintegration of the Bay of Bengal", "created_at": "2018-06-08T01:59:35.195-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36804964/Indias_New_Geopolitical_Paradigm_and_Reintegration_of_the_Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_36804964", "summary": "The 'Look East' Policy (LEP) is usually identified as the beginning of an effort by India to build relations with its eastern neighbours lying on the other side of the Bay of Bengal rim.

Early on, Bengal developed a distinct literary identity within the Sanskrit tradition and, despite abrupt political transitions and the fragmentation of the landscape of literary patronage, fundamental aspects of the literary culture of P\u0101la Bengal were transmitted during later periods. It was during the Sultanate period, from the 14th century onward that courtly milieus began to cultivate Middle Bengali. This patronage was mostly provided by uppercaste Hindu dignitaries and (in the case of lyric poetry at least) by the Sultans themselves. During the period ranging from the 15th to the early 19th centuries, vernacular literature can be divided into two broad categories: short narrative forms called padas or g\u012btas (songs), which were often composed in an idiom derived from songs by the Old Maithili poet Vidy\u0101pati (c. 1370\u20131460); and long narrative forms in Middle Bengali called p\u0101\u0303c\u0101l\u012bs, which are characterized by the alternation of the prosodic forms called pa\u1e8f\u0101r and tripad\u012b and the occasional insertion of songs.\nThese poetic forms are the principal markers of the literary identity of Bengal and eastern South Asia (including Assam, Orissa, and Arakan). The \u1e24usayn Sh\u0101h\u012b period (1433\u20131486) contributed to the consolidation and expansion eastward of vernacular literary practices. Then, the political landscape became fragmented, and the multiplication of centers of literary production occurred. This fragmentation fostered the formation of new, locally grounded literary trends. These could involve the cultivation of specific genres, the propounding of various religious doctrines and ritual practices, the fashioning of new idioms fostered by either dialectal resources, classical idioms such as Sanskrit or Persian, and other vernacular poetic traditions (Maithili, Avadhi, Hindustani). The late Mughal and early colonial periods witnessed the making of new trends, characterized by a radical modification of the lexical component of the Middle Bengali idiom (i.e., Dobh\u0101\u1e63\u012b), or the recourse to scripts other than Bengali (e.g., Sylhet Nagari/ Kaithi, Arabic). The making of such new trends often implied changes in the way that authors interacted with Sanskrit, Persian, and other vernacular traditions. For instance, Persian played as crucial a role as Sanskrit in the various trajectories that Middle Bengali poetry took. On the one hand, Persian in Bengal had a history distinct from that of Bengali; on the other hand, it constituted a major traditional model for Bengali authors and, at times, Persianate education replaced the one based on Sanskrit as the default way to access literacy.\nEven if Middle Bengali poetic forms continued to be used in the context of various traditional performances, the making of a new literary language in the 19th century, the adoption of Western genres, and the development of prose and Western prosodic forms occasioned a radical break with premodern literary practices. From the second half of the 19th century, with the notable exception of some ritual and sectarian texts, access to the ancient literature of Bengal began to be mediated by philological analysis and textual criticism.\nKeywords: Bengal, Bengali, Brajabuli, Sanskrit, Persian, Avadhi, Urdu, multilingualism, lyric poetry, narrative poetry\nFull version available at: http://asianhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190277727.001.0001/acrefore-9780190277727-e-39\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63398349, "asset_id": 36083445, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8489787, "first_name": "Thibaut", "last_name": "d'Hubert", "domain_name": "chicago", "page_name": "ThibautdHubert", "display_name": "Thibaut d'Hubert", "profile_url": "https://chicago.academia.edu/ThibautdHubert?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8489787/11138863/12430500/s65_thibaut.d_hubert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 14500, "name": "Bengali Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali_Literature?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 507727, "name": "Bengal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengal_studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35713705, "title": "Migrants In Nusantara: Indonesian and Malaysia Perspectives", "created_at": "2018-01-19T21:26:38.856-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35713705/Migrants_In_Nusantara_Indonesian_and_Malaysia_Perspectives?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_35713705", "summary": "The process of human migration between Indonesia and Malaysia has been running for hundreds of years.

Migration not only provides benefits for both countries, as remittance and development, but it also has a negative impact and creates problems such as the abuse of migrant workers or increase of irregular migrants. This paper attempts to identify the driving forces of migration and explore different types of migration from Indonesia to Malaysia. It is found that there are five pull-push factors of migration, namely; economic, demographical, social, environmental and political factors. The economic and demographical factors become the main causes of migration in the form of workers. The social factor of migration encourages Indonesians to study in Malaysian universities. The political and environmental factors, which are obvious among the Acehnese, include migrating to Malaysia in the form of refugees and asylum seekers. By exploring all factors of migration, this paper attempts to mapping out the human migration process for Indonesia to Malaysia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55586744, "asset_id": 35713705, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9536777, "first_name": "Suyatno", "last_name": "Ladiqi", "domain_name": "unisza", "page_name": "SuyatnoLadiqi", "display_name": "Suyatno Ladiqi", "profile_url": "https://unisza.academia.edu/SuyatnoLadiqi?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9536777/3019328/3546619/s65_yatno.ladiqi.jpg"}, {"id": 34776524, "first_name": "Reevany", "last_name": "Bustami", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ReevanyBustami", "display_name": "Reevany Bustami", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ReevanyBustami?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35538267, "title": "Michael Charney and Muslims in Arakan", "created_at": "2017-12-29T15:23:18.873-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35538267/Michael_Charney_and_Muslims_in_Arakan?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_35538267", "summary": "In 2016, Aman Ullah did me the honor of typing in and posting online on the \"Stateless Rohingya\" website as an article a chapter from my unpublished dissertation from 1999, entitled \"Michael Charney and Muslims in Arakan\".

The Bay of Bengal became more conductive to tropical cyclone intensification due to increase in sea surface temperature & upper ocean heat content and increase in such rough sea events are directly affecting the major means of livings of more than 3.5 million coastal people. Fisheries of the Bay of Bengal & other aquatic resources serve as a source of livelihood and employment opportunities for the surrounding coastal communities. Such Climatic extremes coincided with over exploitation have left majority of those people in severe crisis who depend on it. Diversified impact of climate change affects this marginal coastal fisher's groups in different ways and cause numerous loss and damage. The extent and dimension of climate change induced loss and damage is very complex and hardly proportional. This research study applied participatory action research tools to explore the nature and dimensions of climate change induced loss and damage of this marginal professional groups based on the experience, perception and thoughts of the coastal fisher folks. The study revealed that, majority of the fishermen had to experience unfinished trip at least 3 to 4 time due to warning signal throughout the year of 2016 and on an average, such trip cost them an economic loss of more than BDT 3000. Most of the fishermen have to travel 10 to 15 additional hours on the deep sea as due to shift in fishing reservoirs and all the respondent expressed their concern regarding sea surface temperature rise, increased salinity and sea level rise. They also have been experiencing more intensified rough sea events including depressions and cyclones. Apart from those, limited technological accessnot only in terms of fishing boats & gears but also in terms of access to weather forecast receiving instruments, safety equipments and poor socio-economic condition have aggravated their sufferings to further extend. Government has various safety net supports schemes but none of them are explicitly deal with fishing communities except the \"Coastal fishers support scheme (also called as fishers ID card). Both informal and institutional credit mechanisms were found in both the study areas but more than 50% of the respondents from the Cox's Bazar were engaged with informal one (dadan) while in case of Barguna, more than 60% respondents reported their engagement with institutional microcredit. Surprisingly, more than 50% of the respondents stated that they know about insurance and significant portion of them met insurance agent and have basic understanding on different policy schemes. Though the understanding was very limited to life insurance scheme only, however, majority of the respondents (97% in Barguna and 88.2% in Cox's Bazar) expressed their willingness to pay a monthly premium up to BDT 500 for their fishing boats and nets if rationale compensations are ensured. For addressing loss and damage, combination of efforts are required at individual & institutional level. More specific poverty reduction programmes and special support schemes are need be initiated this for this marginal coastal fishing communities.

The strait is bounded on the south by Pamban Island, Adam's bridge (also known as Rama Setu), the Gulf of Mannar. The strait is 40 to 85 miles (64 to 137 km) wide, 85 miles long. The average depth is less than 100 meters Many rivers including Vaigai (India) drain into the Palk Bay., The Sri Lankan side has many Islets including Katchateevu which has been the bone of contention between Indian fishers and Sri Lankan fishers since 1974. The occurrences of Tamil fishermen crossing the International Maritime Boundary Limit (IMBL) in large numbers\u2014quoting the traditional rights to fish in the Palk Bay and despite the fear of being arrested\u2014has not abated. The mostly intentional crossing of the officially demarcated(IMBL) by quoting historical rights has not helped matters. The agreement of 1974 for demarking the IMBL, and the subsequent clarifications by the Indian Government, do not allow Indian fishers to cross the IMBL. The fishers continue to fish not only around the Katchatheevu Island (where the drying of nets was allowed in the 1974 agreement) but also in areas well in Sri Lankan waters. With the clarifications of 1976 on the floor of the Indian Parliament by the then External Affairs Minister Swaran Singh, the fishermen were specifically directed not to cross the IMBL to fish in Sri Lankan waters. The vows of Tamil fishermen have only accentuated with each passing year due to the complexities involved in resolving the vexed issue of fishing in the Palk Bay. Both Sri Lanka and India are engaged in tackling the issue in an amicable manner\u037e however, a permanent solution seems to be elusive given the ground realities between the fishermen on both sides who insist on juxtaposing historical rights.

In spite of strong historical connectivities, the maritime space of Bay of Bengal separated nation-centric postcolonial states and became divided into zones, promoting geopolitical demarcations that have subsequently become deeply embedded in academic, political, and public discourses. This article attempts to examine the emergence of new economic and geostrategic horizons in this maritime space, a space that may well become a powerful pivot of a rising Asia. It proposes paradigm shifts in scholarly discourses in and around the Bay, distinct from the prism of conventional western historiography and the narrative of South-Southeast Asia divergences. A trajectory of renegotiations in the understanding of flows and networks is envisaged, implying a strong possibility of this waterscape emerging as a specialized area of study, and thus a rethinking of scholarship and pedagogy in Asian studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52919977, "asset_id": 32763953, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11097680, "first_name": "Jayati", "last_name": "Bhattacharya", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JayatiBhattacharya", "display_name": "Jayati Bhattacharya", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JayatiBhattacharya?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11097680/8878368/19189255/s65_jayati.bhattacharya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 61668, "name": "Comparative and Connected History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_and_Connected_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32293862, "title": "A case study of the gears and craft used for artisanal fishing in Chittagong Patharghata Fishery Ghat, Bangladesh and socio-economic condition of the fishermen", "created_at": "2017-04-06T03:25:06.472-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32293862/A_case_study_of_the_gears_and_craft_used_for_artisanal_fishing_in_Chittagong_Patharghata_Fishery_Ghat_Bangladesh_and_socio_economic_condition_of_the_fishermen?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_32293862", "summary": "The Patharghata Fishery Ghat in Chittagong is one of the largest fish landing centers in Bangladesh. The study aimed to explore different types of gears and crafts used from the landing center, fish species caught by the gears, and certain degree of socioeconomic condition of the fishermen. Data were collected from local fishermen through on the spot inspections, Personal Interview (PI), and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). The gears used from the landing center were classified as Large Mesh Drift Gill Nets (DGNs), Marine Set Bag Nets (MSBNs), and Trammel Nets. Mainly 7 types of DGNs having the mesh sizes ranging from 2.5 to 16 inches had been used by the fishermen of which Lakkha Jal, Lal jal and Char Shuta Jal were the most commonly used DGNs to catch Hilsha, Lakhua, Pomfret etc. Hilsha Shad (Tenualosa ilisha) was the most dominant species and about 60% of different nets were used to catch this species. Only single type of artisanal fishing craft (trawlers) was found in the landing center and is propelled by inboard engine. The capacity of the trawlers varied from 8 to 22 metric tons. In case of socioeconomic condition, most of the fishermen belonged to the age groups of 21-30 and 31-40 years; each represented 31% of the total fishermen. About 91% of fishermen were found to be Muslim and rest 9% were Hindu. The average members of the nuclear and joint families were 3.78 and 7.83 per household, respectively; however, these groups of people were being deprived in their society. The study also revealed that about 67% of fishermen had no formal education and 27% had primary and rest 6% had secondary level of education. The annual income of the fishermen ranged from BDT 50,000 to 100,000 and the main expenditure of their earnings were for food (80%), followed by physical treatment (10%) of their family members. They had hardly any savings. Lack of knowledge and government support, and illiteracy were the major problems of the fishermen in the landing center.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52509873, "asset_id": 32293862, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33703139, "first_name": "Ebu Press", "last_name": "Ltd", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EbuPressLtd", "display_name": "Ebu Press Ltd", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/EbuPressLtd?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33703139/9933152/11075410/s65_ebu_press.ltd.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 14490, "name": "Fisheries Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries_Biology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32245463, "title": "Optimum Compositions of Fishing Units in Five Scenarios of Sustainable Fisheries in Palu Bay", "created_at": "2017-04-04T05:26:29.056-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32245463/Optimum_Compositions_of_Fishing_Units_in_Five_Scenarios_of_Sustainable_Fisheries_in_Palu_Bay?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_32245463", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52467618, "asset_id": 32245463, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62485673, "first_name": "Ari", "last_name": "Purbayanto, Ph.D.", "domain_name": "bogoragriculturaluniversity", "page_name": "AriPurbayanto", "display_name": "Ari  Purbayanto, Ph.D.", "profile_url": "https://bogoragriculturaluniversity.academia.edu/AriPurbayanto?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13262, "name": "Sustainable", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 112574, "name": "Goal programming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Goal_programming?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32187093, "title": "Provenance of Proterozoic garnet-biotite gneiss recovered from Elan Bank, Kerguelen Plateau, southern Indian Ocean", "created_at": "2017-04-01T10:07:22.968-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32187093/Provenance_of_Proterozoic_garnet_biotite_gneiss_recovered_from_Elan_Bank_Kerguelen_Plateau_southern_Indian_Ocean?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_32187093", "summary": "At Elan Bank of the Kerguelen Plateau in the southeast Indian Ocean, Leg 183 of the Ocean Drilling Program recovered clasts of garnet-biotite gneiss in a fluvial conglomerate intercalated with basalt flows.

Although studies predict that fish stocks are on the decline there is little evidence that these declines are being countered by changes in either fishing regulations or fishing practices. Fishermen rarely comply with regulations, instead operationalizing and directing the fishery on their own. In these circumstances understanding how fishermen perceive and use resources has significant management and policy implications. Our study examined fishermen's perceptions about the state of fish stocks and documents current fishing practice and management strategies in India. We surveyed 342 fishermen in two states, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. We found that 86% of fishermen perceived a decline in catch and 69% perceived a decline in bycatch. Fishermen adapt to these declines by increasing fishing area and time spent, changing their gear, and overlapping in fishing zones. The convoluted interactions between ineffective community and state regulations guiding their actions has prevented fishermen from developing successful models of sustainable fisheries management. We identified non-compliance with regulations and government incentives as an important livelihood opportunity.

Along with the coupled framework, Delft3D, a separate hydrodynamic model based on shallow water equations, has also been coupled in offline mode to simulate the storm surge and inundation over the land.\n\nTwo major tropical cyclones, TC Sidr (2007, Category 5) and TC Aila (2009, Category 1) that made landfall in coastal Bangladesh, have been selected for this experiment. To our knowledge air-sea interactions have not been considered in TC studies in the Bay of Bengal region.

The ridge's internal structure and mode of eruptions are unknown due to lack of deep seismic reflection and borehole data control. Here, we analyze 10 km of long-streamer seismic reflection data to unravel the ridge's internal structure, and thereby to enhance the understanding of how the ridge was originated and grew over a geologic time. Seismic facies analysis reveals the ridge structure consisting of volcanic vent and several stratigraphic units including packs of prograding clinoforms. The clinoform sequences are interpreted as volcanic successions, and led to the formation of lava-delta fronts. Interpreted features of lava-fed deltas and intervening erosional surfaces, and mass flows along ridge flanks suggest that the 85 E Ridge is a volcanic construct, and was built by both subaqueous and multiphase submarine volcanism during the Late Cretaceous (approximately from 85 to 80 Ma). At later time, from Oligocene-Miocene (~23 Ma) onwards the ridge was buried under the thick sediments of the Bengal Fan system.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50878918, "asset_id": 30436221,

The authors address three broad issues through an interdisciplinary perspective. The first relates to boat-building traditions and the communities who traversed these waters. The challenge is to use the ethnographic \u2018present\u2019 and mobility of the fishing and sailing groups for an understanding of the history of the sea and the extent to which knowledge of the waters was vital to the construction of identity of a maritime society. Linked to this movement across the waters, are the narratives of trans-locality inherent in memories of groups in the region. Long-distance pilgrimage and devotional networks have been consistent features of the cultural life of South and Southeast Asia. \nA third issue relates to European intervention, starting with the Portuguese and the Dutch. The engagement of the English East India Company with the countries of the Bay of Bengal was of a different order from that of its predecessors, as the Company sought to establish a maritime empire. The eighteenth century thus, raised a different set of issues with the colonization of large parts of South and Southeast Asia. How did notions of a maritime empire impact the study of the region\u2019s past? It is these themes that we address in the volume thereby shifting the focus from chronological markers and national histories to communities who crossed the waters and the changes that these underwent in time.\n\nBio-note of the editors:\nSatish Chandra is former Chairman of the University Grants Commission and former Professor, Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University.

The Mingun Pagoda, the 'white elephant' by Colesworthy Grant (British Library), a portrait of Arthur P.

Mean depth profiles of BSi showed a minimum in the surface waters and a maximum in the middle depths of the euphotic zone. The deepening of BSi maxima from north to south coincides with the deepening of the thermocline and thickening of the surface layer. In coastal waters, the contribution of BSi to total particulate silica was high (> 80 %); in offshore waters it was 60-70 %. BSiIPOC (0.086) and LSiIPOC (0.023) ratios show that particulate matter consists mostly of biogenic material, while the BSiILSi (1.61) ratio revealed the dominance of siliceous phytoplankton in the euphotic zone. High concentrations of BSi (0.49 pmol 1-') and LSi (1.89 pmol 1-') in deeper waters are due to a high sedimentation rate, the resuspension of bottom sediments and the flow of large amounts of riverine siliceous material.

This circulation system leads to an intense southwestward #ow in the central Bay. The circulation pattern characterizes the transition from the pre-monsoon (spring season) ACG to the southwest monsoon CG. A deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) is found in the depth range 30}50 m in the coastal region and 50}100 m in the open sea. The DCM is located below the surface mixed layer, in the oxycline and nutricline, and above the seasonal thermocline/pycnocline, which coincides with the deep stability maximum (DSM). In the ACG, the DCM is located at 100 m when DSM is at 140 m deep, whereas in the CG, the DCM and DSM rise to 50 and 80 m, respectively. The magnitude of the chlorophyll maximum (CMAX) is nearly twice as high in the CG zone as in the ACG zone.

Specific examination is needed in terms of how much and how effectively the existing structures have succeeded in taking on the scourge of both traditional and nontraditional security threats. It is also important to see how much more can be achieved in terms of regional and sub regional integration that promotes the economic well being of countries under the chosen umbrella. Terrorist Attack.The 9/11 attack in 2001, the Mumbai terror attack in 2008, the piracy attacks and armed robberies off the Somali coast as well as in the South China Sea brought about a sea change in the way land locked countries along with maritime nations looked at the serious challenges faced by Law Enforcement Agencies, Intelligence agencies, Maritime Security Forces and the civil society. It may be noted that even China which is more than 8000 kilometers from the piracy infested area off the Somali coast chose to send its war vessels to patrol the areas to protect its sea borne interests. In fact, PLA-Navy units have maintained active patrols since end of 2008. Certain measures were instituted immediately post the 9/11 attack to ensure that ships and ports were protected by similar attacks that could result in mass casualities and disruption. The main consideration was that just as the aircraft were hijacked and used as human guided missiles; ships likewise could be taken over and used as weapons against ports and facilities to cause large scale destruction and media attention. The measures included International Ship and Port Security Code(ISPS), Container Security Initiatives(CSI), and application of many innovative technological measures. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) an American led initiative was specifically designed to prevent proliferation though many countries including India did not join the initiative as there were concerns about the sovereignty issues of the vessels to be boarded by the inspecting units of a particular navy. The Mumbai terror attack on 26 th November 2008 on the other hand brought to fore the continued danger in the sub continent due to cross border terrorism. The audacious planning to attack the commercial capital by using well trained terrorists using the sea routes shook up the entire world and prompted security agencies to review the existing structures and mechanisms for preventing such attacks. The fact that the terrorists were able to take over a fishing vessel MV Kuber and commandeer the vessel to take them to a safe landing point in Mumbai indicated the dangers that lurked in the maritime neighbourhood of India with a determined neighbor hell bent on inflicting cuts at regular intervals to promote the policy of 'bleeding India to death by a thousand cuts \".

In the present study, we carry out an integrated analysis of the potential field data across the basin to understand the crustal structure and the associated rift tectonics. The composite-magnetic anomaly map of the basin clearly shows the onshore-to-offshore structural continuity, and presence of several high-low trends related to either intrusive rocks or the faults. The Curie depth estimated from the spectral analysis of offshore magnetic anomaly data gave rise to 23 km in the offshore Cauvery\u2013Palar basin. The 2D gravity and magnetic crustal models indicate several crustal blocks separated by major structures or faults, and the rift-related volcanic intrusive rocks that characterize the basin. The crustal models further reveal that the crust below southeast Indian shield margin is \u223c36 km thick and thins down to as much as 13\u201316 km in the Ocean Continent Transition (OCT) region and increases to around 19\u201321 km towards deep oceanic areas of the basin. The faulted Moho geometry with maximum stretching in the Cauvery basin indicates shearing or low angle rifting at the time of breakup between India\u2013Sri Lanka and the East Antarctica. However, the additional stretching observed in the Cauvery basin region could be ascribed to the subsequent rifting of Sri Lanka from India. The abnormal thinning of crust at the OCT is interpreted as the probable zone of emplaced Proto-Oceanic Crust (POC) rocks during the breakup. The derived crustal structure along with other geophysical data further reiterates sheared nature of the southern part of the ECMI.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45297528, "asset_id": 24965936, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3324113, "first_name": "Srinivasa Rao", "last_name": "Gangumalla", "domain_name": "ismdhanbad", "page_name": "SrinivasaRaoGangumalla", "display_name": "Srinivasa Rao Gangumalla", "profile_url": "https://ismdhanbad.academia.edu/SrinivasaRaoGangumalla?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3324113/1111662/1386088/s65_srinivasa_rao.gangumalla.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 409, "name": "Geophysics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geophysics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15947, "name": "Geodynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geodynamics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81995, "name": "Marine geology and geophysics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_geology_and_geophysics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1129920, "name": "Geophysics (Potential Field Methods) for Crustal Structure and Tectonics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geophysics_Potential_Field_Methods_for_Crustal_Structure_and_Tectonics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624553, "name": "Rift Tectonics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rift_Tectonics?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 23748426, "title": "Choosing a Boundary Layer Parameterization for Tropical Cyclone Modeling", "created_at": "2016-03-28T20:29:14.844-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23748426/Choosing_a_Boundary_Layer_Parameterization_for_Tropical_Cyclone_Modeling?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_23748426", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44186130, "asset_id": 23748426, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40520925, "first_name": "Jeffrey", "last_name": "Kepert", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JeffreyKepert", "display_name": "Jeffrey Kepert", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JeffreyKepert?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 60285, "name": "Atmospheric sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atmospheric_sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611183, "name": "Parameterization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parameterization?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 685326, "name": "Boundary Layer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Boundary_Layer?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 23715942, "title": "Forcing the Common Good: The Significance of Public Diplomacy in Military Affairs", "created_at": "2016-03-27T03:34:49.039-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23715942/Forcing_the_Common_Good_The_Significance_of_Public_Diplomacy_in_Military_Affairs?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_23715942", "summary": "Hard power, the unorthodox foreign policy mechanism, has emerged recently as a complex agency that uses military power to regulate diplomatic relations between military and civilian actors.

Among them highest amounts were ilish (39%) and lowest amounts were Thai koi (2%). About 85% of the fishes were brought from different rivers and ponds of the Barisal region and only 15% from Mymensingh, Jessor, Satkhira and from India (major carps). The marketing channel from fishermen/fish farmer to consumers passes through a number of intermediaries such as local paikers/aratdar/mahajan (local agent), wholesalers and retailers. The average gross profit of fish retailers in Port Road Bazar, Natun Bazar and Lakhutia Bazar were estimated as BDT 950/day, BDT 750/day and BDT 400/day (1 US$=78 BDT), respectively. Lack of storage facilities, poor supply of ice, exploitation by middlemen, lack of money and infrastructure were the common constraints of the fish marketing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43465849, "asset_id": 22938368, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44634583, "first_name": "Abdullah -Al-", "last_name": "Hasan", "domain_name": "univdhaka", "page_name": "AbdullahAlHasan", "display_name": "Abdullah -Al- Hasan", "profile_url": "https://univdhaka.academia.edu/AbdullahAlHasan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44634583/11865640/72132820/s65_abdullah_-al-.hasan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16691, "name": "Physical Oceanography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physical_Oceanography?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1914105, "name": "Sea Surface Salinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Surface_Salinity?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 22604375, "title": "MODIS images catalog of Internal Solitary Waves in the Sumba Strait during strong semidiurnal tides on 2015", "created_at": "2016-02-29T08:39:19.499-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22604375/MODIS_images_catalog_of_Internal_Solitary_Waves_in_the_Sumba_Strait_during_strong_semidiurnal_tides_on_2015?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_22604375", "summary": "MODIS true-color images during fortuitous sunglint conditions allows easy detection of internal solitary waves (ISWs) packets.

The 18.61 year lunar nodal precession has a large effect on the Moon\u2019s declination (its celestial latitude), minimizing the declination when N = 180\u00b0 (23\u00b0 27\u2032 \u2212 5\u00b09\u2032 = 18\u00b018\u2032). The low lunar declination increases the semidiurnal form of the tides. In addition, these two time periods are near the equinoxial tides then increasing the semidiurnal form of the tides. More important, on March 20 and September 27 the perigean and spring tides coincide. The sum of all the above factors explains why during these two time periods in 2015 we expected to see a strong semidiurnal forcing.

Several studies have been carried out on the organic-walled dino\uf002 agellate cyst distribution pattern in surface sediments of various marine regions of mid-high latitudes with very few studies from the tropical oceans. In the present study, dino\uf002 agellate cyst distribution pattern was studied in proximal-distal transect of the western Bay of Bengal at a water depth of 25m to 2500m. Distribution of different species of protoperidinioid and gonyaulacoid dino\uf002 agellate cysts were studied. Four major types of dino\uf002 agellate cyst associations, which are characteristic of inner neritic (Inner shelf), outer neritic (outer shelf), slope and oceanic zones, have been recognized. With the exception of gonyaulacoid dino\uf002 agellate cyst Bitectatodinium spongium, coastal inner and outer neritic regions of the Bay of Bengal are dominated by protoperidinioid dino\uf002 agellate cysts (heterotrophic forms). The oceanic assemblages are characterized by a low diversity of gonyalaucoid dino\uf002 agellate cysts (autotrophic forms) represented by Spiniferites species. The heterotrophic dino\uf002 agellate cyst species, predominant in the inner, outer and slope regions, show considerable variation in the species composition in coastal to distal region of the Bay of Bengal. Diversity and abundance of protoperidinioid dino\uf002 agellate cysts point to a high-nutrient loading and eutrophic environmental conditions of marine waters stretching as far as the slope regions of the Bay of Bengal.

The Bengal Fan \u2013 the world's largest submarine fan \u2013 has long been studied to understand the link between the Himalayan tectonics and Asian monsoon. But, lack of detailed information on corresponding signals hampered the understanding of related processes of tectonics, climate and erosion. The present study of long-streamer seismic reflection profile data and information from deep drill well logs in the western BoB has revealed two different phases of sediment deposition. In the first phase, until Oligo-cene\u2013Miocene (~23 Ma), Indian peninsular rivers discharged sediments to the BoB which accumulated at a rate ~20 m/m.y. with an aberration of two fairly enhanced sediment pulses during the periods from 65 to 54 Ma and 34 to 23 Ma. In second phase, since 23 Ma, the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers added huge volumes of sediments to the bay at variable rates ranging from 40 to >1000 m/m.y. A distinct increase in sediment discharge (~140 m/m.y.) during the Oligo-cene\u2013Miocene (~23 Ma) together with the development of regional onlap unconformity and the start of turbidity system provide an important age marker corresponding to rapid exhumation of the Himalaya, which intensified the erosional process and commencement of Bengal Fan sedimentation. Further rise in the rate of sedimentation during the period 6.8\u2013 0.8 Ma is coincident with the change in monsoon intensity , but surprisingly not in agreement with the decrease in sediment rate reported at ODP Leg 116 sites in the distal Bengal Fan.

In the case of premodern Bengali literature, however, neglecting the fact that texts were performed leads to a misunderstanding, not only of the way poems were composed, but also of the dynamics at work in the formation of the literary tradition as a whole. The texts I am dealing with in this article are panchalis, a type of Bengali narrative poem. Though the exact origin of the term remains unknown, panchali refers more to a kind of public performance than to a literary form or a genre.3 In this paper I propose to study the various levels of performance that shaped the compositional pattern of the Bengali panchali author Alaol.

After a brief introduction to the well-known life and works of \u0100l\u0101ol, I highlight some features of the literary multilingualism prevalent during the poet's time in the kingdom of Arakan. Then, I proceed with an analysis of his discourse on 'translation' scrutinizing the terms and expressions he used to describe the process of textual transposition from one language to another. My comments attempt at providing a more detailed account of what is often called bh\u0101v\u0101nuv\u0101da by scholars of Bengali literature. What comes out of my observations is that \u0100l\u0101ol's dynamic approach to translation is grounded in reading practices evincing his familiarity with Sanskrit and Indo-Persian hermeneutic traditions. Translation implied an active intervention on the source text and, beyond the mere transmission of its meaning, further elaborations on its aesthetic content - all of which were conditioned by traditional textual hermeneutics. Finally, as an invitation to further reflection on the topic, I argue that this very specific approach to textual transposition was misunderstood and abandoned in modern times for the sake of different, and aesthetically less engaged, methods of translation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40985083, "asset_id": 20044494, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8489787, "first_name": "Thibaut", "last_name": "d'Hubert", "domain_name": "chicago", "page_name": "ThibautdHubert", "display_name": "Thibaut d'Hubert", "profile_url": "https://chicago.academia.edu/ThibautdHubert?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8489787/11138863/12430500/s65_thibaut.d_hubert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1269, "name": "Persian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Literature?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14500, "name": "Bengali Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali_Literature?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48945, "name": "Commentary Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commentary_Traditions?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 537573, "name": "Arakan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arakan?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1365574, "name": "Avadhi Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Avadhi_Poetry?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 20044054, "title": "\u201cPirates, Poets, and Merchants: Bengali Language and Literature in Seventeenth-Century Mrauk-U.\u201d In Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India, edited by Thomas de Bruijn and Allison Busch.

My central concern will be the use of languages in this highly multicultural area and the formation of a literary corpus using one of these languages, namely Bengali. We will see that the Bengali language served as an intermediary between the local sphere and the networks of the Bay of Bengal, in which the kingdom occupied a place of growing importance.

The growing involvement of Bangladeshi\npeacekeepers is tantamount to its new orientation with the functioning of generic\nconstitutional process. The democratic governance in Bangladesh is also uninterruptedly\nin place since the popular uprising in 1990. Considering the close proximity of these two\nfacts the article has assessed whether there is any reciprocity in the context of BAF\u2019s\nnonintervention in Bangladeshi politics and its participation in UNPKO since the 90s.\nThe article has attempted to answer whether one is contributing to the sustenance of the\nother. The very interdependency between the BAF\u2019s participation in UNPKO and BAF\u2019s\nnonintervention in the democratic system in Bangladesh has become a political reality. In\n2007 BAF was about to intervene the regular democratic political system. Evidence\nshows that it was the pressure of abandoning BAF from UNPKO has deterred them to\nbecome directly involved in politics. Due to the nature of activities in the UNPKO, BAF\nhas been informed with human security approach. In the process BAF has to work closely\nwith the civil administration and local government. The article has explained whether\nsuch involvement is instrumental to reduce the gap of the BAF\u2019s understanding about the\nfunctioning of civilian and political institutions. The article has also underscored the\nimpact from individual level human security orientation to the BAF\u2019s institutional\napproach towards the political government. To understand such dynamics the author has\nconducted a qualitative analysis using mainly the available secondary literatures.

The origin, evolution and the present day configuration of these structures such as the northward down dipping of the Bay of Bengal basement and its lithosphere, the Moho of the 85oE ridge, the formation of the Ninetyeast ridge median graben and ridge normal faults and their interaction with slow convergence and stress diffusion processes in the north Andaman trench, remain conspicuous. In this paper, we explain the above mentioned processes and the existence of the Bay of Bengal basement features through plausible tectonic scenarios that related with past time dynamics of the Indian Plate prior to the India-Eurasia collision and lithospheric thermal perturbation due to the Ninetyeast Ridge magmatism.\nOur analysis on the basis of satellite altimeter-derived geoid, gravity, sediment thickness, basement undulation, isostatic and prospecting geoid anomaly; suggests apart from the enhanced Oligocene Himalayan erosion and subsequent increased sediment load, the gravitational stability of the basin load (like formation of ridge graben) was also affected by altering the basin rheology to inelastic, owing to the enhanced thermal perturbation by the ninetyeast ridge magma. This made the Bay of Bengal lithosphere rheologically weak. Pre India-Eurasia collision, fast movement and fast convergence of the Indian plate at erstwhile north Andaman subduction zone made the lithosphere relatively stretchable due to the prevalence of intra-plate extensional stresses. The NE-SW orientation of the Central basin depression and the northward (NE-SW) dipping of the Bay of Bengal (BOB) lithosphere are pointing to such a stretchable lithosphere and its remnants are present at the northeast of the northern Ninetyeast ridge, as observed from the low prospecting geoid anomaly. The presence of such a thermally altered, weak lithosphere as a subducting slab at the north Andaman trench caused the present day observed low convergence rate, lack of seismicity, as well as the cessation of fault rupture followed by the Great Sumatra Andaman earthquake of Mw (9.1) on 26 December 2004. The Ninetyeast ridge oblique collision with the north Andaman trench was presumed around Pleistocene based on the timing of abandonment of the Nicobar fan from the Bengal head fan. The discontinuity of the ridge along the oblique convergence zone of the north Andaman and its isostatic stability are mainly controlled by the subduction zone dynamics, unlike the 85oE ridge.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39863069, "asset_id": 18076796, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38425922, "first_name": "Tapan", "last_name": "Majumdar", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MajumdarTapan", "display_name": "Tapan Majumdar", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MajumdarTapan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 4085289, "first_name": "Rajesh", "last_name": "Sathyaseelan", "domain_name": "wihg", "page_name": "RajeshSathyaseelan", "display_name": "Rajesh  Sathyaseelan", "profile_url": "https://wihg.academia.edu/RajeshSathyaseelan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 810892, "name": "Marine Geosciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_Geosciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 18071157, "title": "Geoid generation and subsurface structure delineation under the Bay of Bengal, India using satellite altimeter data", "created_at": "2015-11-10T02:50:23.598-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/18071157/Geoid_generation_and_subsurface_structure_delineation_under_the_Bay_of_Bengal_India_using_satellite_altimeter_data?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_18071157", "summary": "In the present study, Geosat Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) and ERS-1 altimeter data over the Bay of Bengal have been processed for deriving marine geoid and gravity. Processing of altimeter data involves corrections for various atmospheric and oceanographic effects, stacking and averaging of repeat passes, crossover correction, removal of deeper structures and\nbathymetric effects, spectral analysis and conversion of geoid into free-air gravity anomaly. The final processed results are available in the form of residual/ prospecting geoid and gravity anomaly maps. The highs and lows observed in those maps have been interpreted in terms of a number of prominent mega structures, e.g. gravity linears, 85\u00b0E and 90\u00b0E ridges, the Andaman trench complex, etc. Satellite-derived gravity contour patterns match well with the available ship-borne results. Also, continental margin as well as 85\u00b0E and 90\u00b0E ridges could be demarcated well along latitudinal profiles. The isostatic compensation of major crustal features in this region has been discussed in the light of multiple wavelength marine geoid\nand free-air gravity. Results from the earlier studies using seismological data analysis and modelling also confirm high stress near the Ninetyeast Ridge. In addition, subsurface modelling over 85\u00b0E ridge shows that the crustal root has become shallower as one moves from north to south (14\u00b0N to 10\u00b0N). Progressive shifting of Continent Ocean crustal Boundary\n(COB) along the eastern passive continental margin has been observed both in satellite-derived and shipborne gravity data.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39859985, "asset_id": 18071157, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4085289, "first_name": "Rajesh", "last_name": "Sathyaseelan", "domain_name": "wihg", "page_name": "RajeshSathyaseelan", "display_name": "Rajesh  Sathyaseelan", "profile_url": "https://wihg.academia.edu/RajeshSathyaseelan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 234817, "name": "Satellite Geodesy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Satellite_Geodesy?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 18020141, "title": "Detecting tropical cyclone structural change with the TRMM Precipitation Radar (PR) and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU)", "created_at": "2015-11-09T06:48:42.833-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/18020141/Detecting_tropical_cyclone_structural_change_with_the_TRMM_Precipitation_Radar_PR_and_Advanced_Microwave_Sounding_Unit_AMSU_?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_18020141", "summary": "One of the most critical parameters to monitor within a tropical cyclone (TC) are temperature anomalies.

A country chiefly famous in the West for media images of poverty, underdevelopment, and natural disasters, Bangladesh did not exist as an independent state until 1971. Willem van Schendel's history reveals the country's vibrant, colourful past and its diverse culture as it navigates the extraordinary twists and turns that have created modern Bangladesh. The story begins with the early geological history of the delta which has decisively shaped Bangladesh society.

Bangladesh is located in the path of tropical cyclones \noriginating from the Bay of Bengal. The unique combination of a large astronomical tide, a funneling \ncoastal configuration, low flat terrain and frequent severe tropical storms occasionally produce storm \nsurges that have killed thousands of people. This paper is an attempt to understand the behavior of this \nweather phenomenon; condition of formation of tropical cyclone, formation area in the Bay of Bengal, \nseasons of formation, landfall area, track preparation, etc. GIS method has been used to find out the \nformation area and tracks of Tropical Cyclones over the Bay of Bengal. The frequency of formation of \ndepression and deep depression, Cyclonic Storms and Severe Cyclonic Storms during a particular month \nand year during the period of 1908-  2008 shows that most of these are formed in the Bay of Bengal \nduring June to November with the highest frequency in August followed by September. It is predicted that \nthe study will help understanding the magnitude of the problems to the concern authorities to reduce \ncyclonic damages in Bangladesh.\n\nKeywords: Tropical Cyclones, depression and deep depression, Cyclonic Storms, Severe Cyclonic Storms, \nBay of Bengal, weather, Formation Processes, Track Preparation, Landfall Area, Frequency, GIS", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38625846, "asset_id": 15305134, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43141824, "first_name": "Siddiki", "last_name": "R", "domain_name": "canberra", "page_name": "SiddikiR", "display_name": "Siddiki U R", "profile_url": "https://canberra.academia.edu/SiddikiR?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43141824/11559433/18314939/s65_siddiki.r.jpg"}, {"id": 21551882, "first_name": "Nurul", "last_name": "Islam", "domain_name": "juniv", "page_name": "NurulIslam", "display_name": "Nurul Islam", "profile_url": "https://juniv.academia.edu/NurulIslam?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21551882/10068208/11232155/s65_nurul.islam.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1009312, "name": "Geographic Information Systems (GIS)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographic_Information_Systems_GIS_?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15302883, "title": "WRF AND MM5 REALTIME SYSTEM STATISTICAL COMPARISONS USING THE MODEL EVALUATION TOOLKIT (MET)", "created_at": "2015-08-31T08:48:41.767-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15302883/WRF_AND_MM5_REALTIME_SYSTEM_STATISTICAL_COMPARISONS_USING_THE_MODEL_EVALUATION_TOOLKIT_MET_?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_15302883", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43350427, "asset_id": 15302883, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34400452, "first_name": "Nelson", "last_name": "Seaman", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NelsonSeaman", "display_name": "Nelson Seaman", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NelsonSeaman?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 234710, "name": "Model Evaluation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Model_Evaluation?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 527436, "name": "Diet and ASD", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diet_and_ASD?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1469922, "name": "Realtime System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Realtime_System?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15276294, "title": "Shared Goals, Converging Interests: A Plan for U.S.\u2013Australia\u2013India Cooperation in the Indo\u2013Pacific (co-authored report)", "created_at": "2015-08-29T23:50:04.952-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15276294/Shared_Goals_Converging_Interests_A_Plan_for_U_S_Australia_India_Cooperation_in_the_Indo_Pacific_co_authored_report_?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_15276294", "summary": "Liberal democratic powers in the Indo\u2013Pacific share a strategic interest in enhancing a web of relationships that promote economic and political stability, security, continued free and open trade throughout the region, and democratic governance.

This impact is severe in the coastal region. Proper water resources management is must in this problematic area. The coastal belt of Bangladesh is under a polder system. This system protects the mass people from great threats of natural and man maid calamities over the time. Human requirement of water is increasing day by day as life is getting better and better. So, a good management is required to augment the water resources. This research is aimed at filling the gaps in existing knowledge and management of Bangladesh\u2019s surface water resources. One of the challenges facing water managers understands how changing land use and land cover, evaporation and floods impact surface water resources. We are developing tools and methods to manage the increased pressure on water resources from different users and the competition for water between competing uses including interception from vegetation (such as plantation forestry or farming). Surface water resources are replenished by floodplain inundation and groundwater recharge from landscapes, but these events are episodic so the dynamics of the water balance need to be understood to fully appreciate the implications of variable and changing climate.

The lethality of air delivered weapons makes it difficult to selectively destroy the insurgent enemy who is not averse to using human shields. Despite the counter-productive effects that collateral damage can have on a CIO campaign, airpower offers many advantages in CIO. The highly social and political nature of CIO makes every CIO unique. However, the CIO conducted in Sri Lanka and being conducted in Nigeria have some important similarities. Boko Haram (BH), like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE), is a highly motivated insurgent group in control of parts of a sovereign nation and it enjoys the support of some of the population. BH like the LTTE has also employed tactics ranging from suicide bombings to conducting well coordinated conventional attacks. The SLAF and NAF on the other hand are both tactical air forces with very similar capabilities and are tasked with supporting a larger CIO effort. From the research conducted on the air operations of the SLAF in the Eelam war IV, the study finds that airpower was decisive in the success of the CIO campaign because it was employed strategically. The SLAF was able to provide offensive and logistic air support to the entire campaign. This study, however, finds that the most crucial capability of the SLAF was its ability to provide enhanced situational awareness by providing timely intelligence to the appropriate commanders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36345893, "asset_id": 10259355, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13740962, "first_name": "Makvreng", "last_name": "Nanle", "domain_name": "bup", "page_name": "MakvrengNanle", "display_name": "Makvreng Nanle", "profile_url": "https://bup.academia.edu/MakvrengNanle?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13740962/3823355/4474239/s65_makvreng.nanle.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 579, "name": "Strategy (Military Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategy_Military_Science_?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9451, "name": "Insurgency/Counterinsurgency(COIN)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insurgency_Counterinsurgency_COIN_?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19600, "name": "Air Power History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Air_Power_History?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10157155, "title": "Drinking Water Crisis in Maldives: India Leads the Way", "created_at": "2015-01-14T03:01:13.187-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10157155/Drinking_Water_Crisis_in_Maldives_India_Leads_the_Way?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_10157155", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36263623, "asset_id": 10157155, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 840724, "first_name": "Kapil", "last_name": "Narula", "domain_name": "gfri", "page_name": "KapilNarula", "display_name": "Kapil Narula", "profile_url": "https://gfri.academia.edu/KapilNarula?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/840724/296189/18113462/s65_kapil.narula.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10105749, "title": "A GEOPHYSICAL INSIGHT OF EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED ON 21ST MAY 2014 OFF PARADIP, BAY OF BENGAL", "created_at": "2015-01-10T20:56:29.793-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10105749/A_GEOPHYSICAL_INSIGHT_OF_EARTHQUAKE_OCCURRED_ON_21ST_MAY_2014_OFF_PARADIP_BAY_OF_BENGAL?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_10105749", "summary": "An earthquake of 6.0 magnitude on the Richter scale occurred around 21:52 hrs on 21 May 2014, nearly 275 km south-east of Paradip off Odisha coast.

In the present study, at a micro-tidal coast of the Bay of Bengal, \u03b418O and \u03b4D have been used to delineate the seasonal patterns of discharging terrestrial-sourced groundwater to the sea. Further, the stable isotopes are also being used to qualify and quantify the groundwater-seawater mixing and interactions. Seasonal, multi-depth pore water samples (0 to 105 cm) were collected from a transect that is perpendicular to the high tide line (HTL), and runs for 110 m towards the offshore. Stable isotope composition of the pore water demonstrate significant seasonal variability in the source of the discharging groundwater ( \u03b418O ranges: -8.98\u2030 and +1.82\u2030, \u03b4D ranges: -68\u2030 and +10.8\u2030). Seawater during the same period showed a \u03b418O range of -1.1\u2030 and +1.92\u2030, Consistent patterns of relatively isotopically-depleted pore waters (\u03b418O <-4.0\u2030) were observed at certain parts of the transect, suggesting preferential groundwater discharge zones in those areas that may be dictated by the hydraulic gradients, flow paths and aquifer properties. The gradient of the linear, best-fit trend line of the \u03b418O-\u03b4D bivariate plot for all of the pore water samples were found to be lower than the local or global meteoric water lines. Such a low slope may indicate discharge and/or mixing of terrestrially-sourced groundwater that have not been directly recharged from precipitation water along local flow paths. Most of the relatively \u03b4D depleted groundwater were found up to 40 m distance offshore from the HTL, probably suggesting the extent of terrestrially-sourced discharging groundwater that are undergoing mixing with the re-circulated marine-sourced pore water.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36010723, "asset_id": 9845174, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1276700, "first_name": "Gopal", "last_name": "Krishan", "domain_name": "nih-in", "page_name": "GopalKrishan", "display_name": "Gopal Krishan", "profile_url": "https://nih-in.academia.edu/GopalKrishan?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1276700/468500/6935199/s65_gopal.krishan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1703, "name": "Stable Isotope Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_Isotope_Analysis?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 338850, "name": "Groundwater - Sea water Relation (Groundwater Salinization)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Groundwater_-_Sea_water_Relation_Groundwater_Salinization_?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1725744, "name": "Micro-Tidal Coast", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Micro-Tidal_Coast?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9711168, "title": "Resolving the Indo-Bangladesh Maritime Dispute", "created_at": "2014-12-10T09:08:44.428-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9711168/Resolving_the_Indo_Bangladesh_Maritime_Dispute?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_9711168", "summary": "Indo-\u00adBangladesh relations have been consistently hit by several contentious issues.

These methodical artifacts in the previous version may have arisen due to the use of old Rapp\u2019s geo-potential model coefficients, as well as sharp truncation of reference model at degree and order 50. Geoid anomalies are converted to free-air gravity anomalies and validated with cross-over corrected ship-borne gravity data of the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. The present satellite derived gravity data matches well with the ship-borne data with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.1\u20137.8 mGal, and this is found to be within the error limits when compared with other globally\navailable satellite data. Spectral analysis of ship-borne and satellite data suggested that the satellite gravity data have a resolution down to 16\u201318 km. Further, the geoid, residual geoid and gravity anomalies are integrated with seismic data along two profiles in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, and inferences have been made in terms of density distributions at different depths. The new residual geoid anomaly map shows excellent correlation with regional tectonic features such as Sunda subduction zone, volcanic traces (Chagos\u2013Laccadive, Ninetyeast and 85_E ridges) and mid-ocean ridge systems (Central Indian and Carlsberg ridges).\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35869593, "asset_id": 9674914, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3324113, "first_name": "Srinivasa Rao", "last_name": "Gangumalla", "domain_name": "ismdhanbad", "page_name": "SrinivasaRaoGangumalla", "display_name": "Srinivasa Rao Gangumalla", "profile_url": "https://ismdhanbad.academia.edu/SrinivasaRaoGangumalla?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3324113/1111662/1386088/s65_srinivasa_rao.gangumalla.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 404, "name": "Geodesy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geodesy?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10769, "name": "Tectonics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tectonics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 251801, "name": "Geoid Determination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geoid_Determination?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 440806, "name": "Geoid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geoid?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9650700, "title": "An Edgeworth Box Approach toward Conceptualising Economic Integration", "created_at": "2014-12-06T12:05:46.559-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9650700/An_Edgeworth_Box_Approach_toward_Conceptualising_Economic_Integration?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_9650700", "summary": "The joint-communiqu\u00e9 originating from the January 2010 summit between India and Bangladesh has opened\nnew doors of opportunities for addressing economic integration not just between India and Bangladesh, but\nacross the South Asian region.

Deepening U.S.-Indian economic connections, shared democratic identities, declining U.S. defense budgets, and the rise of China have drawn the United States closer to India as a security partner in the region.\r\n\r\nTo advance bilateral naval ties through coordination on HA/DR, this study determines how the United States can best draw on:\r\n1) India\u2019s new disaster response architecture and growing naval capabilities and experiences;\r\n2) lessons learned from case studies of U.S. and Indian relief provision after previous natural disasters in the Indian Ocean; and\r\n3) research into likely outcomes of future natural disaster scenarios.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35556524, "asset_id": 8744799, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 905899, "first_name": "Nilanthi", "last_name": "Samaranayake", "domain_name": "eastwestcenter", "page_name": "NilanthiSamaranayake", "display_name": "Nilanthi Samaranayake", "profile_url": "https://eastwestcenter.academia.edu/NilanthiSamaranayake?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/905899/916834/31316062/s65_nilanthi.samaranayake.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3167, "name": "Disaster Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3995, "name": "Disaster risk management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_risk_management?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 15582, "name": "Disaster Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_Management?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 27881, "name": "Burma Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burma_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 41875, "name": "Bangladesh Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 42234, "name": "Natural Disasters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_Disasters?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 43838, "name": "India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 122529, "name": "2004 Indian Ocean tsunami", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/2004_Indian_Ocean_tsunami?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 167848, "name": "Maldives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maldives?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 183540, "name": "Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanitarian_Assistance_and_Disaster_Relief?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 305899, "name": "India Bangladesh relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India_Bangladesh_relations?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 615033, "name": "Climate change in the Maldives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_change_in_the_Maldives?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 724377, "name": "International Relations of the Indian Ocean Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_of_the_Indian_Ocean_Region?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 827186, "name": "Indian Ocean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Studies?f_ri=611562"}, {"id": 1002942, "name": "Indian Ocean Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Region?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 8687412, "title": "Mesoscale Modeling for Mountain Weather Forecasting Over the Himalayas", "created_at": "2014-10-07T23:46:35.478-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8687412/Mesoscale_Modeling_for_Mountain_Weather_Forecasting_Over_the_Himalayas?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_8687412", "summary": "Severe weather has a more calamitous effect in the mountainous region-because the terrain is complex and the economy is poorly developed and fragile.

The British Army had been routed and the British Fleet withdrew to Africa - the gates of India lay open.  But the Japanese Army stopped where it was and never tried to overthrow the British Raj.   Underlying their decision to stop at India\u2019s border was the fact that Japan\u2019s leaders did not see the Bay of Bengal to be a single strategic entity \u2013 rather, there was a dividing line between their \u201cmental map\u201d of what constituted Asia and the Indian subcontinent beyond.   \r\n\r\nOur mental maps of the world, including our perceptions of where regions begin and end, can have a profound impact on strategic behaviour.   For decades there has been a sharp division between what we understand to be the regions of South Asia and Southeast Asia.  The line between them effectively cuts the Bay of Bengal in two.  These perceptions have inhibited a proper analysis of the strategic dynamics of the area.  In this discussion I will argue that the rise of India and the re-conceptualisation of the \u201cIndo-Pacific\u201d makes the Bay of Bengal increasingly matter as a strategic space.   Like, the South China Sea, it is necessary understand the Bay as a coherent space in order to properly understand its strategic problems and dynamics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34226139, "asset_id": 7697999, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1832368, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Brewster", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DavidBrewster", "display_name": "David Brewster", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DavidBrewster?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1832368/3871427/4528464/s65_david.brewster.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7501185, "title": "MUSLIM", "created_at": "2014-06-29T19:14:09.673-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7501185/MUSLIM?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_7501185", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34070176, "asset_id": 7501185, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13410264, "first_name": "Abdullah", "last_name": "Az", "domain_name": "uettaxila", "page_name": "AbdullahAz", "display_name": "Abdullah Az", "profile_url": "https://uettaxila.academia.edu/AbdullahAz?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13410264/3754255/4397132/s65_abdullah.az.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7501053, "title": "Evaluation of United Arab Emirates WRF two-way nested model on a set of thick coastal fog situations", "created_at": "2014-06-29T18:58:28.197-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7501053/Evaluation_of_United_Arab_Emirates_WRF_two_way_nested_model_on_a_set_of_thick_coastal_fog_situations?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_7501053", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34070119, "asset_id": 7501053, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13409722, "first_name": "radi", "last_name": "ajjaji", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "radiajjaji", "display_name": "radi ajjaji", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/radiajjaji?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13409722/12420824/13824428/s65_radi.ajjaji.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 831195, "name": "Fog Prediction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fog_Prediction?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1431254, "name": "Physics of the Atmosphere", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physics_of_the_Atmosphere?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7157072, "title": "Muzaffar Alam and Sanjay Subrahmanyam, Writing the Mughal World.

About 20 km from the origin, the packet consists of 6 to 7 internal solitary waves, but 100 km farther from the origin position the number of waves in each packet doubled. The waves were ranked in amplitude order and their intra wave distance decreased from 7 km to 2.5 km.  These packets moved West (270\u00b0) and crossed 1270 km in about 5.4 days to reach the entrance of Trincomalee Bay, Sri Lanka. The average inter packet distance is 122 km, suggesting that the packets were phase locked with the internal tide.  Offshore of Trincomalee Bay entrance a nonlinear internal wave field was observed.  The intra wave distance was 2.5 to 5 km.  A nonlinear internal wave can excite a 42-minute coastal seiche in the Bay with an amplitude of 7 cm.

It constitutes the largest single fishable species in Bangladesh. Information on genetic variability and population structure is very important for both management and conservation purposes. Past reports on the population structure of T. ilisha involving morphometric, allozyme and RAPD analyses are contradictory. We examined genetic variability and divergence in two riverine (the Jamuna and the Meghna), two estuarine (Kuakata and Sundarbans) and one marine (Cox's Bazar) populations of T. ilisha by applying PCR-RFLP analysis of the mtDNA D-loop region. The amplified PCR products were restricted with four restriction enzymes namely, XbaI, EcoRI, EcoRV, and HaeIII. High levels of haplotype and gene diversity within and significant differentiations among, populations of T. ilisha were observed in this study. Significant FST values indicated differentiation among the river, estuary and marine populations. The UPGMA dendrogram based on genetic distance resulted in two major clusters, although, these were subsequently divided into three, corresponding to the riverine, estuarine and marine populations. The study underlines the usefulness of RFLP of mtDNA D-loop region as molecular markers, and detected at least two differentiated populations of T. ilisha in Bangladesh waters.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49553042, "asset_id": 4928901, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6466543, "first_name": "Dr. Sabuj Kanti", "last_name": "Mazumder", "domain_name": "bsmrau", "page_name": "DrSabujKantiMazumder", "display_name": "Dr. Sabuj Kanti Mazumder", "profile_url": "https://bsmrau.academia.edu/DrSabujKantiMazumder?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6466543/2839570/3315205/s65_sabuj_kanti.mazumder.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 156, "name": "Genetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genetics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54381, "name": "Molecular Biology and genetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Molecular_Biology_and_genetics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4828921, "title": "Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society Tropical cyclone predictions over the Bay of Bengal using the high-resolution Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW) model", "created_at": "2013-10-20T03:38:43.361-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4828921/Quarterly_Journal_of_the_Royal_Meteorological_Society_Tropical_cyclone_predictions_over_the_Bay_of_Bengal_using_the_high_resolution_Advanced_Research_Weather_Research_and_Forecasting_ARW_model?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_4828921", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32118465, "asset_id": 4828921, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6250588, "first_name": "yesu", "last_name": "babu", "domain_name": "kaust", "page_name": "yesubabu", "display_name": "yesu babu", "profile_url": "https://kaust.academia.edu/yesubabu?f_ri=611562", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 400, "name": "Earth Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Earth_Sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1252, "name": "Remote Sensing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remote_Sensing?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40030, "name": "Tropical cyclones", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tropical_cyclones?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562"}]}, {"id": 4669742, "title": "Grain Size Analysis of a Growing Sand Bar at Sonadia Island, Bangladesh", "created_at": "2013-10-03T18:47:46.813-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4669742/Grain_Size_Analysis_of_a_Growing_Sand_Bar_at_Sonadia_Island_Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_4669742", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32009411, "asset_id": 4669742, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 225944, "first_name": "Md.

"A native of Bruges (now part of Belgium), Jacques de Coutre was a gem trader who spent nearly a decade in Southeast Asia in the early 17th century. In addition to a substantial autobiography written in Spanish and preserved in the National Library of Spain in Madrid, he wrote a series of memorials to the united crown of Spain and Portugal that contain recommendations designed to reverse the decline in the fortunes of the Iberian powers in Southeast Asia, particularly against the backdrop of early Dutch political and commercial penetration into the region. Translated into English for the first time, these materials provide a valuable first-hand account of the bigger issues confronting the early colonial powers in Southeast Asia, and deep insights into the societies De Coutre encountered in the territory that today makes up Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37473245, "asset_id": 4302708,

have surrounded its establishment. Taking the strength of wellbeing aspirations as point of departure, we focus on two themes: the implications of MPA embeddedness in wider societal systems, and the consequences of natural and social variety for governance. We conclude first of all that conflict resolution depends on MPA authorities\u2019 willingness to engage with the interferences that emerge from outside the MPA area. Secondly, we point out the varying wellbeing aspirations of the population and the need to develop governance partnerships. The latter are argued to contribute to more balanced decision making, as well as to a greater appreciation among the target population of the \u2018fairness\u2019 of MPA policy.",

The knowledge of proximate biochemical composition of fishery species is fundamentally important for: the application of different technological processes, the characteristics post-mortem of species, as an aspect of quality of raw material and giving an idea of sexual stage. The study was conducted to determine the proximate biochemical composition of four marine fishes of the Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh. The study fishes were Dasyatis americana, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis zugei and Gymnothorax favagineus. From the study, it was found that Dasyatis americana contains highest protein, fat and ash concentration while Dasyatis Pastinaca holds highest concentration of moisture and lowest value of protein and fat. On the other hand, Dasyatis zugei hold lowest concentration of moisture and ash. Proximate biochemical composition of all species showed that their percentage of protein and fat content are good and can be a food item in parallel to the bony fishes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 11520775, "asset_id": 1469632, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1095572, "first_name": "Dr. Prabal", "last_name": "Barua", "domain_name": "juniv", "page_name": "PrabalBarua", "display_name": "Dr. Prabal Barua", "profile_url": "https://juniv.academia.edu/PrabalBarua?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1095572/394515/66687464/s65_dr._prabal.barua.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611561, "name": "Proximate Composition of MarineFishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Proximate_Composition_of_MarineFishes?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 611562, "name": "Bay of Bengal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bay_of_Bengal?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1214007, "title": "The tectonic fabric of the ocean basins", "created_at": "2012-01-11T05:08:45.559-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1214007/The_tectonic_fabric_of_the_ocean_basins?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_1214007", "summary": "We present a global community data set of fracture zones (FZs), discordant zones, propagating ridges, V-shaped structures and extinct ridges, digitized from vertical gravity gradient (VGG) maps.

These offsets are small considering gravity data only provide an approximation for the underlying basement morphology. We further investigate the origin of non-FZ seafloor fabric by combining published abyssal hill heights computed from gravity anomalies with global half-spreading rates. A residual abyssal hill height grid, with spreading rate effects removed, combined with our interpreted tectonic fabric reveals several types of seafloor fabric distinct from typical abyssal hills. Where discordant zones do not overprint abyssal hill signals, residual abyssal hill height anomalies correspond to seafloor that accreted near mantle thermal anomalies or zones of melt-depletion. Our analysis reveals several areas where residual abyssal hill height anomalies reflect pseudo-faults and extinct ridges associated with ridge propagation and/or microplate formation in the southern Pacific Ocean.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7557208, "asset_id": 1214007, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75692, "first_name": "Joanne", "last_name": "Whittaker", "domain_name": "utas", "page_name": "JoanneWhittaker", "display_name": "Joanne Whittaker", "profile_url": "https://utas.academia.edu/JoanneWhittaker?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75692/1573844/1905973/s65_joanne.whittaker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 400, "name": "Earth Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Earth_Sciences?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1200728, "title": "Artisanal fisheries status and sustainable management options in Teknaf coast, Bangladesh", "created_at": "2012-01-04T22:00:15.681-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1200728/Artisanal_fisheries_status_and_sustainable_management_options_in_Teknaf_coast_Bangladesh?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_1200728", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7523927, "asset_id": 1200728, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1095572, "first_name": "Dr. Prabal", "last_name": "Barua", "domain_name": "juniv", "page_name": "PrabalBarua", "display_name": "Dr. Prabal Barua", "profile_url": "https://juniv.academia.edu/PrabalBarua?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1095572/394515/66687464/s65_dr._prabal.barua.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 206, "name": "Social Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Change?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 949999, "title": "Numerical methods for integrating particle-size frequency distributions", "created_at": "2011-09-25T18:15:49.667-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/949999/Numerical_methods_for_integrating_particle_size_frequency_distributions?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_949999", "summary": "This article presents a suite of numerical methods contained within a Matlab toolbox for constructing complete particle-size distributions from diverse particle-size data. These centre around the application of a constrained cubic-spline interpolation to logit-transformed cumulative percentage frequency data. This approach allows for the robust prediction of frequency values for a set of common particle-size categories. The scheme also calculates realistic, smoothly tapering tails for open-ended distributions using a non-linear extrapolation algorithm. An inversion of established graphic measures to calculate graphic cumulative percentiles is also presented. The robustness of the interpolation-extrapolation model is assessed using particle-size data from 4885 sediment samples from The Netherlands. The influence of the number, size and position of particle-size categories on the accuracy of modeled particle-size distributions was investigated by running a series of simulations using the empirical data set. Goodness-of-fit statistics between modeled distributions and input data are calculated by measuring the Euclidean distance between log-ratio transformed particle-size distributions. Technique accuracy, estimated as the mean goodness-of-fit between repeat sample measurements, was used to identify optimum model parameters. Simulations demonstrate that the data can be accurately characterized by 22 equal-width particle-size categories and 63 equiprobable particle-size categories. Optimal interpolation parameters are highly dependent on the density and position of particle-size categories in the original data set and on the overall level of technique accuracy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32541566, "asset_id": 949999, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 32140394, "asset_id": 949999, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 276663, "first_name": "Sam", "last_name": "Roberson", "domain_name": "bgs", "page_name": "SamRoberson", "display_name": "Sam Roberson", "profile_url": "https://bgs.academia.edu/SamRoberson?f_ri=611562", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/276663/67881/115097/s65_sam.roberson.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 420, "name": "Sedimentology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sedimentology?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4060, "name": "Applied Statistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Statistics?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25078, "name": "Compositional Data Statistical Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Compositional_Data_Statistical_Analysis?f_ri=611562", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 320044, "title": "Review of Pamela Gutman,'Burma's Lost Kingdoms: Splendours of Arakan'", "created_at": "2010-09-07T07:46:48.090-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/320044/Review_of_Pamela_Gutman_Burmas_Lost_Kingdoms_Splendours_of_Arakan?f_ri=611562", "dom_id": "work_320044", "summary": "With a coherent general survey of early western Burmese art and architecture and a very absorbing body of photographic material, this volume will appeal to a wide audience.
