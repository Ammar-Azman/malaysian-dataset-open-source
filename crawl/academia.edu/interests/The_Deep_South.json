I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Charlottesville on August 14, 2017 led to a national and even international barrage of condemnations of white supremacy along with condemnations of those who were slow to condemn. Why do we like to judge and condemn? And why do we do it with such passion and zeal? Theologically, social judgment and condemnation rely silently on confidence that the standard of justice is eternal, that justice is decreed by divine law. Yet, the act of judgment and condemnation also produces self-justification and perhaps even scapegoating in order to protect social unity. If the biblical gospel proclaims that we are justified before God by grace and not via self-justification through condemnation, could we turn our attention more directly on those victimized by the conflict at hand? Specifically, could we listen to the voices of African Americans, Jews, American's Deep South and Southwest, and the disenfranchised white working class?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

"summary": "This chapter delves into Nick Cave\u2019s engagement with blues mythology. Entwined with his return to tropes pertaining to the southern United States in both literature and songwriting, the blues has been a vital theme in Cave\u2019s output since signing with Mute Records. In particular, the genre affords Cave access to a performative space in which he animates a series of malevolent alter egos. Situating his outlook in relation to Son House and the 1960s revival, I argue that Cave and the Bad Seeds associate blues sonority with violence, masculinity, sex, and iniquity. Although aiming to understand Cave\u2019s aesthetic on its own terms, I end by noting that such work trades on the wounds sustained by those stifled within the black Atlantic\u2019s racialized logic. Cave\u2019s fascination with the blues is nevertheless another indication of an unbounded creative imagination that ransacks history in the service of song.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1282093, "first_name": "Ross", "last_name": "Cole", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "RossCole", "display_name": "Ross Cole", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/RossCole?f_ri=983001", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1282093/470904/88686061/s65_ross.cole.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 109, "name": "Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 787, "name": "Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Folklore?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 788, "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mythology?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2956, "name": "Songwriting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Songwriting?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13497, "name": "African American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_History?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 16898, "name": "Blues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blues?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 174941, "name": "Rock Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Music?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 182689, "name": "Nick Cave", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nick_Cave?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 399336, "name": "Black Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Music?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 983001, "name": "The Deep South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Deep_South?f_ri=983001"}]}, {"id": 19893585, "title": "TIMOTHY OLYPHANT \u2013 JUSTIFED", "created_at": "2015-12-29T14:35:34.434-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19893585/TIMOTHY_OLYPHANT_JUSTIFED?f_ri=983001", "dom_id": "work_19893585", "summary": "The whole question I am concerned about is whether a TV series, any TV series can be analyzed only at the purely technical, filming, shooting and editing, level or if it can be dealt with as a work of fiction that has to be considered like any work of fiction, as seriously as we would consider Shakespeare or Walt Whitman.\n\nI am not satisfied with all such technical approaches that only speak of ellipses and flash backs and flash forwards and the angle of the take or the camera, the zooming details and movements.\n\nI am not satisfied with those who consider a TV series, since it has to be popular, as having to be banal, hollow, void, meaningless and not being able to be analyzed the way any other work of fiction would and should be analyzed.\n\nI deeply agree with the practice of Great Britain where an actor can \u2013 and must or at least is recommended to \u2013 have a parallel career on the stage, for TV and for the cinema. I regret the USA do not have that practice. We know the result when we compare British series and American series.\n\nWhat\u2019s more I don\u2019t see why so many directors \u2013 and critics \u2013 consider film directors cannot direct a TV series, and they generally concede Twin Peaks as being an exception of a rather marginal man in the world of television. That\u2019s grotesque.\n\nI watched all these seasons in one go, two episodes per night and I summarized some general ideas only at the end. It is thus a living experience of this series and I think that\u2019s how TV has to be taken, as a living experience. It is not because Dexter was killed \u2013 was he really killed \u2013 in his TV series that the author Jeff Lindsay does not have the right to keep him alive and to go on with his adventures. And we had already been used with such discrepancies between the TV series and the novel series. \n\nYet a series has a problem with its end. It has to come to an end in some kind of flourish, fireworks, fanfare, brilliant twist. Prison Breaks is one of the best as for that, and yet two years later they are speaking of bringing it back to the screen. How are they going to revive the main character? The actor is available but the character was buried.\n\nSir Conan Doyle has already done that with his Sherlock Holmes that he killed at least once and nearly killed several times to just bring him back to life to satisfy public demand. That was literature you are going to say, and then what! Maybe TV series are also fiction.\n\nLet me tell you here that I find it funny when some pretend to deal with history in fictional series and to have a good historian as a guarantee that all they say in the series is pure history, like Un Village Fran\u00e7ais by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Krivine and the retired university professor Jean-Pierre Az\u00e9ma who found a juicy supplement to his retirement instead of teaching a few years more (65 is the sacred age at which all researchers have to retire in France, even in medicine, so that some just move to the USA to go on with their scientific work). Sorry to deceive you Mr Krivine, either you are an author and you respect the rules of fiction, and you work for television and you respect the rules of TV series and that goes against anything having to do with historical truth, especially since there is no truth, there are only points of view and Jean-Pierre Az\u00e9ma is just one point-of-viewer among many others; or you are a historian and then you should be teaching your point og view about history to some university students. We are not watching your series to have any historical truth, sorry point of view, hammered into our thick skulls.\n\nLuckily, otherwise they would reinvent the Bible.\n", "downloadable_attachments":

pubblicitario (brochure, opuscoli, pubblicit\u00e0, spot) prodotto dagli uffici del turismo di quattro stati (Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Carolina del Sud) tra il 1976 e il 1981. L\u2019analisi parte dalla constatazione che durante gli anni Settanta, e soprattutto nella seconda met\u00e0 del decennio, si sia reso visibile un profondo rimodellamento dell'immagine turistica del Sud, un cambiamento che ha accompagnato e perfino anticipato trasformazioni altrettanto importanti nella cultura e nella societ\u00e0 meridionale in generale. Sebbene sia assodato che nel corso degli anni Settanta la percezione e il ruolo simbolico del Sud all'interno della cultura americana siano profondamente cambiati, non \u00e8 mai stato studiato come questi cambiamenti si siano riflessi nell'immagine promozionale della regione e nella sua autorappresentazione verso l\u2019esterno. La tendenza \u00e8 stata anzi quella di considerare gli anni Settanta come un periodo di semplice riproposizione dell'immaginario classico del Vecchio Sud delle piantagioni. Quello che questo lavoro vuole tentare di mettere in luce, invece, \u00e8 come le origini dell'attuale immagine del Sud, indefinibile e quasi caotica, possano essere rintracciate proprio nel materiale pubblicitario concepito per attirare i visitatori durante la seconda met\u00e0 degli anni Settanta", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65267756, "asset_id": 44776244, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 103388739, "first_name": "Giuliano", "last_name": "Santangeli Valenzani", "domain_name": "roma3", "page_name": "GiulianoSantangeliValenzani", "display_name": "Giuliano Santangeli Valenzani", "profile_url": "https://roma3.academia.edu/GiulianoSantangeliValenzani?f_ri=983001", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/103388739/29683308/27592501/s65_giuliano.santangeli_valenzani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7860, "name": "Cultural Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Tourism?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7916, "name": "Twentieth Century US South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twentieth_Century_US_South?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12644, "name": "Commemoration and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_and_Memory?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17447, "name": "American Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Popular_Culture?f_ri=983001", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310201, "name": "History of Travel and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Travel_and_Tourism?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 983001, "name": "The Deep South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Deep_South?f_ri=983001"}, {"id": 1339135, "name": "Monuments and Memorials", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monuments_and_Memorials-1?f_ri=983001"}]}]
