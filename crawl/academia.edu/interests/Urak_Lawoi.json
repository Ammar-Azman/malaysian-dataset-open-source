[{"id": 3730958, "title": "Language change among the Urak Lawoi'", "created_at": "2013-06-17T09:41:00.793-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3730958/Language_change_among_the_Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475", "dom_id": "work_3730958", "summary": "In this article, the link between migration, community forming and language change of the Urak Lawoi\u2019 (UL) people is made evident. Descriptive and comparative linguistic research, conducted since February 2010 in several Urak Lawoi\u2019 communities on Thailand\u2019s Andaman coast  has supplied most of the data. Some additional data have been selected from earlier research, notably that by Amorn Thawisak (1986). \r\nUrak Lawoi\u2019 is a highly adaptive language that has developed alongside other Malay languages from the Malayan group (which also includes Para Malay languages such as Minagkabau and Temuan). Like the vocabulary of other Malay languages, such as Johor-Riau, Jambi, Kedah, Bengkulu and Pattani, that of UL is for the greater part cognate with the modern standard Malay (SM) languages, the most well known of which are the national languages of Malaysia (Bahasa Malaysia; BM) and Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia; BI)3. When spoken, UL cannot be properly understood by speakers of SM. This is, however, primarily due to certain regular sound changes. By comparing UL with other Malay languages, and by considering loans in vocabulary and grammar which have occurred over time, we can define the place where the Urak Lawoi\u2019 originated as a people, where they went from there, and in which places they chose to settle semi-permanently before making Southern Thailand their permanent domicile. \r\nThe Urak Lawoi\u2019 have a lot in common with other Malay people, but there are also many things in which they differ. Originally a nomadic sea people, they have hardly been indianized and never been islamized, and until today hold on to their own animistic beliefs. Nomadic as they were, the Urak Lawoi\u2019 have been in contact with many other peoples and cultures, and though they never yielded to complete adaptation to a dominant society\u2019s values, and only recently gave up their nomadic life style, they were to a great extend influenced by the groups they came into contact with. Many of these influences are reflected in the Urak Lawoi\u2019 language. Urak Lawoi\u2019 has loaned from Sanskrit, SM, English (directly and via SM) and most recently from Thai. So even though no written sources about the ethnic homeland of the Urak Lawoi\u2019 exist, by tracing linguistic development and influences we can trace back the path to their place of origin - which lay along the eastern coast of Sumatra - with comparative ease. This paper offers to point out how migration, community forming and settlement of the Urak Lawoi\u2019 is mirrored in their language. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31409172, "asset_id": 3730958, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2782260, "first_name": "Jacob", "last_name": "de Groot", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "JacobdeGroot", "display_name": "Jacob de Groot", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/JacobdeGroot?f_ri=1000475", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2782260/908421/19053484/s65_jacob.de_groot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 86664, "name": "Austronesian linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_linguistics?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 717182, "name": "Linguistic Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Analysis?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1000475, "name": "Urak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1663572, "name": "Ethnic homeland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_homeland?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5237971, "title": "Urak Lawoi' Language and Social History", "created_at": "2013-11-26T23:45:41.969-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5237971/Urak_Lawoi_Language_and_Social_History?f_ri=1000475", "dom_id": "work_5237971", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32421598, "asset_id": 5237971, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2782260, "first_name": "Jacob", "last_name": "de Groot", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "JacobdeGroot", "display_name": "Jacob de Groot", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/JacobdeGroot?f_ri=1000475", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2782260/908421/19053484/s65_jacob.de_groot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1000475, "name": "Urak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200037, "name": "Non-globalized Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non-globalized_Languages?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200038, "name": "Malay Dialectology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Dialectology?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4044493, "title": "The settlement of Ko Lipe (1910-2010)", "created_at": "2013-07-16T14:09:26.764-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4044493/The_settlement_of_Ko_Lipe_1910_2010_?f_ri=1000475", "dom_id": "work_4044493", "summary": "The tiny island of Ko Lipe in the Andaman Sea is of great importance to the sea people who live in the area. The Urak Lawoi\u201f had been a wandering people for many generations before their leader, a man called To\u201f Kiri, brought them to the islands they now call home. Lipe was one of the first islands to be occupied by the Urak Lawoi\u201f because of its flat interior and protected position, its sweet water source and the good and easy mooring sites it offered for the Urak Lawoi\u201fs boats. To\u201f Kiri and his descendants lived on Lipe, and died there. To\u201f Kiri\u201fs grave is on the North side of the island; a holy place for the Urak Lawoi\u201f, indicated by a commemorative plaque. \r\nWhen all Urak Lawoi\u201f inhabitants of the Tarutao and Adang Archipelagos were forced out of their villages on other islands to be resettled on Ko Lipe because the whole area was to become a national park, this had great consequences for the self sufficient life style that the Urak Lawoi\u201f had become accustomed to since their first settlement in Southern Thai waters, and when mass tourism began to develop in the area, the Urak Lawoi\u201f became in fact a marginalized people. The question is to whom the use of land and resources of Ko Lipe and the park is actually reserved to; to the Urak Lawoi\u201f or to the project developers who have transformed the beautiful island into a tourist paradise. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31581407, "asset_id": 4044493, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2782260, "first_name": "Jacob", "last_name": "de Groot", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "JacobdeGroot", "display_name": "Jacob de Groot", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/JacobdeGroot?f_ri=1000475", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2782260/908421/19053484/s65_jacob.de_groot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10336, "name": "Ethnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnology?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 235701, "name": "Resettlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resettlement?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1000475, "name": "Urak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475"}]}, {"id": 65496772, "title": "Coastal heritage: Exploring caves and indigenous knowledge in the Lanta Bay (Southern Thailand)", "created_at": "2021-12-22T05:55:46.554-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/65496772/Coastal_heritage_Exploring_caves_and_indigenous_knowledge_in_the_Lanta_Bay_Southern_Thailand_?f_ri=1000475", "dom_id": "work_65496772", "summary": "Hills and caves in islands or along the coasts are part of the cultural seascape of the various people inhabiting or passing through the shores of southern Thailand.

Originally, they were a nomadic sea people, living mainly on their boats and in temporary settlements along the islands\u201f coasts. From around 1910 the Urak Lawoi\u201f appeared rather suddenly on the islands along the Thai coast. They made their living by fishing and gathering other fruits of the sea, such as crustaceans and tripang, and would repair to temporary shelters on the islands when their catch had to be cured for trade, or when weather conditions made it impossible to stay on open sea. Depending on the seasons and the connected availability of sea products they would either stay on coastal islands like Lanta, Talibong or Tarutao, or venture further out and camp on the outlying islands of Adang, Lipe, Rawi, Rok Nai or Phi Phi. Beginning in the 1940ies the Urak Lawoi\u201f settled on the islands which had formerly been merely their provisional domiciles, and they became permanent, though not yet fully legal, citizens of Thailand. \r\n \r\nThe Urak Lawoi\u201f people have no literary tradition. Literacy among the Urak Lawoi\u201f dates from the time of their settlement, when their children started to follow curricula at Thai schools. Texts in Urak Lawoi\u201f are strictly modern, and written in a modified Thai script. Due to this fact it is impossible to know from written sources where the homeland of the Urak Lawoi\u201f lay. A story widely told among the Urak Lawoi\u201f gives us a glimpse of the possible whereabouts of the land of their ancestors. According to this oral tradition, the founder of the Urak Lawoi\u201f \u201eclan\u201f arrived in Thailand four to five generations ago, from the Indonesian Daerah Istimewah  Aceh, or, as it was then called, the province of Atjeh in the Netherlands Indies. \r\n \r\nThis paper aims to determine the true homeland of the Urak Lawoi\u201f people by unraveling the oral tradition concerning their origin through linking available historical and linguistic evidence. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30529367, "asset_id": 2513016, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2782260, "first_name": "Jacob", "last_name": "de Groot", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "JacobdeGroot", "display_name": "Jacob de Groot", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/JacobdeGroot?f_ri=1000475", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2782260/908421/19053484/s65_jacob.de_groot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7540, "name": "Oral Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Traditions?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9183, "name": "Comparative Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Linguistics?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1000475, "name": "Urak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2955802, "title": "Translation as an instrument in descriptive linguistic research", "created_at": "2013-03-11T15:37:15.349-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2955802/Translation_as_an_instrument_in_descriptive_linguistic_research?f_ri=1000475", "dom_id": "work_2955802", "summary": "Translation is an all too easily accepted instrument in linguistic field research. Linguistic researchers use translation and translators in order to find, compare and get acquainted with the words and grammar of their target language . During the research, as long as a field language is used, translation is part of the research method. In researching a language which origins and superficial appearance are close to languages well-known to the researcher, the inclination he might feel to translate an apparent cognate in the target language with their phonemic lookalike in these languages he knows is understandable. This disposition might even be enhanced when, out of necessity, these languages are used as field languages during the research. However, when a field language closely related to the dialects or languages researched is used, and precisely when the lingual nature and traditions of ethnic groups with a divergent world view or with a different cultural awareness are the subjects under research, the researcher should consider the fact that these two last factors will have an impact on the use of language within its relation to the cultural and natural world of its speakers: their language describes their world, not our world or even the world. Therefore, in order to understand not only the semantics of the language of a group under study but also its deviant referential socio-psychological and cultural cadre, the instrument of translation must under certain conditions be abandoned to make place for a more holistic and even intuitive descriptive approach. \r\nThe conditions described above may be exemplified in the research I conducted on Basa Urak Lawoi\u2019  and the description of the language that I completed recently (De Groot 2012). Due to their isolated history, the language of the Urak Lawoi\u2019 is based on, describes and conveys a reality that is quite different from that of speakers of other Malay languages and that of any researcher venturing into their midst. The proximity of Urak Lawoi\u2019 to other Malay languages therefore is in some cases a bonus to the researcher who speaks and understands Bahasa Malaysia or Bahasa Indonesia , although equally often it forms an obstacle for the correct understanding of its relation to truth and reality in the linguistic-philosophical sense. This paper will propagate reflection on whether, in situations as the described, the instrument of translation in general and the instrument of comparison with related languages in particular should be parts of the right method to go about linguistic research, or whether these instruments should be as much as possible dropped. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30910831, "asset_id": 2955802, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2782260, "first_name": "Jacob", "last_name": "de Groot", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "JacobdeGroot", "display_name": "Jacob de Groot", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/JacobdeGroot?f_ri=1000475", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2782260/908421/19053484/s65_jacob.de_groot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1000475, "name": "Urak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475"}]}, {"id": 30824150, "title": "Ross, Lawrence.

It focuses on the Andaman Coast of Malaysia and Thailand: a confluence of people and cultures in what was once a rural backwater prior to World War II but an area that has also long been exposed to contemporaneous cosmopolitan society from its neighbors in the region.  These interrelationships produced a rich musical environment with a shared \u201cAndaman\u201d character, but as the twentieth century progressed and the region became divided along national lines, people and culture ceased to  flow as they had previously. Legacies of a common Andaman Coast culture, however, remained extant despite being under-acknowledged. I explore those legacies through ethnographic and musical data from several cases that are united by a shared drumming practice. I refer to it as the changgong rhythm (borrowing the name of its best-known manifestation) and describe its archetypal features and appearances in four separate songs\u2014including two mixed-sex social dances, a musical folk theater, and a ceremonial consecration, each of which holds an important position in the repertoires of its respective musical community. By using this musical phenomenon to bring attention to the common character and social networks of the Andaman Coast region (across borders, genres, and time), we can gain better understanding of some of the complex social dynamics that have shaped the region in recent decades, particularly in the transformations to the livelihoods, lifestyles, identities, and allegiances of its once-mobile populations.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58674143, "first_name": "Lawrence", "last_name": "Ross", "domain_name": "myum", "page_name": "LawrenceRoss", "display_name": "Lawrence Ross", "profile_url": "https://myum.academia.edu/LawrenceRoss?f_ri=1000475", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58674143/15353955/15999068/s65_lawrence.ross.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1987, "name": "Ethnomusicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomusicology?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=1000475", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1000475, "name": "Urak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475"}, {"id": 1319552, "name": "Urak Lawoi/Orak Lawoi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urak_Lawoi_Orak_Lawoi?f_ri=1000475"}]}, {"id": 37450556, "title": "Thailand \u2013 the Land of Smiles", "created_at": "2018-09-20T13:21:33.180-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37450556/Thailand_the_Land_of_Smiles?f_ri=1000475", "dom_id": "work_37450556", "summary": "Thailand \u2013 the Land of Smiles som det ofta kallas i reklamen \u2013 har blivit ett av de popul\u00e4raste resm\u00e5len f\u00f6r m\u00e5nga v\u00e4sterl\u00e4nningar att spendera sin semester p\u00e5.
