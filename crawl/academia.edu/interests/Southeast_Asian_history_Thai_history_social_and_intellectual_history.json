An unfinished history of the rise of Thailand's monarchical-aristocratic class, beginning during the Ayutthaya period and moving to the end of the nineteenth century in Bangkok, Jit attempts to fit Thai history into a Stalinist, stage-oriented history in which the Thai people must overcome the remnants of feudalism in order to move past the largest obstacle to further industrialization. The particularities of Thai history, however, make this a difficult task \u2013 one at which Jit fails. Jit suggests that Thailand exists under collective or joint exploitation from both capitalists and the monarchical-aristocratic class. These coexisting forms of exploitation are not in conflict with one another but constitute a form of direct and abstract domination that, within Jit's text, can only be overcome through revolution. Following Harry Harutoonian's recent efforts to de-provincialize Marx, I connect the latent multiple temporalities of Jit's text to Marx's later writing on the historic presuppositions of capital and the process of formal subsumption in an effort to demonstrate how both recognized the problem of 'backwardness' as a problem of capital's subsumption of older forms of domination. Everywhere in forums belonging to the People\u2026the voices sounding the loudest are those denouncing imperialism and saktina. Surely this broad movement of the Thai people which opposes and denounces imperialism and saktina is an auspicious sign revealing that the Thai People of today are now fully awake. They have been able to identify clearly the enemies who plunder them and skin them alive and suck the very marrow from their bones\u2026Moreover, the Thai People also now realize that their exploitation and oppression by imperialism and saktina consist of joint exploitation (kaankhuutriitruamkan), meaning that both stand to gain from this joint exploitation \u2026Thus the voices coming from the Thai People resound again and again: the principal enemies that must be driven away with all urgency are the imperialists without and the saktina within.

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":
