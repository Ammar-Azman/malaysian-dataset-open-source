Noted for its sudden appearance in mostly men in mid-life, patients invariably died in hospital within one to five years from the first onset of symptoms. Our study sought to examine the impact of GPI and other manifestations of neurosyphilis on asylum admissions in Queensland in the pre-antibiotic era, analysing the patient records of the Goodna Hospital for the Insane in the period 1880 to 1920. Those diagnosed with GPI on admission were more likely to be married and employed in professional, administrative, technical/trade occupations. The average age of death was just over forty-three years. Conversely, those admitted for other psychiatric presentations where syphilis was presumed to be causal, tended to be predominantly unmarried, and more likely to be in labouring occupations. Average age of death was fifty-two years.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55618189, "asset_id": 35743479, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75283493, "first_name": "Mary", "last_name": "Stewart", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MaryStewart31", "display_name": "Mary Stewart", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MaryStewart31?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75283493/20097317/19855396/s65_mary.stewart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34300013, "title": "'Mustafa Kemal at Gallipoli: The Making of a Saga.'

Wasn\u2019t it Jack Thompson, still in his 1982 garb as \u2018Clancy of the Overflow\u2019 who castigated Australia\u2019s littering and commanded us to \u2018 do the right thing, keep Australia beautiful ay\u2019? What could have Australia\u2019s voice, and Breaker Morant\u2019s defender speaking of invasions?\n\nEqually disturbing, yet with far less eloquence and indeed, in a more militant and \u2018underdog\u2019 manner, images of ex kangaroo hunter and tree chopper Dayne \u2018Frackman\u2019 Pratzky stealthily crawling beneath barbed wire, kitted out in camouflage to obtain a mysterious liquid from an outback industrial site, conjure thoughts reminiscent of \u2018The Great Escape\u2019 or \u2018Platoon\u2019. 60 Minutes\u2019 Liz Hayes also speaks of some national subjugation as she carefully phrases her concerns that \u2018It is an invasion few landholders are prepared for...and just like the gold rush era of the 1850\u2019s, nearly every backyard in Queensland\u2019s north west Downs are being plundered by twenty first century prospectors.\u201d \n\nInvasions?

Again Hayes alludes to this apparently formidable foe as she alarmingly resounds \u201cthis would be bad enough if it were happening half way around the world in some tin pot dictatorship, but this is happening in our backyard. It is OUR laws and OUR politicians who are letting it happen.\u201d \n\nWho is this foe? Coal Seam Gas hydraulic fracturing! \n\nThe impact of popular and activist media presentations on environmental issues surrounding CSG \u2018fracking\u2019 has courted controversy in the United States via documentaries such as \u2018Gasland\u2019, and its various heavy industry and \u2018fact checker\u2019 rebuttals. Likewise, the Australian environmental-media landscape has germinated by way of American influence its own native crop of activist/pop culture documentaries over the last five years such as \u2018Frackman\u2019 and \u2018Fractured Country\u2019 from whence several of the aforementioned quotations derive.\n\nHydraulic fracturing and indeed industrial scale mining have been a part of Australia\u2019s industrial narrative for quite some time, so why and how have the issues surrounding CSG fracking garnered such a media response in recent years? It is the scope of this essay to explore from an historical perspective, the development of CSG fracking, from its embryonic roots in the United States to the implementation in Australia, and considering the popular media precursors from the United States in order to understand how this issue has taken root with such potency over the last ten years.\n\nThe \u2018Invader\u2019: Hydraulic fracture gas mining\n\nKnown also as hydro fracturing, hydro fracking, fraccing and fracking, hydraulic fracturing has its origins as a mining technique in the United States. In essence, \u2018fracking\u2019 is a process of well stimulation where rock is deliberately fractured by hydraulically pressurized liquid made of water, sand and an assortment of heavy chemicals. \n\nHigh pressure fluid (chemicals, sand and water) is injected into a well bore in order to crack the deep rock formations (fractures) so as to release trapped natural gas or petroleum. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, particles from the fracturing proppants (chemical gels, sand and aluminium oxide) hold the fractures open to sustain gas release. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37852812, "asset_id": 12856743, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6253239, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Brown", "domain_name": "newcastleuni", "page_name": "MatthewBrown", "display_name": "Matthew F Brown", "profile_url": "https://newcastleuni.academia.edu/MatthewBrown?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6253239/2828213/6903857/s65_matthew.brown.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 994723, "name": "Coal Seam Gas In Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coal_Seam_Gas_In_Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34807747, "title": "Water, history and the Australian city: urbanism, suburbanism and water in a dry continent, 1788-2015", "created_at": "2017-10-09T06:44:03.666-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34807747/Water_history_and_the_Australian_city_urbanism_suburbanism_and_water_in_a_dry_continent_1788_2015?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34807747", "summary": "This report provides the historical context for Australian urban and suburban development in the period since European colonisation in 1788. The report is a deliverable for Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities (CRCWSC) project on \u2018Understanding social processes to achieve water sensitive cities\u2019 (Project A2.1).\n\nWhile the major focus is the three key node cities of the CRCWSC (Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth) the report also provides background information on the histories of other Australian cities and locates the Australian urban experience within international contexts of the \u2018settler societies\u2019 of the so-called New World.\n\nThe key three cities have differing early histories as well as climate and topographic differences \u2013 sub-tropical and hilly Brisbane, temperate and flat Melbourne, and Mediterranean and flat Perth. Despite these differences, residents of each of these cities as with residents of all Australian cities - have from at least since the late nineteenth century demonstrated a clear preference for suburban rather than urban living, and a strong preference for low-density, detached dwellings over higher-density attached ones. They have also demonstrated a willingness to wear the elevated private costs associated with these dwelling and \u2018lifestyle\u2019 choices.\n\nIn this report we draw on the historical concept of \u2018path dependency\u2019 - that is the key constraining roles that decisions made or not made in the past have on contemporary practices and policy options. This central concept leads us to argue that as planners, engineers and policy-makers seek to move us towards a more\nwater sensitive future, rather than try to impose new morphologies, habits and practices on a likely unwilling Australian public, they should instead actively work with new and existing suburban communities to adapt received ideas about residential and dwelling cultures to these new hydrological constraints.\n\nWhile the report makes clear that Australians have traditionally been profligate with water, we also demonstrate that they have always shown a remarkable willingness to adapt water habits and usage during times of crisis. Our report proves that whereas in the past planners and governments have traditionally looked to \u2018big engineering\u2019 solutions such as newer and ever-larger dams (or more recently desalination plants) in order to deal with issues around water supply and demand, in practice two important but administratively simple and cheap policy changes have had the greatest impact: water pricing and public education campaigns.\n\nThe latter has been especially effective during periods of drought. The historical evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that once the impacts of drought and wasteful usage of water have been explained, urban Australians have adapted their water use and behaviours to fit the short-term need for restraint. We see no reason why that should not remain the case into the future. We thus recommend that in a climate change-influenced water constrained-future, public education campaigns about the importance of water sensitivity should become a permanent component of public policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54666754, "asset_id": 34807747, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1302580, "first_name": "Andrea", "last_name": "Gaynor", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "AndreaGaynor", "display_name": "Andrea Gaynor", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/AndreaGaynor?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1302580/480868/605522/s65_andrea.gaynor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13527, "name": "Water History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 70695, "name": "History of Water Supply", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Water_Supply?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 442527, "title": "Australia's 'Other' History Wars: Trauma and the Work of Cultural Memory in Kate Grenville's The Secret River", "created_at": "2011-02-14T06:23:18.449-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/442527/Australias_Other_History_Wars_Trauma_and_the_Work_of_Cultural_Memory_in_Kate_Grenvilles_The_Secret_River?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_442527", "summary": "Kate Grenville\u2019s The Secret River (2005) enacts a narrative return to the violent trauma of Aboriginal dispossession and destruction upon which Australia is founded, situating its reader complexly, as both witness to and complicit in the events it retells.

But privately an enigma. The REAL Archbishop Mannix: from the sources, reveals Mannix through his own words, his own actions and the actions taken against him.\u201d\r\n\r\nArriving in San Francisco in June 1920, on his way to Rome to call on the Pope, Mannix wasted no time in making inflammatory remarks about the English. Addressing the Catholic summer school at Plattsburg, New York, he said, \u201cThere is no use mincing words-Ireland is ruled by an alien Government.

I have used existing work on wine history in New South Wales (Australia) from 1788 to 1901 alongside a significant body of new research to create an historical argument suitable for incorporation into more broadly-themed narratives of Australian history and to inform studies of wine growing in other academic fields.  My principal argument is that although wine growing proved of little economic value in colonial primary production compared with nation-building commodities - such as pastoralism, wheat growing and gold - advocates of the cultivation of wine grapes believed wine growing embodied beneficial, even transformative, cultural value so they persisted in attempting to create a \u2018civilizing\u2019 industry.  Several times, from 1788 to 1901, advocates invoked wine and wine growing as capable of creating order in a wild or \u2018savage\u2019 landscape and within a settler society shaped culturally by shifting adaptations to both imported and \u2018native\u2019 influences in agriculture as well as alcohol production, consumption and distribution.  While the methodological framework employed here falls mainly within economic, social and environmental history, sociological theories have contributed to findings on causation. The result is a comprehensive, expert narrative of colonial wine growing in New South Wales enriched by links to key developments in Australian colonial history and with reference to wine growing in other British colonies or former territories.\n\nThis thesis incorporates material from my earlier publications and has in turn been revised into a 'crossover' book titled First Vintage: Wine in Colonial New South Wales (UNSW Press, 2012).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50823490, "asset_id": 30373704, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6156822, "first_name": "Julie", "last_name": "McIntyre", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "JulieMcIntyre", "display_name": "Julie McIntyre", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/JulieMcIntyre?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6156822/2557223/15537452/s65_julie.mcintyre.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6858, "name": "Food History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17918, "name": "Intellectual and cultural history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_and_cultural_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 22251, "name": "Agriculture and Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture_and_Food_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 147963, "name": "History of wine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_wine?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 26001534, "title": "From Vance Palmer's The Passage to Susan Johnson's The Landing", "created_at": "2016-06-08T19:04:25.969-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26001534/From_Vance_Palmers_The_Passage_to_Susan_Johnsons_The_Landing?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_26001534", "summary": "This paper compares Vance Palmer\u2019s classic novel, The Passage (1930) set in Caloundra, with Susan Johnson\u2019s The Landing (2015), a comic novel of manners set a further north on the contemporary Sunshine Coast.

The impact of British power on Aboriginals was calibrated and ruthless, but we are now asked to question British 'intent', that there was no documented intention by Britain to commit genocide. This is a further example of 'reframing'. Mass killing almost never has a written order. It is unlikely, and highly self-incriminating, that a Government would issue instructions for carrying out deliberate murder. Nevertheless, ethnically targeted mass killing-racial destruction-is usually the expected result of some official policy or reactive social behaviour within a policy context. We are asked by some politicians and historians to absolve or reject Britain's role in colonial genocide because there is no evidence of written orders from the British Government that authorises mass killing. Others argue, if mistakes were made, that the past should remain in the past. We are further asked by some (such as Windschuttle and other denialists) to dismiss any allegations of mass killing because there is no body of legal evidence (that is, case histories) to support such a charge. Instead, we are exhorted to consider violence against Aboriginals, if we accept it at all, as the aberrational excesses of a few settlers at the lawless frontier; or if we reluctantly accept that targeted racial violence and Aboriginal antipathy did occur, we are encouraged to play it down as 'a black armband' view of history that is unhelpful in the myths we prefer to create for ourselves.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66054118, "asset_id": 45577331, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42610368, "title": "Aborjinler'de yeti\u015fkinli\u011fe  ge\u00e7i\u015f t\u00f6reni: Walkabout", "created_at": "2020-04-04T00:23:31.752-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42610368/Aborjinlerde_yeti%C5%9Fkinli%C4%9Fe_ge%C3%A7i%C5%9F_t%C3%B6reni_Walkabout?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_42610368", "summary": "Aborjinler ismi size tan\u0131d\u0131k geliyor mu? \u00c7o\u011funuz kangurular\u0131 ve \u00e7\u00f6lleriyle me\u015fhur Avustralya k\u0131tas\u0131n\u0131 ve \u00fclkesini duymu\u015fsunuzdur.

However the 1943 French invention of the self contained underwater breathing apparatus which came to be known as SCUBA would, in the post war period, make shipwreck diving more accessaible than ever before. This paper traces the development of SCUBA diving in New South Wales, early shipwreck investigations, and the rise of a new breed of shipwreck explorer 'the tech diver'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2003159, "asset_id": 447011, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 125848, "first_name": "Kieran", "last_name": "Hosty", "domain_name": "anmm", "page_name": "KieranHosty", "display_name": "Kieran  Hosty", "profile_url": "https://anmm.academia.edu/KieranHosty?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/125848/33605/56227/s65_kieran.hosty.125848"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35037935, "title": "'The Vandemonian War: The Secret History of Britain\u2019s Tasmanian Invasion' by Nick Brodie, Australian Book Review 394 (Sept 2017), 32.", "created_at": "2017-11-02T23:15:49.829-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35037935/The_Vandemonian_War_The_Secret_History_of_Britain_s_Tasmanian_Invasion_by_Nick_Brodie_Australian_Book_Review_394_Sept_2017_32?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35037935", "summary": "Review of Nick Brodie's The Vandemonian War: The Secret History of Britain\u2019s Tasmanian Invasion (Hardie Grant Books, 2017).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54900312, "asset_id": 35037935, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10719809, "first_name": "Billy", "last_name": "Griffiths", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "BillyGriffiths", "display_name": "Billy Griffiths", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/BillyGriffiths?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10719809/6486762/18178080/s65_billy.griffiths.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33671011, "title": "Appendix A: New Zealand Plant availability in Australian nurseries", "created_at": "2017-06-27T05:32:05.401-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33671011/Appendix_A_New_Zealand_Plant_availability_in_Australian_nurseries?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_33671011", "summary": "This appendix lists New Zealand plant species stocked and available in Australian nurseries, over time.

What was the reality of their captivity? Beyond Surrender presents for the first time the diversity of the Australian 'behind-the-wire' experience, dissecting fact from fiction and myth from reality.\n\nBeyond Surrender examines the impact that different types of camps, commandants and locations had on surrender, survival, prison life and the prospects of escape. It considers the attitudes of Australian governments to those who had surrendered, the work of relief agencies and the agony of families waiting at home for their husbands, brothers and fathers to be freed.\n\nCovering several conflicts and diverse sites of captivity, Beyond Surrender showcases new research from Kate Ariotti, Joan Beaumont, Lachlan Grant, Jeffrey Grey, Karl James, Jennifer Lawless, Peter Monteath, Melanie Oppenheimer, Aaron Pegram, Lucy Robertson, Seumas Spark and Christina Twomey.\n\n\nContents:\n\n1.

The following study will give a reasoned argument for the fact that Mary MacKillop's Scottish and Australian cultures underpinned her choices in life. With these cultures in mind, one will investigate her spirituality as evidenced through her actions in light of her dual cultural background. The framework for the work that follows will begin with a snapshot of the current religious and spiritual temperature in Australia. This will then be used to segue back in time, particularly to the history of the Celts. Once an understanding of Mary MacKillop's heritage has been established, one will be able to gain some insight into her Scottish spirituality, followed by her Australian influence. The concluding part of this work focuses on two specific individuals who arguably also shaped Mary MacKillop's spirituality resulting in her lifelong calling to serve the poor.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63662970, "asset_id": 43371744, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37025032, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Misdom", "domain_name": "worldview", "page_name": "DanielMisdom", "display_name": "Daniel Misdom", "profile_url": "https://worldview.academia.edu/DanielMisdom?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37025032/11470984/12794375/s65_daniel.misdom.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9366, "name": "Spiritual Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spiritual_Formation?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12349, "name": "Spirituality & Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality_and_Mysticism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21049, "name": "Christian Spirituality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christian_Spirituality?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36088588, "title": "The Middle Class at War", "created_at": "2018-03-06T02:40:57.943-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36088588/The_Middle_Class_at_War?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_36088588", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55978053, "asset_id": 36088588, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13718712, "first_name": "William", "last_name": "Westerman", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "WilliamWesterman", "display_name": "William  Westerman", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/WilliamWesterman?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13718712/3910164/19411684/s65_william.westerman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29830, "name": "Middle Class Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_Class_Identity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 22721754, "title": "The Pioneer Migrant: The Link to Chinese-Australian Family History", "created_at": "2016-03-02T20:36:59.608-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22721754/The_Pioneer_Migrant_The_Link_to_Chinese_Australian_Family_History?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_22721754", "summary": "Everybody is born into a family.

Cahill, R. Connell, B. Freeman, T. Irving, B. Scribner, this is the founding manifesto of what became the innovative and radical Free University (Free U), Sydney, 1967-1972. The Sydney Free U  initially operated out of rented premises in Redfern (Sydney) before moving to premises in nearby  suburbs. The first Free U courses commenced in December 1967, and early in the new year involved 150 people. At its peak, during the summer of 1968-1969, over 300 people were involved in courses. The Sydney experiment  stimulated others to attempt something similar in Adelaide, Armidale, Brisbane, Hobart, and Melbourne, although the Sydney experiment seems to have been the most successful. This foundation document is included in C. Turney (editor), 'Sources in the History of Australian Education 1788-1970' [Angus & Robertson, Sydney, 1975].

While it is well known that the Walk Off was driven by the poor treatment of Aboriginal workers, what is less well known is the previous decades of massacres and killings, stolen children and other abuses by early colonists.

This is the most comprehensive study to date on the relationship between religion and the state in Australian history, focusing on the meaning of political secularity in a society that was from the beginning marked by a high degree of religious plurality.\n\nThis book tracks the rise and fall of the established Church of England, the transition to plural establishments, the struggle for a public Christian secular education system, and the eventual separation of church and state throughout the colonies. The study is unique in that it does not restrict its concern with religion to the churches but also examines how religious concepts and ideals infused apparently secular political and social thought and movements making the case that much Australian thought and institution building has had a sacral\u2013secular quality. Social welfare reform, nationalism, and emerging conceptions of citizenship and civilisation were heavily influenced by religious ideals, rendering problematic traditional linear\nnarratives of secularisation. \n\nFinally, the book considers present day pluralist Australia and new understandings of state secularity in light of massive social changes over recent generations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58435453, "asset_id": 38380017, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19845487, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Chavura", "domain_name": "campion", "page_name": "StephenChavura", "display_name": "Stephen A Chavura", "profile_url": "https://campion.academia.edu/StephenChavura?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19845487/5516507/49083540/s65_stephen.chavura.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9690, "name": "Intellectual History of Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History_of_Enlightenment?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12624, "name": "History of Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Political_Thought?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19283, "name": "Secularisms and Secularities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secularisms_and_Secularities?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 21096, "name": "Separation of Church and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Separation_of_Church_and_State?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 116468, "name": "Church and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_and_State?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 34497906, "title": "The Great War as Ideological Conflict: An Australian Perspective", "created_at": "2017-09-06T23:21:15.088-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34497906/The_Great_War_as_Ideological_Conflict_An_Australian_Perspective?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34497906", "summary": "War and Society, Vol. 7, No. 2 (1989), pp. 56-76.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54363759, "asset_id": 34497906, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11468510, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Moses", "domain_name": "charlessturt", "page_name": "JohnMoses", "display_name": "John Moses", "profile_url": "https://charlessturt.academia.edu/JohnMoses?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11468510/9131207/10183511/s65_john.moses.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167738, "name": "World War 1", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_1?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4236713, "title": "Libby Robin, Chris Dickman, and Mandy Martin (eds.) -

Home for Boys in Queensland, Australia, existed in various forms for over one hundred years. As such, it offers a valuable window into Australian approaches to managing and reforming boys through the twentieth century. The present paper examines its approach to reforming teenage boys during a period marked by a mass escape in 1961. It argues that the reformatory education initially intended was no longer tenable during this moment in history, and that this period represents a breakdown of that approach. \n\nThis paper draws on material including newspaper reports, memoirs, and the report of an inquiry into an escape by inmates in 1961. These are analysed in order to construct a picture of the type of reformatory education during this period and the public and official responses to this. \n\nWestbrook Farm Home for Boys was, during this period, an institution attempting to provide a reformatory education at a historical moment when such an education was no longer viewed as appropriate means of addressing the criminal behaviour of youths. This, combined with the leadership of a domineering figure in Superintendent Roy Golledge, led to a culture of abuse, rather than education. The uncovering of this culture was a pivotal moment in the transition of Westbrook into an institution explicitly dealing with criminal youths.

These produced such a number of issues relevant to the study of the philosophy behind historiography, that it would be a difficult to cover all in such a limited period. This led to a focus upon what the 1985 Royal Commission dubbed the \u201cMarston Controversy.\u201d \n\nThroughout my research on this event, I explored the influence of the respective agendas and paradigms of \u2018historians\u2019 upon their research as well as the parallels between the natural and social sciences. Rather than merely studying the remaining written material, I consulted sources from a variety of other mediums, such as oral history and audiovisual material. In order to maintain a balanced perspective, sources from both the British and Australian perspectives were obtained, and individual participants, as well as relevant government departments, such as Australian Radiation Protection And Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST), and British Defence Research and Support Staff (BDRSS), were consulted. \n\nThe central concerns of this essay concentrate on the reliability of \u2018scientific\u2019 data as a historical source, and the extents to which personal influences or agendas of individuals (be they historians or researchers) affect the resultant historiographies. In addressing these issues, this essay presents the prominent events during Australia\u2019s nuclear testing era and the \u2018Marston controversy\u2019, analyses the background of the \u2018historians\u2019 to present possible reasons for their opinion, and makes comparisons between the perspectives. Scientific data is also treated in a similar manner to the historical sources, thus making a connection between the methodologies and the subjectivity of the natural and social sciences. \n\nThis paper was added to the source selection list of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) on Maralinga for some ten years, and although based on pre-University work serves at the very least as a sound resource list for the topic in question.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64028610, "asset_id": 43720037, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 164664106, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Townsend", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "jtwnzJohnTownsend21", "display_name": "John Townsend", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/jtwnzJohnTownsend21?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/164664106/46249730/35798901/s65_john.townsend.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4507, "name": "Nuclear Weapons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nuclear_Weapons?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20881, "name": "History of Nuclear Weapons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Nuclear_Weapons?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 996031, "name": "Nuclear Tests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nuclear_Tests?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3442437, "name": "Maralinga Nuclear Tests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maralinga_Nuclear_Tests?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 38441795, "title": "Daniel Marc Segesser: review of David S.

The children removed became known as the Stolen Generations. In 1997 the Wilson-Dodson enquiry published the findings in the Bringing Them Home Report which sparked intense public and academic debate around the issue of the forced removal of Aboriginal children, particularly whether it constituted genocide. In the wake of the report scholars investigated how the actions of the federal and state governments and their agencies relates to the 1949 United Nations definition of genocide. But this scholarship has not engaged specifically with the genocide of the \u2018half-caste\u2019 population. Apprehension around part-Aboriginal individuals arose in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century when many white Australians feared a growing \u2018coloured\u2019 population. This dissertation addresses this gap in the literature by exploring the removal of the \u2018half-caste\u2019 children in the states of Western Australia and New South Wales. Laws enacted by both state legislatures clearly reveals genocidal intent. The effects of the policy can be seen through victim\u2019s testimonies, which show the long term consequences of being removed, and highlight other aspects of genocide. This research also aims to examine other aspects of genocide in relation to the part-Aboriginal population, including severe mental and physical harm, conditions of life that were calculated to bring about its destruction, and the imposition of measures intended to prevent births within the group. I argue that these actions can be considered as genocide in accordance to the United Nations definition these actions can be considered as genocide.

And, most importantly, by what means did they gain a following? The colonisation of time is a highly original and long overdue examination of the ways that western-European and specifically British concepts and rituals of time were imposed on other cultures as a fundamental component of colonisation during the nineteenth century. Based on a wealth of primary sources and a comparative analysis of two British settler-colonies\u2014Victoria, Australia, and the Cape Colony, South Africa\u2014it explores the intimate relationship between the colonisation of time and the conquest of land; time\u2019s instrumentality in the exportation of Christianity, capitalism, and modernity; and its role in forging European identities and civilities against an imaginary, \u2018time-less\u2019 and \u2018irregular\u2019 other.

The discourse of sub-imperialism developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as a means of characterising the British self-governing Dominions\u2019 uncertain status in the international order, and drew explicitly on the United States Monroe Doctrine. The article revisits the significance of sub-imperialist posturing at two critical junctures in the historical formation of the Commonwealth of Australia. The first is the formalisation in the early 1880s of the movement toward federation of the Australasian colonies as a response to perceived British acquiescence to German imperialism in the Western Pacific. The second is the Commonwealth government\u2019s attempt during the Versailles negotiations of 1919 to annex to its territory the occupied German Pacific territories of New Guinea and Nauru. The principal argument made in this article is that attempts to establish an Australian sub-empire in the Western Pacific were fundamental both to the federation movement and the recognition of Australian sovereignty in international law. The article concludes that Australian sub-imperialism warrants greater attention both in accounts of the history of Australia\u2019s transition from self-governing Dominion to sovereign status in international law, and in accounts of contemporary Australian foreign policy in the Pacific region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57412998, "asset_id": 37445984, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9007089, "first_name": "Cait", "last_name": "Storr", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "CaitStorr", "display_name": "Cait Storr", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/CaitStorr?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9007089/4246260/39290409/s65_cait.storr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13908, "name": "History of International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Law?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32671, "name": "Pacific History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 30940434, "title": "McGrath, A.  \u201cIntroduction\u201d.

The fear of the \u203ayellow peril\u2039 found expression in science and politics as well as in innumerable invasion novels which depicted the swamping of the European outpost in the Pacific by Asiatic hordes. The programme of a white society was reasoned scientifically and found political supporters not least in the labour movement. Moreover, it found expression in a medium which was even more popular than pulp fiction: consumer racism which propagated the consumption of \u203awhite sugar\u2039. \u203aWhite sugar\u2039 was a very special commodity: refined white and produced white, it comprised white labourers, dearer sweetness, protection from the world market, and gaining of intra-continental acceptance through subsidies. Certainly there were countless points of contact between colour discrimination and thinking in terms of whiteness. In the context of the European diggers\u2019 rebellions on the goldfields, the workers\u2019 strikes against the replacement of white with Chinese labour and clashes with Aborigines on the colonial frontier, the whites\u2019 anger was given vent to. But these were largely isolated incidents involving concrete problems and select societal groups. Invasion novels and sugar consumption, on the other hand, aimed at the whole society. The problem to turn the empty north, considered \u203aterra nullius\u2039, into a breeding ground for whiteness and, thus, into a bulwark against the \u203ayellow peril\u2039 was considered problematic, however. This was due to the utilization interest of the agrarian capital as well as the phantasies of degeneration of race sciences. While the latter were not sure whether whites would altogether proof to be able to successfully settle in the tropics, the former were mainly interested in the exploitation of cheap labour. This paper will look into the ways in which the campaigns to consume white-produced Australian sugar and the genre of invasion novels accomplished to subsume lobbies of adverse interests in the joint pursuit of white Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62185257, "asset_id": 21191995, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 477227, "first_name": "Stefanie", "last_name": "Affeldt", "domain_name": "uni-heidelberg", "page_name": "StefanieAffeldt", "display_name": "Stefanie Affeldt", "profile_url": "https://uni-heidelberg.academia.edu/StefanieAffeldt?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/477227/160446/35858781/s65_stefanie.affeldt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6858, "name": "Food History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10469, "name": "Whiteness Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19051, "name": "Transnational Labour Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Labour_Migration?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 49467, "name": "Sugar cane", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sugar_cane?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 75130, "name": "Sugar industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sugar_industry?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 78265, "name": "Political economy of sugar production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_economy_of_sugar_production?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 966953, "name": "History of Cooking and Food Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cooking_and_Food_Culture?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 5555344, "title": "Girlhood in Transition: Girls\u2019 Shipboard Diaries on Journeys to New Zealand, 1879-1881", "created_at": "2013-12-29T17:29:53.897-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5555344/Girlhood_in_Transition_Girls_Shipboard_Diaries_on_Journeys_to_New_Zealand_1879_1881?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_5555344", "summary": "Nineteenth-century girlhood was imagined as a decisive period of liminality: distinct from both childhood and adulthood, it shaped the womanhood that followed it. Shipboard diaries written by emigrants engage with a similar period of transformation. Discussing three diaries written by girls en route from Scotland and Ireland to New Zealand, this essay explores how the liminality of girlhood and the liminality of the emigrant voyage are intertwined. While narrating a spatial and temporal transition, the three texts also negotiate a transformation in the concept of girlhood: the notion of the ideal colonial girl as brave, resourceful and hardworking developed traditional British expectations of women as responsible for the domestic sphere and as upholders of morals. Whereas two of the diarists stress qualities such as bravery, a sense of adventure, and good health, the third diarists focuses on a more traditional concept of girls as pure and virtuous. The texts\u2019 adherence to and departures from the genre conventions of shipboard diaries emphasise the liminality of the journey, mirroring the transformative potential of new notions of girlhood.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32648557, "asset_id": 5555344, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1130929, "first_name": "Lilja",

The purpose is to use historical records, including Deakin\u2019s own writings, to uncover the extent to which Alfred Deakin was a a social and business entrepreneur.  The period of analysis is 1885 when he was twenty-nine years of age and serving as Minister for Water Supply and President of the Royal Commission on Water Supply.  Deakin\u2019s vision of an irrigated Murray Basin drew upon his Victorian liberalism and on his own spiritualism, viewing water as \u2018life force\u2019 that could provide the \u2018vital spark\u2019 to the land through engineering and irrigation science.

The men, all members of the Irish National Association (INA), were taken to the Military Detention Barracks at Darlinghurst, an inner-city suburb of Sydney, where they were held until war\u2019s end. The government claimed they were members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood who through links to America and Germany were seeking to aid an armed revolution in Ireland. A public judicial inquiry into the internments found that the government was justified in continuing to detain the men. During their incarceration they became known as the \u2018Darlinghurst Seven\u2019. A number of photographs of the internees was smuggled out of Darlinghurst Gaol. One of those photographs shows eight men. This paper tells the story of that eighth man, William Joseph Fegan, a founding member of the INA in Queensland who was imprisoned in Darlinghurst gaol twice as long as the others but without the benefit of a judicial inquiry to review his internment. The little known case of William Fegan demonstrates, more so than that of the Darlinghurst Seven, how untrammelled executive power was used unjustly during the First World War to deprive the government\u2019s opponents of their liberty.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63056876, "asset_id": 42824940, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5203947, "first_name": "Jeff", "last_name": "Kildea", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "JeffKildea", "display_name": "Jeff Kildea", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/JeffKildea?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5203947/42229567/33953824/s65_jeff.kildea.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 200139, "name": "Irish Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Australian_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35810029, "title": "An incident at the Upper Ross: remembering Black American servicemen in Australia during World War Two", "created_at": "2018-01-31T19:19:58.219-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35810029/An_incident_at_the_Upper_Ross_remembering_Black_American_servicemen_in_Australia_during_World_War_Two?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35810029", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56736018, "asset_id": 35810029, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73135589, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Leach", "domain_name": "swinburne", "page_name": "DanielLeach", "display_name": "Daniel Leach", "profile_url": "https://swinburne.academia.edu/DanielLeach?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/73135589/18937128/40270956/s65_daniel.leach.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13497, "name": "African American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 74844, "name": "Race relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_relations?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 643124, "name": "The Second World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Second_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 993590, "name": "Mutiny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mutiny?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 10381146, "title": "The Black War, by Nicholas Clements", "created_at": "2015-01-29T21:53:53.882-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10381146/The_Black_War_by_Nicholas_Clements?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_10381146", "summary": "A review of Nicholas Clement's 'The Black War: fear, sex and resistance in Tasmania', University of Queensland Press, 2014.

While the Australian experiment of penal colonization was not considered a model for direct imitation, it did nonetheless provide a foundational reference point for France and indeed other European powers well after its demise, serving as a yardstick (whether positive or negative) for subsequent discussions about the utility of transportation as a method of controlling crime. The ultimate fate of the Australian experiment raised questions in later decades about the utility, sustainability and primary purpose of penal transportation. Drawing on the records of both French and international penal reform organizations, this paper reflects on the legacy that the British experiment was seen to provide in the decades after convict transportation to Australia ended, while French transportation took off. In so doing, it casts light onto the expectations of and rationale for penal colonization held by its practitioners\u2014past, present, and aspiring. Even if penologists saw penal transportation as serving some useful role in tackling crime, the experience of the British in Australia seemed to indicate the strictly limited practicability of the method in terms of controlling crime. Far from a self-sustaining system, penal colonization was premised on an inherent and insurmountable contradiction; namely, that the realization of the colonizing side of the project depended on the eradication of its penal aspect.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39354177, "asset_id": 10355485, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21670211, "first_name": "Briony", "last_name": "Neilson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "BrionyNeilson", "display_name": "Briony Neilson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/BrionyNeilson?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21670211/5955661/11810577/s65_briony.neilson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1181, "name": "French History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4153, "name": "Criminal Justice History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8007, "name": "Penology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Penology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19018, "name": "New Caledonia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Caledonia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 22773, "name": "HISTORY OF CRIME AND LAW", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/HISTORY_OF_CRIME_AND_LAW?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 128448, "name": "History of Crime and Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Crime_and_Punishment?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 131775, "name": "French Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Colonial_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 166694, "name": "Histoire du droit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Histoire_du_droit?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 43740981, "title": "#MirandaMustGo: Contesting a settler colonial obsession with lost-in-the-bush myths through public and socially engaged art", "created_at": "2020-07-29T17:04:25.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43740981/_MirandaMustGo_Contesting_a_settler_colonial_obsession_with_lost_in_the_bush_myths_through_public_and_socially_engaged_art?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_43740981", "summary": "In January 2017, settler Australian artist, Amy Spiers, launched a creative campaign to contest habitual associations at the site of Hanging Rock in Central Victoria with a white vanishing myth. Entitled #MirandaMustGo, the campaign\u2019s objective was to provoke thought and unease about why the missing white schoolgirls of Joan Lindsay\u2019s fictional novel, Picnic at Hanging Rock, prompted more attention and feeling in the general public than the actual losses of lives, land and culture experienced by Indigenous people in the region as a consequence of rapid and violent colonial occupation. The campaign incited significant media attention, substantial public debate and some reconsideration of the stories told at Hanging Rock. In this article, Spiers will describe how she conceptualized the artwork/campaign as a propositional counter-memorial action that attempted to conceive ways in which non-Indigenous Australians can acknowledge, and take responsibility for, the denial of colonization\u2019s impact on Indigenous people. She will do so by discussing the critical methodology that underpinned this socially engaged artwork and continue by analysing the public reception and dissensus the campaign provoked. She will conclude in presenting some thoughts about what #MirandaMustGo produced: a rupture of the public secret of Australia\u2019s violent colonial past, a marked shift to the discourse concerning Hanging Rock and an ongoing, unresolved agitation stimulated by Picnic at Hanging Rock\u2019s persistent reproducibility.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64051532, "asset_id": 43740981, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2261399, "first_name": "Amy", "last_name": "Spiers", "domain_name": "rmit", "page_name": "AmySpiers", "display_name": "Amy Spiers", "profile_url": "https://rmit.academia.edu/AmySpiers?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2261399/2638225/39291949/s65_amy.spiers.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19197, "name": "Decolonialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonialization?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 103762, "name": "Settler/Indigenous relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Indigenous_relations?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 465890, "name": "Counter-Monuments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counter-Monuments?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 632564, "name": "Socially Engaged Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socially_Engaged_Art-1?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 770294, "name": "Picnic at Hanging Rock", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Picnic_at_Hanging_Rock?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 43372019, "title": "Contemporary Studies in Spirituality: the central ministry of Providence (The Rocks, Sydney) and St Margaret's Maternity Hospital (Darlinghurst, Sydney) in the writings of Margaret Press", "created_at": "2020-06-17T23:23:20.820-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43372019/Contemporary_Studies_in_Spirituality_the_central_ministry_of_Providence_The_Rocks_Sydney_and_St_Margarets_Maternity_Hospital_Darlinghurst_Sydney_in_the_writings_of_Margaret_Press?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_43372019", "summary": "This short essay will take interest in the work of two community groups, namely the Providence (The Rocks, Sydney) and St Margaret's Maternity Hospital (Darlinghurst, Sydney) and survey their work in an attempt to understand their purpose.

perspectives on artillery and firepower, presented by Australian and international experts and practitioners over four years during the Firepower: Lessons from the Great War seminar series, commemorating the Centenary of Anzac.\n\nFrom Anzac Cove to the Hindenburg Line, Clash of the Gods of War tells a gripping Australian story of the Great War through the lens of artillery \u2013 the

It analyses comparatively and systematically the universal constraints and global mechanisms on the one hand (see Zuckermann 2009), and local peculiarities on the other hand, apparent in revival attempts across various sociological backgrounds, all over the world (see Zuckermann & Walsh 2011). A branch of both linguistics and applied linguistics, it combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning (language reclamation is the most extreme case of Second Language Learning).\n\nThe study: The Barngarla language (spelled Parnkalla by Sch\u00fcrmann 1844) is a no-longer spoken Thura-Yura Pama-Nyungan Aboriginal language of the Lakes Cultural Region of South Australia. Most recently Zuckermann, Monaghan and the Barngarla community have launched a reclamation of this sleeping beauty in three major rural/urban centres on the Eyre Peninsula, namely Port Lincoln, Whyalla, and Port Augusta. The presence of three Barngarla populations several hours drive apart presents the revival linguist with a need for a sophisticated reclamation involving \u2018talknological\u2019 innovations, such as online chatting, newsgroups, photo and resource sharing through a Barngarla wiki. This paper also examines the tensions accompanying the creation of a Barngarla \u2018community of practice\u2019 (cf. Wenger 1998) in a post-traditional Aboriginal context. In important ways, the new talknology poses a direct challenge to existing authority structures relating to the everyday management of knowledge, collaboration and participation. We predict that how the broader Barngarla community negotiates these issues will have an important bearing on the ultimate results of the reclamation project.\n\n\n\n \nRevival Linguistics\n\nRevival Linguistics is a new branch of linguistics, currently being established at Adelaide. It analyses comparatively and systematically the universal constraints and global mechanisms on the one hand (see Zuckermann 2009), and local peculiarities and idiosyncrasies on the other hand, apparent in revival attempts across various sociological backgrounds, all over the world (Zuckermann & Walsh 2011). A branch of both linguistics and applied linguistics, it combines scientific studies of native language acquisition and foreign language learning (language reclamation is the most extreme case of Second Language Learning).\n\nRevival Linguistics complements the established field of documentary linguistics, which records endangered languages before they fall asleep. Revival Linguistics ought to revise the fields of grammaticography (writing grammars) and lexicography (writing dictionaries): Grammars and dictionaries ought to be written for language reclamation, i.e. in a user-friendly way, for communities, not only for linguists. For example, juxtapose Lutheran missionary Clamor Wilhelm Sch\u00fcrmann\u2019s 1844 spelling of the Barngarla word nunyara \u2018recovery\u2019, which ignores the English environment, thus resulting in the pronunciation nanYAra rather than NOONyara.\n\nClosely related to contact linguistics, Revival Linguistics changes the field of historical linguistics, e.g. by weakening the Family Tree model, which implies that a language ought to have only one parent. Assisting Aboriginal communities in a realistic, non-purisitic way, without selling them myths, Revival Linguistics promotes efficiency and efficacy in language reclamation.\n\nCertainly Australia has been made the \u2018Unlucky Country\u2019 through the historical processes of linguicide (language killing) and glottophagy (language eating). These twin forces were in operation from the early colonial period. In her detailed study of the role missionary language practices in the early years of the South Australian colony, Scrimgeour quotes the following colonial language ideology: \u2018Mr Forster afterwards adverted to the present mode of teaching the children in their own language. He, with all respect to the Missionaries, would say, on several grounds, that this was wrong. The natives would be sooner civilized if their language was extinct. The children taught would afterwards mix only with whites, where their own language would be of no use \u2013 the use of their language would preserve their prejudices and debasement, and their language was not sufficient to express the ideas of civilized life.  He gave the Missionaries full credit for their talents and zeal, but he thought it would be better to teach the children in English\u2019 (from Report on a public meeting of the South Australian Missionary Society in aid of the German Mission to the Aborigines, Southern Australian, 8 September 1843; Scrimgeour, 2007: 116, italics added).\n\nIn the case of glottophagy, Governor George Grey noted: \u2018The merchant in London who lays on a vessel for a certain port, regards the affair as a mere mercantile speculation, but could he trace out the results he effects in their remotest ramifications, he would stand astonished at the changes he produces.  With the wizard wand of commerce, he touches a lone and trackless forest, and at his bidding, cities arise, and the hum and dust of trade collect \u2013 away are swept ancient races; antique laws and customs moulder into oblivion.  The strong-holds of murder and superstition are cleansed, and the Gospel is preached amongst ignorant and savage men. The ruder languages disappear successively, and the tongue of England alone is heard around\u2019 (Grey 1841: 200-201, italics added). Grey was a strong supporter of Aboriginal languages, encouraging Sch\u00fcrmann\u2019s work documenting the Adelaide language (Kaurna) and Barngarla at Port Lincoln (see below).\n\nWith globalization, homogenization and Coca-colonization there will be more and more groups all over the world added to the forlorn club of the lost-heritage peoples. Language reclamation will become increasingly relevant as people seek to recover their cultural autonomy, empower their spiritual and intellectual sovereignty, and improve their wellbeing. There are various ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian benefits of language revival: for example, social justice, diversity and employability, respectively.\n\nZuckermann (2012) has enthusiastically called for Native Tongue Title and linguistic human rights, suggesting that the Australian government ought to compensate Indigenous people not only for the loss of land but equally importantly for the loss of language. Zuckermann has suggested to the Australian government to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages. \n\nFurthermore, it is predicted that in the future the very insights offered by Revival Linguistics will themselves become part of Indigenous Intellectual Property, when Slovenes and Estonians come to Australia and New Zealand to ask Aboriginal Australians and Maori to assist them in their own European language resurrection.\n\nThere is an urgent need to produce perspicacious LINGUISTIC and socio-linguistic insights relevant to language reclamation. Otherwise, linguists or language workers would not be able to offer, if asked by Indigenous people, efficient and efficacious advice. There are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would help revivalists and First Nations leaders to work more efficiently; for example, to focus more on basic vocabulary and verbal conjugations than on sounds and word order \u2013 see Zuckermann (2009: http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Hybridity_versus_Revivability.pdf. \n\nRevival linguistics would assist revivalists to be more realistic and to abandon discouraging slogans such as \"Give us authenticity or give us death!\" The following are among the basic principles that the revival linguist encourages in Aboriginal communities:\n\ni.\tIf your language falls asleep: stop, revive, survive!\nii.\tIf you revive a language, embrace the hybridity of the emerging tongue; and\niii.\tIf your language is healthy, assist others in linguistic need.\n\nOne day we may invent devices to \u201cinject\u201d a language into our brains. But until then, any attempt to reclaim a hibernating language will result in a hybrid that combines components from the revivalists' and documenters' mother tongues and, of course, the target language. In the immortal words of Jerry Seinfeld: \"Not that there's anything wrong with that!\"\n\nThe Study\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of Traditional Aboriginal Country after Norman Tindale (adapted from Hercus 1999)\n\nThe Barngarla language reclamation project has arisen through partnerships between the University of Adelaide (Linguistics and the Mobile Language Team) and the Barngarla people. Although still in its infancy, consultations began in September 2011, a number of very significant steps have been made towards reclaiming this \u2018sleeping beauty\u2019. Without doubt, the key challenge has been to develop a strategy for the reclamation of the language simultaneously and without favour in three major regional centres. In ways that will be elaborated below, this multi-sited, regional or peripheral reclamation makes demands that are very different to those often found in metropolitan reclamation contexts (e.g. Kaurna, cf. Amery 2000 and Amery 2012). \n\nAs implied above, for linguists, the first stage of any language revival must involve a long period of observation and careful listening while learning, mapping and characterizing the specific needs, desires and potentials of an indigenous or minority or culturally endangered community. Only then can one inspire and assist. Linguists are important but cannot provide what a united Aboriginal community can. That said, a crucial aspect of the Barngarla language reclamation project involves creating a virtual and actual community of practice (Wenger 1998).\n\nBrief historical background\nThe Barngarla people and their neighbours were brought into contact with the world economic system through the whalers and sealers operating in their waters from the early years of the nineteenth century; these contacts predating official colonization by a number of decades (Brock & Kartinyeri 1989; cf. Clarke 1998). Unlike some other areas of the state, the area surrounding the Port Lincoln colony was a site for violent conflict between Aboriginal people and colonists (Brock & Kartinyeri 1989). By the time Clamor Sch\u00fcrmann arrived there in 1840, Port Lincoln and surrounds were still violent places. Poonindie Mission, near Port Lincoln, operated between 1860-1890s. After the mission closed, Barngarla people lived under the Aborigines Act, 1911, which was introduced inter alia to control the lives of Aboriginal people of mixed blood. Many of the current elder generation of people are members of the \u2018Stolen Generation\u2019, children taken away by government agencies and put through a process of cultural re-education with the ultimate aim of assimilation. Having survived this \u2018civilizing process\u2019 consisting of separation from family, country, culture and language, these people have sought to re-establish their cultural roots and to reconnect with their ancestors. The traumatic effects are deeply remembered and shared by other family members who did not experience these ordeals first hand. In many ways, these experiences and shared memories motivate the younger generations to be involved in the reclamation and to get language going again in everyday contexts. \n\nJust before the reclamation began, there were no speakers of Barngarla at any level. Doyenne of Australian documentary linguists Luise Hercus recorded a very limited number of fragments in the 1960s. These recordings have been made available for the current project and for digital repatriation (underway). \n\nAll Barngarla people living in the towns described below speak a variety of Aboriginal English, sometimes called West Coast Talk, which includes words and phrases from a number of Aboriginal languages such as Pitjantjatjara, a strong Western Desert language spoken in Central Australia, north of Eyre Peninsula. Speakers of West Coast Talk do not usually know the particular language of origin of such distinctive words. Prima facie it appears that very few of the distinctive Aboriginal words have a Barngarla origin, indicating the long-past demise of the language. Another explanation is the migration from the 1950s of many Aboriginal families into these towns from the Far West Coast seeking employment. They brought with them the Nhangga Wanggarn, or West Coast Talk, from the Ceduna area, which consists principally of English with Wirangu and Gugada words and phrases added in. An obvious litmus test for our activities will be the increased appearance of Barngarla words in this everyday in-group language.\n\n\nFigure 2: Barngarla Workshop participants (including Barngarla leader elder Howard Richards and revival linguist Professor Ghil\u2018ad Zuckermann), Port Lincoln, South Australia, April 2012.\n\nIt is worth making a brief comment on the state of neighbouring languages and their relation to Barngarla. Nauo is treated in the historical records as separate to Barngarla (Hercus & Simpson 2001), although it is considered by current Barngarla to be part of the broader umbrella of the Barngarla peoples. Sch\u00fcrmann only recorded 10 Nauo words. Very little else is known to exist. It is most likely that it ceased to be spoken in the mid to late nineteenth century. Wirangu and Gugada (\u2018Kukata\u2019 in Figure 1) are both extremely endangered. Wirangu is related but Gugada is not (cf. Monaghan 2012). Nukunu is a related language but is known only in fragments (although Peter M\u00fclh\u00e4usler is conducting research with a possible last speaker, cf. Hercus 1992). Kuyani is a related language documented by Luise Hercus, although not as yet written up. Not named on Figure 1 is Adnyamathana, a related language that is still spoken, albeit endangered. A number of groups are active in revival and maintenance and working with a number of linguists.\n\nThe three main centres of Barngarla residence on the Eyre Peninsula are Port Lincoln, Whyalla, and Port Augusta. All three are important regional centres. Port Augusta (Aboriginal/general population: 2360/13987 = 16.8%)  is in many ways the crossroads of Australia. Whyalla, \u2018the steel city\u2019 where the outback meets the sea, has been dominated by mining and industry during its 100 year existence (Aboriginal/general population: 927/22539 = 4.1%). There is almost no Barngarla presence within the linguistic landscape of the town, and we were surprised to learn that the current Mayor does not know the proportion of the Aboriginal residents among the general population. Port Lincoln (Aboriginal/general population: 786/14087 = 5.5%)  has a reputation for boasting a high proportion of (non-Aboriginal) millionaires among its residents. Fishing and agriculture are the key industries.\n\nIt is difficult to determine precise figures for the proportion of Barngarla within the total Aboriginal population. In both Port Lincoln and Whyalla, we heard the term \u2018licorice all-sorts\u2019 to describe those residing in these towns but do not have a traditional connection (that is, they do not fall under the definition of Traditional Owner under the Aborignal Heritage Act, 1988, for example). Monaghan (co-author) has not heard this term further west in Ceduna. An estimate of the Port Lincoln Barngarla population was provided as numbering 120. Further research is needed to complete this picture.\n\n \n\nFigure 3: The authors (Monaghan left, Zuckermann centre) and Barngarla elder Ms Anita Taylor with the plans for Gabmididi Manoo (Barngarla for \u2018learning together\u2019) community and early learning centre (Barngarla Soil Turning Ceremony, Whyalla, March 2012)\n\nWhile the Kaurna revival in Adelaide is arguably the most high-profile reclamation activity in Australia, it is not likely to be typical of the majority of revivals moving forward. This rests less on the lack of comparable materials to Teichelmann & Sch\u00fcrmann (1840), for example, than it does on the diasporic character of contemporary Aboriginal family groups. Apart from the well-noted mobility of Aboriginal people (e.g. Birdsall 1988, Beckett 1988), there are other demographic trends, such as out-marrying that will increasingly place pressure on the coherence of Aboriginal societies (cf. Sutton 2009: 212, who provides the figure \u201871.5 per cent in 2006\u2019). From detailed empirical research at Ceduna,  we know that a White father was a major cause of household language shift to English. A number of respondents explained that the White father did not want to hear language in the home. The obvious question arising here is how the presence of a non-Aboriginal father, which is increasingly likely, will affect the linguistic reclamation and revival chances. On the face of it, metropolitan and regional/peripheral programmes may be equally affected by this trend. Multi-sited regional approaches will be encouraged by the way Aboriginal youths (particularly young men) are encouraged to travel to find spouses and to avoid \u2018incest\u2019 (which in Aboriginal societies is often more broadly defined, sometimes to second or third cousins). There are many anecdotal reports of the current mining boom being a period of increased Aboriginal mobility. \n\nA major implication of this mobility is the problem of traditional versus historical connection to country and hence language (a good discussion of how this operates in rural NSW can be found in Macdonald 1997). There is a very strong resistance in rural centres in South Australia for local schools to teach any Aboriginal language other than that of the traditional owners of the area. This leads to social conflict in a number of towns and most destructively often acts as a brake on language revival and maintenance activities. One local independent school in a rural town is happy to sit on the fence and wait until elders pass away and the problem disappears. Maybe, it was pointed out, the extremely endangered languages will go too.\n\nMuch of this conflict can be understood within the framework of extended-family politics (Sutton 2003). Asked how one would go about fashioning a language revival project with the \u2018families of polity\u2019, Sutton\u2019s reply was \u2018keep politics out of it. You\u2019ll politicize the languages\u2019 (pers. comm. July 2012). But arguably, in many cases the languages are already politicized and contested, particularly in the not-uncommon functional role as instrument for native title and our resource-rich fields (or at least they are perceived to be so). When the politics of identity and difference are involved, as they crucially often are, then we do well to heed the advice of that acute observer of social life, Zygmunt Bauman: when you hear the word identity \u2018you can be sure that there is a battle going on\u2019 (2004: 77) . Politics can be both a spur to action or a hindrance. \n\nSome groups who identify with a tribal label \u2013 usually one of those represented on an authoritative map (such as Tindale 1974 and Horton 1994) \u2013 are scattered to all points of the continent. We know of one case where families who identify with the label \u2018Tribe X\u2019 are found in Queensland (QLD), New Territories (NT), New South Wales (NSW), and South Australia (SA). These groups do not constitute a community and the separate families do not all recognize each other as families of \u2018Tribe X\u2019. If empirical research reveals an increasing trend in this direction, then language revival activities will only become more critical but also more difficult a multi-sited, regional approach might be the best or even option.\n\nBarngarla activities to date\nSince the first meeting between senior Barngarla representative and the authors in September 2011, numerous meetings have been held in Adelaide, Whyalla, Port Lincoln and Port Augusta. In May 2012, the first Barngarla Reclamation Workshop was held in Port Lincoln (25 attendees over 2 days, see Figure 2). Another workshop was held in Whyalla in July 2012 (13 attendees). Apart from these major events, work has progressed on changing to a much more user-friendly spelling system. Zuckermann has handled an increasing number of requests for culturally-appropriate names for new buildings or simply single or multiple word requests from teachers, former workshop participants and the general public (having watched or read Zuckermann in the media). Compilation of archival resource materials on all things Barngarla is ongoing. To this end Zuckermann has secured sponsorship for a travelling delegation of Barngarla language enthusiasts and potential language workers to the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS, Canberra, forthcoming). Work in ongoing to secure funding for a young Barngarla scholar to study linguistic at Adelaide and to become the first reclaimed Barngarla language expert.\n\nThroughout these activities we have learned from our Barngarla partners that the advantages of a language revival movement go far beyond the actual \u2018native speech\u2019 results. From the point of view of Aboriginal empowerment and wellbeing, it is clearly not the case that if, at the end (if any) of the Barngarla revival process there is no all-encompassing native-speaking community that converses in the revived language in all semantic domains, then it will automatically imply that the revival was a failure. The revival process is as important as the revival goals. After the first workshop we received a number of unsolicited communications from participants that expressed their excitement and joy at having pleased their ancestors and gaining a new aspiration. An elder expressed that \u2018we have watched other languages around us start to be revived, but we never thought it would happen to us\u2019. A Barngarla woman wrote (in an unsolicited email to Zuckermann): \u2018I found the experience of learning our language liberating and went home feeling very overwhelmed because we were finally going to learn our OWN language, it gave me a sense of identity\u2026 it gives you a purpose in life\u2019.\n\nOf course, the goals of a language revival movement can be very varied in the first place. For example, some communities might want only to change the \u2018linguistic landscape\u2019 of their town (like putting up Barngarla signs in Whyalla, which is very much on the agenda), others might want to have funerals and other rituals in language; others may want to go for the full monty. It is for the Aboriginal people to think these questions through; it is not for the linguist to pass normative value judgments and to set etic goals.\n\nMobile Language Team (MLT)\nThe MLT is a Federal Government funded project  that, at the time of writing, is coming to the end of its first triennial phase of operation. The University of Adelaide has recently secured another round of funding and is about to commence another three-year period of activity. One of the major objectives for the first triennium was to develop an audit of the vitality and status of 44 Aboriginal languages in the state and to assess the potential within communities for revival and maintenance activities. Many of these communities are rural, which implies that the Mobile Language Team ought to provide Flying Linguist services, somewhat comparable to the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia.\n\nAn important step in establishing our presence was to launch a website (www.mobilelanguageteam.com.au), which provides information to communities and scholars, and which will be developed further in the second triennium to incorporate a greater range of services, such as designated language wikis. More generally, our strategy will become more subtle. Rather than, like an old apiarist, waiting for the bees to come, we will take the honey-pot to the bees. One example will be retaining the news feature of this site, but we will send out teasers through Facebook with links back to our site. Many of our constituents who prefer mobile phone technology to computers will greatly benefit from this development. The MLT will seek to develop a presence on Youtube, Flickr and other social networking sites.\n\nBefore moving on to discuss new technologies more fully, it is useful to mention an MLT-Linguistics seeding project. In 2010 the MLT took on a German masters student, Ms Anne Quandt, as a volunteer. During this time she became acquainted with Sch\u00fcrmann\u2019s Barngarla dictionary and was co-supervised in her research (Quandt 2012). With this project we hoped to build a connection that would allow a new linguist to arrive and to connect with a waiting revival community. Currently Zuckermann is seeking funds for a PhD scholarship to continue this developmental strategy. \n          \nNew Talknology\nThe following sections report on work in progress: the novelty of the Barngarla reclamation and its particular challenges are yet to be fully appreciated. It is possible to report some interesting observations at this early stage, nevertheless. Much has changed since the anthropologist Eric Michaels was engaged by the peak Aboriginal research institute in the 1980s to undertake a three-year research programme into the interaction between traditional Aboriginal people and electronic media (Michaels 1985). As Hobson (2010: 309) points out, hardly a project is run these days that does not involve information and communication technology (ICT) in some form or another. Despite this ubiquity, however, there is often a problem with continuity \u2013 either once the project is complete from a reporting point of view or a newfangled gismo turns up and creates a linguistic stampede. Dyson & Brady (2010) also point to the problem of abrupt endings. Monaghan witnessed a stark example of technological dumping at the Solomon Islands National Museum in 2008 while running a programme to digitally repatriate material culture items and to record intangible cultural heritage connected to them to be stored with the objects in Sydney. During the Solomon Island \u2018Tensions\u2019 the museum was looted and the traditional currencies (such as shell money and red feather money) were taken. In the museum store their shelves laid empty while elsewhere in the complex piles of electronic equipment lay undisturbed. Much of this equipment had been donated by Japanese cultural heritage projects that had a short shelf life. The cultural heritage was safely encoded onto Beta and VHS and minidisk but was for all intents and purposes as remote as their objects held in foreign museums. The lesson here is that the respective value horizons of the local community and the outside organization need to meet in a meaningful way.\n\nRecently, Barngarla reclamation made it onto Facebook. Photographs and language materials were uploaded to the Facebook group \u2018Barngarla Peoples of South Australia\u2019: https://www.facebook.com/groups/115798078441945/.\nThere are approximately 60 registered members of this open group. The median age among Aboriginal people across the study sites range from 20 (Port Lincoln) to 24 (Port Augusta). We are certainly dealing with people more likely to engage with new technologies and new social media. We plan to develop a mobile phone dictionary application and to tap in to GPS-backed tourists who wish to experience Barngarla language and culture while travelling through, e.g. listening to Welcome to Country in Barngarla upon arrival to Barngarla country.\n\nThere are a number of other platforms that we are currently considering, such as NING: a popular platform that Monaghan trialled with Vanuatu Cultural Centre in 2008. Features include social integration, so that users can login using their Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn or Google accounts; blogs; forums; video and audio upload, and photo galleries. The major advantage is that it is an inexpensive and flexible option.\n\nCommunities of practice\nLinguists, like other office workers, often have a handy basket on their desks next to the in/out tray called the \u2018too hard basket\u2019 or it may rather more euphemistically be called \u2018community issues\u2019. It is for difficult matters that are best left for the \u2018community\u2019 to resolve. This is probably for some at least a matter of convenience. But for others there is an element of dread at the looming boundaries of (often descriptive-focused) linguistic knowledge and competencies, where angels fear to tread. Of course, this is slightly tongue in cheek \u2013 for the problem is far worse and particularly widespread in government bureaucracies. In the context of this paper, it is important to draw a distinction between such an imagined community and to focus on the community of engagement that can be created in a virtual environment and, where possible, through face-to-face interactions as well. \n\nAccording to Wenger (1998: 73), a community of practice has three main elements: (i) mutual engagement, (ii) joint enterprise, and (iii) shared repertoire.\n\n\nFigure 4: Dimensions of practice as the property of a community (Wenger 1998: 73)\n\nWenger\u2019s influential insight is that communities are made by doing \u2013 through practice. In the case of the Barngarla reclamation project a community of practice will be created through mutual engagement in the joint reclamation enterprise. During these processes a shared repertoire will develop. The repertoire includes: concepts, stories, artifacts, discourses (as listed in Figure 4). Of great significance for a virtual community is the fact that this experiential repertoire will potentially operate according to different norms to those operating in face-to-face contexts. An illustration by analogy here is the difference between the styles of emails and handwritten letters (if such things still exist) or face-to-face interactions. A rapidly growing body of literature is examining the evolving etiquette of social media mediated interactions.\n\nWhile mutual engagement can readily provide benefits through mutual recognition among participants as fellow participants \u2013 it is around these recognitive relationships that community coheres \u2013 there is a potential cost in the challenge these flows and exchanges pose to existing power and authority structures within the local Aboriginal knowledge economy.\n\nThe famous Ara Irititja project, a digital archive that services communities in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara-Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands in South Australia, has not only developed a platform for digital interaction but also a set of cultural protocols. This is in some ways a closed system and as such it is easier to manage information access and flows. The new media, by its very nature, provides far more opportunities for interaction and digital exchange (Christidis et. al. 2008). It is possible of course to set up a closed site, but arguably the full functionality of a wiki almost requires that it remains open, although closely moderated. Questions arise here about who gets to administer the site, its membership and its content. Key to answering this question is the nature of traditional and post-traditional knowledge economies. Michaels wrote that \u2018the Aboriginal societies I encounter in Australia provide no models for progressive global villages. To the contrary, a future modeled on their information management systems would more closely resemble a vast gerontocratic bureaucracy than a hippie commune writ large\u2019. Michael\u2019s prickly comments here are directed at Marshall McLuhan\u2019s (1962) utopian vision of the global village.\n\nIn closing, Michaels notes that it took 2000 years for the Christian Bible, through the technology of the printing press, to reach all corners of the globe. Television achieved the same feat in less that a generation. Facebook and other new media platforms are on track to achieve it in a fraction of that time. The big question is how tough, yet fragile, societies can cope with the challenges to their local knowledge and authority systems. Rather than a utopian global village, we need to focus on reclaiming and reviving languages and prevent the recently de-subjugated knowledges (Foucault) that they support from becoming re-subjugated.\n\n\nReferences\n\nAmery, Rob 2012.

"summary": "In 1932, the respected anthropologist Raymond Firth wrote that the Aboriginal Australian manifested a strange trait, one unlike their indigenous counterparts elsewhere in the colonised Pacific. The Indigenous person, Firth said, \u2018mutely dies.\u2019 It would take just two hundred years of settler-Indigenous contact\u2014and, within that span, a few intense decades of frontier activity\u2014to decimate the Indigenous people who had been in Australia for forty thousand years. If this population died at all \u2018mutely\u2019, then it may well have been in shock and trauma. Silence, after all, is a common response to extreme suffering. To invoke Cathy Caruth, this implores us to engage in \u2018a new mode of reading and listening [or viewing] that both the language of trauma, and the silence of its mute repetition of suffering, profoundly and imperatively demands\u2019. These relations between contemporary and historical silence\u2014as well as suffering and violence\u2014powerfully arise in Australian director Warwick Thornton\u2019s Samson and Delilah (2009), the focus of this chapter. Forgetting or denying Australia\u2019s foundational structure of colonisation generates silence around what happened in the nation\u2019s past. Samson and Delilah thus depicts trauma as a crisis of speech, a trope we can read as a reflection on representing Indigenous suffering in contemporary Australia. In analysing how the film depicts trauma in form and content, the chapter discusses silence, historical inheritances and belonging as central concerns of the film. These concerns draw all Australian subjects into positions of implication, although with incommensurate, unevenly distributed suffering between Indigenous and settler groups. Samson and Delilah is unflinching in its criticism of all implicated parties\u2014the web of social, cultural and political forces acting on the couple at its centre. This adds up to an uncommonly holistic appraisal of the trails of trauma in a setting where colonisation is entrenched and continuing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53752311, "asset_id":

Although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia compensation schemes for the victims of the Stolen Generation policies, the victims of \u2018linguicide\u2019 (language killing) are largely overlooked by the Australian Government. Existing grant schemes to support Aboriginal languages are inadequate, and they should be complemented with compensation schemes, which are based on a claim of right. The proposed compensation scheme for the loss of Aboriginal languages should support the effort to reclaim and revive the lost languages. We first outline the history of linguicide during colonisation in Australia. We then put a case for reviving lost Aboriginal languages by highlighting the benefits of language revival. After evaluating the limits of existing Australian law in supporting the language revival efforts, this paper proposes a statute-based ex gratia compensation scheme, which can be colloquially called \u2018Native Tongue Title\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34078315, "asset_id": 7511656, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3918,

moral panics over the presence of Chinese diggers on the Victorian goldfields and examine the commonalities between anti-Chinese sentiment and popular attitudes towards the local indigenous

It will consider both in terms of the politics of land usage in the colonial context and the function of associated assumptions about the supremacy of Anglo-Saxon culture and institutions. \n\nTo that end this paper will examine the development of fears of the Yellow Peril, especially in the aftermath of the Eureka Rebellion of 1854. It will consider the extent to which the repressive behaviour of the colonial administration further negative outcomes in the spread of popular racism. It will look at at how racism functioned then as an outlet or \u2018safety valve\u2019 for tensions produced by the colonial style of administration that were otherwise not permitted expression. \n\nUltimately then this paper will explore racism as a means of facilitating blame-shifting and avoiding accountability for institutional injustices stemming from colonialism more broadly. It will consider the meaning of \u2018whiteness\u2019 and the tendency to perceive the world through the prisms of class and the dominant ethnicity in these terms, and examine the extent to which such were the motivating force behind the development of the White Australia policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47091591, "asset_id": 26818721, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Australian federal government proclaimed that violence against women had become a national crisis. Despite widespread social and economic advances in the status of women since the 1970s, including growing awareness and action around gender violence, its prevalence remains alarming. A third of all women in Australia have been assaulted physically; a fifth of all women have been assaulted sexually. Intimate partner violence is significantly more prevalent in Australia than in Western Europe or North America. One woman each week is murdered by an intimate partner, and recent research suggests that nearly forty per cent of all women who suicide have a history of domestic or family violence. Domestic violence is a precipitating factor in a third of all homelessness. The resulting strain on government services and lost productivity means that family violence has been estimated as costing the Australian economy around $13.6 billion a year.

While Australia was able to perform no diplomatic activity in the pre-commonwealth period, Australian civilians brought a cultural transformation to the Confucian and Buddhist society of Korea from 1889 through non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

In thinking about the idea of renaissance, it is worth comparing Nadjamerrek\u2019s achievements to an artist who might be thought of as his Italian counterpart: Giotto di Bondone. Like Nadjamerrek, Giotto\u2019s work was steeped in tradition \u2013 in his case, the extraordinary aesthetic accomplishments of the Byzantine Empire. Yet, through their individuality, both artists helped spark an artistic revolution. Like Giotto, Bardayal Nadjamerrek can be seen as a pioneering artist who paved the way for the radical developments that would follow him. Kenneth Clarke once said of Giotto, \u201cOnce we have learnt Giotto\u2019s language, we can recognise him as one of the greatest masters of painted drama that has ever lived.\u201d The same could be

The accomplishment of the Lebanese team has also given the small country some exposure at the global level. Additionally, since 2002, a new sport has been established in Lebanon, making the country one of the few cases in the world where rugby league is more popular than rugby union. This paper examines diaspora issues including the assimilation of Lebanese emigrants into Australian sporting culture and strategic uses of citizenship. Furthermore, the research sheds light on the \u2018glocalized\u2019 development of rugby league in Lebanon by its establishment at private Lebanese universities while it is known in Australia for its working-class origins. There is a relationship of mutual dependence between diaspora and homeland: without its diaspora, Lebanon could not participate in the World Cup, and without domestic development in the sport (which includes, since 2015, also women\u2019s teams), the diaspora would not be permitted to participate in global championships.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58195105, "asset_id": 38161388, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18878114, "first_name": "Danyel", "last_name": "Reiche", "domain_name": "www1-georgetown", "page_name": "DanyelReiche", "display_name": "Danyel Reiche", "profile_url": "https://www1-georgetown.academia.edu/DanyelReiche?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18878114/5464066/57165805/s65_danyel.reiche.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4216, "name": "Sports History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6736, "name": "Lebanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lebanon?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 11378, "name": "Rugby", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rugby?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 11384, "name": "Rugby League", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rugby_League?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 49905, "name": "Sport", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sport?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 50456, "name": "Sports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 35964930, "title": "Socio-Religious Volunteerism: The Australian NGO Movement during the Korean War (1950-1953", "created_at": "2018-02-19T21:53:30.965-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35964930/Socio_Religious_Volunteerism_The_Australian_NGO_Movement_during_the_Korean_War_1950_1953?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35964930", "summary": "The Korean peninsula, like Taiwan (1895-1945), was one of Japan's colonies in the first half of the twentieth century (1910-1945). The end of World War II brought an opportunity to be independent, but the different ideologies of the Capitalist Bloc and the Soviet Bloc generated the Cold War. The Korean War (1950-1953) was the initial result of the political conflict. Australia did not have diplomatic relations with the unsteady nation until 1963, but the involvement of the Australian government cannot be disregarded. The Liberal government, led by Prime Minister Robert Menzies, immediately responded to the UN resolution (June 25, 1950) by offering military assistance. Was this military support the only aid for Korea? If not, how did Australia affect citizens of the war zone? Was there an Australian NGO movement? If so, what did these NGO's do? This paper not only explores the social activities of the group of Australian NGO's, but also argues that the religious volunteerism of humanitarian aid, medical work, religious mission, and education was a significant refugee project in Pusan (the temporary capital of the Republic of Korea during the Korean War) and Ky\u014fngnam province.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55847932, "asset_id": 35964930, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9634, "first_name": "David William", "last_name": "Kim", "domain_name": "regnet", "page_name": "DavidWilliamKim", "display_name": "David William Kim", "profile_url": "https://regnet.academia.edu/DavidWilliamKim?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9634/3298/37839446/s65_david_william.kim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3902, "name": "Korean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32699070, "title": "Catherine Smith of Bengal", "created_at": "2017-04-28T02:38:40.561-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32699070/Catherine_Smith_of_Bengal?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_32699070", "summary": "\"Catherine Smith was a convict woman born in Bengal and possibly of Anglo-Bengali ethnicity.

The focus here is on leaders and supporters of the Australian arm of the British and the Foreign Bible Society (BFBS)\u2014since renamed the Bible Society of Australia. The Bible Society\u2019s response to a period of \u201cunprecedented\u201d crisis\u2014marked by the First World War and the Spanish Influenza pandemic\u2014is illuminating for several reasons: in the first place, the Bible Society is Australia\u2019s oldest and largest nationwide parachurch organisation; additionally, during the period of the First World War it was the nation\u2019s most important ecumenical Protestant entity, and so it provides an unparalleled snapshot of religious organisation and activity across Protestant denominations. The society also possesses a rich vein of archival sources\u2014including extensive committee and branch minutes, ephemera, and periodical publications\u2014that remain untapped by Australian historians (until now, that is, as this lecturer is currently writing the first major scholarly history of the Bible Society of Australia). \n\nAs this article demonstrates, Bible Society leaders and supporters responded with a clear focus on their mission and raison d\u2019\u00eatre; with creativity that saw opportunities within crises; with sacrificial commitment and flexibility; and with a stubborn optimism underpinned by a theology of a transcendent kingdom governed by the providence of God\u2014all of which was pursued in the face of profound uncertainty and loss that touched almost every family in Australia.

During their sentence they worked as indentured labourers. Contemporary Australian cultural narrative says convicts wore clothing marked prominently to denote their prisoner status. However, research into archaeological artefacts from Hyde Park Barracks in Sydney has challenged this idea, and suggested more nuanced narratives about how convicted people negotiated fear and fashion in their government-issued clothing. \n\nSecond-offence convicts wore distinctive \u2018punishment suits\u2019, made from coarse woollen fabric that went over ordinary clothing, identifying the wearer as a convict. However, most wore everyday government-issued convict clothing, which attempted to create a uniform of penal identity. Surviving convict shirts are made from striped cotton fabric, and one does have a single black arrow stamped on it. But this arrow is discreet and marks the shirt, not the wearer. Further research into 225 scraps of convict shirts at the Barracks has shown that this convict \u2018uniform\u2019 actually fits into broader trends of British working men\u2019s dress. The informal practices convicts built up around supposed prison clothing undermine and complicate the established narratives of the fear, control and supposed uniformity of convict \u2018fashion\u2019 in New South Wales. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68202280, "asset_id": 50085553, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 707458, "first_name": "Hilary", "last_name": "Davidson", "domain_name": "fitnyc", "page_name": "HilaryDavidson", "display_name": "Hilary Davidson", "profile_url": "https://fitnyc.academia.edu/HilaryDavidson?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/707458/892789/26849418/s65_hilary.davidson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1437, "name": "History of Dress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Dress?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50088, "name": "Punishment and Prisons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punishment_and_Prisons?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 128448, "name": "History of Crime and Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Crime_and_Punishment?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 177724, "name": "History of clothing and fashion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_clothing_and_fashion?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 41505936, "title": "Japan in Australia, an Introduction", "created_at": "2020-01-03T23:11:34.919-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41505936/Japan_in_Australia_an_Introduction?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_41505936", "summary": "The introduction outlines the goal of examining the impact and influence of Japan on Australia\u2019s social, historical and cultural landscape.

the late nineteen century until the closing decades of the twentieth century, Greeks played a large part in Australia\u2019s food catering industry.

These included: agricultural and pastoral activities, mining, sea-related industries, itinerant work, secondary industries, public life, professional fields, and artistic and sporting avenues.

with Russel Ward\u2019s Australian Legend, in order to explore the relatively unexamined religious dimensions of the Australian national myth. Religious leaders could be surprisingly sympathetic toward Kelly, with the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, James Moorhouse, urging congregants to pray for the outlaws as they cowered in the bush on the run from the law. Kelly was an Irish Catholic, of course, but there are also interesting Methodist connections. His widowed mother Ellen married the Californian miner George King in the home of a  Primitive Methodist minister, a perhaps surprising thing for an Irish Catholic to do in a sectarian age that frowned on such \u2018mixed marriages\u2019. The Wesleyan Methodist preacher John Cowley Coles visited Kelly in the Melbourne Gaol in September and October 1880 while Kelly awaited execution. Kelly the penitent Catholic Christian knelt beside Coles the forthright Wesleyan preacher, together calling upon God to grant mercy to a fallen sinner. An examination of the response of religious leaders to the Kelly Outbreak as well as Kelly\u2019s own religious sentiments can inform and enlarge our understanding of one of Australia\u2019s most enduring cultural icons.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57074438, "asset_id": 37122787, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 439923, "first_name": "Glen", "last_name": "O'Brien", "domain_name": "divinity", "page_name": "GlenOBrien", "display_name": "Glen O'Brien", "profile_url": "https://divinity.academia.edu/GlenOBrien?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/439923/141030/18481984/s65_glen.o_brien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37995, "name": "Australian religious history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_religious_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 109283, "name": "John Wesley", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Wesley?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 257546, "name": "Methodist Church history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Methodist_Church_history?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 775853, "title": "The Dunbar: A melancholy obsession", "created_at": "2011-07-25T11:29:55.964-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/775853/The_Dunbar_A_melancholy_obsession?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_775853", "summary": "Every state in Australia has an iconic shipwreck - shipwrecks like the 'Loch Ard' in Victoria, the 'Admella' in South Australia and the 'Yongala' in Queensland - a shipwreck that has captured the imagination of the public and become engrained into the living consciousness of the state through the nature of the disaster, the loss of life and the wreck's social, cultural and economic impact on the state.

Bernie Muller, the Archives Liaison Officer, prepared the display, which was produced on a shoe string budget with simple photocopying of pictures and documents. I suggested that a display about the Scandinavian Lutherans at this Synod, held in Kingaroy, with forward promotion, would be interesting, just to see what material could turn up.

Architectural design was heavily influenced by modernism and focused particularly on the perceived needs of mothers and children, imagined to be ever-present in the home. Architects recommended modernising and centralising the kitchen so that the mother could efficiently complete chores while supervising her children. They advised designing children\u2019s bedrooms to provide privacy and stimulate creativity, as well as incorporating indoor and outdoor play areas. While these ideals were promoted in housing magazines, analysis of other sources reveals that the reality of 1950s housing was more complex. Many Australians lived in dwellings representing the design conventions of previous eras. For those building new houses in the 1950s, postwar shortages and personal finances often constrained aspirations. Others disliked the fact that modernism challenged traditional spatial and social precepts. Even for that minority residing in newly constructed, architecturally designed housing, families did not always inhabit domestic spaces in the manner anticipated by architects. Attention to a range of historical sources allows a fuller understanding of the broad spectrum of postwar housing and the diverse ways in which 1950s Australian families dwelt in their homes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53810489, "asset_id": 33827004, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14410109, "first_name": "Carla", "last_name": "Pascoe Leahy", "domain_name": "utas", "page_name": "CarlaPascoeLeahy", "display_name": "Carla Pascoe Leahy", "profile_url": "https://utas.academia.edu/CarlaPascoeLeahy?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14410109/11445609/12766390/s65_carla.pascoe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12643, "name": "Twentieth Century History and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twentieth_Century_History_and_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45408, "name": "History of architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_architecture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 391753, "name": "History of Motherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Motherhood?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 38014191, "title": "The Mrs Freer case revisited: Marriage, morality and the state in interwar Australia", "created_at": "2018-12-20T03:07:12.936-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38014191/The_Mrs_Freer_case_revisited_Marriage_morality_and_the_state_in_interwar_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_38014191", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60565474, "asset_id": 38014191, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2255189, "first_name": "Jeremy", "last_name": "Martens", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "JeremyMartens", "display_name": "Jeremy Martens", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/JeremyMartens?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2255189/3085946/19139675/s65_jeremy.martens.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 93550, "name": "White Australia Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/White_Australia_Policy?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 35668303, "title": "The stories behind Aboriginal star names now recognised by the world's astronomical body", "created_at": "2018-01-14T22:00:52.239-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35668303/The_stories_behind_Aboriginal_star_names_now_recognised_by_the_worlds_astronomical_body?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35668303", "summary": "Four stars in the night sky have been formally recognised by their Australian Aboriginal names.

With the assistance of a National Estate Grant, Melbourne's Living Museum of the West, carried out a study of the history of pastoral estates in Melbourne's Western Region during 1992-3, as part of a continuing program of documenting, researching and presenting the history, culture and environment of the region. \r\n\r\nThe study builds on earlier work in the area, including oral history interviews, documentary research and physical surveys, looking at the way of life of the people of the pastoral land west of Melbourne. Such studies include interviews with ex-tenants of the Werribee Park Estate, research into the history of the early squatting families, studies of rural landscapes, including bluestone buildings and dry stone walls, and a constant co-operations with members of the local historical societies in finding out more about the early settlers of the region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 28515860, "asset_id": 1950201, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1297651, "first_name": "Gary", "last_name": "Vines", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GaryVines", "display_name": "Gary Vines", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GaryVines?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1297651/480627/612612/s65_gary.vines.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25632, "name": "Pastoral landscapes (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pastoral_landscapes_Archaeology_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 32305, "name": "Pastoralism (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pastoralism_Archaeology_?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 41492276, "title": "Forum: Towards a decolonial history of Italian migration to Australia", "created_at": "2020-01-02T09:27:30.928-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41492276/Forum_Towards_a_decolonial_history_of_Italian_migration_to_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_41492276", "summary": "This special Forum explores some key aspects on Italian migrants\u2019 relationships with First Nations people in Australia, including their complicity in settler colonialism and their solidarity with Indigenous struggles. Taking into consideration the Australian context, this forum aims to instigate an intellectual dialogue around the need to decolonise Italian migration history worldwide. A decolonising approach requires not just the recognition that millions of Italians have migrated to settler colonial societies, but also a theoretical and methodological reflection on how migration history needs to be informed by Indigenous epistemologies. The forum is divided in six parts. After a methodological introduction by Francesco Ricatti, the artist Paola Balla reflects on her life and work as a Wemba-Wemba and Gunditjmara woman and artist, whose father and paternal family came to Australia from Calabria. Her contribution emphasises the need to relearn the history of settler colonial nations from the perspective of Indigenous women. Federica Verdina and John Kinder then explore from a linguistic perspective the anthropological discourse in the Italian language concerning Aboriginal people in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The next contribution, from Matteo Dutto, focuses on the visual and cinematic representation of the encounters between Indigenous and Italian migrants in Australia. Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli then reflects on the complex methodologies that are required when studying personal relationships between Italian migrants and Indigenous people. The forum is concluded by Joseph Pugliese\u2019s personal reflections on his scholarly and activist involvement in decolonial practices within the Australian context.

While the argument that a critical mass of people triggers the formation of new identities is compelling, a centralised, urban model of the generation of modern queer identities ignores an alternative theoretical model emphasising flow and connection between the 'centre' and the 'margins' that has emerged in writing about colonial and post-colonial cultures, but which has a wider applicability in understanding cultural change. In this paper, I argue that marginalised same-sex behaviours and relationships on the periphery of the empire or the nation are implicated in larger patterns of interconnectedness and reciprocity in the historical formation of modern sexual identities. Specifically, I use a family study to explore manifestations of same-sex attraction in early twentieth century Cooktown in Far North Queensland, Australia and the influence of these sexual role models on three subsequent generations. Inevitably, my exploration of the private lives of people who are not on the public record is speculative, but no more so than any biography. As Martha Vicinus has argued: 'Discontinuity and reticence do not mean silence or absence. Many lesbian histories, contradictory, complicated, and perhaps uncomfortable, can be told.' Here I use oral histories, letters and photographs, together with public records, to piece together a queer family history and place it in the broader context of the emergence of contemporary queer identities.

Through Filipino, Filipino-Australian, and Filipino-American experiences, the author explores the operation of whiteness, showing how a mixed-race identity becomes the means through which racialised privileges, authority and power are embodied in the Philippine context, and examines the ways in which colonial and imperial technologies of the past frame contemporary practices such as skin-bleaching, the use of different languages, discourses of bilateral relations, secularism, development, and the movement of Filipino, Australian and American bodies between and within nations. Drawing on key ideas expressed in critical race and whiteness studies, together with the theoretical concepts of somatechnics, biopolitics and governmentality, The Somatechnics of Whiteness and Race sheds light on the impact of colonial and imperial histories on contemporary international relations, and calls for a 'queering' or resignification of whiteness, which acknowledges permutations of whiteness fostered within national boundaries, as well as through various nation-state alliances and fractures. As such, it will appeal to scholars of cultural studies, sociology and politics with interests in whiteness, postcolonialism and race.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43482105, "asset_id":

Guided by the United Nations trusteeship system between 1945 and 1975, Australian colonial policy had been marked by the provision of developmental assistance in order to prepare the \u2018primitive\u2019 PNG for self-government. By the final decade of Australian colonial rule in PNG, increased international pressure combined with a rising indigenous voice to create a more urgent push towards independence. Whereas previously Australian experts and policymakers had dominated developmental policy in PNG, by the late 1960s, new institutions and strategies entered the fray. \n\nThe most prominent of these new ideas was the self-reliance movement, most commonly associated with Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere. This broad developmental approach rejected many of the assumptions of Western-centric \u2018modernisation\u2019 programs, instead encouraging a blend of traditional and modern practices. These ideas were most clearly represented in the 1973 Faber Report and inaugural PNG Prime Minister Michael Somare\u2019s \u2018Eight Point Plan\u2019. \n\nThis paper will examine the intellectual origins and political significance of the self-reliance approach in PNG. As PNG approached independence, the self-reliance movement gained momentum, driven by intensified contact between Tanzanian and PNG leaders. While international ideas of development had long exerted an influence on Australian aid to PNG, the rise of self-reliance marks a pivotal step in the history of PNG\u2019s development. Exploring the historical significance of the self-reliance approach reveals the transnational flow of developmental ideas and practices between Tanzania and PNG, thereby broadening the story of PNG\u2019s decolonisation.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53822853, "asset_id": 33840452, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4913807, "first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Ferns", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "NicholasFerns", "display_name": "Nicholas Ferns", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/NicholasFerns?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4913807/2117897/2487918/s65_nick.ferns.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5211, "name": "International History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8233, "name": "Transnational History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20606, "name": "Papua New Guinea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua_New_Guinea?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 23241, "name": "Tanzania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tanzania?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 43668645, "title": "The archaeology and history of the Sydney Sailors Home, The Rocks, Sydney", "created_at": "2020-07-20T03:59:53.064-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43668645/The_archaeology_and_history_of_the_Sydney_Sailors_Home_The_Rocks_Sydney?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_43668645", "summary": "The subject of this paper is the Sydney Sailors Home and how historical archaeological study of this site contributes to our knowledge of the lives of seamen in the 19th and 20th centuries.

It was created to work a rich uranium oxide, or yellow cake, deposit discovered in 1954. The town\u2019s curved streets, modern materials and progressive urban planning scheme contrasted strongly to the red soil, heat and dust of the surrounding countryside. The extensive company records remain untouched at the University of Melbourne Archives. This paper uses the example of Mary Kathleen to explore key themes in post-war Australian history while also considering the example set by prior uranium mining communities in Australia and overseas.\r\n\r\nThe design of Mary Kathleen represented a strong statement about transplanting a functional, suburban community into the bush (Iwicki & Jones, 2012). It many ways it was emblematic of post-war Australia with the rapid growth of suburbs, all achieved through a mix of public and private investment (Darian\u2013Smith, K and Willis, J 2007). Mary Kathleen however was a pioneer in terms of planning principles with Robert Freestone suggesting that it represented \u2018[t]he most decisive break with past traditions\u2019. (Freestone, 2010: 130)  Its large access roads ringing the settlement, its curved interior streets hugging the contours of the hills, and the provision of open parkland would not look out of place in contemporary growth corridor suburbs in Australian cities.\r\n\r\nA history of Mary Kathleen is also significant because it can shed light on our complex and changing international relationships in the 1950s and 60s. The US alliance was increasingly important from 1942, further reinforced by the ANZUS Treaty of 1951, yet Australian-British co-operation in specific areas was still vitally important. British power was on the wane in the Far East, but there were still plans to utilize Dominion or Commonwealth resources for the development and maintenance of British military power (Reynolds, 1998). Mary Kathleen played a little known though pivotal role in these wider geopolitical changes.

I argue that culinary historians and other commentators present the contemporary consumption of native foods as a means of rejecting the colonial attitudes of the past. In this narrative, early settlers lacked appreciation for Australian native foods and, by extension, Indigenous Australian culture and knowledge. Based on this depiction of colonial history, the current interest in native foods becomes symbolic of a wider revaluing of Australia\u2019s previously denigrated indigenous flora and fauna and Indigenous people. However, as I relate, some early European settlers and their descendants ate a wide variety of native Australian foods. These historical episodes challenge the conventional narrative of Australian culinary history and, in particular, the idea that contemporary consumption constitutes a novel break from past culinary practices. Moreover, as I demonstrate, settler interest in native foods was often consistent with the attitudes that justified and underwrote colonisation. By drawing attention to the role that native foods played in the colonial project, I complicate the idea that recognition of these foods is sufficient to address this history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30884229, "asset_id": 2513060, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 494869, "first_name": "Charlotte", "last_name": "Craw", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "CharlotteCraw", "display_name": "Charlotte Craw", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/CharlotteCraw?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/494869/169617/58747251/s65_charlotte.craw.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6850, "name": "Local food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_food?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6858, "name": "Food History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10469, "name": "Whiteness Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18535, "name": "Culinary History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culinary_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 75774005, "title": "Counter-monuments: Challenging distorted colonial histories through public art and memorials", "created_at": "2022-04-07T21:10:59.436-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75774005/Counter_monuments_Challenging_distorted_colonial_histories_through_public_art_and_memorials?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_75774005", "summary": "In March 2021, Genevieve Grieves and Amy Spiers co-convened the online symposium \"Counter-monuments: Indigenous settler relations in Australian contemporary art and memorial practices\" with hosting partner Australian Centre for Contemporary Art.

It also places his arrival in Western Australia into the broader setting of seventeenth-century Dutch exploration. Finally, it investigates the archaeological and historical context of the Hartog Inscription Plate, emphasising the nature of similar monuments left by European explorers in the Indian Ocean region and contemporary ship communication practices.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56504354, "asset_id": 11833341, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 712903, "first_name": "Wendy", "last_name": "van Duivenvoorde", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "WendyVanDuivenvoorde", "display_name": "Wendy van Duivenvoorde", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/WendyVanDuivenvoorde?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/712903/254737/7962015/s65_wendy.van_duivenvoorde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 131, "name": "European History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3834, "name": "Rock Art (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Art_Archaeology_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8724, "name": "17th-Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th-Century_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 26606, "name": "17th Century Dutch Republic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_Century_Dutch_Republic?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27393, "name": "17th century Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/17th_century_Europe?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 49917, "name": "Dutch History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 65822, "name": "Dutch East India Company", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dutch_East_India_Company?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 124175, "name": "Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 159686, "name": "16th and 17th century Dutch and Flemish Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/16th_and_17th_century_Dutch_and_Flemish_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 604313, "name": "Historical Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Biography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 654089, "name": "Early Modern Age of Exploration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_Age_of_Exploration?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3133422, "name": "Historical Biographies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Biographies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 9720655, "title": "Working for the Railways: Torres Strait Islander Labour and Mobility in the 1960s", "created_at": "2014-12-11T00:01:34.803-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9720655/Working_for_the_Railways_Torres_Strait_Islander_Labour_and_Mobility_in_the_1960s?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_9720655", "summary": "In 1995 Ann Curthoys and Clive Moore published \u201cWorking for the White People\u201d, a key essay on Indigenous labour historiography.

In our study of Indigenous labour and mobility we focus on the experiences of a particular Islander man, John Culear Kennell Snr, who worked as a labourer, team leader and recruiter of other Islanders in Queensland and Western Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35907750, "asset_id": 9720655, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1751650, "first_name": "Leah", "last_name": "Lui Chivizhe", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "LeahLuiChivizhe", "display_name": "Leah Lui Chivizhe", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/LeahLuiChivizhe?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1751650/601054/62794791/s65_leah.lui_chivizhe.jpeg"}, {"id": 1020989, "first_name": "Shino", "last_name": "Konishi", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "ShinoKonishi", "display_name": "Shino Konishi", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/ShinoKonishi?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48608, "name": "Australian Indigenous History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 3697167, "title": "Ceramics and Status in Regional Australia", "created_at": "2013-06-12T12:02:28.717-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3697167/Ceramics_and_Status_in_Regional_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_3697167", "summary": "Ceramics from Graham Connah\u2019s research at Lake Innes, New South Wales, are compared with ceramics from the site of Willoughby Bean\u2019s Parsonage, Gippsland, Victoria.

In the analysis of the first scenes of the film, the focus is on the notion of scenic and human beauty at once arresting and foreboding, and the various contrasting and parallel spaces that characterise the structure of both film and book. The presentation highlights the tension between old and new, spiritual and polytheistic, and a more monotheistic Christian culture. Through an analysis of main characters, the discussion will demonstrate how individuals can reflect a certain culture and cultural idiosyncrasies at large, where deep-going cultural differences seem to be not so much impossible to overcome, as not sought to eradicate - the outcome being that the British culture as it is represented in Weir's film does, against all odds, not dominate the colonised Victorian locality, the college and its residents, as have to surrender to the larger, less readily categorised culture of Aboriginal Australia. Reader and viewer undergo a learning experience and what seems to be real as well as safe notions to hang on to, do not necessarily constitute the only reality to believe in, nor are we necessarily who we think we are \u2013 \"what we see or what we seem are but a dream, a dream within a dream.\"  \n\nI am a research scholar, freelance translator and university tutor with a keen interest in Film, Cultural and Screen Studies and a doctoral degree in Screen and Media Culture, awarded from the University of Melbourne in 2015.

While the Aquarius Festival is recognised as a founding historical and countercultural event, the unique and important relationships established with Indigenous people at this time are generally less well known. This article investigates claims that the 1973 Aquarius Festival was \u201cthe first event in Australian history that sought permission for the use of the land from the Traditional Owners\u201d (Joseph and Hanley). The diverse international, national and local conditions that coalesced at the Aquarius Festival suggest a fertile environment was created for reconciliatory bonds to develop.

Cousteau's successful Antarctic campaign demonstrates the indelible impact celebrities can have on international environmental negotiations, and political developments more broadly.\n\nThe definitive version is available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajph.12108/full", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49869139, "asset_id": 29424522, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13636706, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Shortis", "domain_name": "yale", "page_name": "EmmaShortis", "display_name": "Emma Shortis", "profile_url": "https://yale.academia.edu/EmmaShortis?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13636706/3801238/19357193/s65_emma.shortis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1181, "name": "French History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5211, "name": "International History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8994, "name": "Social Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Activism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 57487, "name": "Antarctica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antarctica?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 78690, "name": "Celebrity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celebrity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 154245, "name": "Antarctic Treaty System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antarctic_Treaty_System?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 430314, "name": "Celebrity Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celebrity_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 691956, "name": "Antarctic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antarctic_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 12376216, "title": "ANZAC Day as Australia\u2019s \u2018Civil Religion\u2019?", "created_at": "2015-05-14T00:59:16.492-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12376216/ANZAC_Day_as_Australia_s_Civil_Religion_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_12376216", "summary": "St Mark\u2019s Review, No. 231 (April 2015),  23-39.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37942898, "asset_id": 12376216, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11468510, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Moses", "domain_name": "charlessturt", "page_name": "JohnMoses", "display_name": "John Moses", "profile_url": "https://charlessturt.academia.edu/JohnMoses?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11468510/9131207/10183511/s65_john.moses.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3987, "name": "History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Memory?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27131, "name": "Civil Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Religion?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114861, "name": "Anzac", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anzac?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 207319, "name": "Anzac, Centenary, Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anzac_Centenary_Education?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 256680, "name": "World War One and the Commonwealth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_One_and_the_Commonwealth?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 483286, "name": "World War One Memorials", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_One_Memorials?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 888754, "name": "Australia, war Anzac, belief", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia_war_Anzac_belief?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 888755, "name": "Anzac tradition, commemoration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anzac_tradition_commemoration?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 73279162, "title": "Hosty, K. and J.

Firstly, this is done by accounting for the laws introduced between 1869 and 1935, which made mass removal of children, The Stolen Generations, possible. The lead up to and granting of Native Title to the Aborigines is further accounted for, by examining the contents of the 1967 referendum and the outcome of the Mabo-cases in 1988 and 1992. By analysing the report made by Student Action for Aborigines after their freedom Ride describing the poor living conditions and blatant racism in rural New South Wales in 1965 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the shift away from the assimilation approach to Australian Aborigines during those ten years is then accounted for. Lastly, judicial, meta- sociological and socio-psychological approaches are discussed in relation to the Northern Territory National Emergency Response, in order to specify a viable way for Aborigines to gain more recognition in Australian society. It is concluded that although the first 180 years of Australian history are marked by racism and discrimination towards Aborigines, the last 50 years, with the exception of the NTNER, have shown great advancements in the socio-economic status of the Aborigines. It is argued, that to continue this trend, it is necessary for organisations, institutions and academics to incorporate Aboriginal agency in their programmes and theories, in order to improve access to e.g. health-care, justice and education. This will affect the general population and a new narrative will be formed, which recognises, preserves and utilises the Aboriginal culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42619759, "asset_id": 21882006, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37974033, "first_name": "Julius Gotthardt", "last_name": "M\u00f8ller", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JuliusGotthardtM\u00f8ller", "display_name": "Julius Gotthardt M\u00f8ller", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JuliusGotthardtM%C3%B8ller?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37974033/10640213/11877797/s65_julius_gotthardt.m_ller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 8621641, "title": "Belonging: Australians, Place and Aboriginal Ownership.

In this way, Hall extends the subversive legacy of surrealist exhibition and display with her imaginative and playful combination of juxtaposition and resemblance. Hall\u2019s appropriation and subversion of traditional museological order and display, from wunderkammen, natural history collections and modern museums, identifies the museum\u2019s role in shaping knowledge and invites the spectator to be critical of its consumption.

However, since 1990 Australian Prime Ministers and their governments have increasingly engaged with Anzac in a manner that has supplanted the traditional role of the Returned and Services League as custodians and drivers of Anzac. This has involved them consistently giving Anzac Day addresses during the last twenty-five years, both at home and at significant sites of Australian war remembrance overseas. But this has not always been the case. Prime Ministerial engagement with Anzac in the past was primarily as a participant, not as a custodian, and was more sporadic, more suburban, and less spectacular.\n The thesis explains this shift by tracing the increasing use of Anzac discourse by Australian Prime Ministers from 1972-2007. It will be argued that these Australian Prime Ministers have increasingly shown \u2018Anzac entrepreneurship\u2019 \u2013 successfully identifying the public\u2019s desire to engage with Anzac and facilitating Anzac\u2019s resurgence by employing the power resources of the state in order to amplify Anzac. Critical discourse analysis is adopted to analyse the integration of Anzac discourse into Prime Ministerial language. Such an approach points to the socially embedded nature of language, whilst simultaneously analysing the linguistic construction of this language.\n The thesis identifies that Prime Ministers have engaged with Anzac in order to both constitutively renovate Anzac as a central Australian identity and for instrumental policy ends. These twin developments have pertained especially to the processes of domestic economic reform in a globalising world and the deployment of Australian troops during the War on Terror. Such a study is important, as recent scholarly interest in Australian politicians\u2019 role in the resurgence of Anzac from political scientists and historians has not seen systematic investigation of Prime Ministerial Anzac Day addresses that analyses the evolution of these addresses over time or closely examines their language on a sustained basis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50874636, "asset_id": 30122227, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47623849, "first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Bromfield", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "NicholasBromfield", "display_name": "Nicholas Bromfield", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/NicholasBromfield?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47623849/15043985/15771285/s65_nicholas.bromfield.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 201, "name": "Political Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Sociology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10633, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 33566, "name": "Nationalism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 68967, "name": "Prime Ministership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prime_Ministership?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 73937, "name": "Political Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 93561, "name": "ANZAC Day", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ANZAC_Day?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 114861, "name": "Anzac", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anzac?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 182179, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis_CDA_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 979949, "name": "Prime Ministers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prime_Ministers?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1762628, "name": "Australian Prime Ministers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Prime_Ministers?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 12970794, "title": "Privilege to Serve: A History of Christian Women's Fellowship in Victorian and Tasmanian Churches of Christ", "created_at": "2015-06-14T00:13:31.720-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12970794/Privilege_to_Serve_A_History_of_Christian_Womens_Fellowship_in_Victorian_and_Tasmanian_Churches_of_Christ?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_12970794", "summary": "Preview available for download.

Groups of political cultural radicals were fashioned by the struggles of this era, ranging from the Vietnam War and racial oppression in America to debates over civil liberties and university reform in Brisbane itself. In reaction to these issues, global examples of similar activism and the realities of a state less than accommodating, if not violently opposed to, their demands, activists sought to establish a subterranean network of locations and spaces around the city from which to challenge political and cultural conservatism while living out differential lifestyles. These spaces witnessed the disintegration of political activism into cultural activity, creating a variety of operations which sought to unite a dispirit community of countercultural drop-outs with radicals of a more polemical bent. Foco Club, a combination of rock music, poetry, films, books and political discussion held on a Sunday night in Trades Hall was the first large scale attempt of this nature, drawing thousands of youths to its membership roles as well as representatives of conservative authority seeking its closure. Foco\u2019s example provided inspiration to further venues and \u2018counterinstitutions\u2019, from the Red and Black Bookshop to HARPO, all of which worked to solidify a radical \u2018map of meaning\u2019 to Brisbane protestors. Finally, 4ZZZ-FM can be seen as a consolidation of these traditions into an institution capable of reaching a \u2018mass minority audience\u2019, while its appropriation\nof a legal medium to led to a significant degree of internecine conflict. These spaces were not only vital to the existence of Brisbane\u2019s successful activist subculture, but also give hints as to what a truly urban radical practice would look like today.

frontier of nineteenth-and twentieth-century Australia was a place in which colonists routinely lived in fear of retaliation by the Aboriginal peoples whose traditional lands they had forcibly dispossessed. It has been suggested this concern manifested itself in domestic architecture, in both active and passive defensive strategies designed to afford protection against various forms of potential attack. Yet there remains a lack of substantive research to support such assertions. In this article, we present an analysis of accounts drawn from a range of sources of 97 domestic structures across Queensland with claims for defensive features. Although suggesting that fortified domestic structures were more common than previously envisaged, our review indicates that defensive features were usually minimal-holes in walls and barrable doors, windows or other ports of entry-reflecting the often expedient nature of the structures themselves. First-hand accounts of these buildings are rare, although not entirely absent, with most written accounts being reminiscences told in hindsight by later descendants, resulting in both distortions and myth-building. Accounts of fortified domestic structures peak in the decades following Federation and through both World Wars as the newly minted Australian nation explicitly engaged in nation-building and constructing the 'glorious pioneer' narrative.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67447378, "asset_id": 49057105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12107330, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "kerkhove", "domain_name": "usq", "page_name": "raykerkhove", "display_name": "ray kerkhove", "profile_url": "https://usq.academia.edu/raykerkhove?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12107330/3473744/68319068/s65_ray.kerkhove.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5439, "name": "Australian Indigenous Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35203, "name": "Colonial Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Architecture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 54201, "name": "Australian architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_architecture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 54723, "name": "Fortifications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fortifications?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 59470, "name": "Borders and Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Frontiers?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 147877, "name": "Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 848565, "name": "Comparative Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Frontiers?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 984661, "name": "Pioneers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pioneers?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1450812, "name": "Australian Frontier Wars", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Frontier_Wars?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 41948189, "title": "Jennie Scott Griffiths: How a conservative Texan became a radical socialist and feminist in World War I Australia", "created_at": "2020-02-11T21:19:48.707-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41948189/Jennie_Scott_Griffiths_How_a_conservative_Texan_became_a_radical_socialist_and_feminist_in_World_War_I_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_41948189", "summary": "This article explores the influences that changed a woman born into a socially conservative evangelical section of American society who spent more than a decade as a member of a small European community in Fiji to a vehement anti-war socialist and feminist in World War I Australia. Jennie Scott Griffiths arrived in Australia from Fiji in 1912 with nine children and a wealth of journalistic experience that led to her appointment as editor of the Sydney-based Australian Woman's Weekly. In Australia, she was thrown into a maelstrom of ideas that articulated many of her previously held but unexpressed views. She was empowered by this ferment of feminist ideas among activist women in Australia to become a well-known fighter against war and conscription in World War I Australia and as a 'red-ragger' who gave impassioned support to those imprisoned for their beliefs. Her flamboyant, unsparing support for causes she embraced, led to the loss of her hard-won editor's job and to surveillance by the Government secret intelligence organisation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62158324, "asset_id": 41948189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1010308, "first_name": "Patricia", "last_name": "Clarke", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PatriciaClarke", "display_name": "Patricia Clarke", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PatriciaClarke?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1010308/3420507/14147622/s65_patricia.clarke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1138, "name": "Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19064, "name": "Women Writers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_Writers?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23336, "name": "Fiji", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fiji?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 112901, "name": "Female Journalists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Female_Journalists?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2738617, "name": "Anti-conscription movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-conscription_movement?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 14813859, "title": "Exclusion and a call for justice: The Lambing Flat banner", "created_at": "2015-08-10T01:08:33.581-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14813859/Exclusion_and_a_call_for_justice_The_Lambing_Flat_banner?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_14813859", "summary": "The Lambing Flat riots were a series of violent riots led by European miners against Chinese miners from 1860 to 1861 on the Burrangong goldfields in NSW. They led to anti-Chinese immigration legislation in NSW and the White Australia policy enacted after Federation in 1901. During the riots, the European miners carried this banner, now owned and exhibited by the Lambing Flat Folk Museum in Young, NSW. Once able to proudly lay claim to \u201cThe Birth of White Australia\u201d, this local museum and country town have struggled to understand themselves and their past as part of a modern multicultural nation. Increasing interactions with Chinese Australians who also want to be acknowledged as having a major role in the formation of the Australian nation complicate the banner's meaning for the museum and the town.\r\n\r\nUsing a combination of object biography (Kopytoff 1986) and assemblage theory (Latour 2005) to trace the life story of the banner, this paper will explore the ways in which the Lambing Flat Folk Museum and the town of Young have dealt with their \u201cdifficult heritage\u201d (Macdonald 2009). How do we understand and discuss the historical and contemporary exclusion of particular groups of people in a multicultural society when the primary mode of representation in museums and in commemorations is about inclusion?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38431014, "asset_id": 14813859, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2020417, "first_name": "Karen", "last_name": "Schamberger", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "KarenSchamberger", "display_name": "Karen Schamberger", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/KarenSchamberger?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2020417/666727/827606/s65_karen.schamberger.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16887, "name": "Museums and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums_and_Identity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 45176, "name": "Dissonant Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dissonant_Heritage?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 74237, "name": "Cultural Heritage and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_and_Tourism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 113375, "name": "Biography of Objects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography_of_Objects?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 159080, "name": "Australian cultural history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_cultural_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 253574, "name": "Chinese-Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese-Australian_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 445151, "name": "Difficult heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Difficult_heritage?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1311575, "name": "Young NSW", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_NSW?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 12568486, "title": "McGrath, A.  \u201cShamrock Aborigines: the Irish, the Aboriginal Australians, and their Children\u201d.

Inspirited refers to the spirit of a site that may be enlivened by invoking the memories and histories that lay embedded in its layers, allowing visitors to reconsider their own agency in relation to the active materiality of their surrounds. \n\nThrough a combination of creative arts practices, the PhD maps the creation of two site-specific projects to create what Jill Bennett would call \u2018affective encounters\u2019 to demonstrate how historical affect and cultural memory flow through bodies, singular subjects and the places that are made transactive by the newly activated relationships. The research project also addresses particular acts of attention that invite visitors to look outwards rather than inwards: from the body to the site and from the site to the culture, context and history. The research positions site-specific art practice as a form of material philosophy concerned with what could be perceived as a revitalisation of the social sacred. In particular, the \u2018sanctification\u2019 of social life that consists of a revaluing of the importance of \u2018live and emplaced\u2019 intra-action and a reading/perceiving/feeling the \u2018affects\u2019 of community as deeply integral to the human subject.\n\n The larger question of the creative research is interrogating how I make a bridge as an artist to the culture \u2013 and as the person to the pre-individual field of affects that have been mapped on each site. How we can/can we begin to learn to \u2018walk softly\u2019 and listen to what we walk upon? \n\nThe creative practice has been developed through two creative works developed on two sites that share a reflective history and affective experience. The first work created and installed in 2014, was Anthology, a journey through Stirling Park in the ACT produced in collaboration with local artists to resurface the layers of history and story in the Westlake site. The major submission and contribution to new knowledge was TIDE, a site-specific work that addressed the way in which Australian cultural memory is circulated and repressed though affective understandings of location. The site for TIDE, (Royal Park, Melbourne) was mapped as an affective field in which its historical points of connection were activated and distilled through installation. \n\nThe conceptual and processual terrains of this creative practice will be explored and developed in detail in this exegesis, in relation to the key theorists and practitioners who address ways to position processes of research, practices and social engagement through material aspects of site and specific modes of post-traumatic engagement in art, theatre, performance and philosophy.\n\nThis project aims to produce new knowledge concerned with the ways in which historical narratives, individual or psychological affects in a particular place cannot be separated from a pre-individual field of affects. If the affective field is viewed as a net of connections, when we create trauma in one section of the net it will impact upon the whole. The PhD deploys modes of creative engagement designed to draw attention to the way affects imprint upon the social/cultural space in a given site. The project builds upon my previous research on trauma\u2019s mark on the body, and contributions to an understanding of how trauma also marks the land. In this way, my creative practice attempts to demonstrate how two specific parklands (where a community continues to fight to protect an apparent terra nullius from development) reflect Australian cultural memory, a shared and remembered history, but are deeply revealing of the lived reality of what we think we know, and our amnesia: what is forgotten, ignored or silenced. \n\nMy central claim is that the Australian landscape is inspirited with all that has been, and replete with beings and becomings. In this project, I demonstrate how site-specific creative practice can open our awareness and provide modes of engagement and potentially, modes of access, to the irrepressible land and the materiality of history. The aim is to retune our perception of the agency and liveliness of all matter. Creative action in situ can begin to foster deeper connections between the sacred and the social as we share knowledges about each other and place, and in doing so, reawaken the sacred in relation to the deep ecological mesh, the human-non-human community to which we all belong. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56965501, "asset_id": 37015737, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14145131, "first_name": "Louise", "last_name": "Morris", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "LouiseMorris", "display_name": "Louise Morris", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/LouiseMorris?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14145131/3888387/19823336/s65_louise.morris.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2080, "name": "Installation Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Installation_Art?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3470, "name": "Community Engagement & Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Engagement_and_Participation?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3815, "name": "Spirituality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16320, "name": "Site-Specific Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Site-Specific_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 30535, "name": "Site-Specific Art and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Site-Specific_Art_and_Performance?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 39494, "name": "Cultural Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Trauma?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 76626, "name": "New Materialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Materialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 332529, "name": "Sacred Sites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sacred_Sites?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 632564, "name": "Socially Engaged Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socially_Engaged_Art-1?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 678755, "name": "Site Specific Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Site_Specific_Performance?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 18851557, "title": "Echoes from the past: Oral history in the National Museum of Australia", "created_at": "2015-11-23T03:09:12.860-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/18851557/Echoes_from_the_past_Oral_history_in_the_National_Museum_of_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_18851557", "summary": "When the National Museum of Australia\u2019s opened in 2001 it was severely criticised by right-wing politicians, historians and journalists for being too negative and \u2018too politically correct\u2019, especially in its depiction of Aboriginal history.

It contributes nothing to an understanding of the multidimensional past and present of Kimberley heritage, which continues to fascinate so many people in Australia and beyond. To the contrary, it reiterates viewpoints and convictions that had been put forward and refuted decades ago. As a historical novel, it is largely a failure. The author seemingly had no intention to accurately reflect and comment on the complex history he uses as inspiration for his book. Rather he seems to aspire to be a player himself, by creating an elaborate statement of admiration for Grahame Walsh, his work and convictions. Yet the selective combination of fictitious and factual elements make this book a politically problematic and outdated statement on this subject. This book will only be appreciated by those who prefer a simplistic and sanitised version of Australia's past, and who refuse to accept the difficult historical challenge of the process of reconciliation with Indigenous Australians.\n\nhttp://www.decolonisinghumanorigins.com/2017/01/myths-that-refuse-to-die.html", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51387482, "asset_id": 30956260, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 644307, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Porr", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "MartinPorr", "display_name": "Martin  Porr", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/MartinPorr?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/644307/357067/18503540/s65_martin.porr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3834, "name": "Rock Art (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Art_Archaeology_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5439, "name": "Australian Indigenous Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 12567556, "title": "Melbourne Street Art and Graffiti (The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti)", "created_at": "2015-05-24T17:00:43.954-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12567556/Melbourne_Street_Art_and_Graffiti_The_World_Atlas_of_Street_Art_and_Graffiti_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_12567556", "summary": "The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti is the definitive survey of international street art, focusing on the world\u2019s most influential urban artists and artworks.

Any scattered Aboriginal survivors endured the politics of suffering, of introduced diseases, of stolen children, of forced detention, of harassment, of sexual predation, of alienation and mental despair. \nThe Palawa were one of the first, but they would not be the last to see the targeted destruction of their society and culture, the songlines  and traditions, as the process of Lemkinian genocide spread across the continent over the 19th century in the longest war in our history, a \u2018civil\u2019 war of oppression and dispossession that the Australian War Memorial defiantly refuses to acknowledge.   For this reason, we will use Britain\u2019s destruction of the Tasmanian Palawa as a type instantiation of violent Aboriginal dispossession across Australia.\nWe still see the lingering evidence of this genocidal process today, with excessive rates of illness and incarceration, systemic early deaths, continuing racism and third world conditions for many of our First People.\nVolume 2, Context focuses directly on the British Imperium as the agency for intentional Tasmanian genocide and develops the semantic landscape through which we address revisionist counter-arguments against genocide.

It affected the home front and the troops fighting on the front line and was characterised by widespread fears, accusations and rumours concerning an array of individuals and groups that reveal much about existing prejudices in Australian society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38304801, "asset_id": 14431015, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 511259, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Loeffel", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "RobertLoeffel", "display_name": "Robert Loeffel", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/RobertLoeffel?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/511259/178025/63832184/s65_robert.loeffel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5523, "name": "Security Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5531, "name": "Antisemitism (Prejudice)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antisemitism_Prejudice_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12739, "name": "Second World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32727, "name": "World War and Comparative Home Fronts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_and_Comparative_Home_Fronts?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41661, "name": "World War II Pacific Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_II_Pacific_Theatre?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 204916, "name": "Stereotyping, Prejudice, and Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stereotyping_Prejudice_and_Discrimination?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 488213, "name": "Rumours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rumours?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 606199, "name": "Sabotage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sabotage?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1732028, "name": "Fifth Column", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fifth_Column?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 3391238, "title": "The measure of the woman: eugenics and domestic science in the 1924 sociological survey of white women in North Queensland", "created_at": "2013-04-26T00:22:04.567-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3391238/The_measure_of_the_woman_eugenics_and_domestic_science_in_the_1924_sociological_survey_of_white_women_in_North_Queensland?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_3391238", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31183041, "asset_id": 3391238, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3947265, "first_name": "Gillian", "last_name": "Colclough", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GColclough", "display_name": "Gillian  Colclough", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GColclough?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3947265/1478286/5011713/s65_gillian.colclough.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14993, "name": "Home Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Economics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2034650, "title": "The Rise of the Therapeutic Society: Psychological Knowledge & the Contradictions of Cultural Change", "created_at": "2012-10-16T10:57:46.033-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2034650/The_Rise_of_the_Therapeutic_Society_Psychological_Knowledge_and_the_Contradictions_of_Cultural_Change?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_2034650", "summary": "This book is an examination of our fascination with psychological life and the historical developments that fostered it. Taking Australia as the focal point, Katie Wright traces the ascendancy of therapeutic culture, from nineteenth century concerns about nervousness, to the growth of psychology, the diffusion of an analytic attitude, and the spread of therapy and counselling. Wright's analysis, which draws on social theory, cultural history, and interviews with therapists and people in therapy, calls into question the pessimism that pervades many accounts of the therapeutic turn and provides an alternative assessment of its ramifications for social, political, and personal life in the globalized West. \r\n\r\n\"Wright's work provides an all important antidote to a long series of off-base polemics that misunderstand the role of psychotherapy in contemporary society. Wright's work provides a sharp and welcome contrast. She finds the language of therapy at the heart of the new social movements.\" -Jeffrey C. Alexander, Lillian Chavenson Saden Professor of Sociology, Yale University \r\n\r\n\"The strength of Wright's work lies in its emphasis on the complex, contradictory ways in which various aspects of our global worlds enter into the inner, emotional texture of identity as well as the processes through which the unconscious imagination constitutes fabrications of the social-historical world.\" -Anthony Elliott, Chair of Sociology, Flinders University, Australia. \r\n\r\n\"This work makes an important contribution to cultural and historical sociology. Wright argues convincingly for a reappraisal of therapeutic culture through a compelling critique of existing theory and by drawing on alternative traditions to those that have dominated scholarship in this field. The case studies she presents are intrinsically interesting and theoretically important, and her innovative perspective on the therapeutic society will make a valuable and significant contribution to the field.\" -Zlatko Skrbis, Dean, UQ Graduate School, The University of Queensland, Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35312251, "asset_id": 2034650, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2653533, "first_name": "Katie", "last_name": "Wright", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "KatieWright", "display_name": "Katie Wright", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/KatieWright?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2653533/849317/19128234/s65_katie.wright.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 948, "name": "Historical Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Sociology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 957, "name": "Cultural Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Sociology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3279, "name": "Psychotherapy and Counseling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychotherapy_and_Counseling?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 4995, "name": "History of Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15677, "name": "History Of Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Psychology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 214965, "name": "Therapy culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Therapy_culture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 216666, "name": "Therapeutic culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Therapeutic_culture?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 24913507, "title": "AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF 6-8 PITT STREET, WINDSOR", "created_at": "2016-05-01T00:22:38.144-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24913507/AN_ARCHAEOLOGICAL_ASSESSMENT_OF_6_8_PITT_STREET_WINDSOR?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_24913507", "summary": "This is an edited version on an Archaeological Assessment of 6-8 Pitt Street, Windsor,.

Mill defended colonization throughout his life, although his arguments about its character and justification shifted over time.

Finally recognizing the prevalence of colonial violence and the difficulty of realizing his grand ambitions, yet refusing to give up on colonization altogether, his colonial romance gave way to a form of melancholia.

In advance of official settlements in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, entrepreneurs mapped coastlines, pioneered trade routes and colonised lands.

health is one of the most pressing issues confronting contemporary Australian society. In recent years government officials, medical practitioners, and media commentators have repeatedly drawn attention to the vast discrepancies in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. However a comprehensive discussion of Aboriginal health is often hampered by a lack of historical analysis. Accordingly this thesis is a historical response to the current Aboriginal health crisis and examines the impact of colonisation on Aboriginal bodies in Queensland during the early to mid twentieth century. \r\n\r\nDrawing upon a wide range of archival sources, including government correspondence, medical records, personal diaries and letters, maps and photographs, I examine how the exclusion of Aboriginal people from white society contributed to the creation of racially segregated medical institutions. I examine four such government-run institutions, which catered for Aboriginal health and disease during the period 1900-1970. The four institutions I examine \u2013 Barambah Aboriginal Settlement, Peel Island Lazaret, Fantome Island lock hospital and Fantome Island leprosarium \u2013 constituted the essence of the Queensland Government\u2019s Aboriginal health policies throughout this time period.\r\n\r\nThe Queensland Government\u2019s health policies and procedures signified more than a benevolent interest in Aboriginal health, and were linked with Aboriginal (racial) management strategies. Popular perceptions of Aborigines as immoral and diseased directly affected the nature and focus of government health services to Aboriginal people. In particular the Chief Protector of Aboriginals Office\u2019s uneven allocation of resources to medical segregation facilities and disease controls, at the expense of other more pressing health issues, specifically nutrition, sanitation, and maternal and child health, materially contributed to Aboriginal ill health.\r\n\r\nThis thesis explores the purpose and rationales, which informed the provision of health services to Aboriginal people. The Queensland Government officials responsible for Aboriginal health, unlike the medical authorities involved in the management of white health, did not labour under the task of ensuring the liberty of their subjects but rather were empowered to employ coercive technologies long since abandoned in the wider medical culture. This particularly evident in the Queensland Government\u2019s unwillingness to relinquish or lessen its control over diseased Aboriginal bodies and the continuation of its Aboriginal-only medical isolation facilities in the second half of the twentieth century. At a time when medical professionals and government officials throughout Australia were almost universally renouncing institutional medical solutions in favour of more community-based approaches to ill health and diseases, the Queensland Government was pushing for the creation of new, and the continuation of existing, medical segregation facilities for Aboriginal patients.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Queensland the management of health involved inherently spatialised and racialised practices. However spaces of Aboriginal segregation did not arise out of an uncomplicated or consistent rationale of racial segregation. Rather the micro-histories of Fantome Island leprosarium, Peel Island Lazaret, Fantome Island lock hospital and Barambah Aboriginal Settlement demonstrate that competing logics of disease quarantine, reform, punishment and race management all influenced the ways in which the Government chose to categorise, situate and manage Aboriginal people (their bodies, health and diseases). Evidence that the enterprise of public health was, and still is, closely aligned with the governance of populations.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30183299, "asset_id": 2072928, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2387483, "first_name": "Meg", "last_name": "Parsons", "domain_name": "auckland", "page_name": "MegParsons", "display_name": "Meg Parsons", "profile_url": "https://auckland.academia.edu/MegParsons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2387483/871139/39784081/s65_meg.parsons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15482, "name": "Structuralism/Post-Structuralism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Structuralism_Post-Structuralism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 25175, "name": "Social History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History_of_Medicine?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 63487605, "title": "The History of Children in Australia: An Interdisciplinary Historiography", "created_at": "2021-12-07T15:51:22.403-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63487605/The_History_of_Children_in_Australia_An_Interdisciplinary_Historiography?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_63487605", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75902839, "asset_id": 63487605, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14410109, "first_name": "Carla", "last_name": "Pascoe Leahy", "domain_name": "utas", "page_name": "CarlaPascoeLeahy", "display_name": "Carla Pascoe Leahy", "profile_url": "https://utas.academia.edu/CarlaPascoeLeahy?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14410109/11445609/12766390/s65_carla.pascoe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 257992, "name": "Historical Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 19259794, "title": "Philippine-Australian Interactions: The Late Nineteenth Century", "created_at": "2015-11-30T16:53:25.001-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19259794/Philippine_Australian_Interactions_The_Late_Nineteenth_Century?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_19259794", "summary": "Chapter 2 of Discovering Australasia: Essays on Philippine-Australian Interactions, edited by Reynaldo C.

These traditions could lead to the discovery of meteorites and impact sites previously unknown to Western science. In addition to benefiting the scientific study of meteoritics, this study can help social scientists better understand the nature and longevity of oral traditions and further support the growing body of evidence that oral traditions contain historical accounts of natural events. In a previous study led by the author in 2009, no meteorite-related oral traditions were identified that led to the discovery of meteorites and/or impact craters.

It aims to understand the interaction of missions with native culture and the resulting hybrid culture created on the missions. It describes the differing points of view of missionaries and the generations who grew up on the missions. It is argued that the culture created on the missions by the joint efforts of missionaries and local peoples was by and large a positive phase in Australian black history, between the violence of pre-contact times and the dysfunctionality of recent decades. Criticisms of the missions are addressed, such as those arising from their opposition to aspects of native culture and from their involvement in child removals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50494960, "asset_id": 30042339, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2127, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Franklin", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "JamesFranklin", "display_name": "James Franklin", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/JamesFranklin?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2127/1027334/8432140/s65_james.franklin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2283, "name": "Catholic Missionary History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catholic_Missionary_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187034, "name": "Australian Aboriginal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 455653, "name": "Colonial history, Aboriginal history and cultural studies, Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_history_Aboriginal_history_and_cultural_studies_Australian_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1122342, "name": "Australian Catholicism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Catholicism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 11296521, "title": "The Divided History of Dugong Oil: The Cross-Cultural Circulation of an Indigenous Medicine in 1940s Queensland", "created_at": "2015-03-05T16:26:45.433-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11296521/The_Divided_History_of_Dugong_Oil_The_Cross_Cultural_Circulation_of_an_Indigenous_Medicine_in_1940s_Queensland?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_11296521", "summary": "Through the effects of colonisation, materials such as food, tools and medicines are appropriated and transformed to appeal to different consumer groups creating new points of interaction and combined histories.

I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.\u201d \n\n\n\u201c Europeans had been convinced of the existence of a Great Southern Land for more than two thousand years. At first it was dreamed of in much the same way contemporary people hope for extra-terrestrial.\u201d \n\n\nIt is easy for one\u2019s mind to be cast adrift into a more romantic era while contemplating those \u2018barbarous\u2019 coasts that Melville\u2019s siren like prose tempts us with. Like wise, the rather \u2018Edinburgh\u2019 sounding Soviet submarine captain Ramius in the blockbuster Hunt for Red October, also lures the imagination towards a deeper will to explore the unknown seas while \u2018quoting\u2019 one Christopher Columbus:\n\n\u2018And the Sea will grant each man new hope, as sleep brings dreams of home\u2019\n\nThe \u2018dream\u2019 however, is rudely interrupted with the realisation that Columbus spoke no such words, and that this stunning maxim from one of the greatest navigators to challenge the unknown seas is in fact, the product of the film\u2019s director Larry Ferguson.  However, we still like to believe it was Columbus, Scottish accent and all.\n\nHuman beings, as the X-Files Fox Mulder correctly surmised, tend towards the notion of \u2018I want to believe\u2019 when faced with tantalising and mysterious new scenarios. The Historian is then faced with a conundrum when accounting for \u2018belief\u2019, while at the same time remaining faithful to Von Ranke\u2019s eternal doctrine of understanding the past wie es eigentlich gewesen.  Yet, as with the \u2018Mars Anomalies\u2019, much of the evidence (but not all) regarding the Portuguese discovery and mapping of Australia\u2019s east coast almost a century before Willhem Janzsoon in 1606, may in fact be a broad case of Pareidolia, driven by a desire for an alternate historical narrative. \n\nPareidolia is a known psychological phenomenon by which the human mind perceives images, shapes and patterns that may not exist, often according to suggestions or pre determined assumptions.  The unfamiliar and unusually oriented sixteenth century Dieppe maps may certainly have served as \u2018inkblots\u2019 that have been interpreted over time as representing Australia.\n\nHowever, like the \u2018Mars Anomalies\u2019, an element of doubt remains due to the vast ocean of space and time that separates our human experience from the sixteenth century. Historical interpretation provides a flimsy plank hanging cautiously over the bow of historical certainty, yet like the Rorschach inkblots, sixteenth century cartography is at the mercy of modern interpretation and those who dare to walk the plank.\n                          \n              \nFig.1. This map represents the apparent similarity between \u2018Jave la Grande\u2019 in the 1542 Rotz map and the modern cartographic representation of Australia. Not much imagination is required to assume a direct relationship of shape. \n\n\nAs this essay will attempt to demonstrate, interpretation of evidence and supposition in the case of the possible Portuguese discovery and mapping of Australia\u2019s east coast has proven as treacherous a sea as any sailed by De Gama, Magellan or Mendonca. Indeed, the Portuguese claim is not unique when considering the problem of who the first non-Aboriginal discoverer of Australia may have been.\n\nIn 1756, Charles de Brosses claimed in his Histoire des navigations aux Terres Australe, that the Frenchman Binot Paulmier de Gonneville had succeeded in 1504. The well known Australian aviator Lawrence Hargrave cited what he thought were archaeological ruins to posit that Spanish explorers had established a lost colony in Botany. \n\nIn 1947 V.R. Ramachandra Dikshiter suggested that Tamil explorers had arrived in Australia centuries before Cook.  By 1980, Allan Robinson self published evidence that suggested the ancient Phoenicians had crossed the globe to Australia in ancient times.  Most recently, Gavin Menzies met great scholarly resistance due to his unsatisfactory methodologies while advocating that the Chinese had landed in Australia in 1421. \n\nIt is the scope of this essay to determine the efficacy of the evidence that has been put forward in support of the claim that Portuguese navigators discovered and charted Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard in the early 1500\u2019s. In doing so, the many errors, assumptions and problematic interpretations of evidence will be examined, along with the same methodological issues that exist in the counter claims.\n\nTo achieve this end, an examination of the historiography of the theory will be assessed and critiqued, followed by a detailed analysis of the major arguments within the evidentiary fields. These will include the Dieppe maps and the \u2018Mahogany Ship\u2019, as well as problems surrounding place name identification and Jave la Grande. Hopefully the reader will better understand the paucity of evidence and difficulties surrounding the claims and rebuttals concerning the Portuguese discovery and mapping of Australia.\n\nDavy Jones\u2019 Locker: The historiography of the Portuguese discovery theory-1786-2015. \n\n\u201c....that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on....\u201d \n\nThe premise behind a Portuguese discovery of Australia has been in the public discourse since the hydrographer and propagandist Alexander Dalrymple implied in his \u2018Memoirs Concerning the Chagos and Adjacent Islands\u2019 in 1786, that the sixteenth century Dieppe maps depicting Jave la Grande, served as evidence for a pre existent knowledge of Australia before James Cook in 1770. \n\nAccording to Dalrymple, the Coste Herbiage (coast of vegetation) on the Dauphin (Harleian) map was in fact Cook\u2019s Botany Bay. The inference being that Sir Joseph Banks forwarded the knowledge to Cook while in possession of the map. \n\nDalrymple\u2019s assumption may have been predicated upon the knowledge, as Stuart Duncan has identified, that Banks\u2019 presentation of the map to the British Museum in 1790, well after Cook\u2019s voyage was public knowledge, serves as circumstantial evidence of Cook\u2019s foreknowledge of the Australia coast line via a supposed very old corpus of Portuguese cartographic material. Helen Wallis has noted that the map in question was probably thought of as originating in 1536 during Dalrymple\u2019s time, but should be more accurately dated to 1547, thus throwing a cautionary light on the map\u2019s actual original source material. \n\nIt is to Dalrymple that we may attribute, as Andrew Sharpe noted in 1963, the scholarly controversy surrounding the significance of Jave la Grande; that debate has \u2018waxed hot ever since cannot be questioned\u2019. \n\n\u2018Costa dangereuse\u2019 on the east coast of Jave la Grande was in Dalrymple\u2019s view, where the Endeavour had actually run aground.  However, this notion has been challenged by Bill Richardson who in the process of arguing for a problematic Vietnamese rather than Australian coast line for Jave la Grande, argued that Dalrymple (and by default Stuart McIntyre after him), had fallen victim to erroneous translations of place names. \n\nRichardson\u2019s alternative solution to Dalrymple\u2019s Portuguese answer was to argue for the possibility of French mistranslations of \u2018Mui Varella\u2019 (the most north easterly cape of Vietnam) as \u2018Costa dauraella\u2019 rather than \u2018Costa da varella\u2019. To Richardson, it would have been quite plausible for Portuguese navigators to incorrectly transcribe \u2018danarella\u2019 or \u2018dangarella\u2019, followed by a French mistranslation as \u2018dangereuse\u2019. The \u2018costa dangereuse\u2019 found on the Jave la Grande depiction could be incorrectly identified by Dalrymple as the place of Cook\u2019s accident. \n\nIt must be noted that Richardson\u2019s argument, while at face value appears plausible, fails the tenets of Occam\u2019s Razor  by compounding assumptions in order to achieve a solution that is by definition, lacking evidence and therefore an argumentum ex silentio.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39267620, "asset_id": 16927089, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6253239, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Brown", "domain_name": "newcastleuni", "page_name": "MatthewBrown", "display_name": "Matthew F Brown", "profile_url": "https://newcastleuni.academia.edu/MatthewBrown?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6253239/2828213/6903857/s65_matthew.brown.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2365, "name": "Pacific Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Island_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2861, "name": "Portuguese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4409, "name": "Naval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naval_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 4916, "name": "Portuguese Discoveries and Expansion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Discoveries_and_Expansion?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 63770, "name": "Seafarers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seafarers?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 335125, "name": "Historic Shipwrecks/ Conservation of Marine Artifacts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historic_Shipwrecks_Conservation_of_Marine_Artifacts?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 685303, "name": "Portuguese Naval Architecture in the Age of Exploration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Naval_Architecture_in_the_Age_of_Exploration?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 42436733, "title": "New Histories but Old Patterns: K\u0101i Tahu in Australia", "created_at": "2020-03-31T03:37:47.086-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42436733/New_Histories_but_Old_Patterns_K%C4%81i_Tahu_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_42436733", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62606588, "asset_id": 42436733, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51067409, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Standfield", "domain_name": "i-am-groupltd", "page_name": "RachelStandfield", "display_name": "Rachel Standfield", "profile_url": "https://i-am-groupltd.academia.edu/RachelStandfield?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51067409/28351507/26529644/s65_rachel.standfield.jpg"}, {"id": 5460793, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Stevens", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MichaelStevens42", "display_name": "Michael Stevens", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MichaelStevens42?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5460793/2510439/33934533/s65_michael.stevens.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19464, "name": "History of New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_Zealand?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93958, "name": "Maori history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maori_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 302491, "name": "southern Ngai Tahu whakapapa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/southern_Ngai_Tahu_whakapapa?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3604578, "name": "Ng\u0101i Tahu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ng%C4%81i_Tahu?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 36115062, "title": "Philo Free", "created_at": "2018-03-08T21:02:30.621-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36115062/Philo_Free?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_36115062", "summary": "These are two articles of mine now published in a new book, Freedom to Libel?

Taking as its central theme the way each country responded to the introduction of new migrants, the book asks a key historical question: why and how did multiculturalism replace Britishness as the defining idea of community for English-speaking Canada and Australia, and what does this say about their respective experiences of nationalism in the twentieth century? The book begins from a simple premise \u2013 namely, that the path towards the adoption of multiculturalism as the orthodox way of defining national community in English-speaking Canada and Australia in the latter half of the twentieth century was both uncertain and unsteady. It followed a period in which both nations had looked first and foremost to Britain to define their national self-image. In both nations, however, following the breakdown of their more formal and institutional ties to the \u2018mother-country\u2019 in the post-war period there was a crisis of national meaning, and policy makers and politicians moved quickly to fill the void with a new idea of the nation, one that was the very antithesis to the White, monolithic idea of Britishness.

Yet the notion that this battle constituted a \" coming of age \" for a nascent nation, and that Australian soldiers had exhibited the defining characteristics of a national type, has become a powerful \u2014 even hegemonic \u2014 story of Australian identity. Many analysts have pointed to the militaristic, masculine and mono-cultural dimensions of a myth that weds the nation to a colonial past and in the process imposes limits on the ways in which we can imagine the nation and its role in the world. Yet as the Australian government geared up for the 2015 centenary of that landing \u2014 Anzac Day 1 \u2014 with an unprecedented commitment of resources for commemorative activities, the shadow cast by the broader Anzac myth over Australian society and politics triggered surprisingly little public debate.

Its concentration on the complex historical and contemporary relationships between these two cinemas taps directly into discussions of national cinema, transnationalism and global Hollywood. While most equivalent studies aim to define national cinema as independent from or in competition with Hollywood, this collection explores a more porous set of relationships through the varied production, distribution and exhibition associations between Hollywood and  Australia.  To explore this idea, a range of chapters investigate the influence that Australia has had on US cinema through the exportation of its stars, directors and other production personnel to Hollywood; while many of the other chapters chart the sustained influence of US cinema on Australia over the last 100 years. The authors represented in this book re-examine the concept and definition of Australian cinema in regard to a range of local, international and global practices and trends that blur neat categorizations of Australian national cinema. Although this concentration on US production, or influence, is particularly acute in relation to such developments as the opening of international film studios in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide and the Gold Coast over the last 30 years, this book also examines a range of Hollywood financed and/or conceived films shot in Australia since the 1920s. Furthermore it surveys Hollywood models of production and genre, as well as American distribution and exhibition networks, that have altered the way Australians go to the cinema, the type of films they watch, and the kinds of movies they make. This book takes two key points in time - the 1920s and 1930s and the last 20 years - to chart the ongoing, shifting, resistant and dependent relationships between Australian and US cinema and how particular patterns of localism, nationalism, colonialism, transnationalism and globalization have shaped its course over the last century.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57794160, "asset_id": 32697387, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2427485, "first_name": "Peter C.", "last_name": "Kunze", "domain_name": "tulane", "page_name": "kunze", "display_name": "Peter C.

This is the story of toponymic Murdering Creek, on the southern side of Lake Weyba near Noosa in Queensland\u2019s southeast. \nWe will assess the alleged massacre at Murdering Creek as a potential type instance of the Australian genocidal process, while the war for land raged across the continent for a century or more.  Aboriginals were an impediment to a blitzkrieg of settler occupation. Aboriginal dispersal was abetted by a Government process that included military (at first) and then police enforcement. Heavily armed pastoralists were encouraged to take the law into their own hands, if they did it circumspectly, under the guise of self-protection. Aboriginals resisted, but the war was too one-sided. The reward for resistance was to be shot or hanged. British law did not allow Aboriginals to own land, not until well into the 20th century. Until then, Aboriginal dispossession was legal, leaving the First People as trespassers. With no where else to go they became refugees. Detention centres became the Government answer to the Aboriginal problem. And a ruthless boot on the neck. Over 90% of the Aboriginal population \u2018disappeared\u2019 by 1911. \nWe see the pattern of invasive occupation repeat for all states, including Queensland. From the early  1860s, almost all the available pastoral areas in south east Queensland had been taken over by British settlers seeking their fortune. Many leases remained a battleground. In our forensic examination of the Murdering Creek massacre myth, we find that it is supported by an actual event that, on the balance of evidence, took place in 1864 on a 23,000 acre pastoral station called Yandina Run,  between the Maroochy River and Lake Weyba. We determine that the massacre was carried out by local pastoral workers and at least one timbergetter. The motive seems to have been  a belief in white supremacy,  and a pathological desire to remove the Aboriginals, who objected to a homestead being built near a sacred bora in 1862.  An unkown number of Aboriginals were murdered while in canoes at the mouth of the Creek and into the shallow foreshore of the lake, where they had been inveigled by a ruse.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38112569, "asset_id": 13727169, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2965, "name": "Sociology of Crime and Deviance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Crime_and_Deviance?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 17633278, "title": "The Irish R.M.: Capt.

This phenomenon has been explored in relation to technological developments, but thus far little scholarly attention has been paid to the interconnection between Holocaust memory and the post-war migration of survivors. In this article, I redress this critical oversight and examine how memory and migration shape the work of Maria Lewitt, a Polish-born Jewish Holocaust survivor who emigrated to Australia. Come Spring (1980) portrays her survival in Europe and No Snow in December (1985) her Australian migrant life; together, the two autobiographical novels recount \u2018a whole life\u2019, both over time and synchronically, as Lewitt connects private experiences to global historical events. In the 1980s, a time when Australia was increasingly embracing the diversity arising from its migrant population, the texts inserted Lewitt's personal memories into the public discourse in her new home country. I argue that Lewitt combined her memories of survival and migration in order to add her voice as a Jewish Australian to this new \u2018multiculturalism\u2019.

At its very origin, the indigeneous inhabitants of that land were thus excluded from the political space later named \" Australia \". The British declaration of absence inaugurated a fundamental dislocation between Australian politics and the land itself. In January 1972 a second declaration answered the first, a declaration of the sovereign presence of indigeneous people and of their inviolable ties to the land; the Aboriginal Tent Embassy set up opposite Parliament House. However, this declaration did not seek to simply rectify the error of the first by seeking inclusion for indigeneous people; rather, it seeks to transform the very nature of Australian politics. To understand how such change might be possible the Tent Embassy can be understood as an event in Alain Badiou's terms; that is an anomalous disruption which occurs at a structural flaw of a situation and inaugurates an infinite process of explorative change. The analysis of indigeneous politics in Australia in terms of Badiou's philosophy bears results in two domains; first Badiou's theory of structural change is shown to require some fine tuning, and second, the indigeneous politics faithful to the event of the Tent Embassy is revealed to be the sole political practice capable of redressing the fundamental dislocation of Australian politics; hence its singularity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42760856, "asset_id": 22087812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6666945, "first_name": "Oliver", "last_name": "Feltham", "domain_name": "aup", "page_name": "OliverFeltham", "display_name": "Oliver  Feltham", "profile_url": "https://aup.academia.edu/OliverFeltham?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6666945/2634616/12943076/s65_oliver.feltham.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5060, "name": "Indigenous Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Politics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16209, "name": "Alain Badiou", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alain_Badiou?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22547, "name": "Social and Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Political_Philosophy?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 17633401, "title": "Working the Capes: The Irish Cattle Economy of the Lower South West of Western Australia, 1829-1918", "created_at": "2015-11-02T21:19:19.337-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17633401/Working_the_Capes_The_Irish_Cattle_Economy_of_the_Lower_South_West_of_Western_Australia_1829_1918?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_17633401", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39627103, "asset_id": 17633401, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36560840, "first_name": "Gil", "last_name": "Hardwick", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HardwickGil", "display_name": "Gil Hardwick", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HardwickGil?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36560840/10595133/11826087/s65_gil.hardwick.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 386, "name": "Irish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8875536, "title": "Counter-Memorial Aesthetics:  Refugee Histories and the Politics of Contemporary  Art", "created_at": "2014-10-20T13:10:46.200-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8875536/Counter_Memorial_Aesthetics_Refugee_Histories_and_the_Politics_of_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_8875536", "summary": "prologue, intro and afterword of book\nPublication date: October 20, 2016\nAbstract: \nRestrictive border protection policies directed toward managing the flow of refugees coming into neoliberal democracies (and out of failing nation-states) are a defining feature of contemporary politics. In this book, Ver\u00f3nica Tello analyses how contemporary artists--such as Tania Bruguera, Isaac Julien, Rosemary Laing, Dierk Schmidt, Hito Steyerl, Lyndell Brown and Charles Green--negotiate their diverse subject positions while addressing and taking part in the production of images associated with refugee experiences and histories. Tello argues that their practices, which manifest across a range of contexts including Cuba, the United States, Australia and Europe, represent an emergent, global paradigm of contemporary art, 'counter-memorial aesthetics'.\n\nCounter-memorial aesthetics, Tello argues, is characterized by its conjunction of heterogeneous signifiers and voices of many times and places, generating an experimental, non-teleological approach to the construction of contemporary history, which also takes into account the complex, disorienting spatial affects of globalization. Spanning performance art, experimental 'history painting', aftermath photography and video installation, counter-memorial aesthetics bring to the fore, Tello argues, how contemporary refugee flows and related traumatic events critically challenge and conflict with many existing, tired if not also stubborn notions of national identity, borders, history and memory. \n\nBuilding on the writings of such thinkers as Michel Foucault and Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, this book offers a useful concept of 'counter-memory' for the twenty-first century. It shows how counter-memorial aesthetics is not only central to the nexus of contemporary art and refugee histories but also how it can offer a way of being critically present with many other, often interrelated, global crises in the contemporary era.\n\nhttp://bloomsbury.com/us/counter-memorial-aesthetics-9781474252737/", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48867571, "asset_id": 8875536,

of violent riots led by European and Australian born miners against Chinese miners from 1860 to 1861 on the Burrangong goldfields in NSW. They led to anti-Chinese immigration legislation in NSW in 1861 and the White Australia policy enacted after Federation in 1901. However, legislation and government policies were not enough to create a shared sense of national identity. After Federation, individual and collective memories of the Lambing Flat riots were re-imagined as a national foundation myth. The town of Young, where the riots had occurred were proud of the role that they played in the foundation of a White Australia. Indeed, residents proudly participated in a film titled \u201cThe Birth of White Australia\u201d (1928) and many memoirs published around this time also refer to the riots as the birth of White Australia. Today, however, pride in this myth has disappeared and the town struggles to redefine itself in a modern multicultural nation, especially when there are increasing interactions with Chinese Australians who want to be acknowledged for the roles they played in the creation of the Australian nation.

The architects and designers of the city's new coffee shops and cocktail lounges were, however, influenced by a design archetype established earlier by the Sydney milk bar phenomenon. These three typologies were generally designed to accommodate the activities of three novel social groupings. While the city's milk bars beckoned to the 'Bodgies and Widgies' generation; Sydney's coffee shops drew a loose association of 'Smart Set' urbanites and bohemians attracted to design and visual arts, while the cocktail bars lured a new class of 'urban sophisticates' in search of perfect cocktails, style and conversation in a fashionable setting. Much of the interior architecture of these new venues featured gender-responsive interior planning and decor designed to attract women to new urban entertainments, introduced new mid-20th century materials, lighting and fittings and played a major role in underwriting the professionalization of Sydney's interior designers. Sydney's coffee shops and cocktail lounges attracted a new generation of women architects and designers who engaged in commercial-scale interior architecture for the first time. The development of the coffee lounge and cocktail bar typologies belongs to a specific time and place and the decorative and structural deviations from the distinctive, defined norms of postwar Sydney venues helps isolate and identify the elements of this new taxonomy of style. The linear evolution of these Sydney gathering places illustrates that they were collectively shaped around a stylistic 'meme' that reproduced, albeit imperfectly, for each generation. These memes shared social and cultural characteristics and had specific physical boundaries, settings and common qualities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50648954, "asset_id": 30189600, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33959543, "first_name": "michael", "last_name": "bogle", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "michaelbogle", "display_name": "michael bogle", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/michaelbogle?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33959543/10009190/11163749/s65_michael.bogle.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 988, "name": "Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5553, "name": "Interior Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Design?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8002, "name": "Youth Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Culture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9437, "name": "Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 48876, "name": "Interior Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Architecture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 61835, "name": "Urban Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Design?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 12361316, "title": "Deconstructing colonial myths: the massacre at Murdering Creek", "created_at": "2015-05-12T23:24:30.803-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12361316/Deconstructing_colonial_myths_the_massacre_at_Murdering_Creek?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_12361316", "summary": "Australia is populated with violent place names, a shadowland of myth. This is the story of toponymic Murdering Creek in south-east Queensland. \nMyth is the handmaiden of reality, a more onerous citizenship. It can be ignored. Or cast aside as quaint folklore from another time. Or it can be explored and possibly verified or refuted. What cannot be discounted: myth forms a large part of the Australian historical landscape. For over a century, Australia was a war zone. It was a war for land and Aboriginals were in the way. A firestorm of massacres defined the pastoral frontier as it advanced across the continent. Many of these massacres have achieved the element of myth, untested, insufficiently examined. One of them is the reported massacre  at Murdering Creek, on the southern side of Lake Weyba near Noosa in Queensland\u2019s southeast. \nThis paper proposes investigative tools that can help decode Australia\u2019s mythical past. Not the largely confected, triumphal past of heroic pastoralism, as it tamed the land for economic gain. No, it is the violent and defiantly  racist past that many of us choose to forget, including that at Murdering Creek. It is the invasive pattern of armed dispossession, the process of occupation that formed the political uses of Australian genocide. We remind ourselves that racism is the belief that one race considers itself superior to another.

Heffernan, a twenty-three year old woman sentenced to death for the drowning of her son in 1900, created considerable public debate regarding her guilt. Historians have used Heffernan's case to demonstrate attitudes toward violent mothers in the period, yet the concept of 'madness' and its centrality to Heffernan's case has been overlooked. Heffernan aroused public sympathy, several large petitions for her release, and was eventually granted a commuted sentence of only two years imprisonment due to the public's willingness to attribute her behaviour to madness. An examination of Victorian lunatic asylum committals and public discourses surrounding femininity and 'madness' reveals that Heffernan's case was highly reflective of a culture in which violent women were often deemed irrational.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73688115, "asset_id": 34854967, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42631546, "first_name": "Georgina", "last_name": "Rychner", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "gryc", "display_name": "Georgina Rychner", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/gryc?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2326, "name": "Nineteenth Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4153, "name": "Criminal Justice History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Justice_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6182, "name": "History of Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Psychiatry?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 25175, "name": "Social History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History_of_Medicine?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 38504, "name": "Ideologies of Motherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideologies_of_Motherhood?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 49710, "name": "Infanticide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Infanticide?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 51941, "name": "Women's and gender history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_and_gender_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 91050, "name": "Social and Cultural History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_History_of_Medicine?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 128448, "name": "History of Crime and Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Crime_and_Punishment?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 141136, "name": "History of Mental Illness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Mental_Illness?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 9255189, "title": "The Somerton Man: An Unsolved History", "created_at": "2014-11-11T12:15:20.316-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9255189/The_Somerton_Man_An_Unsolved_History?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_9255189", "summary": "A true crime cold case and the \"unknowable-ness\" of the past", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35522946, "asset_id": 9255189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13099838, "first_name": "Ruth", "last_name": "Balint", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "RuthBalint", "display_name": "Ruth Balint", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/RuthBalint?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13099838/3694128/4329752/s65_ruth.balint.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2072927, "title": "Fantome Island Lock Hospital and Aboriginal Venereal Disease Sufferers 1928-45", "created_at": "2012-10-31T15:26:59.207-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2072927/Fantome_Island_Lock_Hospital_and_Aboriginal_Venereal_Disease_Sufferers_1928_45?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_2072927", "summary": "In this article the Queensland government's response to suspected and confirmed cases of venereal disease amongst the state's Aboriginal population is examined through the micro history of Fantome Island lock hospital, which operated between 1928 and 1945.

As officials pieced together the horrors of the voyage many questions arose. Why did Michael Collins claim that his fellow convicts conspired to take the ship? Why was Captain Drake unable to rein in the violent and sadistic Third Mate Baxter? Was there really an attempted mutiny on the Chapman? Or was this cold-blooded murder?

It took three years to organise and outfit the expedition and during that time the objectives changed frequently and the aims were never clearly defined. The way the Society established the expedition was unlike any previous Australian expedition. The expedition was renamed the Burke and Wills Expedition after the deaths of the two leaders. Although it is easy to imagine the drama on the expedition centered solely on Burke and Wills, the story of the expedition is a complicated one which involved many people in various groups scattered all across the continent.

Often ignored are the \u2018general public\u2019, here used to mean those who are neither victim nor perpetrator. This thesis seeks to address this oversight in one specific case by examining the changes in public opinion towards the apology to the Stolen Generations in Australia across the period 1997-2008. Here, the general public is the non-Indigenous public of Australia, most of whom were not in any way involved in the policies which led to the Stolen Generations. The apology is an interesting aspect of TJ in Australia because it came to represent reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians during the 11-year period where former Prime Minister John Howard refused to make it. The thesis will argue that opinion towards the apology fluctuated drastically in the period between its suggestion in 1997 and it being made in 2008, due to factors including fluctuating political opinion and changes in attitude towards Indigenous reconciliation. It will conclude that while the apology was an important step in reconciliation, and was believed to be so by many of the general public, its actual and perceived effects on the reconciliation process for the Stolen Generations have been negligible. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53094884, "asset_id": 32972262, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35218561, "first_name": "Eliott", "last_name": "Hull", "domain_name": "roehampton-online", "page_name": "EliottHull", "display_name": "Eliott Hull", "profile_url": "https://roehampton-online.academia.edu/EliottHull?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35218561/12265778/71794007/s65_eliott.hull.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1116, "name": "Public Opinion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Opinion?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9251, "name": "Transitional Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transitional_Justice?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 241532, "name": "Apology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Apology?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 21583930, "title": "The killing of Charles Franks and the obliteration of Port Phillip\u2019s convicts", "created_at": "2016-02-05T02:33:44.665-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21583930/The_killing_of_Charles_Franks_and_the_obliteration_of_Port_Phillip_s_convicts?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_21583930", "summary": "The squatter Charles Franks and his shepherd were brutally killed by Aboriginal people in 1836 in the Port Phillip District.

We find that there are disturbing similarities between genocidal aetiology and morbidity for Barambah (Kabi) and Wybalenna (Palawa).

They were seen, not just as cricketers, but as a curious example of colonised indigenous people of the British empire who had been \u201ccivilised\u201d by adopting the game of cricket.  The tour was moderately successful, but the team\u2019s legacy did not pave the way for other Aboriginal people to forge successful careers in what was to remain essentially a white man\u2019s game.  Players who followed them, such as Gilbert, Henry, and Marsh, were unable to break through the racism and discrimination they faced at the hands of white umpires and selectors.  It was not until the 1990s when Jason Gillespie was selected to play for Australia, leading to discussion about race and conservatism within the game.  It has only been during the last few decades that organisations such as Cricket Australia have sought to address the issue of why indigenous people don\u2019t play cricket and what can be done about it.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35676336, "asset_id": 9434853, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15222701, "first_name": "Julia", "last_name": "Carmichael", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "JuliaCarmichael2", "display_name": "Julia Carmichael", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/JuliaCarmichael2?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15222701/4106402/11223039/s65_julia.carmichael.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4216, "name": "Sports History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 11374, "name": "Cricket", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cricket?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 49752, "name": "History of Cricket", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cricket?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 182063, "name": "Australian sports history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_sports_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 460668, "name": "Indigenous Sport History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Sport_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 507443, "name": "Social History of Sport (cricket)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History_of_Sport_cricket_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 601345, "name": "Cricket History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cricket_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1322514, "name": "Racism In Sports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism_In_Sports?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 4939135, "title": "Pinkerton Graves Melton: A report on the relocation of the Pinkerton pioneer graves and memorial cairn", "created_at": "2013-10-30T11:05:03.160-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4939135/Pinkerton_Graves_Melton_A_report_on_the_relocation_of_the_Pinkerton_pioneer_graves_and_memorial_cairn?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_4939135", "summary": "The Melton Shire Sewerage Authority, extended their irrigation development which required the Pinkerton family grave site and historic pioneer cairn to be moved.

After years of working in the shadows, assisting their fathers and husbands, they burst onto the scene, giving it a new vitality and dynamism. Women artists redrew the boundaries of Aboriginal art, and continue to be among its most daring innovators.\n\nDrawn from the collection of Debra and Dennis Scholl, Marking the Infinite features the work of nine leading exponents of this ongoing tradition: Nonggirrnga Marawili, Wintjiya Napaltjarri, Yukultji Napangati, Angelina Pwerle, Carlene West, Regina Pilawuk Wilson, Lena Yarinkura, Gulumbu Yunupingu, and Nyapanyapa Yunupingu. These nine artists offer a snapshot of the diversity of Aboriginal Australian contemporary art practice. Matriarchs in their communities, they are steeped in the ancient cultural traditions of their people. Inspired by these traditions, they extrapolate to the universal, creating artworks that speak\nto the entangled globalized world in which we live. \n\nIn this volume, the art of each artist is given in-depth analysis by leading art historians, curators, and anthropologists. The essays shed light on the rich and complex histories behind the artworks, placing them in the contexts of traditional Aboriginal culture, philosophy, colonial experience, and the contemporary art world. Marking the Infinite shows nine artists producing works that cross cultures and bridge worlds. This strength of vision is immediately evident in works that shimmer and swirl, affirm their authority like lightning bolts, or sparkle like the night sky. These are marks upon\nthe infinite, connecting people from different cultures and countries, and reminding us of our shared humanity.\n\nFeaturing contributions from Tina Baum, Anne Marie Brody, John Carty, Rachel Kent, Howard Morphy, JoAnne Northrup, Hetti Perkins, Cara Pinchbeck, Sarita Qunilivan, Elina Spilia, Will Stubbs and Suzette Wearne.

A vigorous male was shipped off but died shortly before arrival in Britain. This request can only be understood if placed in the context of Churchill\u2019s passion for exotic pets as well as the rich history of aristocratic menageries and live diplomatic gifts. Obtaining an animal hitherto unseen alive in Europe would have been a great zoological achievement for London Zoo and secured British authority in heated historical taxonomical debates. This zoological triumph, coupled with accomplishing an extravagant enterprise in the middle of war-time austerity would have boosted public morale.

Eventually, she became known as \u201cThe Witch of King\u2019s Cross\u201d and is widely remembered as a scandalous bohemian figure. This dissertation will argue that Norton\u2019s work can be considered a politically charged art of resistance, which challenged the dominant paradigms and political hegemonies of the time. This can be understood, in part, through Jacques Rancie\u0300re\u2019s notion of \u201cdissensus\u201d whereby a political subject intervenes in accepted distributions of sensible materials. In engaging with certain creative traditions, Norton embraced and reimagined existing art forms to political effect. Her interpretation of the gothic horror genre became a vehicle to redeem the image of the occult artist, while her use of Surrealist art tactics posed a challenge to a presiding rationalistic worldview. Norton\u2019s artwork can also be seen to challenge the primacy of Christian and patriarchal social norms in mid-century Australia. Finally, Norton\u2019s negotiation of her own public representation (through the media and social engagement) can be read as a radical political and aesthetic statement. Through this medium, the artist posed a resistance to cultural expectations and reclaimed the image of the \u201cWitch\u201d to assert her agency and equality in society. Ultimately, Norton\u2019s practice espouses the values of knowledge and freedom, resisting repression both passively and actively, through modes of literature, visual art and lifestyle suffused with the occult.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39511614, "asset_id": 17444285, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14291224, "first_name": "Lyndon", "last_name": "Blue", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "LyndonBlue", "display_name": "Lyndon Blue", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/LyndonBlue?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14291224/4234973/4928238/s65_lyndon.blue.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4951, "name": "Surrealism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surrealism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5408, "name": "Magic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magic?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8760, "name": "Jacques Ranci\u00e8re", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Ranci%C3%A8re?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14546, "name": "Modernism (Art History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernism_Art_History_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15342, "name": "Aesthetics and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics_and_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20816, "name": "Art Theory and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Theory_and_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24149, "name": "Occultism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Occultism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24185, "name": "Witchcraft, Religion and Magic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Witchcraft_Religion_and_Magic?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 28686, "name": "Pantheism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pantheism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 60357, "name": "Western Esotericism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Esotericism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 60890, "name": "Counterhegemony", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Counterhegemony?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 129908, "name": "Sydney", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sydney?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 429873, "name": "Rosaleen Norton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rosaleen_Norton?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 15369380, "title": "Masters of the Sydney whaling fleet, 1805-1896", "created_at": "2015-09-03T16:15:15.079-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15369380/Masters_of_the_Sydney_whaling_fleet_1805_1896?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_15369380", "summary": "The first essential for a whaling voyage was a good captain.

Nonetheless one of the more pivotal factors is historically that of the ministry and influence of the college principal.  In the case of the Queensland Baptist College of Ministries (QBCM, presently Malyon College), with its affiliated Queensland Baptist denomination, this role was fulfilled in 1983-2001 by Rev Dr Stan W Nickerson.  Through interacting with extant literature touching on aspects of Nickerson\u2019s tenure, conjoined with Field Research interviews featuring relevant QBCM faculty and graduates, a more comprehensive portrait of Nickerson\u2019s influence as Principal begins to emerge.  \n\nIt is an analysis centred on (1) the development of QBCM\u2019s overall educational standards and credibility under Nickerson\u2019s tenure, (2) Nickerson\u2019s interaction with theological developments at QBCM and throughout the Queensland Baptist movement, as well as (3) consideration of any criticisms of Nickerson or QBCM during Nickerson\u2019s Principalship.  Finally, (4) we will explore what characterized the ensuing generation of QBCM graduates during Nickerson\u2019s era as QBCM Principal, homing in on personal and ministry practices which may be attributed to him, as well as exploring his wider influence on the Queensland denomination.  We discover in Nickerson a leader who helped steer the College educationally, wisely hiring and enabling faculty, consolidating accreditation standards and encouraging practical ministry developments.  The theological climate at QBCM remained conservative under Nickerson, yet with a more \u2018open evangelical,\u2019 educationally progressive accent.  Though not in the classical mould of the strong, decisive leader, ultimately Nickerson\u2019s track-record and tenacity offset this from being a hindrance.  The stability and growth of QBCM under Nickerson was a boon to the denomination, with many graduating ministers viewing the OT through a new lens as a result of Nickerson\u2019s gift for teaching and preaching.

As is often the case in historical research, the surviving sources provide us with only vague, imprecise, anecdotal, fragmented, and ambiguous accounts of this fascinating case of animal-human cooperation (or mutualism). In order to gain at least a partial understanding of this situation, as a pedagogical exercise for historians and historical social scientists, we explain the creation of an atemporal mathematical fuzzy rule-based model that helps us make sense of the information we have in order to enrich the historical narrative. We employ the strengths of fuzzy logic because information can be imprecise or vague and we can use variables that are subjective in nature (for example, cooperation). The rules on which the model is built are transparent and are thus readily understood and discussed among domain experts, thereby improving debates among historians. The modeling process remains open-ended so that in the future, we can include other models and/or variables/classes. Because fuzzy logic (fuzzy set theory) and mathematical modeling are well-established techniques for dealing with vague information with which historians are largely unfamiliar, we intend this article to serve a pedagogical purpose by teaching historians how to do this type of modeling work when their sources, particularly those that are qualitative, exhibit such vagueness. \n\nAn earlier version of this paper was presented (by Owens) to the SOCNET Networking Workshop, \"'The dream which is not fed with dream disappears': Geographically-Integrated History and Dynamics GIS\" (Boise, Idaho, USA), 7-8 August 2012.\n\nKeywords: cooperation; mutualism; fuzzy rule-based modeling; shore-based whaling; Orcinus orca; killer whale; Australian history; Twofold Bay (Eden, Australia)", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51144957, "asset_id": 30700036, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28595, "first_name": "J.

the 1830s, white settlers in the Australian colonies sought to consolidate their possession of Aboriginal land, prompting tension between colonists and Aboriginal people, and between settlers and

In this essay, I examine competing representations of frontier clashes, and particularly the 1838 Myall Creek massacre, and their links to larger imperial debates. At the height of their inf luence, British humanitarians drew upon the discursive strategies of the antislavery movement in seeking to mobilize concern for Indigenous Australians. In a context where Aboriginal people were stereotyped as primitive and non-human, counter-images and strategies drawn from antislavery discourse might constitute them as objects of white compassion. Focusing blame upon the convict perpetrators allowed elite humanitarians to displace responsibility from the system of colonization itself.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51330139, "asset_id": 30904871, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3455353, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Lydon", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "JaneLydon", "display_name": "Jane  Lydon", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/JaneLydon?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3455353/1169316/20221586/s65_jane.lydon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 863, "name": "Visual Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1697, "name": "Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2363, "name": "Empathy (Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empathy_Psychology_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5524, "name": "History Of Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Emotions?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9456, "name": "Emotions (Social Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions_Social_Psychology_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 11575, "name": "Anti-slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-slavery?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 33035, "name": "Historical and Theoretical Conceptions of Empathy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_and_Theoretical_Conceptions_of_Empathy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 149466, "name": "Visuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visuality?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 160390, "name": "Antislavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antislavery?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 178759, "name": "History Wars, Australian historiography, historical consciousness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Wars_Australian_historiography_historical_consciousness?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 228231, "name": "Frontier Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Frontier_Conflict?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 512722, "name": "Australian frontier conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_frontier_conflict?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 37703750, "title": "Federation's children\u2014white women's 'entangled lives' in interwar Australia: Ruth Heathcock and Phyllis Flower", "created_at": "2018-11-05T02:03:33.734-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37703750/Federations_children_white_womens_entangled_lives_in_interwar_Australia_Ruth_Heathcock_and_Phyllis_Flower?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_37703750", "summary": "This article concerns two white women missionary nurses who, in the wake of Australian Federation, and its policies to instigate a white Australia, had significantly different relationships with Aboriginal people than those typically imagined in Australian culture: Ruth Rayney (1901\u20131994), born in rural South Australia at the stroke of Federation in January 1901, and Phyllis Flower (1889\u20131926), born twelve years earlier in central Queensland.

Although this thesis is the fourth to interrogate the extensive Mitchell Library holdings of the Angus & Robertson archives, it is the first whose central concern is the company\u2019s production and distribution of Australian titles within the United Kingdom and further afield through its London office. Often indicated as worthy of further investigation, this is an area of history which to date has only been broadly scoped without reference to key (often restricted) archival volumes.\nExploring the premise that there are cultural and commercial links between books produced at home and books imported from overseas, this study examines whether an Australian publisher could avoid becoming subject to the same socio-economic forces that British publishers claimed underpinned their international trade. Indeed, within the historical context of a strong British presence in Australian publishing and bookselling across the course of the twentieth century, this thesis asks in what ways did Angus & Robertson replicate, challenge or transform the often highly-criticised commercial practices of British publishers in order to develop an export trade for Australian books in the United Kingdom?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39671464, "asset_id": 17717178, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 388433, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Ensor", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "JasonEnsor", "display_name": "Jason Ensor", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/JasonEnsor?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/388433/98160/113784/s65_jason.ensor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 876, "name": "Print Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Print_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1139, "name": "Publishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Publishing?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2340, "name": "Book History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2811, "name": "History of the Book", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Book?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17062, "name": "Book Publishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_Publishing?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 26128, "name": "Book trade History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_trade_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 40867, "name": "United Kingdom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Kingdom?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 52154, "name": "Communication Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 334544, "name": "Angus and Robertson", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angus_and_Robertson?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 15619393, "title": "The partial case for Australian genocide: the role of Captain Arthur Phillip", "created_at": "2015-09-11T22:30:32.659-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15619393/The_partial_case_for_Australian_genocide_the_role_of_Captain_Arthur_Phillip?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_15619393", "summary": "Was Arthur Phillip a hero or a villain? A humanitarian or a despot? Was he merely a dutiful instrument of his time or did he exhibit the self-awareness of mens rea (guilty mind). Is a key servant of any sovereign state culpable for their actions, now or at any time in the past? Or are they above the law because they represent the law, as defined by national interests?  Does the \u2018standards of the time\u2019 argument really apply, the reflexive argument that we cannot judge the past because times were different then; or is it a denial of innate human values, a limp defence that might is always right, in the past and forever into the future. \n\nThis paper examines Phillip\u2019s role in Australian history. It challenges whether his historical impact, as a representative of Imperial Britain, was benevolent or dysfunctional, viewed through the lens of human rights. It presents a contrarian view of Phillip that points to his role as a British harbinger of Australian genocide. \n\nOnce the pattern of invasive British occupation was established - the system of land grants, land alienation and the policy of accelerated emigration, the one sided system of laws that denied Aboriginal witness testimony to atrocities, the use of armed force to ensure Aboriginal resistance would not be tolerated - the social and political outcome for the Indigenous people was inevitable. Well over 90% of the Aboriginal population were to \u2018disappear\u2019 by 1911.\n\nThe questions then become: Have we learned anything from our history, beginning with Phillip? Or are those same exploitative behaviours still with us in a more pernicious form?\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38742397, "asset_id": 15619393, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2965, "name": "Sociology of Crime and Deviance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Crime_and_Deviance?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 51753, "name": "Genocide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 11895880, "title": "'Fracturing the Skeleton' of the Law: the Mabo decision and the (re-) constitution of Australia", "created_at": "2015-04-11T03:46:43.558-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11895880/Fracturing_the_Skeleton_of_the_Law_the_Mabo_decision_and_the_re_constitution_of_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_11895880", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37273755, "asset_id": 11895880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29278991, "first_name": "Judith", "last_name": "Pryor", "domain_name": "cardiff", "page_name": "JudithPryor", "display_name": "Judith Pryor", "profile_url": "https://cardiff.academia.edu/JudithPryor?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29278991/8438199/9432495/s65_judith.pryor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8487, "name": "Sigmund Freud", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sigmund_Freud?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12040, "name": "Jacques Derrida", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Derrida?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 30027, "name": "The uncanny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_uncanny?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 199630, "name": "Constitutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutions?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 571826, "name": "Mabo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mabo?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 74050583, "title": "Launch of Stuart Macintyre's The Party: The Communist Party of Australia from Heyday to", "created_at": "2022-03-19T00:01:00.351-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74050583/Launch_of_Stuart_Macintyres_The_Party_The_Communist_Party_of_Australia_from_Heyday_to?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_74050583", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82343577, "asset_id": 74050583, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 904696, "first_name": "Jon", "last_name": "Piccini", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "JonPiccini", "display_name": "Jon Piccini", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/JonPiccini?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/904696/333916/37777692/s65_jon.piccini.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59779, "name": "History of Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Communism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36702201, "title": "Ukerbarley Aboriginal Area Aboriginal History and Occupation Report", "created_at": "2018-05-23T19:27:56.967-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36702201/Ukerbarley_Aboriginal_Area_Aboriginal_History_and_Occupation_Report?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_36702201", "summary": "Land use study of the Ukerbarley Aboriginal Area, which is located north of Coonabarabran in New South Wales, Australia.

Nevertheless, the approach of the Italian government is to consider the Romani peoples as \u201cnomadi\u201d (nomads), a term which describes them as unwilling or unable to settle within the host society. The most dramatic result of the strategic interpretation of Romani culture as inherently nomadic is the ghettoisation of a part of the Romani population into \u201ccampi nomadi\u201d (nomad camps), where they live in conditions of practical segregation from the rest of society. In turn, the fact that they are considered by the government as \u201cnot settled in a given territory\u201d excludes them from the list of non-native populations officially recognised as historico-linguistic minorities, a status that would have enhanced and protected their language and culture.\nThe Romani population in Australia is much smaller, at least as stated in official figures. According to the few available studies and a number of Romani informants interviewed, however, the real number is thought to be significantly underestimated by the Australian government. Romani individuals have been generally reluctant to disclose their ethnic and cultural identity on arrival. This fear results from the common attitude in Europe, from where many fled in search of a new life, which associates their ethnicity with crime and other stereotypical misconceptions. At the same time, apprehensions regarding the social and political climate in Australia have also reinforced this attitude. As a consequence, not many Australians know about their existence, government officials included. But while the Australian Romani community is mainly invisible, the term \u201cGypsy\u201d is used by mainstream Australians in order to describe a supposedly \u201chippy life style\u201d, thus obscuring its broader ethnic meaning. \nBoth in the Italian and Australian contexts there is a cultural loss/deprivation due to the dissemination of apparently opposing stereotypical misconceptions. Consequently, in Italy and Australia the Romani communities do not exist in positive terms, but as the result of a negative approach enacted by these governments: institutional and spatial segregation in the first case, bureaucratic neglect and romantic views in the second one. This comparative study aims to show that although Italy and Australia represents and configure quite different contexts, they do present similarities, especially in the way, with differing degrees of pressure, people with a Romani background risk to lose their cultural connotation.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45795668, "asset_id": 25478150, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 363267, "first_name": "Riccardo", "last_name": "Armillei", "domain_name": "rmit", "page_name": "RiccardoArmillei", "display_name": "Riccardo Armillei", "profile_url": "https://rmit.academia.edu/RiccardoArmillei?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/363267/111060/7721849/s65_riccardo.armillei.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11866, "name": "Romani Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romani_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45213, "name": "Italy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italy?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149130, "name": "Contemporary Italian History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Italian_History_and_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 201150, "name": "Gypsy Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gypsy_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 1139811, "title": "The four fathers of Australia: Baz Luhrmann's depiction of Aboriginal history and paternity in the Northern Territory", "created_at": "2011-12-06T14:37:15.940-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1139811/The_four_fathers_of_Australia_Baz_Luhrmanns_depiction_of_Aboriginal_history_and_paternity_in_the_Northern_Territory?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_1139811", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33520995, "asset_id": 1139811, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1020989, "first_name": "Shino", "last_name": "Konishi", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "ShinoKonishi", "display_name": "Shino Konishi", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/ShinoKonishi?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8734, "name": "Masculinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 124376, "name": "Australian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Cinema?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 182520, "name": "Baz Luhrmann", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baz_Luhrmann?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 20198641, "title": "From Pasture to Pastorate: The History of Morningside Uniting Church 1902-2002", "created_at": "2016-01-12T11:15:17.117-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20198641/From_Pasture_to_Pastorate_The_History_of_Morningside_Uniting_Church_1902_2002?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_20198641", "summary": "This is Chapter One of a history of Morningside Uniting Church.

At the beginning of the study basic outlines of the princely Jewish policy in the Middle Ages are briefly presented. Introduction is followed by the first section, which outlines the course of action of Geserah in the light of sources of the period. In the second section interpretations of the pogrom in modern, especially Austrian historiography is monitored. The third section is devoted to Geserah financial background; first the costs of Albrecht V the first and second anti-Hussite crusades are analyzed in detail as well as his marriage to Elizabeth of Luxem-bourg in the context of development of the land's financial policy throughout Albrecht government. From this background an attempt rises to interpret the impact of Geserah on Albre-cht's finances and ultimately the conclusion quite logically is that the main motivation of the Duke to unleash a pogrom lay precisely in the fiscal area. Lately the cause of Geserah has been sought rather in the sphere of religious history and that is why the authors point out the weaknesses of this religious argumentation. In conclusion the authors attempt again to present an overview of the causes and course of the pogrom as they understand them. \r\n\r\nReviews: \r\nLackner, Christian, in: MI\u00d6G 125 (2017) 457 (https://www.recensio.net/rezensionen/zeitschriften/mioeg/125-2017/2/ReviewMonograph877424138/@@generate-pdf-recension?language=de)\r\nLohrmann, Klaus, Im Vorfeld des Gedenkens an 1420/21, in: Wiener Geschichtsbl\u00e4tter 73 Heft 4 (2018) 377-379 (https://www.geschichte-wien.at/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Wiener_Geschichtsblaetter_2018-4.pdf)\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46363633, "asset_id": 26020228, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4605139, "first_name": "Wolfram", "last_name": "Ziegler", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WolframZiegler", "display_name": "Wolfram Ziegler", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WolframZiegler?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4605139/3912242/17974234/s65_wolfram.ziegler.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1446, "name": "Medieval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6326, "name": "Central European history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_European_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6627, "name": "Jewish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6633, "name": "Habsburg Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Habsburg_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 16677409, "title": "'Conciliate the Affections of the Natives': Governor Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet", "created_at": "2015-10-11T23:00:14.652-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16677409/Conciliate_the_Affections_of_the_Natives_Governor_Arthur_Phillip_and_the_First_Fleet?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_16677409", "summary": "Was Arthur Phillip a hero or a villain? A humanitarian or a despot? Was he merely a dutiful instrument of his time or did he exhibit the self-awareness of mens rea (guilty mind). Is a key servant of any sovereign state culpable for their actions, now or at any time in the past? Or are they above the law because they represent the law, as defined by national interests?  Does the \u2018standards of the time\u2019 argument really apply, the reflexive argument that we cannot judge the past because times were different then; or is it a denial of innate human values, a limp defence that might is always right, in the past and forever into the future. \n\nThis paper examines Phillip\u2019s role in Australian history. It challenges whether his historical impact, as a representative of Imperial Britain, was benevolent or dysfunctional, viewed through the lens of human rights. It presents a contrarian view of Phillip that points to his role as a British harbinger and agent of Australian genocide. \n\nOnce the pattern of invasive British occupation was established - the system of land grants, land alienation and the policy of accelerated emigration, the one sided system of laws that denied Aboriginal witness testimony to atrocities, the use of armed force to ensure Aboriginal resistance would not be tolerated - the social and political outcome for the Indigenous people was inevitable. Well over 90% of the Aboriginal population were to \u2018disappear\u2019 by 1911.\n\nThe questions then become: Have we learned anything from our history, beginning with Phillip? Or are those same exploitative behaviours still with us in a more pernicious form?\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39114939, "asset_id": 16677409, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 25646639, "title": "'Dancing with the stars' - Astronomy and Music in the Torres Strait", "created_at": "2016-05-26T23:50:18.730-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25646639/Dancing_with_the_stars_Astronomy_and_Music_in_the_Torres_Strait?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_25646639", "summary": "Song and dance are a traditional means of strengthening culture and passing knowledge to successive generations in the Torres Strait of northeastern Australia.

These are people who have proven faithful in times of trial. This faithfulness can be attributed at least in part to their holding a set of convictions regarding Jesus Christ, the concern of God for the world, and the necessity of resisting dominant ideologies which work against justice. In this article I argue that the late Athol Gill should be included in any such list of disciples. Gill was an Australian Baptist minister, New Testament scholar, community builder, and peace and justice activist. Central to his thinking and acting were the centrality of Jesus Christ as the model for discipleship, the importance of community, and the holistic nature of mission. In pursuing these concerns often in the face of institutional and social conservatism I show that Gill exhibited the qualities which Stassen attributes to those who should be recognised as notable examples of the Christian faith.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49375408, "asset_id": 28938924, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18104175, "first_name": "Stuart", "last_name": "Blythe", "domain_name": "ibts", "page_name": "StuartBlythe", "display_name": "Stuart Blythe", "profile_url": "https://ibts.academia.edu/StuartBlythe?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18104175/5047502/15300852/s65_stuart.blythe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5683, "name": "Baptist Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baptist_Theology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37995, "name": "Australian religious history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_religious_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79519, "name": "James McClendon Jr and Baptist Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/James_McClendon_Jr_and_Baptist_Theology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 233206, "name": "Saints", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Saints?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 281281, "name": "CHRISTIAN DISCIPLESHIP", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CHRISTIAN_DISCIPLESHIP?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 538849, "name": "Baptist History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baptist_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 598532, "name": "Practical Theology: Discipleship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Practical_Theology_Discipleship?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 780967, "name": "Incarnational Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Incarnational_Theology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2085366, "name": "Glen Stassen", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glen_Stassen?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 29206672, "title": "Histories of Climate, Science and Colonization in Australia and New Zealand, 1800-1945", "created_at": "2016-10-17T01:06:49.394-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29206672/Histories_of_Climate_Science_and_Colonization_in_Australia_and_New_Zealand_1800_1945?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_29206672", "summary": "This review article focuses on scholarship that lies at the intersection of histories of climate and British settler colonization in Australia and New Zealand.

The article finishes by recommending future areas for research. Throughout, we stress the importance of local-level approaches to climate as a means of understanding past and present, popular and scientific, interpretations of climate.

The first sanatorium in the Colony of Victoria had two branches: Echuca and Mount Macedon. These two locations differ in terms of altitude, the surrounding forest and meteorological variation. Yet, both sites were considered suitable at the time for the location of a sanatorium, possibly due to the health-promoting and aesthetic aspects of nearby eucalypt forests.

Whereas Anzac Day in New Zealand is solemn, with a focus on the laying of wreaths and services at war memorials and churches, in Australia the day is distinguished more by marches of returned servicemen, cheered by large crowds. By exploring the emphasis on different components of what are shared rituals, on the march of the veterans and the laying of wreaths, the article aims to outline and explain how and why Anzac Day is more funereal in New Zealand. It proceeds to highlight the \u2018NZ\u2019 in Anzac through a study of myth, ritual, memorialisation, heroes, and reinvention, and finds that, contrary to accepted views, the conscription debate in Australia is insufficient to account for this divergence of emphasis in Anzac formalities from 1916. Rather the article suggests that the coincidence of the South African War and Australian Federation at the dawn of the twentieth century, different nationalisms, and political, social, and cultural disparities between the dominions provided the context for divergent scripts of remembrance and meaning enacted in Anzac Day rituals since the First World War.

Samuel Leigh (1785-1852). Australian and New Zealand Methodism are linked by Leigh as he was the first Wesleyan missionary to arrive in both places. He visited Samuel Marsden\u2019s mission at the Bay of Islands in 1819 and then, in 1822 established the first Wesleyan mission, Wesleydale in Whangaroa, among the Maori accused of the Boyd massacre in December 1809. Leigh belonged to a period when Methodism had close ties to the Church of England, and the fact that he was \u2018not radically a Dissenter\u2019 was one cause of conflict with his fellow missionaries. The wave of the future for nineteenth-century Methodism would be as a strong, independent, body of Dissenters. This lecture will examine Leigh\u2019s relationships with his co-workers and argue that, as a man who belonged more naturally to an earlier period of Methodist development, he may be remembered as a pioneer, but not as a builder, of Methodism in Australia and New Zealand.

Their generous and exciting brief will ensure that the book has immediate appeal for multiple readers engaged in critical theory, as well as those more specifically involved in Australian and New Zealand history.

For most of the 20-year period, \u201cphysical\u201d policing was the dominant concern. Feet on the pavement. Knowing how to \u201cput a man in cuffs\u201d. The cultivation and use of informants formed the backbone of intelligence gathering and operational decision-making. A gentleman-like status quo driven corruption prevailed, extending all the way up to government and back down again. The old patterns changed when drugs infiltrated the Sydney markets and arrogant greed replaced the old-fashioned greed of regular gangsters. In parallel to this, society began loosening up, and traditional values of respect for authority began to erode. At a more subtle level, everywhere technology was making inroads into people\u2019s lives. The advent of portable analogue recording devices and primitive computing added a new \u201celectronic\u201d dimension to society that changed perceptions about the reliability of interpretation of events. While the full effects of this change would not be felt until the 80s, it created a tension between the old and new, and at least in one instance led to the revealing of significant misrepresentation of crime statistics by the police. Additional pressure was placed on the police due to increasing mobility and anonymity of society. Cars were becoming more affordable and younger people were becoming more independent and educated. By the late 70s, crime with \u201capparent lack of motive\u201d began competing with armed robbery and assault, which had remained relatively stable over the entire period. Perhaps because of the backlash against the Vietnam war, and the rising visibility of the younger strata of society, government saw a perceived need to grant more civil liberty rights to its marginalized citizens, leading to the abolishment of the Summary Offences Act and relaxing of consorting laws. Coupled with the foreshadowed replacement of the seniority system with the merit system, a change that was driven by a greater need for specialization within the force, this quickly led to a downward spiral in police morale. Many of the old time cops said that this was when they \u201clost the street\u201d. Nevertheless, police need to keep up with changes in society, which many understand, so evolution is inevitable, and is a process that still continues to this day.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45841763, "asset_id": 25518897, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 804092, "first_name": "Rob", "last_name": "Dielenberg", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RobDielenberg", "display_name": "Rob Dielenberg", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RobDielenberg?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/804092/275861/326202/s65_rob.dielenberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 189, "name": "Criminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36248106, "title": "Book Review: Eugenia: a true story of adversity, tragedy, crime and courage, written by Mark Tedeschi AM QC", "created_at": "2018-03-24T23:18:00.454-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36248106/Book_Review_Eugenia_a_true_story_of_adversity_tragedy_crime_and_courage_written_by_Mark_Tedeschi_AM_QC?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_36248106", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56152562, "asset_id": 36248106, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2875103, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Franks", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "RachelFranks", "display_name": "Rachel Franks", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/RachelFranks?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2875103/948516/15833348/s65_rachel.franks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 535, "name": "Criminal Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Criminal_Law-1?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 50088, "name": "Punishment and Prisons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punishment_and_Prisons?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 29045401, "title": "Reconstructing the Star Knowledge of Aboriginal Tasmanians", "created_at": "2016-10-10T02:48:17.141-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29045401/Reconstructing_the_Star_Knowledge_of_Aboriginal_Tasmanians?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_29045401", "summary": "The canopy of stars is a central presence in the daily and spiritual lives of Aboriginal Tasmanians.

Unlike the cornucopia of similarly focused groups, ESHRAA members publicly identified as ex-servicepeople, a privileged category of citizen in Australia with particular purchase on public debate. In this article I locate ESHRAA within the long tradition of Australian opposition to conscription and national service, describe how the expulsion of its leading personality from the Returned and Services League in mid-1967 contributed to perceptions of that organisation as increasingly outdated, and finally argue that it sought to refashion the hallowed Anzac tradition from the veneration of brave soldiers to equally valiant resisters. In so doing, I unearth an under-examined protest organisation during the Vietnam War, challenge the notion of a monolithic ex-services community, and complicate emerging scholarly understandings of how Anzac was re-invented in the late twentieth century.

Colonisation refers to the process whereby the British Crown made claim to these lands and then occupied them. The South Australia Act passed through the British Parliament in 1834, enabling this formal act of possession of the region. King William IV issued the Letters Patent in 1836 which defined the territory of South Australia and proclaimed it a colony. A few months later Governor John Hindmarsh arrived at Holdfast Bay to administer the colony. Until the arrival of Hindmarsh's party no Aboriginal people in the colony were aware of the decisions made on the other side of the globe that would disrupt and undermine their lives, cause high rates of illness and death and dispossess them of their lands. In this chapter I investigate how our current knowledge of Aboriginal South Australia has been formed. Our understanding of the structures of Aboriginal society is influenced by the observations of early colonists and later anthropologists, all of whom grappled with how to conceptualise and describe these Aboriginal groupings. I discuss the distribution of Aboriginal people across what was to become South Australia and how cultural, social, political and linguistic groupings were influenced by a range of factors, particularly ecology and the impact it had on availability of resources. 1 There have been two broad approaches to describing the distribution of Aboriginal people: a regional perspective influenced by ecology; and one that rigidly defines tribal groups with clearly defined territories, languages and cultures. A regional approach describes hunter-gatherers living within one of five ecological zones before the colonisation of South Australia: 3", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54868620, "asset_id": 35004336, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2527464, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Monaghan", "domain_name": "adelaide", "page_name": "PaulMonaghan", "display_name": "Paul Monaghan", "profile_url": "https://adelaide.academia.edu/PaulMonaghan?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2527464/787612/47321978/s65_paul.monaghan.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5570, "name": "Australian Indigenous languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_languages?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 279173, "name": "Australian Aboriginal Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_Languages?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1346873, "name": "Aborginal Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aborginal_Australia?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 36401669, "title": "\"Where did she spring from?\": Miss La Trobe's Colonial Connection", "created_at": "2018-04-13T10:16:34.473-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36401669/_Where_did_she_spring_from_Miss_La_Trobes_Colonial_Connection?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_36401669", "summary": "Miss La Trobe is a character from Virginia Woolf's last novel 'Between the Acts'.

As a class, assumptions are made about their character, motivations for entering the trade, and their complicity with the illegality frequently associated with recruiting. The academic literature often focuses on agency in the initial recruitment event, where shipmasters generally were not present. Popular writing concentrates on the scandals. Recruiting shipmasters are either ignored or suffer the odium associated with the trade. They are portrayed as immoral drunkards, incompetent seamen at the end of their careers, lawless adventurers, or men of inferior character. This study examines the early life and career of one notorious recruiting shipmaster, Joseph Vos, focusing in particular on his first three formative recruiting voyages. It suggests that the motivations, experiences and characters of recruiting shipmasters are more disparate and nuanced than generally portrayed. It demonstrates that the reputation of the labour trade has tended to obscure the diverse attributes of the shipmasters involved, indicating potential fruitful fields for further research.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62517899, "asset_id": 37170867, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27833140, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Clifton-Steele", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RobertCliftonSteele", "display_name": "Robert L Clifton-Steele", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RobertCliftonSteele?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27833140/20182585/19917330/s65_robert.clifton-steele.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68567, "name": "Queensland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 838079, "name": "New Hebrides", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Hebrides?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1797891, "name": "Blackbirding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blackbirding?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1853447, "name": "Pacific labour recruiting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_labour_recruiting?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2111936, "name": "Colonial history of Pacific Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_history_of_Pacific_Islands?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3384095, "name": "Royal Navy Australian Station", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Royal_Navy_Australian_Station?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 35713483, "title": "Celebrities, Culture & Cyberspace", "created_at": "2018-01-19T19:45:44.070-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35713483/Celebrities_Culture_and_Cyberspace?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35713483", "summary": "One of my 'popular front' books from the Australian culture wars of the 1990s.

My Place narrates Morgan's journey towards the recovery of personal and historic Aboriginal pasts and presents, through her own voice and those of her family. The book follows her quest to find and write of her Aboriginal identity; to voice life stories still denied a place in collective and private consciousness and conscience. Aided by once commonplace governance of denial and oppression, as indicated by a quote from archival evidence above, through My Place Morgan sought to reiterate her relative Arthur that the effects of colonialism are not \u201cover yet\u201d (above). My Place fast received critical acclaim across both national and international, and indigenous and non-indigenous audiences. Morgan's carving of a literary space across otherwise binary notions of genre, form and voice predominantly contributed to a widespread reception of, and audience for, autobiographical life writing in Australian Aboriginal experience, especially of the Stolen Generations. Often regarded as perhaps \u201cthe defining moment in Australian Aboriginal literature\u201d (Wheeler in 2013: p.5), this essay will endeavour to explore the context and effect My Place has arguably participated in realizing within contemporary Australia: regarding literature, (re)writing of histories and reconciliation processes. It will also discuss some of the diverse critiques that My Place and Aboriginal life writing in general has faced, and still continues to, both within and outside of Aboriginal critical analysis. Through attempting to understand and analyse the emerging canon of Australian Aboriginal literature, this essay will briefly review other forms and examples of relevant literature and, further, archival records in contrast to offer a side commentary of discourses surrounding this vast nascent section of Aboriginality within contemporary Australian culture. Furthermore, notions of reconciliation through literature, both descriptive and prescriptive will be briefly explored, summarising some of the critiques surrounding them.\n\nWhilst My Place and the scale of its success has been critiqued through diverse analyses of Morgan's Aboriginality, authenticity and authorship, which will be explored in this essay, the main thesis will argue that Morgan holds a valid and important place in the canon of Australian Aboriginal Literature. Further that this place must be considered within a spectrum of audiences (Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal) and of approaches to Aboriginal literatures of the canon; contributing toward complex, varied and ongoing reconciliation processes across contemporary Australia. This essay will thus support that whilst My Place holds an important space within the canon, especially of its time, indeed also many of the critiques entail credible and well-founded perspectives, participating towards the pursuit of accessible alternative agendas, contexts and outcomes all vital towards voicing and de-homogenising reconciliation for a diverse, and diversely affected, peoples.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34930723, "asset_id": 8557899, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9806857, "first_name": "Ruth", "last_name": "Bubis", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "RuthBubis", "display_name": "Ruth Bubis", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/RuthBubis?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9806857/4911994/12399344/s65_ruth.bubis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8913, "name": "Indigenous Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15514, "name": "Contemporary Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 52202, "name": "Aboriginal Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 147877, "name": "Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 150268, "name": "Postcolonial Studies and Contemporary Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies_and_Contemporary_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 209871, "name": "Sally Morgan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sally_Morgan?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 497567, "name": "Australian Aborigines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aborigines?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 25409267, "title": "(2016) Dutch seaman Dirk Hartog (1583\u20131621) and his ship Eendracht.

agitator, journalist, businessman and politician, Hugh Mahon had a varied and fascinating life. Born in Offaly, he and his\r\nfamily migrated to America in 1869, but returned to Ireland in 1880 after their American dream failed. He was active in the Land League\r\nin County Wexford which led to his arrest and imprisonment with\r\nParnell in 1881, and exile to Australia. As a crusading journalist he\r\nexposed corruption and became a thorn in the side of the Forrest\r\ngovernment in Western Australia during the 1890s. He was elected to the first Commonwealth parliament in 1901 and served in foiu* Labor\r\nministries, rising to Minister for External Affairs during the First World War. He has the distinction of being the only person expelled\r\nfi'om the Commonwealth parliament after he criticised British rule in Ireland.\r\nThis book, the first part of a two-volume biography of Mahon, spans the period fi-om his birth in 1857 to his election to parliament. Pulling\r\ntogether the many facets of Mahon's life, it reveals the forces which drove this complex man who was reviled by many for denouncing the\r\nBritish Empire while remaining a hero to those who supported self- determination for Ireland.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63058110, "asset_id": 42826033, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

Our nation\u2019s mateship character has inherited a debilitating morbidity. Unequal. Racist. Exploitative. Fearful. Historical amnesia. The great Australian silence. The rise of right-wing extremism and Trump-style identity politics. \nWe are now in denial. Lies become truths. Truth is relative. Opinion is fact. Myths are reality. Democracy is for sale, along with the environment and our basic rights. Can we change? Do we want to? \nPerhaps it is already too late. From the destruction of Aboriginal society, we now seem intent on destroying the biosphere in whole or part, a persisting Lemkinian pattern for as long as economic considerations overrule environmental and humanitarian concerns. \nWe should have expected it. The persecution and impoverishment of Aboriginal society came with a subrogated human cost. We now expect to delay the cost of climate change and transfer it to other generations. Both outcomes arise from exploitative normative behaviour, from our values.   \nTo avert an imperiling national emergency, an existential threat to our home and way of life, an impending tragedy that is self-imposed through our inability to act strategically against the worst effects of human-induced climate change, this document argues for a transformational myth, one that re-engages us with respect for the Earth, a respect that allowed Aboriginal people to live sustainably in a way to which we should all aspire, where the rights of the biosphere are protected, where Nature is not owned as property, where Aboriginal people have a treaty-recognized voice, where fundamental rights \u2013 of humans, of Nature - are set out in Australia\u2019s Constitution as a Bill of Rights, a positive and more substantial  foundation for our rule-based order. \nAboriginal people were right: The Earth is our Mother and we are her children, for now and all the generations to come. Unless we dishonor her. We can become scavengers or builders.

No doubt the fighting in North Africa was marked by\r\nacts of generosity and humanity towards the enemy. However, this is only one\r\nside of the coin. As I will show on the basis of new archival findings in seven\r\ncountries and a critical reassessment of the existing literature, in the shadow of\r\nEl Alamein, both sides committed serious atrocities against enemy soldiers and\r\ncivilians. While it is certainly true that the level of violence was lower than in\r\nEastern Europe, the North African Campaign was anything but a war without\r\nhate. There were numerous intentional crimes and infringements of the rules of\r\nconduct, including the ill- treatment and murder of captured enemy soldiers; the\r\nplunder of the indigenous population; the rape of local women; as well as the\r\nexploitation, murder, and mass detainment in concentration camps of Arabs,\r\nBerbers, and Jews, which was often motivated by racial and anti-Semitic hatred.\r\nThus, the Desert War has to be recontextualized and put into the larger historical\r\nframeworks that shaped WWII and, more broadly, the first half of the 20th\r\ncentury. Conceptually, I reconnect the North African Campaign to the overarching\r\npolicies and prevailing ideologies of both the Axis and Allied regimes and\r\ntheir societies. In particular, I show that much of the war violence that we see in\r\nNorth Africa resulted from two major factors: the colonial context in which the\r\nfighting took place, and the simple yet too often ignored fact that on the Axis side\r\nthe war was waged by fascist regimes that shared the violent vision of creating\r\nracially pure societies. Thus, the Desert War has to be seen for what it actually\r\nwas: an integral part of the World War II experience which itself was inextricably\r\nlinked to the Axis powers\u2019 imperial drive for \u201cliving space\u201d and their murderous\r\nbiopolitics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61064266, "asset_id": 24274105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

This thesis uses evidence from the archives of the party and other primary and secondary sources to describe this educational work, to assess its educational value in its own right, and to identify the impact it had on the official or mainstream tradition of liberal adult education. It represents the first attempt in Australia to retrieve knowledge of the CPA as an educational body; and it also attempts an interpretation of that history which throws some light on the nature of adult education. The CPA\u2019s educational work, I argue, posed questions about adult education\u2019s contradictory relationship to society which were rarely addressed by those in the mainstream liberal tradition, questions raised long before in an elliptic sentence by Karl Marx in the Theses on Feuerbach - who shall educate the educator? The CPA was never free of the characteristics it opposed in others, and it had specific problems of its own. However, for as long as those in the mainstream simply dismissed communist educational work as propaganda or indoctrination, their theories of the nature of adult education avoided the very issues the communists tried to address, and which remain unresolved in contemporary adult education theory. The historical evidence is thus located within an extended theoretical argument regarding the nature of adult education in contemporary society, in particular its relationship with social movements, to produce both a new reading of the history of adult education in Australia, and a contribution to current international debates on the history and theory of the field.

its biggest national celebration yet: that of the Bicentenary of the arrival of the first European settlers. The Australian Bicentenary can be seen as a media event, which is defined as a construct, rather than a representation of the social order (Couldry 56) and, as such, this generated an interesting conflict between the many different, sometimes contrasting, versions of Australian history to be presented as official. The controversy was mainly centred on the representation of Aborigines, ethnic minorities and, to a certain degree, the involvement of women throughout history which, in turn, exposed the fragility of historical narratives as truth and fact. Academic historians were well aware of the necessity to reorient the historiographic process since the so-called poststructural turn, but as these debates were strongly connected to the Bicentenary, this was arguably the first time that the Australian public was made aware of them. An interesting consequence of the shift of these debates from academia to society was the massive increase in the writing and publication of historical fiction. Novelists became key figures in the process of reassessing and reconstructing Australian history, demonstrating, thus, the fluidity of the boundaries between history and fiction. This thesis examines the many ways in which historical fiction was used to question and undermine the \u201clegend\u201d form of Australian national identity (as defined, primarily, by Russel Ward) as creator and holder of history, how this dynamic connects with the political project of the Labor government of the 1980s in its attempt to promote historic heteroglossia and social polyphony in the continent, and how the Bicentenary acted as an important catalyst for these debates. Chapter One provides a context of the political and institutional making of the Bicentenary from the creation of the Australian Bicentennial Authority in 1979, also looking at the historical and broader literary projects associated with it. Chapter Two examines in more detail the changes in the discipline of history (from constructionist to reconstructionist to deconstructionist modes of historiography) and the postmodern influence of metafictional historiography. The following chapters are analytical and examine the many ways in which the classical notion of Australian identity was questioned by novelists. Chapter Three focuses on the rise and influence of second-wave feminism in history and historical fiction. Chapter Four deals with the displacement of manliness from the defining centre of identity. Chapter Five looks at the notion of Aboriginality and how it was being defined and redefined in the 1980s. Chapter Six examines the rise of ethnic literatures in the early stages of Australian multiculturalism. The conclusion briefly looks at how these debates about the boundaries between history and fiction have changed in the 1990s and 2000s, paying particular attention to the contemporary resurgence of these debates seen since the publication of The Secret River in 2005.

From 1914 Camden district women joined local Red Cross branches and their affiliates in the towns and villages around the colonial estate of the Macarthur family at Camden Park. They sewed, knitted and cooked for God, King and Country throughout the First and Second World Wars, and during the years in-between. They ran stalls and raffles, and received considerable community support through cash donations from individuals and community organisations for Red Cross activities.\n\nUsing the themes of soldier and civilian welfare, patriotism, duty, sacrifice, motherhood, class and religion, the narrative explores how the placed-based nature of the Red Cross branch network provided an opportunity for the organisation to harness parochialism and localism for national patriotic purposes. The work shows how a local study links the Camden district Red Cross with the broader issues within Australian history and debates involving local history, philanthropy, feminism, conservatism, religion and other areas, while at the same time illustrating the multi-layered nature of the issues that shape global, national and regional history that can impact rural volunteering.\n\nThe book delves into the story of how Camden\u2019s Edwardian women, the Macarthur Onslows and others of their ilk, provided leadership at a local, state and national level and created ground-breaking opportunities that empowered women to exercise their agency by undertaking patriotic activities for the first time. In their wake Camden women created the most important voluntary organisation in district history, a small part of the narrative of the Australian Red Cross, arguably the country\u2019s most important not-for-profit organisation. Their stories were the essence of place, and the success of the district branches meant that over time home front volunteering became synonymous with the Red Cross.\n\nMinistering Angels is a local Red Cross study of volunteering in war and peace that provides a small window into the national and transnational perspectives of one of the world\u2019s most important humanitarian organisations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61650315, "asset_id": 41478013, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4533674, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Willis", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IanWillis", "display_name": "Ian Willis", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IanWillis?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4533674/4171393/4858177/s65_ian.willis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3438, "name": "Local Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4156, "name": "Local History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19596, "name": "Philanthropy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philanthropy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20180, "name": "Volunteerism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Volunteerism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 53396, "name": "Local and regional history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_and_regional_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 62235, "name": "Tuberculosis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tuberculosis?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 99257, "name": "Volunteering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Volunteering?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 116694, "name": "Red Cross", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Red_Cross?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 260470, "name": "International Volunteering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Volunteering?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 443364, "name": "Regional History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 447306, "name": "Convalescence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convalescence?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 602874, "name": "History of Voluntary Associations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Voluntary_Associations?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 849084, "name": "History of the Red Cross", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Red_Cross?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1288362, "name": "Womens History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History-22?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2565072, "name": "Australian Red Cross", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Red_Cross?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3504478, "name": "British Red Cross", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Red_Cross?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 37221079, "title": "THE CARNIVAL OF BLOOD IN AUSTRALIAN MANDATED TERRITORY.

However, in post-war reappraisals of the war crimes trials, the voice of those slain in unlawful killings in the Pacific theatre has remained silent.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57171915, "asset_id": 37221079, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5137325, "first_name": "Brenton", "last_name": "Brooks", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BBrooks1", "display_name": "Brenton J Brooks", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BBrooks1?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19087, "name": "Military and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_and_Politics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42242345, "title": "The Painter's Tongue \u2013 The Eighties:1981 \u2013 The Life of an Artist", "created_at": "2020-03-17T08:09:31.586-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42242345/The_Painters_Tongue_The_Eighties_1981_The_Life_of_an_Artist?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_42242345", "summary": "The Painter's Tongue (The Life of an Artist) \u2013 1981 \r\nIntroduction by Dr. Ashley Crawford\r\nThis is the second volume of a 10 Volume account of the life of one Australian artist during the Eighties.\r\n'A Searingly honest, warts and all, account of the life of one Australian artist working in the turbulent Eighties ...

These two aims are not unrelated to one another. As will become apparent in the text, one of the major themes that emerges from the description I give of the main positions which have been taken on this matter is the intimate connection that exists between the ideas that we have and the sort of life that Aborigines were forced to live.\nThis book examines the issues of identity, aboriginality and a sense of belongingness from the viewpoints of three autobiographies, proposing a new model of creating a new discursive space within the dominant discursive space. It critically discusses the Australian Aboriginal model\u2015a new epistemological terrain\u2015which would become an emancipatory dialogue of discourse, having potentiality to bring transformation in Australian Aboriginal Community.

Diemen\u2019s Land in 1803, to the cessation of convict transportation in 1853, over 69,000 male and female convicts were dumped on the colony\u2019s shores. At any one time, thousands of convicts were incarcerated or laboured across the length and breadth of the colony. Of these, it was inevitable that a certain number died whilst still under sentence.

Popular throughout the world, they were ostensibly elegant shopping spaces for a genteel middle-class clientele. Such was the enthusiasm for them in Australia that both Sydney and Melbourne possessed arcades in a quantity that rivalled many other international cities. Today only a few of these spaces survive. The best-known examples, restored to an approximation of their original form, have become iconic heritage sites that are drawcards for both locals and tourists. Marketing campaigns and tourist brochures invite shoppers to step back in time and encounter the bourgeois elegance of Australia\u2019s retail past. But these often idealised and simplified interpretations elide the far more diverse, complex, multilayered and sometimes uneasy histories of these sites. \n\nArcades were not static spaces, forever caught in the nineteenth century, nor simply bourgeois shopping malls. Rather, they were significant social spaces that housed a variety of businesses and attracted patrons from all walks of life and underwent diverse historical trajectories.

In the second half of the nineteenth century, Manifest Destiny featured prominently in editorial discussion on a variety of Australian issues. This article will trace the way that the American notion of Manifest Destiny proved extremely useful to those interested in Australian expansionism. Through an investigation of editorial comment of public addresses, it can be seen that Manifest Destiny was invoked in Australia in relation to the marginalisation of the Aboriginal population, along with the debates over federation and expansion into the Pacific Islands and New Guinea. Tracing the utility of an American concept such as Manifest Destiny in its Australian context complicates the story of Australia's nation-building project, as it interacted with the position of Australia within the British Empire. As a result, it becomes possible to gain a stronger understanding of the forces driving Australian attitudes towards its own expansion in the period leading up to federation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47739401, "asset_id": 24956521, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4913807, "first_name": "Nicholas", "last_name": "Ferns", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "NicholasFerns", "display_name": "Nicholas Ferns", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/NicholasFerns?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4913807/2117897/2487918/s65_nick.ferns.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32671, "name": "Pacific History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 198956, "name": "Manifest Destiny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manifest_Destiny?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 33285835, "title": "Gallipoli, Anzacs and the Great War", "created_at": "2017-06-01T01:11:20.619-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33285835/Gallipoli_Anzacs_and_the_Great_War?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_33285835", "summary": "This book covers the long history of the Gallipoli peninsula and surrounding landscape.

Now you can follow them too.\r\n\r\nFollowing Burke and Wills Across Australia guides you on a road trip that follows one of history\u2019s great transcontinental journeys, sharing the explorers\u2019 experiences on the way. Maps lay out a route that takes you as close as possible to the Expedition\u2019s track. As you travel the outback roads, you can learn all the details of the day to day journey of the Expedition from the explorers\u2019 own words, and compare what you see with their descriptions of the country in 1860\u201361. Each chapter provides information about what to see now: the location and descriptions of the markers and memorials placed along the route over the 150 years since the Expedition, and places where you can stand where the explorers stood and look out over prospects they drew and described.\r\n\r\nThe book is a perfect companion for those wanting to see outback Australia, and at the same time understand a journey that has attained mythic status in the history of Australian exploration. Even if you want to follow only part of the track, this is the book for you.\r\n-----\r\nFoR Codes: 21 HISTORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY > 2103 Historical Studies > 210303 Australian History (excl Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander History) @ 100%\r\n-----\r\nSEO Codes: 95 CULTURAL UNDERSTANDING > 9505 Understanding Past Societies > 950503 Understanding Australias Past @ 100%", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65025185, "asset_id": 33396793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 64425345, "first_name": "Dr Dave", "last_name": "Phoenix", "domain_name": "jamescook", "page_name": "DPhoenix", "display_name": "Dr Dave Phoenix", "profile_url": "https://jamescook.academia.edu/DPhoenix?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/64425345/16743202/73154976/s65_dr_dave.phoenix.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1082, "name": "Travel Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel_Writing?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35486370, "title": "MAKALAH GEOGRAFI REGIONAL II TENTANG NEGARA AUSTRALIA MENURUT TEORI DEBLIJ", "created_at": "2017-12-21T07:34:38.590-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35486370/MAKALAH_GEOGRAFI_REGIONAL_II_TENTANG_NEGARA_AUSTRALIA_MENURUT_TEORI_DEBLIJ?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35486370", "summary": "Benua Australia terletak di belahan bumi selatan, secara astronomis berada pada posisi 9\u2019LS-45\u2019 LS dan 113\u2019BT-154\u2019BT.

It examines the processes and practices that constituted the analysis, movement and use of the enormous amount of information produced by British explorations and surveys of the Australian continent. The study focuses on the period between 1829-1863, when the interior of the continent was explored and settlements expanded at a rapid rate. The study focuses on the roles of the following actors in Great Britain and the Australian colonies: The Colonial Office, official establishments overseen by governors in the colonies, the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) and the cartographer John Arrowsmith (1790\u20131873). The material examined consists of the official correspondence between the Colonial Office and the governors of the colonies, and other correspondence, printed material, and manuscript and printed maps that were prepared in the Australian colonies and in Great Britain by different actors.\nThe research is conducted by investigating the processes of knowledge-making with methodological tools used in the history of knowledge and processual map history. These include the analytical tool of \u2018circulation\u2019 and examining the processes that constituted the production, movement and use of maps. In practice, the study is conducted by (1) examining the manuscript material (maps, texts) alongside the printed and published material and (2) by examining the material relating to their circulation and use, such as minutes, annotations and marginalia.\nIn sum, the research findings demonstrate how the snippets of information produced by different individuals gained the power to define the continent by being circulated. These developments, which took place in the mid-nineteenth century, were rooted in the social processes that occurred in different, interconnected locations. The main findings and implications of this study include: (1) The production of British geographies of Australia was a spatio-temporal process, as the location of knowledge-work and the pace at which material became available in different locations influenced the type of knowledge formed by the actors; (2) Geographical knowledge of Australia was achieved through chains of knowledge brokers in different locations. Pieces of information were mediated and transformed in the hands of numerous different actors into geographical knowledge; (3) Intertextuality and multi-modality contributed to the production of geographical knowledge, whereby maps and text had co-constitutive roles in the process; (4) John Arrowsmith was a key individual in the process of mapping Australia. This was due to his strong relationship with the Colonial Office, the RGS and Australian explorers; (5) The processual approach is productive when studying the history of knowledge and this work encourages the use of archival material in order to examine the processes of knowledge-making. This study encourages the further application of this method, especially in relation to studies aiming to understand how knowledge was formed and how structures of knowledge were established in different locations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55131988, "asset_id": 35271084, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2822796, "first_name": "Johanna", "last_name": "Skurnik", "domain_name": "helsinki", "page_name": "JohannaSkurnik", "display_name": "Johanna Skurnik", "profile_url": "https://helsinki.academia.edu/JohannaSkurnik?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2822796/922916/19323534/s65_johanna.skurnik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6878, "name": "History of Cartography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cartography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13237, "name": "History of Geographic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Geographic_Thought?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 29901, "name": "History of geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_geography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 32496, "name": "History of knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_knowledge?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35165, "name": "History of the British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_British_Empire?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 30121047, "title": "GARIS BESAR KOLONISASI INGGRIS DI AUSTRALIA", "created_at": "2016-11-27T17:54:44.319-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30121047/GARIS_BESAR_KOLONISASI_INGGRIS_DI_AUSTRALIA?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_30121047", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50581888, "asset_id": 30121047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57311741, "first_name": "Bagus", "last_name": "Setiawan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BagusSetiawan134", "display_name": "Bagus Setiawan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BagusSetiawan134?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57311741/15043181/15770754/s65_bagus.setiawan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9953325, "title": "Cui bono?

Forged by influential individuals and impacting on global events including the Japanese Peace Treaty, the Korean War and the Suez Crisis, the ANZUS Alliance was a crucial factor in the seismic changes that took place in the second half of the twentieth century.\n\nIn this compact and accessible study, Andrew Kelly lays out the tensions that underpinned the formation of the Alliance, as each power sought to extract maximum influence and prestige. He examines how the ANZUS powers worked together (or failed to do so) when responding to massive global events including the rise of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the waning of the British Empire. Kelly comprehensively explores the reasons why Australia and New Zealand disagreed so regularly about mutual security issues, how US global leadership shaped ANZUS, and the British impact on the trilateral relationship, and outlines how these issues set the foundations for today\u2019s world order.\n\nANZUS and the Early Cold War is essential reading for historians of Australian, New Zealand and American international relations in the twentieth century. Its concise format and readable style will also appeal to general readers interested in the history and foreign policies of these nations, and to anyone who wants to know more about the individual and geopolitical tensions that beset any major alliance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61668693, "asset_id": 37373552, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 539568, "first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Kelly", "domain_name": "edithcowan", "page_name": "AndrewKelly", "display_name": "Andrew  Kelly", "profile_url": "https://edithcowan.academia.edu/AndrewKelly?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/539568/193509/33218756/s65_andrew.kelly.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1931, "name": "New Zealand Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Zealand_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 5214, "name": "Cold War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 116108, "name": "New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Zealand?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 571832, "name": "ANZUS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ANZUS?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 40908662, "title": "The accidental explorer: unknown and underrated exploration of the Sunshine Coast/Cooloola Region, 1827-1860", "created_at": "2019-11-12T15:35:43.740-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40908662/The_accidental_explorer_unknown_and_underrated_exploration_of_the_Sunshine_Coast_Cooloola_Region_1827_1860?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_40908662", "summary": "Some of Australia's earliest or more 'fine grained' European exploration was conducted by runaways, whalers and other persons.

They set Captain William Bligh and his loyal crew adrift, took twelve Tahitian women and six Tahitian men captive, and eventually settled on Pitcairn Island, a remote volcanic isle in the Southern Pacific. Their descendants still live both there and on Norfolk Island, to which many of them migrated in 1856. My dissertation follows the making of these islands into sites for the production of knowledge about race, language, national identity, and colonial governance. Writers and researchers came to construe the islanders as near-perfect research subjects, describing their home islands as \u201caccidental experiments\u201d and \u201cnatural laboratories.\u201d However, that metaphor elided the intentional and careful construction of both islands as exemplary, insular, and experimental spaces. During the nineteenth century, moralists, missionaries and evangelical authors made the islands into object lessons in Victorian and Anglican virtue. The migration to Norfolk Island in 1856 was authored by colonial administrators as a morally freighted \u201cexperiment\u201d in colonial settlement and racial destiny\u2014an experiment that bureaucrats later termed a dysgenic failure after a series of on-the-ground investigations. Stepping into field spaces engendered by that long history of observation and scrutiny, twentieth-century social scientists measured, interviewed, and recorded Pitcairn Islanders in order to define the boundaries of race and language.

By comparison, language revival movements in Australia are in their infancy. This article provides comparative insights and makes information about the Hebrew revival accessible to Australian linguists and Aboriginal revival activists. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the first stage of any desire by professional linguists to assist in language reawakening must involve a long period of thoroughly observing, carefully listening to the people, learning, mapping and characterizing the specific indigenous community. Only then can one inspire and assist. That said, this article proposes that there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would be useful to endangered languages in general and to Aboriginal linguistic revival in particular. \r\n\r\nThis article contributes towards the establishment of Revival Linguistics, a new linguistic discipline and paradigm. Zuckermann`s term Revival Linguistics is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics' (<language contact). Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: Revival Linguistics, Language Revival, Aboriginal Studies, Hebrew, Social Empowerment, Hybridity and Multiple Causation, Purism versus Compromise, Language and Identity, Contact Linguistics, Yiddish, Aboriginal English, Anthropological Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Language Endangerment, Resilience Linguistics, Revitalization, Renewal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDedicated to Professor Michael Clyne z\"l\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICLE\r\n\r\n\"I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.

'Language is power; let us have ours', wrote Aboriginal politician Aden Ridgeway on 26 November 2009 in the Sydney Morning Herald. Previous revival efforts have largely failed (for obvious reasons, we are not going to single out specific failures here). While there have been some good results from several projects since 1992 (e.g. Kaurna, see below), Aboriginal people overall do not see as many positive outcomes from revival programmes as they would like. In large part this is the result of shortage of sufficient (continuity of) funding, lack of technical expertise, and lack of integration of school-based programmes with community language programmes. However, there are purely linguistic reasons too: Many revival efforts were not supported by a sound theoretical understanding of how successful language revival works. As pointed out by Thieberger (2002), decisions about the appropriate target for language maintenance programmes are too often driven by structural linguistics, where the supposed ideal is intergenerational transmission of the language with all its original structural complexity retained, thus creating unrealistic expectations among the Aboriginal community. \r\n\t\r\nThis article is the first of its kind as it will innovatively draw crucial insights from 'Modern Hebrew' (henceforth, Israeli \u2013 see Zuckermann 1999), so far the most successful known reclamation attempt of a sleeping tongue. Zuckermann's (2008a, 2009, 2010, 2011) research on Israeli demonstrates which language components are more revivable than others. Words and conjugations, for example, are easier to revitalize than intonation, discourse, associations and connotations. We should encourage revivalists and Aboriginal leaders to be realistic rather than puristic, and not to chastise English loanwords and pronunciation, for example, within the emergent language. Applying such precious conclusions from Hebrew will closely assist Australian revivalists in being more efficient, urging them not to waste time and resources on Sisyphean efforts to resuscitate linguistic components that are unlikely to be revivable.\r\n\t\r\nWhile the results the endeavors we are proposing here have considerable value as a research enterprise, one can also consider them in terms of a cost-benefit analysis (M\u00fchlh\u00e4usler and Damania 2004, Walsh 2008): Language revitalization contributes to social reconciliation, cultural tourism (Clark and Kostanski 2005), capacity building, and improved community health for Indigenous peoples (Walsh forthcoming B). In the process of language revival, some Aboriginal people will go from being dysfunctional (cf. Sutton 2009) to well-balanced, positive people. The benefits to the wider community and to Australian society are immense.\r\n\r\nReversing language shift (RLS) (Fishman 1991, 2001, Hag\u00e8ge 2009, Evans 2010, Walsh 2005a, Zuckermann 2011) is thus of great social benefit. Language revival does not only do historical justice and address inequality but can also result in the empowerment of people who have lost their heritage and purpose in life. \r\n\t\r\nSome Aboriginal people distinguish between usership and ownership. There are even those who claim that they own a language although they only know one single word of it: its name. Consequently, some Indigenous Australians do not find it important to revive their comatose tongue. We, on the other hand, have always believed in Australia\u2019s very own roadside dictum: \u2018Stop, revive, survive!'\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground: The Hebrew Revival\r\n\r\nI suppose the process of acceptance will pass through the usual four stages: 1. This is worthless nonsense. 2. This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view. 3. This is true, but quite unimportant. 4. I always said so. (Haldane 1963: 464)\r\n\r\n'Hebrew' is the most quoted example of a successful language revival. On the other hand, if we are to be brutally truthful with ourselves, the modern-day vernacular spoken in downtown Tel Aviv is a very different language \u2013 both typologically and genetically \u2013 to that of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) or of the Mishnah, the first major redaction of Jewish oral traditions.\r\n\t\r\nHebrew was spoken since approximately the 14th century BC. It belonged to the Canaanite division of the northwestern branch of the Semitic languages, which constitute a branch of the Afro-Asiatic language family. Following a gradual decline, it ceased to be spoken by the second century AD. The failed Bar-Kokhba Revolt against the Romans in Judea in 132-5 AD marks the symbolic end of the period of spoken Hebrew. We believe that the Mishnah was codified around 200 AD because Hebrew was then dying as a mother tongue. Rabbi Judah haNasi and his collaborators might have realized that if they did not act then to redact the oral tradition, it would soon have been too late because Jews were already speaking languages other than Hebrew. (In fact, the Gemara, the other component of the Babylonian Talmud, which was codified around 500 AD, was written in Aramaic rather than in Hebrew.)\r\n\t\r\nFor approximately 1,750 years thereafter, Hebrew was \u2018clinically dead\u2019. A most important liturgical and literary language, it occasionally served as a lingua franca \u2013 a means of communication between people who do not share a mother tongue \u2013 for Jews of the Diaspora, but not as a native language.\r\n\t\r\nFascinating and multifaceted Israeli, which emerged in Palestine (Eretz Israel) at the end of the nineteenth century, possesses distinctive socio-historical characteristics such as the lack of a continuous chain of native speakers from spoken Hebrew to Israeli, the non-Semitic mother tongues spoken by the Hebrew revivalists, and the European impact on literary Hebrew. Consequently, it presents the linguist with a unique laboratory in which to examine a wider set of theoretical problems concerning language genesis, social issues like language, identity and politics, and important practical matters, such as whether it is possible to revive a no-longer spoken language.\r\n\r\nThe genetic classification of Israeli has preoccupied scholars since its genesis. The still regnant traditional thesis suggests that Israeli is Semitic: Hebrew revived. The revisionist antithesis defines Israeli as Indo-European: Yiddish relexified; that is, Yiddish, the revivalists\u2019 mother tongue, is the 'substratum', whilst Hebrew is the 'superstratum' providing the vocabulary (cf. Horvath and Wexler 1997). According to Zuckermann's mosaic (rather than Mosaic) synthesis, Israeli is not only multi-layered but also multi-parental. A Semito-European, or Eurasian, hybrid, Israeli is both Semitic (Afro-Asiatic) and (Indo-) European. It is based simultaneously on 'sleeping beauty' / 'walking dead' Hebrew and 'm\u00e1me l\u00f3shn' (mother tongue) Yiddish, which are both primary contributors to Israeli, and a plethora of other tongues spoken by Jewish pioneers in Palestine in the 1880s\u20131930s, e.g. Russian, Polish, Arabic, Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Turkish, German, French and English.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Success Rate of the Hebrew Revival\r\n\r\nThe vernacularization of Hebrew was partially a success and partially a failure. It is hard to provide an exact quantification for such a multi-variable enterprise, but we would roughly estimate that on a 1-10 scale, 10 being a complete success and one being a complete failure, the Hebrew revival is at seven. More specifically, we propose the following continuum approximations for the extent to which Israeli can be considered Hebrew: mindset/spirit: 1 (i.e. European); discourse (communicative tools, speech acts): 1; sounds (phonetics and phonology): 2; semantics (meaning, associations, connotations, semantic networkings): 3; constituent/word order (syntax): 4; general vocabulary: 5; word formation: 7; verbal conjugations: 9; and basic vocabulary: 10 (i.e. Hebrew).\r\n\t\r\nThe factors leading to the partial failure of the Hebrew revival have little to do with a lack of motivation or zealousness, or with economic or political variables \u2013 not even with the fact that the revivalists, such as the symbolic father of Israeli, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda (born Perelman, 1858-1922), were not as linguistically sophisticated as contemporary linguists. It is simply the case that one cannot negate one\u2019s most recent roots, be they cultural or linguistic, even if one is keen to deny one\u2019s parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 heritage (diasporic Yiddish) in search of cultural antiquity (Biblical Hebrew). It is therefore most unlikely to revive a clinically-dead language without cross-fertilization from the revivalists\u2019 mother tongue(s). Thus, when most native Israeli-speakers speak Israeli, their intonation is much more similar to that of Yiddish, the mother tongue of most revivalists, than to that of Arabic or any other Semitic language. It is high time to acknowledge that Israeli is very different from ancient Hebrew. We should embrace \u2013 rather than chastise \u2013 the multisourcedness of Israeli.\r\n\r\nThat said, the Hebrew revival cannot be considered a failure because without the zealous, obsessive, enthusiastic efforts of Ben-Yehuda and of teachers, writers, poets, journalists, intellectuals, social activists, political figures, linguists and others, Israelis would have spoken a language (such as English, German, Arabic or Yiddish) that could hardly be considered Hebrew. To call such a hypothetical language 'Hebrew' would have not only been misleading but also wrong. To call today\u2019s Israeli 'Hebrew' may be puristic but not wrong: Hybridic Israeli is based on Hebrew as much as it is based on Yiddish. So, although the revivalists could not avoid the subconscious influence of their mother tongue(s), they did indeed manage at the same time to consciously revive important components of Hebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nHybridity, Camouflage and the Congruence Principle\r\n\r\nIsraeli is a new hybrid language rather than an evolutionary phase of Hebrew. Yiddish is not a 'foreign language' vis-\u00e0-vis Israeli, and the word intu\u00edtsya 'intuition' \u2013 to give but one example out of thousands of alleged loan words \u2013 is not a loan word (from Yiddish intu\u00edtsye, Russian intu\u00edtsiya, Polish intuicja etc., all meaning 'intuition') but rather an integral part of Israeli from its very beginning.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Congruence Principle, the more revivalists speak contributing languages with a specific linguistic feature, the more likely this feature is to prevail in the emergent language. Based on feature pool statistics, this principle weakens August Schleicher\u2019s famous Family Tree theory in historical linguistics, which may give the wrong impression that every language has only one parent. For example, most revivalists spoke languages, mainly Yiddish, that lacked that Semitic pharyngeal gulp \u2018ayin (represented, for instance, by the apostrophe in Zuckermann's Christian \u2013 actually Jewish \u2013 name Ghil\u2018ad). Naturally, their children \u2013 the ones who, in fact, shaped the real character of Israeli \u2013 could not buy the argument 'do as I say, don\u2019t do as I do!' The result is that most Israelis do not have this sound in their speech.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, m\u00e1 nishm\u00e0, the common Israeli 'what\u2019s up?' greeting, looks like a calque \u2013 loan translation \u2013 of the Yiddish phrase vos h\u00e9rt zikh, usually pronounced vs\u00e9rtsekh and literally meaning 'what\u2019s heard?' but functioning as a common greeting. However, a Romanian-speaking immigrant to Israel might have used m\u00e1 nishm\u00e0 because of Romanian ce se aude, a Polish-speaker Jew because of Polish co s\u0142ycha\u0107, and a Russian-speaker \u0427\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u043d\u043e chto slyshno, all meaning the same and functioning in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between forms and patterns is crucial here as it demonstrates multiple causation. In the 1920s and 1930s, gdud megin\u00e9y hasaf\u00e1, 'the language defendants regiment' (cf. Shur 2000), whose motto was ivr\u00ed, dab\u00e9r ivr\u00edt 'Hebrew [i.e. Jew], speak Hebrew,' used to tear down signs written in 'foreign' languages and disturb Yiddish theatre gatherings. However, the members of this group only looked for Yiddish forms, rather than patterns in the speech of the Israelis who did choose to speak 'Hebrew.' The language defendants would thus not attack an Israeli speaker saying m\u00e1 nishm\u00e0. Ironically, even the language defendants regiment's anthem included calques from Yiddish.\r\n\r\nZuckermann (2011, forthcoming) analyzes the hitherto-overlooked camouflaged semantic networking transferred from one language to another. Whereas mechanisms as calques (loan translations such as superman, from German \u00dcbermensch), phono-semantic matches (e.g. crayfish, from Old French crevice, a cognate of crab that has little to do with fish) (Zuckermann 2003) and portmanteau blends (e.g. motel, from motor+hotel, or sprummer, from spring+summer) have been studied, there is a need to uncover concealed semantic links between words in the Target Language which reflect \u2013 often subconsciously \u2013 semantic networking in the Source Language. Consider the Israeli word gakhlil\u00edt 'firefly, glow-worm' \u2013 coined by poet laureate Hayyim Nahman Bialik (1873-1934). This word is semantically and etymologically linked to the Biblical Hebrew word ga\u0127elet 'burning coal, glowing ember.' Morphologically, Israeli gakhlil\u00edt derives from Hebrew ga\u0127elet plus the reduplication of its third radical [l]. However, no Israeli dictionary reveals the crucial semantic networking aspect, namely that the Israeli concoction, gakhlil\u00edt, in using an element associated with 'glow,' in fact replicates a European mindset, apparent for example in the Yiddish word gliv\u00f3rem, literally 'glow' (cf. ga\u0127elet) + 'worm', or in German Gl\u00fchw\u00fcrmchen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNative Israeli Speech and the Academy of the Hebrew Language\r\n\r\nSince its conception, Israeli has been the subject of purism (the dislike of foreign words \u2013 as in Icelandic: Sapir and Zuckermann 2008) and the enforcement of 'correct' pronunciation. Brought into being by legislation in 1953 as the supreme institute for 'Hebrew', the Academy of the Hebrew Language (known in Israeli as haakademya lalash\u00f3n haivr\u00edt) is funded by Israel's Ministry of Education. It superseded the (Hebrew) Language Council (v\u00e1ad halash\u00f3n (haivr\u00edt)), which was established in 1889 \u2013 as a branch of Saf\u00e1 Brur\u00e1 (Clear Language) \u2013 by Ben-Yehuda and colleagues. As defined in its constitution, the Academy's functions are: (1) To investigate and compile the Hebrew lexicon according to its historical strata and layers; (2) To study the structure, history, and offshoots of the Hebrew language; and (3) To direct the development of Hebrew in light of its nature, requirements, and potential, its daily and academic needs, by setting its lexicon, grammar, characters, orthography and transliteration [in fact, transcription].\r\n\r\nThe first goal is most useful, as Israeli is indeed a multi-layered language. For example, one could say both (a) khashkh\u00fa en\u00e1v, literally 'His eyes became dark,' meaning 'He saw black' (\u2018black\u2019 in this context meaning \u2018bad news\u2019), and (b) niy\u00e1/naas\u00e1 lo kh\u00f3shekh baen\u00e1im, meaning the same, albeit structurally different. While khashkh\u00fa en\u00e1v is Hebrew, niy\u00e1 lo kh\u00f3shekh baen\u00e1im is a calque of the Yiddish phrase siz im gev\u00f3rn f\u00edntster in di \u00f3ygn, which might in turn be an adaptation of the very Hebrew khashkh\u00fa en\u00e1v (transcribed here in its Israeli form, which would have been unintelligible for an ancient Hebrew-speaker).\r\n\r\nIsraeli has many other minimal pairs, such as as\u00e1 din leatsm\u00f3 and lak\u00e1kh et hakh\u00f3k layad\u00e1im, both referring to a person violating the law, with the latter being more colloquial; as well as lel\u00f3t kayam\u00edm, literally 'nights as days' (also yam\u00edm kelel\u00f3t, literally 'days as nights'), and misav\u00edv lasha\u00f3n, literally 'round the clock,' both often referring to hard work.\r\n\r\nSomewhat resembling the 'catastrophic success' of the 1928-1936 Turkish Language Revolution (see Lewis 1999), many referents have several Israeli signifiers, one of which is puristically Hebrew and the other, often more commonly used, 'foreign' (in fact, Israeli ab initio). These include many internationalisms such as opoz\u00edtsya 'Opposition' (according to the Academy, the word should be negd\u00e1 \u2013 cf. Hebrew n\u00e9ged 'against') and koal\u00edtsya 'Coalition' (according to the Academy: yakhd\u00e1 \u2013 cf. Hebrew ya\u0127ad 'together').\r\n\r\nHowever, goal (3), to direct the development of Hebrew in light of its nature, is oxymoronic (cf. Zuckermann 2008b: 139). If the nature of a language is to evolve in a specific direction (cf. Sapir's 'drift,' the pattern of change in which the structure of a language shifts in a determinate direction), why direct its evolution by language policing?\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Promised Land to the \u2018Lucky\u2019 Country \r\n\r\nThe three principles of linguistic revival and survival: \r\n(1) If your language is endangered --> Do not allow it to \r\n die! \r\n(2) If your language died --> Stop, revive, survive!\r\n(3) If you revive your language --> Embrace the \r\n hybridity of the emergent language!\r\n\r\nQuestions of this kind, albeit in an implicit and sometimes confused fashion, are being raised within the context of Australian Aboriginal languages. Current language revival activities are worthy but often under-theorized. The tendency has been to attempt to revive the language en masse despite what has been indicated about the Hebrew rate of success for take up of particular components of language. There is a need to examine a range of existing language revitalization programmes with a view to assessing the rate of success for take up of particular components of language and at the same time adduce the preferences (and sometimes the prejudices) of the group in question (cf. Couzens and Eira forthcoming).\r\n\t\r\nIndigenous Australians have been living in Australia for more than 40,000 years. Today Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders make up 2.6% of Australia's population. Unfortunately, one of the main findings of the most recent National Indigenous Languages Survey Report (2005) was that the situation of Australia\u2019s languages is grave (in both senses). Of an original number of over 250 known Australian Indigenous languages, only about 145 Indigenous languages are still spoken and the vast majority of these, about 110, are critically endangered: they are spoken only by small groups of people, mostly over 40 years old. Eighteen languages are strong in the sense of being spoken by all age groups, but three or four of these are showing some disturbing signs of moving into endangerment. So of an original number of over 250 known Australian Indigenous languages, only 6% (i.e. 15) are in a healthy condition.\r\n\t\r\nAboriginal language revival began recently \u2013 from the late 1970s (Amery and Gale 2007) \u2013 and has therefore much to learn from other revival efforts, especially that of Hebrew, which began in the late nineteenth century. There has been little coordination among the geographically-scattered language revival efforts in Australia. Most recently, language revitalization practitioners have begun to share experiences at various conferences and workshops (Hobson et al. forthcoming). There is thus an urgent need for an on-the-ground, ongoing input, creating intellectual and practical synergy and complementing the mission of the regional Aboriginal language centres and the recently-established mobile language team based at the University of Adelaide \u2013 by adding significant advice based on scholarly and universal perspectives. Practical outcomes will include a useful handbook of the best practices for language revival in Australia (Christina Eira, pers. comm.), and an improved sense of well being in the local Aboriginal community.\r\n\t\r\nThere is community support in some parts of the country for revival and heritage learning programmes: either in reclamation proper (e.g. extensive courses similar to Israel\u2019s ulpan\u00edm) or only in symbolic, postvernacular maintenance (teaching Aboriginal people some words and concepts related to the dead language \u2013 cf. postvernacular Yiddish among secular Jews in the United States \u2013 see Shandler 2005). At its broadest level language revival refers to the range of strategies for increasing knowledge and use of a language which is no longer spoken fully across all generations. In practice, however, this can range from largely symbolic uses of ancestral languages like naming buildings or places through to more constant involvement with the language through school-based language instruction (Walsh 2005a).\r\n\r\n\r\nComparative Analysis of Hebrew and Aboriginal Language Revival \r\n\r\nAlthough they too were at the beginning very few in number, and encountered great hostility and animosity (e.g. by those who saw the revival as the desecration of a holy tongue), the Hebrew revivalists had several advantages compared with Australian revivalists. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Documentation: extensive \u2013 consider, for example, the Hebrew Bible and the Mishnah. \r\n\r\n(2) Accessibility: Jews have been exposed to literary Hebrew throughout the generations, e.g. when praying in the synagogue or when saying the blessing over the meal. It would be hard to find a Jew who did not have access to Hebrew (unless in totalitarian regimes such as the Soviet Union).\r\n\r\n(3) Prestige: Hebrew was considered a prestigious language (as opposed to Yiddish, for instance, whose Australian sociolinguistic parallel might be Aboriginal English). It is true that some Aboriginal languages are held in high regard by their owners/custodians but unfortunately usually not by the wider Australian society.\r\n\r\n(4) Uniqueness: Jews from all over the globe only had Hebrew in common (Aramaic was not as prominent), whereas there are dozens of 'sleeping' Aboriginal languages and it would be hard to choose only one unifying tongue, unless one resorts to Aboriginal English. The revival of a single language is much more manageable than that of numerous tongues in varying states of disrepair.\r\n\r\n(5) National self-determination: revived Hebrew was aimed to be the language of an envisioned state, where speakers of Revived Hebrew would eventually have the political power (cf. Yadin and Zuckermann 2010).\r\n\r\n(6) Lack of ownership: Unlike in the case of Aboriginal languages (cf. Walsh 2002), anybody has the right to speak Hebrew, without getting permission from the Jews.\r\n\r\n(7) Easy borrowing: Loanwords and foreign words are not considered theft. In fact, Eliezer Ben-Yehuda loved borrowing from Arabic, Aramaic and other Semitic languages.\r\n\r\n(8) Lack of place restriction: Hebrew could be and was revived all over the globe \u2013 consider Haim Leib Hazan\u2019s coinage mishkaf\u00e1im \u2018glasses\u2019 in 1890 in Grodno (see Zuckermann 2003: 1-4).\r\n\r\n(9) Multilingualism: Jews arriving in Eretz Israel in the time of the revival were used to multilingualism and did not have a \u2018monolingual mindset\u2019. For example, back in Europe many of them spoke Yiddish at home and Polish in the market, and prayed in Hebrew (and Aramaic) in the synagogue.\r\n\r\n(10) Number: There are many more Jews than Aboriginal people in Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, as it happens, Aboriginal revivalists actually have some advantages vis-\u00e0-vis Hebrew revivalists. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n(1) Deontological reason for the revival: As we see it, Aboriginal tongues deserve to be revived for historical, humanistic and social justice, inter alia addressing inequality (cf. Thieberger 1990). This can provide strength to the revival attempts. We hear again and again 'native title' but where is the 'native tongue title'? Is land more important than langue and (cultural) lens? And if land, langue and heritage are bound together as a trinity, then why ask for reparation only for land?\r\n\r\n(2) Numerous utilitarian reasons for the revival: The revival of sleeping Aboriginal languages can result in personal, educational and economic empowerment, sense of pride and higher self-esteem of people who have lost their heritage and purpose in life (see concluding remarks). The Hebrew revival had many less utilitarian purposes, the main one being simply the constitution of a unifying tongue to Jews from all over the world. It would have been unfair, for example, for Ladino-speaking Sephardim if German were selected.\r\n\r\n(3) Governmental support: Although it could obviously be greater, the Australian government does support the reclamation and maintenance of Aboriginal languages, or at least there is an obvious address to apply for money from. This has not been the case in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Palestine. \r\n\r\n(4) Similarities between Aboriginal English and Aboriginal Languages: Aboriginal English (e.g. Nunga English in Adelaide), spoken by some revivalists, contain various linguistic features \u2013 such as connotations, associations, sounds and morphological characteristics like the dual \u2013 of the reclaimed Aboriginal languages at stake. One might perspicaciously argue that Israeli semantics, which is deeply modelled on Yiddish semantics, also maintains the original Hebrew semantics after all because Yiddish, a Germanic language with Romance substratum, was deeply impacted by Hebrew and Aramaic. However, the Yiddish dialects that have been the most influential ones in Israel, e.g. Polish Yiddish, are, in fact, the ones that underwent Slavonization from the thirteenth century onwards, when Jews moved from Germany to Slavonic-speaking areas in Eastern Europe. Aboriginal English is much younger and therefore is much more likely to retain features of Aboriginal languages, than Yiddish is to retain features of Hebrew.\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversal Constraints of Language Revival\r\n\r\nAnd yet, although obviously language revival attempts should be tailored to the specific contexts, needs and desires of each community, there are some universal constraints that should be recognized. As we have already seen, Hebrew revivalists, who wished to speak pure Hebrew, failed in their imprisoning purism prism, the result being a multifaceted and fascinating fin-de-si\u00e8cle Israeli language, both multi-layered and multi-sourced. Most relevantly, some Australian interest groups (cf. Tiwi in Dorian 1994: 481-4) get hung up on misled views akin to the slogan \u2018Give me authenticity or give me death!\u2019 (cf. \u2018Give me Liberty, or give me Death!\u2019, the famous quotation attributed to Patrick Henry from a speech he made to the Virginia Convention in America on 23 March 1775), where the death, of course, ends up being the Indigenous language they wish to save from \u2018contamination\u2019! (On authenticity and language revival, see also Wong 1999 and Hinton and Ahlers 1999.)\r\n\t\r\nWhy should we encourage revivalists and Aboriginal leaders to be realistic rather than puristic? Purism creates unrealistic expectations that may discourage learners from acquiring the emerging language. A revived language should not be viewed negatively if it is seen to be influenced by a neighbouring language or by English. The use of words from a neighbouring language should not discredit the revived language. There might be some rare occasions when it is more appropriate for revivalists to favour purism \u2013 see Harlow (1993) on Maori. However, in the case of reclamation proper (i.e. the revival of a language that has no native speakers such as Hebrew), one must learn to embrace, celebrate and champion \u2013 rather than chastise \u2013 the inevitable hybridity of the emerging language.\r\n\t\r\nOne might argue that the difference between the conditions that surround Aboriginal languages and Israeli are so large that it is impossible to learn across these contexts. But denying universal traits or constraints in human language in general, and in reversing language shift in particular, is counter-productive. Linguistic reality lies between relativism and universalism. No progress will be made by turning a blind eye to any of these extremes. Based on a critical analysis of Israeli, one can predict accurately the situation in various reclaimed Aboriginal languages such as Kaurna [ga:na], a resurrected language spoken around Adelaide, which is the result of one of the most successful revival attempts in Australia \u2013 cf. Gumbaynggirr (Ash et. al. forthcoming), Ngarrindjeri, Walmajarri and Kamilaroi/Gamilaraay.\r\n\t\r\nThere are scholars, e.g. Dalby (2003: 250), who scoff at some attempts at reviving the use of an endangered language: 'this is no longer a language, any more than musicians are speaking Italian when they say andante and fortissimo. These are simply loanwords used in a special context'. A more balanced view is manifested in Crystal's (2000: 162) comments on Kaurna:\r\n\r\nThe revived language is not the same as the original language, of course; most obviously, it lacks the breadth of functions which it originally had, and large amounts of old vocabulary are missing. But, as it continues in present-day use, it will develop new functions and new vocabulary, just as any other living language would, and as long as people value it as a true marker of their identity, and are prepared to keep using it, there is no reason to think of it as anything other than a valid system of communication.\r\n\r\nThe impact of English (Aboriginal or Australian English) on reclaimed Kaurna is far-reaching. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n* At the level of phonology, there are often spelling pronunciations, especially for sequences of er (as in yerlo \u2018sea\u2019 and yerta for instance), ur (as in purle or purlaitye). In classical Kaurna, the r in these words belonged with the consonant (it was be retroflex) but many times we hear an er vowel as in English slur or sir. The original vowel was /a/ in yerlo and yerta, and /u/ in purle and purlaitye. Stress is often placed on the second syllable rather than on the first (Amery 2000: 121-122; Amery and Rigney 2004: 2-3).\r\n\r\n* At the level of vocabulary, there are many calques \u2013 see Amery 2000: 124, as well as Chapter 12 Wodlingga 'In the Home' (pp. 63-70), Chapter 15 Tidnaparndo 'Football' (pp. 81-84) and Chapter 16 Kuya Pirri-wirkindi 'Fishing' (pp. 85-88) in Amery (2007), where a range of calques have been developed \u2013 especially evident in the names of AFL football teams such as Kuinyunda Meyunna (lit. 'sacred men') for the St Kilda Saints. Knowingly \u2013 and jocularly \u2013 cricket (the sport game) was replicated as yertabiritti (the term for the insect with the same name in English) (Amery 2003: 86). It should be noted, however, that in reclaimed Kaurna there are relatively few loanwords/foreignisms from English per se, far less than we see in any \u2018strong\u2019 language such as Pitjantjatjara or Yolngu Matha.\r\n\r\n* Constituent/word order is free in classical Kaurna as in other Aboriginal languages, though it tended to be SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). Naturally, there are contemporary users of Kaurna who tend to produce more SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) sentences, replicating English (Amery and Rigney 2004: 5).\r\n\r\n* English semantics tends to carry through to Kaurna words (Amery and Rigney 2004: 5-7).\r\n\r\n* The most pervasive influence from English is at the level of discourse. Almost everything said or written is translated from English. Thus, the turn of phrase and the idiom are from English (Amery 2001a: 190-194; Amery 2001b; see also Amery and Rigney 2006).\r\n\r\nAnd still, the impact of English on Kaurna is less than in many other revived languages in Australia \u2013 cf. the neighbouring Ngarrindjeri, where published texts are practically English calques: an isomorphic 1 to 1 translation of English, including the use of interrogative \u2018where\u2019 for \u2018were\u2019 and \u2018thus\u2019 for \u2018the\u2019. Case suffixes are used as prepositions \u2013 see p. iii of Reviving Languages: warranna purruttiappendi: tumbelin tungarar: renewal and reclamation programs for indigenous languages in schools (1999), as well as Rhonda Agius in Proctor and Gale (1997: 4-6). \r\n\t\r\nWe predict that any attempt to revive an Aboriginal language will result in a hybrid, combining components from Australian English, Aboriginal English, Kriol, other Aboriginal languages and the target Aboriginal tongue. But we are going to assist Aboriginal revivalists to make their efforts more efficient and to embrace hybridity.\r\n\r\n\r\nConcluding Remarks\r\n\r\nIf you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart. (Nelson Mandela)\r\n\r\nThis article contributes towards the establishment of Revival Linguistics, a new linguistic discipline and paradigm. Zuckermann`s term Revival Linguistics is modelled upon 'Contact Linguistics' (<language contact). Revival linguistics inter alia explores the universal constraints and mechanisms involved in language reclamation, renewal and revitalization. It draws perspicacious comparative insights from one revival attempt to another, thus acting as an epistemological bridge between parallel discourses in various local attempts to revive sleeping tongues all over the globe.\r\n\t\r\nThere is a need to map the revival attempts throughout Aboriginal Australia by (1) assessing the success of the revival so far; and (2) categorizing the specific need on a continuum of revival efforts, e.g. reclamation (e.g. Kaurna), renewal (e.g. Ngarrindjeri) and revitalization (e.g. Walmajarri) \u2013 cf. other RE-terms to be defined such as restoration, resurrection, resuscitation, reinvigoration, reintroduction, regenesis, revernacularization, reawakening, rebirth and renaissance.\r\n\t\r\nNeedless to say, even if there is eventually a sound understanding and awareness of the linguistic/sociolinguistic issues involved and even if the endeavour is well-theorised, language revival efforts may well still fail. Internal factional politics are likely to be far more influential in deciding the fate of a language revival movement that any linguistic theory or lack of one. There is no doubt that the first stage of any desire by professional linguists to assist in language revival involves a long initial period of carefully observing, listening, learning and characterizing each indigenous community specifically. Only then can we inspire and assist. That said, this article proposes that there are linguistic constraints applicable to all revival attempts. Mastering them would be most useful to endangered languages in general and to Aboriginal linguistic revival in particular. \r\n\t\r\nWhile we know that language revitalization can have numerous beneficial effects, we also know that some revival efforts are more successful than others (see Walsh forthcoming A). A better understanding of success in this arena by surveying numerous language reinvigoration efforts in Australia, and by drawing on lessons from the Hebrew revival, will enable less waste of resources and better outcomes. Besides significant scholarly impact and intellectual benefits, the results of such endeavours will also improve substantially the future of Australia's Indigenous communities, promoting and maintaining their physical, spiritual and cultural good health through:\r\n\r\n(1) Transformation of disturbed individuals;\r\n\r\n(2) Capacity building: Some Aboriginal people will undertake training only because they are interested in language(s). However, what they will learn in the process are useful generic skills such as literacy, computer literacy, conducting research and giving speeches in public;\r\n\r\n(3) Improved sense of well being in the local Aboriginal community;\r\n\r\n(4) Reconciliation and potential decrease in racism towards Aboriginal people in some country centres;\r\n\r\n(5) Promoting cultural tourism to Aboriginal areas in order to learn about their cultures and languages.\r\n\r\nRegaining language is a life-changing experience for many Aboriginal people. One Aboriginal person has told us that he used to be angry, often drunk and in trouble with police and his home life was a mess. Two years later, when he had regained his language, his situation had turned around and his family life had greatly improved.\r\n\r\nThrough this and other experiences we became convinced that a small investment in language revitalization could yield very significant dividends. Language revival can result in the saving of vast amounts of money and resources going into housing, social services and health intervention to little effect. A small investment into language revitalization can make an enormous difference to society. Public health can benefit from language intervention.\r\n\t\r\nTo date such money as has been devoted to Aboriginal language revival and maintenance has not been well targeted. This is partly because Australian Indigenous language policies have been piecemeal and un-coordinated at best or otherwise non-existent or implicit (Liddicoat 2008, McKay 2007, 2009, Truscott and Malcolm forthcoming; see also http://www.anu.edu.au/linguistics/nash/ aust/policy.html \u2013 accessed 6 July 2010). We aim at a better informed Indigenous language policy at the national level, as well as in particular institutional contexts. For instance, in considering Indigenous policies of Australian universities, Gunstone (2008: 107) complains: \u2018it is apparent that universities are still largely failing to adequately address the educational needs of Indigenous staff, students and communities.\u2019\r\n\t\r\nAs cellist Yo Yo Ma said on 28 November 2000 at the White House Conference on Culture and Diplomacy:\r\n\r\nA Senegalese poet said 'In the end we will conserve only what we love. We love only what we understand, and we will understand only what we are taught.' We must learn about other cultures in order to understand, in order to love, and in order to preserve our common world heritage.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAmery, Rob 2000.

There are, however, minimal examples of how museums might realize this opportunity. This thesis examines the curation of a local history of Australian videogames for the era of the microcomputer and, in the process, provides an example of how museums can effectively engage with online communities to document and display videogames.\n\nLocal game histories form a crucial component of a response to the call for a critical historiography of videogames. Notable scholars to have proposed the need for such a historiography include Raiford Guins, Henry Lowood, Jakko Suominen and Melanie Swalwell. Responding to this need, I undertake research on an important chapter of Australian videogame history. In addressing the challenges of curating videogames, which are understood as both \u2018artefacts and experiences\u2019, I explore what museums can learn from the practices of retro game communities. Online retro gamer communities have created extensive archives of early microcomputer games, developing systems and procedures for their preservation and documentation. Through examination of retro gamer sites and other player made artefacts, I develop a novel argument for the importance of player memory in capturing how people experienced videogames and engaged with broader game culture. The importance of personal memories for videogame history is further explored in the case study of the Popular Memory Archive (PMA). The PMA website is designed as both exhibition and archive with the intent of engaging online communities in sharing their recollections of 1980s games. Through an analysis of the PMA I examine new ways of documenting and displaying born digital work. \n\nThis thesis contributes to broader questions about the display and collection of digital heritage by museums confronted with the challenges of a future in which screen culture will no longer leave material traces. Born digital artefacts need to be recorded and represented through the documentation of their systems and the experiences they afford their users. Through an analysis of retro gamer sites and the PMA, I present an exemplar for future collaborative practice between museums and online communities for the display and documentation of born digital artefacts. \n\u2003\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48599103, "asset_id": 28273051, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2762516, "first_name": "Helen", "last_name": "Stuckey", "domain_name": "rmit", "page_name": "HelenStuckey", "display_name": "Helen Stuckey", "profile_url": "https://rmit.academia.edu/HelenStuckey?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2762516/898262/1122391/s65_helen.stuckey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 883, "name": "Game studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Game_studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2133, "name": "Digital Curation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Curation?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15076, "name": "Digital Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Games?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 17517, "name": "Digital preservation (Cultural Heritage)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_preservation_Cultural_Heritage_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 111850, "name": "Fan Communities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fan_Communities?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 3391242, "title": "From Augustine to Anglicanism: the Anglican Church in Australia and beyond: proceedings of the conference", "created_at": "2013-04-26T00:22:12.109-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3391242/From_Augustine_to_Anglicanism_the_Anglican_Church_in_Australia_and_beyond_proceedings_of_the_conference?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_3391242", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31183040, "asset_id": 3391242, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3947265, "first_name": "Gillian", "last_name": "Colclough", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GColclough", "display_name": "Gillian  Colclough", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GColclough?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3947265/1478286/5011713/s65_gillian.colclough.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30425, "name": "Anglican Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglican_Church_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37085901, "title": "Piecing together suffrage internationalism: Place, space, and connected histories of Australasian women's activism", "created_at": "2018-07-20T05:33:46.469-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37085901/Piecing_together_suffrage_internationalism_Place_space_and_connected_histories_of_Australasian_womens_activism?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_37085901", "summary": "Over the past 20 years, suffrage historians have sought to reimagine their field\u2014traditionally tethered to the nation\u2014as an international one. The Australasian suffragists, who strove to overcome their perceived isolation by exchanging print, personnel, and ideas across borders, seem perfect candidates for such revisionist treatment. However, despite the invigorating push to destabilise the nation, which has rewired much of Australian and New Zealand historiography, the suffragists remain ensconced in national frames. Revisiting the rich Australasian scholarship on women, mobility, and cross\u2010border organisation, this article discusses the political and intellectual barriers that have impeded attempts to reconstruct suffrage internationalism. Yet documenting the suffragists' cross\u2010border interactions requires more than replacing monolithic national histories with revised internationalist versions. Instead, responding to debates about the digitally driven rise of connected histories, this article argues that historians should piece together suffrage internationalism as it existed in specific places\u2014recovering often messy assemblages of transnational individuals, groups, and organisations. Such an approach will both illuminate colonial women's place in the networks that bound the fin\u2010de\u2010si\u00e8cle world and provide a fresh perspective on the international women's movement.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60638353, "asset_id": 37085901, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3468285, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Keating", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "JamesKeating", "display_name": "James Keating", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/JamesKeating?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3468285/1279423/1592476/s65_james.keating.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6367, "name": "Woman Suffrage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Woman_Suffrage?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8233, "name": "Transnational History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19464, "name": "History of New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_Zealand?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 26030738, "title": "North American Wesleyan-Holiness Churches in Australia, PhD thesis, La Trobe University, 2005", "created_at": "2016-06-09T21:29:31.367-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26030738/North_American_Wesleyan_Holiness_Churches_in_Australia_PhD_thesis_La_Trobe_University_2005?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_26030738", "summary": "This thesis examines the emergence of a number of North American Wesleyan-Holiness denominations in Australia, beginning in the years following the Second World War.  They are the Church of God (Anderson), the Church of God (Cleveland), the Church of the Nazarene, and the Wesleyan Methodist Church.  It will trace the manner in which some of these churches moved from being despised and marginalised sects to established denominations while others remained small and isolated, experiencing little growth.\nThe thesis demonstrates that the movement along the church-sect continuum is by no means a smooth and inevitable one.  Immigrant dislocation may lead to a slowing down of change to preserve a sense of identity.  A particular group may be found to be positioned toward the church end of the continuum in its place of origin and be positioned toward the sect end in its mission areas, or the reverse may be true.   A particular movement may be seen as a \u2018sect\u2019 when compared to one group and a \u2018church\u2019 when compared to another.     \nThe theme of Americanisation and anti-Americanism will be examined, as the explicitly American origins of these churches was both the cause of their exclusion and at the same time a mechanism for their survival.  The emergence of the Wesleyan-Holiness denominations in Australia is not an example of American cultural and religious imperialism.  Rather it has been a creative partnership between like-minded evangelical Christians from two modern nations sharing a general cultural and social similarity and a common set of religious convictions.  \nThe Wesleyan-Holiness churches saw increased growth from the late 1970s by welcoming into their membership a new wave of refugees from more liberal Protestant denominations. They are shown to be both a new religious movement, emerging out of the post-war context of greater engagement between Australians and Americans and at the same time a continuation of the long-standing \u2018holiness\u2019 and \u2018revivalist\u2019 strain within Australian evangelicalism.

Ultimately responding to their moment of creation, both novels in very different ways argue the impossibility of a state\u2010sanctioned version of the Australian past. They are political works of literature which, in my reading, intervened culturally into one of the most central existential debates in Australian society.\r\n\r\nThe History Wars were a series of disputes centred around epistemological, methodological, philosophical and political questions of evidence, honesty, truth and myth in relation to Australia\u2019s past. They were fuelled by a series of measures in the 1980s and 1990s, not least the Native Title Act (1993) which overturned the legal falsehood of terra nullius, and aimed to acknowledge aspects of the country\u2019s past which contributed to the oppression of Aboriginal people. The spirit of Reconciliation, enshrined in government policy in 1990, led to brief moments of official recognition such as the famous \u2018Redfern Speech\u2019 by Paul Keating in December 1992. Identifying the landmark Mabo court ruling as \u201can historic turning point,\u201d Keating stated that \u201cthere is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition of historical truth.\u201d Against this framework, a terminology of \u2018myth\u2019, \u2018untruth\u2019, \u2018lies\u2019, \u2018invention\u2019 and, most heatedly, \u2018fabrication\u2019, dominated Australian politics during the 1990s and early 2000s, and continues to be prominent today.\r\n\r\nThe History Wars gave rise to an atmosphere of extreme existential crisis in the universities. Not only for historians, but for all people involved in creating and relating Australian historical narratives, this involved a questioning of methodology which spanned the role of paper sources versus oral sources, the idea of historical records either being manufactured for a particular aim, or indeed misinterpreted and manipulated for particular political reasons became central. \r\n\r\nThe opening up of historical practice in the 1970s and 1980s had been necessitated by the conditions of colonisation, namely the absence of historical evidence of oppression, and the pretence that the only valid source is a written one. However this opening up and the subsequent experimentation with a variety of creative approaches to history were denigrated as untruthful. One of these creative approaches was through historical fiction that was critically and politically engaged with the very process of how history is \u2018written\u2019.\r\n\r\nWhile not setting out to philosophically examine and appraise the notion of \u2018historical truth\u2019, this thesis seeks to analyse the way in which the notions of historical truth and evidence were taken up by two Australian writers in novels published during Howard\u2019s second term (1998\u20102001), following a tumultuous decade of political and epistemological debate over history and historiography. It analyses these authors\u2019 examinations of the process by we reach collective understandings (or not) about the past, and in the role played by literature in that process.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60430107, "asset_id": 8153929, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 865259, "first_name": "Kate", "last_name": "Davison", "domain_name": "edinburgh", "page_name": "KateDavison", "display_name": "Kate Davison", "profile_url": "https://edinburgh.academia.edu/KateDavison?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/865259/310385/39048350/s65_kate.davison.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9465, "name": "Philosophy of History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44716, "name": "Historical Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Fiction?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 28401298, "title": "Chapter 4:  1910s: the bungalow from California to Australia, Images of the Pacific Rim: Australia and California, 1850-1935", "created_at": "2016-09-10T19:58:08.814-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28401298/Chapter_4_1910s_the_bungalow_from_California_to_Australia_Images_of_the_Pacific_Rim_Australia_and_California_1850_1935?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_28401298", "summary": "The history of the California bungalow, in California and in Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48739857, "asset_id": 28401298, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3744521, "first_name": "Erika", "last_name": "Esau", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ErikaEsau", "display_name": "Erika Esau", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ErikaEsau?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3744521/1347029/30910096/s65_erika.esau.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25513, "name": "California History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/California_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54201, "name": "Australian architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_architecture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 663795, "name": "Bungalows", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bungalows?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1051741, "name": "Southern California Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_California_Architecture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1645664, "name": "Californian architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Californian_architecture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2220742, "name": "Craftsman Bungalows", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Craftsman_Bungalows?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 1606244, "title": "Biography of George Douglas Smythe & William Henry Hutchinson Smythe, Surveyors", "created_at": "2012-05-30T16:28:50.325-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1606244/Biography_of_George_Douglas_Smythe_and_William_Henry_Hutchinson_Smythe_Surveyors?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_1606244", "summary": "\"The Smythe brothers were minor but important colonial officials in Western Australia, Tasmania and Victoria.

They were not prominent actors but were there doing their work which was not insignificant mapping the country was an important function of colonisation.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 15504529, "asset_id": 1606244, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 394870, "first_name": "Iain", "last_name": "Stuart", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "IainStuart", "display_name": "Iain Stuart", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/IainStuart?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/394870/99966/1370916/s65_iain.stuart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29722, "name": "Surveying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Surveying?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 218815, "name": "Victoria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victoria?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 439640, "name": "Land Surveyor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Surveyor?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 497972, "name": "George Douglas Smythe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/George_Douglas_Smythe?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 497973, "name": "Henry William Hutchinson Smythe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Henry_William_Hutchinson_Smythe?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 11832686, "title": "Moving the Genocide Debate Beyond the History Wars", "created_at": "2015-04-07T11:13:39.897-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11832686/Moving_the_Genocide_Debate_Beyond_the_History_Wars?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_11832686", "summary": "The \u201cHistory Wars\u201d have paralysed the scholarly discussion on genocide in Australian history, because genocide is regarded as a politicized concept that distorts historical understanding.\nBoth the public sphere and much historiography continue to regard genocide as a synonym for\nthe Holocaust, framing public discussion of genocide in Australia as well as discouraging historians from engaging with the international comparative literature on colonial genocides.\nThis article aims to stimulate reflection on these issues by explaining the origin and meaning of the term in intellectual and legal history.

This thesis is an exploration of the life and the sixty-year career of Lockwood as a journalist and writer, in which membership of the CPA was but part (1939-1969). \r\n\r\nA general chronological framework is adopted, and the account developed with regard to three aspects of his life and career\u2013 as a journalist, as a communist, and as an intellectual.\r\n\r\nBy contextualising the communist period of Lockwood\u2019s life in his overall life and times, the portrait of a significant Australian journalist emerges, one who chose to leave the capitalist press for the adversarial and counter sphere of labour movement journalism, the latter the site of his work from 1940 until retirement in 1985. \r\n\r\nThe thesis also explores Lockwood\u2019s considerable intellectual activity, and mounts a case for recognition of the originality and sophistication of his largely unacknowledged research and writings in the areas of Australian history, politics, and political economy.\r\n\r\nOverall, this thesis contributes empirical knowledge and understandings to a number of aspects of Australian history: to labour movement history generally, and specifically to communist and labour biography; to journalism history; and to intellectual history. In so doing, it also contributes to the understanding of Australia between the two World Wars, and during the Cold War.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36073287, "asset_id": 7942224,

His discreet actions \u2013 discussed in detail for the first time \u2013 were not unusual among elites in the post-war period. However, he was especially entrenched in the practice.

This is the story of toponymic Murdering Creek, on the southern side of Lake Weyba near Noosa in Queensland\u2019s southeast. We will assess the alleged massacre at Murdering Creek as a potential type instance of the Australian genocidal process.\r\nIn our forensic examination of the Murdering Creek massacre myth, we find that it is supported by an actual event that, on the balance of evidence, took place in 1864 on a 23,000 acre pastoral station called Yandina Run,  between the Maroochy River and Lake Weyba. We determine that the massacre was carried out by local pastoral workers and at least one timbergetter. The motive seems to have been  a belief in white supremacy,  and a pathological desire to remove the Aboriginals, who objected to a homestead being built near a sacred bora in 1862.  An unkown number of Aboriginals were murdered while in canoes at the mouth of the Creek and into the shallow foreshore of the lake, where they had been inveigled by a ruse.\r\nThe massacre was enabled by the murderous and racist policies of the newly installed Herbert Government, the first Government of Queensland. Herbert assumed the office of Government in 1859, and was sworn into power in 1860. He took the title of premier and colonial secretary, which included Aboriginal affairs. He is considered the founder of Queensland. During Herbert\u2019s long term, there is no legislative evidence that he considered the human rights of dispossessed Aboriginals. His priorities were economic, and Aboriginals were an encumbrance. Herbert\u2019s Government introduced Aboriginal dispersal policies that legitimised extermination. Britain was a co-conspirator. Britain supplied the weaponry, strategic governance, immigrants and maritime mercantile support.\r\nIn our findings, Murdering Creek therefore becomes a type instance of a violent State sponsored process that saw the destruction of Aboriginal society across a multiplicity of other Murdering Creek type events in Queensland and across Australia. \r\nMeticulous effort has been used to investigate this particular myth, because other researchers may be able to reuse the originating syncretic methods and investigative tools that can help them further decode Australia\u2019s mythical past. Not the largely confected, triumphal past of heroic pastoralism, as it tamed the land for economic gain. No, it is the violent and defiantly  racist past that many of us choose to forget, including that at Murdering Creek. It is the invasive pattern of armed dispossession, the process of occupation that formed the political uses of Australian genocide, where economic imperatives outweighed humanitarian considerations. We ignore the past to our cost.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38025575, "asset_id": 13367497, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 248, "name": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2965, "name": "Sociology of Crime and Deviance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Crime_and_Deviance?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 940741, "name": "Colonial Genocide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Genocide?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1226770, "name": "Behavioural Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Behavioural_Economics?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 34561978, "title": "The curious world of The Hobbit: an early example of a dynamic gameworld", "created_at": "2017-09-13T17:00:03.105-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34561978/The_curious_world_of_The_Hobbit_an_early_example_of_a_dynamic_gameworld?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34561978", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54427425, "asset_id": 34561978, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2762516, "first_name": "Helen", "last_name": "Stuckey", "domain_name": "rmit", "page_name": "HelenStuckey", "display_name": "Helen Stuckey", "profile_url": "https://rmit.academia.edu/HelenStuckey?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2762516/898262/1122391/s65_helen.stuckey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3557, "name": "History of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Technology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14812, "name": "Fan Cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fan_Cultures?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 95051, "name": "Women and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Technology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 247481, "name": "Microcomputers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Microcomputers?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 32033281, "title": "\" The Play \" , from The Annotated Songs of a Sentimental Bloke", "created_at": "2017-03-24T17:59:24.726-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32033281/_The_Play_from_The_Annotated_Songs_of_a_Sentimental_Bloke?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_32033281", "summary": "This \" article \" is an excerpt from the complete version of The Annotated Songs of a Sentimental Bloke.

Both writers were supported in various ways by their puzzled families and their work expresses a difficult affection for life on the land. Both found a literary resource in their rural family heritage while consistently criticising its culture. This paper gives particular consideration to Wright's two histories of her family's life on the land, The Generations of Men (1959) and The Cry for the Dead (1981) as demonstrations of the double heritage of heroic pioneering at the cost of Aboriginal people and the land. Her late poem 'For a Pastoral Family' expresses succinctly her ambivalent feelings about her heritage: 'a doubtful song that has a dying fall'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50342589, "asset_id": 29875284, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 275634, "first_name": "Susan", "last_name": "Lever", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "SusanLever", "display_name": "Susan Lever", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/SusanLever?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/275634/56972/17828719/s65_susan.lever.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 85755, "name": "Judith Wright", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Judith_Wright?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 91300, "name": "Patrick White", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patrick_White?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 329110, "name": "Contemporary Australian Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Australian_Poetry?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 2183832, "title": "Mothers\u2019 Interrupted: Puerperal Insanity in early Twentieth Century, Australia.", "created_at": "2012-11-22T20:27:41.413-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2183832/Mothers_Interrupted_Puerperal_Insanity_in_early_Twentieth_Century_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_2183832", "summary": "\"\"Puerperal insanity, was a term used extensively throughout the 19th century and generally is understood as the suffering of mental illness following childbirth. Marland (2004) argues that puerperal insanity was in decline as a diagnosis in the twentieth century. However, my investigation of 30 female mental patient files from Victoria between 1920-1934 reveals that a small but significant number of post birthing women were still committed with puerperal insanity at this time.\r\n\r\nCases of puerperal insanity violate twentieth century ideals of motherhood. Yet the medical definition of puerperal insanity, lack of treatment and the public discourses of what constitutes the \u2018good mother\u2019 from the 1930s ignore family power relations, social conditions and the material realities of mothering in this era. These issues are consistent with Showalter\u2019s conclusion, who states that \u2018the psychiatric definition of puerperal insanity ignored the social problems of motherhood: 'unmarried, abused and destitute mothers and the shocks, adjustments, and psychological traumas of the maternal role\u2019 (1985). \r\n\r\nThe patient histories under examination in this work reflect the gendered discourse of the medical authorities of the early twentieth century who supported, at times, the unrealistic social expectations of mothers of that era.

settlers intend to exterminate the Aboriginal population as the necessary price for confiscating the land? \n\nMany argue: there is no set of official policies or instructions that ordered and encouraged the categorial behaviour and indictable actions of genocide; and therefore that Aboriginal extermination may have been an \u2018unintended consequence\u2019   of forcible land dispossession, if they acknowledge retrospective culpability at all. \n\nWe will show that there were key Government documents and policies that placed genocidal intention (mens rea) in clear view, along with official orders to act (actus rea).  These documents shaped and directed Aboriginal dispossession and extermination. We will further show that arguments against Australian genocide are misconceived at best or reflexive at worst. \n\nIt raises troubling questions: If Australian history has been manipulated, then why and by whom? And can we change? Can we acknowledge the past? Or are we forever to perpetuate more palatable myths of heroic settler triumphalism in benignly \u2018taming\u2019 the land?\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53821671, "asset_id": 33839669, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7514, "name": "Legislative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legislative_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 33121272, "title": "The early copper mining industry in Central Queensland, 1863-1879 -History and place", "created_at": "2017-05-20T19:54:18.539-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33121272/The_early_copper_mining_industry_in_Central_Queensland_1863_1879_History_and_place?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_33121272", "summary": "Copper was first commercially mined in Australia at Kapunda, South Australia, in 1844, followed by the finds at Burra in 1845.

There he made his name with A Bid for Fortune (1895), an international crime thriller featuring his best-known character Dr Nikola, the title of which is most indicative of his attitude toward writing. Inspired by an earlier meeting with Rudyard Kipling in Adelaide, Boothby had come to see fiction-writing as the most promising outlet for his ambition. This paper will argue that just as Kipling\u2019s popularity derived from his ability to mediate the Anglo-Indian experience for domestic British consumption, once in London Boothby similarly tried to construct a distinctive Anglo-Australian identity to differentiate his work in the competitive literary marketplace. His fiction teems with exotic Australasian locales that often function as an end in themselves superfluous to plot requirements. The efficacy of this device is evident in copious reviews lauding his Australian savvy, and spectacular financial success. So meteoric was Boothby\u2019s rise that a spoof article claiming he had recently purchased a solid-gold bath was reiterated as fact across numerous literary magazines. However, as well as a rich vein to be tapped for the metropolitan market, Boothby\u2019s hyphenated identity was a source of conflict for him, producing a sense, expressed by many other contemporary colonial-migrant authors, of belonging fully neither to his home colony nor metropolitan Britain, a kind of \u2018doubled hybridity\u2019 as Robert Young puts it. This conflict is apparent in the public authorial persona Boothby adopted which alternatively valorises his outr\u00e9 colonial background and his new status of English country squire. Likewise it pervades his fiction manifesting itself in some idiosyncratic representations that ultimately seem to favour his Australian heritage.  \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34447212, "asset_id": 2127740, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2761090, "first_name": "Ailise", "last_name": "Bulfin", "domain_name": "ucd", "page_name": "AiliseBulfin", "display_name": "Ailise Bulfin", "profile_url": "https://ucd.academia.edu/AiliseBulfin?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2761090/897623/6620129/s65_ailise.bulfin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1305, "name": "Victorian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7299, "name": "Victorian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10562, "name": "Crime fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crime_fiction?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 11858, "name": "Popular Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Fiction?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20631, "name": "Popular Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35295, "name": "Victorian Crime Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Crime_Fiction?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 39559, "name": "Rudyard Kipling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rudyard_Kipling?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 68813, "name": "Victorian periodicals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_periodicals?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 440369, "name": "Guy Boothby", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Guy_Boothby?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 641122, "name": "Dr Nikola", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dr_Nikola?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 40312068, "title": "\u00daC V\u00c0 CT VI\u1ec6T NAM", "created_at": "2019-09-10T19:17:36.897-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40312068/%C3%9AC_V%C3%80_CT_VI%E1%BB%86T_NAM?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_40312068", "summary": "Chi\u1ebfn tranh Vi\u1ec7t Nam (1954 \u2013 1975) l\u00e0 cu\u1ed9c chi\u1ebfn x\u00e2m l\u01b0\u1ee3c Vi\u1ec7t Nam c\u1ee7a \u0111\u1ebf qu\u1ed1c M\u1ef9 nh\u1eb1m ki\u1ec1m t\u1ecfa \u1ea3nh h\u01b0\u1edfng c\u1ee7a M\u1ef9 \u0111\u1ed1i v\u1edbi Vi\u1ec7t Nam c\u0169ng nh\u01b0 c\u00e1c n\u01b0\u1edbc trong khu v\u1ef1c \u0110\u00f4ng Nam \u00c1 kh\u1ecfi \u1ea3nh h\u01b0\u1edfng c\u1ee7a ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a c\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n Li\u00ean X\u00f4, Trung Qu\u1ed1c. \u0110\u00f3 l\u00e0 cu\u1ed9c chi\u1ebfn b\u1ea3o v\u1ec7 \u0111\u1ed9c l\u1eadp c\u1ee7a qu\u00e2n d\u00e2n ba mi\u1ec1n c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam tr\u01b0\u1edbc 50 \u2013 60 v\u1ea1n qu\u00e2n M\u1ef9 v\u00e0 qu\u00e2n ch\u01b0 h\u1ea7u.

This contribution presents the state of the art in its application to droughts. The range of documentary evidence is very wide, including general annals, chronicles, memoirs and diaries kept by missionaries, travellers and those specifically interested in the weather; records kept by administrators tasked with keeping accounts and other financial and economic records; legal-administrative evidence; religious sources; letters; songs; newspapers and journals; pictographic evidence; chronograms; epigraphic evidence; early instrumental observations; society commentaries ; and compilations and books. These are available from many parts of the world. This variety of documentary information is evaluated with respect to the reconstruction of hydroclimatic conditions (precipitation, drought frequency and drought indices). Documentary-based drought reconstructions are then addressed in terms of long-term spatio-temporal fluctuations, major drought events, relationships with external forcing and large-scale climate drivers, socioeconomic impacts and human responses. Documentary-based drought series are also considered from the viewpoint of spatio-temporal variability for certain continents, and their employment together with hydroclimate reconstructions from other proxies (in particular tree rings) is discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and challenges for the future use of documentary evidence in the study of droughts are presented.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57989334, "asset_id": 37972716, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96211739, "first_name": "J\u00fcrg", "last_name": "Luterbacher", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "J\u00fcrgLuterbacher", "display_name": "J\u00fcrg Luterbacher", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/J%C3%BCrgLuterbacher?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 3396084, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Nash", "domain_name": "brighton", "page_name": "DavidNash", "display_name": "David Nash", "profile_url": "https://brighton.academia.edu/DavidNash?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3396084/1148216/12305519/s65_david.nash.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3255, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3896, "name": "African History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6741, "name": "Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8980, "name": "Drought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drought?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35801, "name": "Climate Change Impacts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Impacts?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 38824, "name": "Modern European History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_European_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 60033, "name": "East Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 66240, "name": "Historical Climatology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Climatology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 80658, "name": "Climate history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 115677, "name": "Drought and Water Stress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drought_and_Water_Stress?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1032184, "name": "Drought Indicators/indices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drought_Indicators_indices?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 34010860, "title": "Deconstructing Australian genocide How Britain shaped the destruction of Aboriginal society", "created_at": "2017-07-23T18:14:38.838-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34010860/Deconstructing_Australian_genocide_How_Britain_shaped_the_destruction_of_Aboriginal_society?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34010860", "summary": "Whenever the subject of Australian genocide arises, so does the question of State intentionality: did Britain, its administrative functionaries (bureaucrats, police, military) and its settlers intend to exterminate the Aboriginal population as the necessary price for confiscating the land? \n\nMany argue: there is no set of official policies or instructions that ordered and encouraged the categorial behaviour and indictable actions of genocide; and therefore that Aboriginal extermination may have been an \u2018unintended consequence\u2019   of forcible land dispossession, if they acknowledge retrospective culpability at all. \n\nWe will show that there were key Government documents and policies that placed genocidal intention (mens rea) in clear view, along with official orders to act (actus rea).

For some residents, being shunted off to a camp at Melbourne\u2019s furthest edge was simply a case of being out of sight and out of mind, and was starkly symbolic of the failure of the capitalist system during Australia's greatest economic downturn.  Others accepted it as 'a necessity under the circumstances', a staging point for upcountry relief works, a brief interlude between a return to paid work or even an escape from the drudgery of daily life or the squalid city shelters.  \n\nThe Broadmeadows camp represented a short hiatus for its various players.  In attempting to understand the life of the camp, a number of themes emerged.  One theme is the relationship between the camp and the protest movement during the Depression.

arrival of 335 Italian migrant workers in North Queensland in 1891, Italians have been ambivalently placed in relation to Australian constructions of whiteness. Despite the dismantling of the White Australia Policy in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this ambivalence persisted into the multicultural era, yet it also shifted. By covering approximately a century of Australia\u2019s recent history, this thesis reveals how the place of Italians - as migrants and as an established ethnic community \u2013 within the field of whiteness has shifted over time, as constructions of whiteness have also shifted. This is explored through an examination of important locations, events and themes such as the North Queensland cane fields, the rise of fascism, World War II, post-war immigration, assimilation, multiculturalism and the construction of a non-white \u2018Wog\u2019 identity. These cases are used to argue that by the end of the twentieth century, despite having acquired a desirable and even successful status in Australia, the whiteness of Italians remained conditional on processes of conferral and accumulation, and therefore remained less stable and self-evident than the whiteness of Anglo-Celtic Australians. By also focusing on the ways in which Italians themselves have asserted or actively negated their whiteness also reveals the role of Italians as active agents in constructing and performing whiteness in Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33090324, "asset_id": 6221749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1271949, "first_name": "Luke", "last_name": "Vitale", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LukeVitale", "display_name": "Luke Vitale", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LukeVitale?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1271949/3020626/26057918/s65_luke.vitale.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10469, "name": "Whiteness Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 397813, "name": "Italian Australians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italian_Australians?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25667886, "title": "Conservation Management Plan Blackguard Gully, Young", "created_at": "2016-05-27T18:05:39.503-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25667886/Conservation_Management_Plan_Blackguard_Gully_Young?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_25667886", "summary": "During the Lambing Flat Gold Rush of 1860-1861 the gullies to the east of the town of Young were heavily contested by desperate gold fossickers.

Australia\u2019s auto industry is an extension of global motor vehicle manufacturers with a small number of domestic manufacturing firms that form a part of the global supply chain.  Toyota Motor Corporation, Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, General Motors Corporation and Ford Motor Company all have had extensive investments in the Australian market.  In the past, the Australian market was also a host to investments from Volkswagen AG, Chrysler LLC, Nissan Motor Company Limited and British Leyland Motor Corporation.  The size of the industry has shrunk recently with the March 2008 shut down of manufacturing by Mitsubishi Motors Australia Limited (MMAL), not long after the company\u2019s emergence from a long and significant restructuring.  Still, the auto industry remains the largest single manufacturing sector in Australia both in terms of investment levels and the number of people employed.  Thus, Japanese auto manufacturing investment in Australia require an evaluation, now that the federal government has completed the 2008 \u2018Review of Australia\u2019s Automotive Industry\u2019.

They were, as Ken Inglis said: sacred places, holy ground and\nfocal points of family and community grief. One hundred years later, the\ncommemoration of the Great War has heralded a mushrooming of virtual war memorials.\n\nThere are a growing number of websites which seek to gather photographs and information about all the ANZACs who served in the First World War. Some of these websites are sponsored by government bodies - like Discovering Anzacs a joint project of National Archives of Australia and Archives New Zealand; and Lives of the First World War created by the Imperial War Museum in Britain. Others are developed by private individuals and the RSLs. Many of these websites are virtual, digital memorials.\n\nThis paper will compare and contrast the purpose of, and community response to, virtual and physical war memorials to the First World War. What is the relationship between virtual and physical memorials? Are online memorials more \u2018authentic\u2019 because they are built through crowd-sourcing or are they less authentic because the information they contain is sometimes not validated by more objective researchers? Can virtual memorials be places of pilgrimage and community building? Are online websites, where people can create tributes to their ancestors, more about the contributor\u2019s search for identity than their need to remember the service of their relative? Or are they just a sign of the times \u2013 a natural response to the digital, online age? \n\nIf, as Marshall McLuhan says, the medium is the message, what do we gain and lose through virtual war memorials? What purposes do physical memorials to the Great War, which are fixed in one place, serve in the digital age?\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52283692, "asset_id": 32017850, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 60026387, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Wishart", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "AlisonWishart", "display_name": "Alison  Wishart", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/AlisonWishart?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/60026387/15649962/19850777/s65_alison.wishart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 49366, "name": "Memorials and the Memorial Art-Work in the Public Arena", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memorials_and_the_Memorial_Art-Work_in_the_Public_Arena?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 53926, "name": "Remembrance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remembrance?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 54603, "name": "Death and  Dying, Mourning and Remembrance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_and_Dying_Mourning_and_Remembrance?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 114861, "name": "Anzac", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anzac?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 6838848, "title": "Fallen girls: Plumpton High and the 'problem' of teenage pregnancy", "created_at": "2014-04-22T18:07:08.793-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6838848/Fallen_girls_Plumpton_High_and_the_problem_of_teenage_pregnancy?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_6838848", "summary": "In 1994, an education program for pregnant teenagers and mothers was introduced at Plumpton High School in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs, an area associated with various social problems, including teenage pregnancy, youth unemployment and low secondary education retention rates. The initiative prompted widespread media coverage, with a particular focus on the role of the Plumpton High\u2019s Principal Glenn Sargeant as the \u2018Patriarch\u2019 of the school and in particular of the teenage mothers. In 2003, the screening of an ABC documentary series on Plumpton High, Plumpton High Babies, renewed and amplified interest in the program and the \u2018problem\u2019 of teenage pregnancy more generally. In this article, I use the example of Plumpton High to trace the construction and representation of teenage pregnancy as a social problem in Australia from the\r\n1970s. I also suggest that while the media emphasis on Principal Sargeant reinforced the \u2018fallen girls\u2019 archetype, the experiences captured by the documentary also offered alternative perspectives on the lives of 'Girl Mothers'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33532949, "asset_id": 6838848, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2737729, "first_name": "Zora", "last_name": "Simic", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "ZoraSimic", "display_name": "Zora Simic", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/ZoraSimic?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2737729/885493/38833527/s65_zora.simic.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30567905, "title": "A whole new world: Global revolution and Australian social movements in the long Sixties", "created_at": "2016-12-21T19:16:53.467-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30567905/A_whole_new_world_Global_revolution_and_Australian_social_movements_in_the_long_Sixties?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_30567905", "summary": "This thesis explores Australian social movements during the long Sixties through a transnational prism, identifying how the flow of people and ideas across borders was central to the growth and development of diverse campaigns for political change. By making use of a variety of sources\u2014from archives and government reports to newspapers, interviews and memoirs\u2014it identifies a broadening of the radical\nimagination within movements seeking rights for Indigenous Australians, the lifting of censorship, women\u2019s liberation, the ending of the war in Vietnam and many others. It locates early global influences, such as the Chinese Revolution and increasing consciousness of anti-racist struggles in South Africa and the American South, and the ways in which ideas from these and other overseas sources became central to the practice of Australian social movements. This was a process aided by activists\u2019 travel. \n\nAccordingly, this study analyses the diverse motives and experiences of Australian activists who visited revolutionary hotspots from China and Vietnam to Czechoslovakia, Algeria, France and the United States: to protest, to experience or to bring back lessons. While these overseas exploits, breathlessly recounted in articles, interviews and books, were transformative for some, they also exposed the limits of what a transnational politics could achieve in a local setting. Australia also became a destination for the period\u2019s radical activists, provoking equally divisive responses. A fearful government controversially barred many international activists, from Marxist economists to Black Power radicals, while those who successfully crossed the border, in particular international student-activists, mobilised Australians to fight repressive governments in their homelands. Through navigating these underexplored areas of the recent past this thesis unearths how and why the idea of global revolution affected a range of activists, and the practice of radical politics, locating Australia as a peripheral yet engaged participant in what historians now call the global Sixties.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51009855, "asset_id": 30567905, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 904696, "first_name": "Jon", "last_name": "Piccini", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "JonPiccini", "display_name": "Jon Piccini", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/JonPiccini?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/904696/333916/37777692/s65_jon.piccini.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134, "name": "Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3410, "name": "Urban History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 5214, "name": "Cold War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8233, "name": "Transnational History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8994, "name": "Social Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Activism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15057, "name": "Black Power", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Power?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 21219, "name": "Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 60644, "name": "Maoism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maoism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 70358, "name": "Protest Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protest_Movements?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 310201, "name": "History of Travel and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Travel_and_Tourism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 11857923, "title": "The political uses of Australian genocide", "created_at": "2015-04-08T19:20:31.471-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11857923/The_political_uses_of_Australian_genocide?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_11857923", "summary": "This is a summary document of a more detailed semantic typology of mass killing and its variant terms, as they applied to Australia.

Recent scholarship has shown that the British attempted to \u2018manage\u2019 the decolonisation process to prevent socialist movements or national liberation movements sympathetic to the Soviet Bloc from coming to power. Therefore Britain, along with the Dominions, co-ordinated their intelligence services to combat the communist threat across the Commonwealth. This paper explores how this co-ordination of anti-communist efforts was implemented in Britain, Australia and South Africa in the early Cold War era, which involved the breaking of strikes using the armed forces, the close monitoring of \u2018persons of interest\u2019 and the (attempted) banning of the Communist Party. It also seeks to demonstrate that the history of anti-communism, similar to communism, has an international dimension that is only starting to be investigated by historians.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54249939, "asset_id": 34350672, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81925, "first_name": "Evan", "last_name": "Smith", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "EvanSmith", "display_name": "Evan Smith", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/EvanSmith?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81925/22775/55219/s65_evan.smith.81925"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1698, "name": "Marxism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3896, "name": "African History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4448, "name": "British Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 5879, "name": "Socialisms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialisms?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 7543, "name": "Modern British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_British_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9730, "name": "Apartheid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Apartheid?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18970, "name": "British Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 21219, "name": "Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 23117, "name": "British and Irish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_and_Irish_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 33524, "name": "South African history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_African_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 59779, "name": "History of Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Communism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 61866, "name": "South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77501, "name": "Anti-communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-communism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 150935, "name": "Communist Party of Great Britain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 478740, "name": "Historical research on the international communist movement.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_research_on_the_international_communist_movement?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 5415831, "title": "Celebrity Sexuality: Judith Anderson, Mrs Danvers, Sexuality and \u2018Truthfulness\u2019 in Biography.", "created_at": "2013-12-13T07:18:34.233-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5415831/Celebrity_Sexuality_Judith_Anderson_Mrs_Danvers_Sexuality_and_Truthfulness_in_Biography?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_5415831", "summary": "Australian-born actress Judith Anderson's portrayal of the housekeeper Mrs Danvers in Hitchcock's 1940 film Rebecca has made her the poster girl for scholarly analyses of lesbian sexuality on film; and the plethora of books in the last few years about gays in Hollywood\u2014scholarly and sensational\u2014assume that Anderson was a lesbian.

The article argues that the anger displayed by the right towards Pascoe's approach to Aboriginal history and culture is tied to issues surrounding facts and their political use, and deeply held British and Australian convictions about how value is released out of land in Australia. Discusses debates about facts in public life in relation to alt-facts and post-truth knowledge, and value in relation to colonial ideas of property. Links the right's criticism of the science of climate change to Aboriginal dispossession, while the issue of value and property is tied to problematic conceptualisations of Aboriginal land use, particularly Pascoe's appeal to evolutionary thinking and the moral and legal underpinnings of Aboriginal land dispossession.

Recent archaeological, botanical and genetic research from Asia and Australia show precocious manipulation of plant resources that continue for millennia within a forager ideology and practice without culminating in 'agriculture'. Australia's Kimberley is an especially productive research region with a wide range of environmental niches on a topographically varied landscape that has had human settlement spanning over the last 50,000 years. Previously characterised as 'foragers' until contact with travellers from Indonesia and then Europeans over the last few hundred years; new research questions this simplistic characterisation of Aboriginal people, and suggests instead a particularly complex and enduring set of people-plant relationships. This complexity is given material witness in the form of Kimberley rock art, which stands out globally in having an enormous body of direct and indirect depictions of plants, including: grasses, trees, tubers; pigment-soaked plants imprinted on rock shelter walls; anthropomorphism of plants; and plant-based material culture such as digging sticks, dilly bags, and wood-hafted stone axe. These are more than simple illustrations of a forager economic base. Instead, rock art is a primary record of long-term sophisticated physical and symbolic manipulation of plants that fits neither into the simplistic categories of 'foraging' or of 'agriculture'. Rather, we have a society in which people actively chose not to pursue orthodox agriculture while according plants a central place in their lives.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51436353, "asset_id": 31003604, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 77292, "first_name": "Sven", "last_name": "Ouzman", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "SvenOuzman", "display_name": "Sven Ouzman", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/SvenOuzman?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/77292/21424/2397924/s65_sven.ouzman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 148, "name": "Botany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Botany?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1360, "name": "Plant Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plant_Ecology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41774, "name": "Prehistoric Rock Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Rock_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 48670, "name": "Rock Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 158442, "name": "History of Botany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Botany?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 220287, "name": "Rock art research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_art_research?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 8875552, "title": "The Politics and Aesthetics of Aftermath Photography: Rosemary Laing's welcome to Australia (2004), [in Third Text]", "created_at": "2014-10-20T13:12:30.046-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8875552/The_Politics_and_Aesthetics_of_Aftermath_Photography_Rosemary_Laings_welcome_to_Australia_2004_in_Third_Text_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_8875552", "summary": "This article reconsiders the politics and aesthetics of aftermath photography.

While these terms accurately reflect the aesthetics of aftermath photography, their politics cannot, the author argues, be so easily dismissed.

implications of the European colonization of Australia, beginning in 1788, have affected nearly all socio-cultural patterns of Indigenous peoples\u2019 lives.

Although several Australian historians and anthropologists had sought to equate these practices to the acts of genocide in the past (Evans, 1988; Reynolds, 1981) it was not until the mid-1990s when the discourse of Aboriginal genocide started to gain momentum and elicit public interest.

While transportation to New South Wales ended in 1840, Van Diemen\u2019s Land continued to serve as a secondary place of confinement, with prisoners shipped from the mainland colonies as well as from Britain. James Boyce estimates that the number of convicts still under sentence in Tasmania rose to a high of more than 30,000 in 1847, with three-quarters of the adult male population being convict or ex-convict. Nicholas Stanley, a Cornwall tanner, was transported to Hobart in 1837 for 14 years for receiving stolen livestock. This paper traces the remarkable number of written records about him, now available through Trove and the digitised Tasmanian convict records. It pieces together aspects of his long life in Tasmania and considers whether his life was typical of convict experience, and speculates about the ease with which the story of his imprisonment could be kept from subsequent generations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37606848, "asset_id": 12340451, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 275634, "first_name": "Susan", "last_name": "Lever", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "SusanLever", "display_name": "Susan Lever", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/SusanLever?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/275634/56972/17828719/s65_susan.lever.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32159, "name": "Family history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149101, "name": "Van Diemen's Land", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Van_Diemens_Land?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 666360, "name": "Tasmanian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasmanian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 19438291, "title": "A Mission Divided: Race, Culture and Colonialism in Fiji's Methodist Mission", "created_at": "2015-12-03T15:15:36.262-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19438291/A_Mission_Divided_Race_Culture_and_Colonialism_in_Fijis_Methodist_Mission?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_19438291", "summary": "This book provides insight into the long process of decolonisation within the Methodist Overseas Missions of Australasia, a colonial institution that operated in the British colony of Fiji.

There are certainly some who consider Kelly to be a hero, a young man rebelling against unwarranted police persecution and profiling. Yet many others, position Kelly as a villain, one who did not hesitate to engage in, and to lead others in, a diverse range of criminal activities from the stealing of livestock to the murdering of policemen.

The original function of the office of coroner was linked to raising revenue for the King in the form of large fines. Over time this office began to focus on investigating violent, suspicious and unnatural deaths. It was this \u201cmodernised\u201d English coronial institution that formed the foundation of coronial law and practice in Australia. Queensland adopted the English common law system from New South Wales upon separation in 1859. Consequently the office of coroner was also transplanted to the new colony. This thesis looks at the first one hundred years of the office of coroner in Queensland, discussing the factors that led to its transformation between 1859 and 1959. The resulting history provides a platform to examine how the institution was formed and how it evolved into the system we recognise today. The data collected revealed a picture of a parsimonious government that marginalised the office of coroner in Queensland legislation. The government undervalued the institution of the inquest as a forum for public scrutiny and an instrument of justice and accountability. This thesis presents an administrative and social history that fills a significant gap in the history of the coroner. It also contributes to aspects of colonial legal and medical history, drawing on previously untapped sources.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30773016, "asset_id": 2228429, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 411556, "first_name": "Lee", "last_name": "Butterworth", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "LeeButterworth", "display_name": "Lee  Butterworth", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/LeeButterworth?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/411556/129784/928341/s65_lee.butterworth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50529, "name": "Death Investigation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_Investigation?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83099, "name": "Coroners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coroners?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 235711, "name": "Coroner's inquests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coroners_inquests?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 634618, "name": "Coronial Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coronial_Law?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 509789, "title": "Other Contact Zones", "created_at": "2011-04-04T11:56:54.999-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/509789/Other_Contact_Zones?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_509789", "summary": "In the construction and acknowledgment of responsibility towards the Other, this edition of 'New Talents' challenges the contradiction of a lucky country sustained by processes of forgetting and, more critically, the processes of silencing.

Screen cultures have functioned as a key transmitter of the Anzac Legend from the propaganda film, The Hero of the Dardanelles (1915), used during the First World War to boost enlistment, through to Kiwi-Australian Russell Crowe\u2019s controversial feature The Water Diviner (2014), a film that explicitly set out to present the Gallipoli campaign from an alternative perspective. Gallipoli is arguably more central to the national identity of Australia than any other combatant nation despite the multiplicity of colonial and national forces present on both sides of the conflict. This is reflected in the outpouring of Australian screen texts on the campaign at particular historical moments, namely, during the First World War, in the 1980s and in the lead up to the centenary of Anzac in 2015. While Anzac elements have dominated British and Irish commemoration of Gallipoli and screen representations from the UK have been infrequent, any examination of Australian screen texts on the campaign cannot be divorced from the essential British elements of the Anzac Legend. Indeed, residual British characteristics lingered in screen representations for decades after the war. Britishness also functioned as a vital counterpoint for Australian nationalism in Peter Weir\u2019s watershed 1981 feature film Gallipoli, which overwrote earlier understandings and in the process reoriented the Legend. By the same token, Anzac was a joint enterprise with New Zealand contributing key consonants to the command structure acronym coined during the campaign. Although New Zealand patterns of commemoration around Anzac have followed a similar trajectory to Australia, few screen representations have emerged.

The course, and the field, are premised on the comparability between societies that were formed in the modern era through (1) a transfer of population from one part of the world to a new country, and (2) through the displacement of the indigenous peoples who previously inhabited that country. Societies such as these formed in the United States, Canada, Australia, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa and in other countries. Comparison between these settler polities and projects will allow us to focus on their particularities and help us answer questions such as why some cases feature acts of genocide and others do not; why some settler states remained nominally under the British Crown and others became independent republics; and why some settler projects abandoned blatantly oppressive forms of governance and why some have not done so yet. As students and teachers at UCLA, we should be aware that settler colonialism is all around us. Thus the course does not purport to have an anti-settler agenda, even though many of the readings in the syllabus are highly critical of settler societies and argue that indigenous displacement is inherent to all aspects of the history of settler colonialism. Assignments and Grading Research paper, 40%: Write a 12 to 15-page essay which contains at least one primary source. This 'mini research paper' should relate to the themes discussed in the readings and our meetings. The purpose of this assignment is to present a small yet interesting addition to what we know about a certain settler colonial society. A primary source can be a literary piece, a TV show, commercials, newspaper articles, and an archival document. The majority of the societies we will be analyzing communicated in English and the UCLA libraries contain many useful collections for your research. You are encouraged to contact Nina Mamikunian, the history librarian at Young Research Library. Mini conference paper, 20%: To aid a timely progression towards writing the research essay, prepare, by week 5, a short 10-minute presentation on the primary source you have chosen for the final paper. The presentation should introduce the primary source, place it in its broader historical context and suggest a few novel insights that could be gleaned from it. The presentations will be conducted in the format of a conference, with panels and Q&As.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48949205, "asset_id": 28587313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 410534, "first_name": "Arnon", "last_name": "Degani", "domain_name": "huji", "page_name": "ArnonDegani", "display_name": "Arnon Y E H U D A Degani", "profile_url": "https://huji.academia.edu/ArnonDegani?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/410534/873210/14942682/s65_arnon.degani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 129, "name": "American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1931, "name": "New Zealand Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Zealand_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6184, "name": "Israel/Palestine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel_Palestine?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33524, "name": "South African history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_African_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 54114, "name": "Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canada?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 27362835, "title": "McGrath, A., \u201cBlack Velvet\u2019: Aboriginal women and their relations with white men in the Northern Territory, 1910-40\u201d.

The islands were a favoured nesting site, and a group of people had waited until the eggs hatched to kill both adult and young birds in order to collect the maximum payout from a 1 penny bounty that had been put on the head of each pelican by the South Australian Fisheries Department. The killings prompted advocates of bird protection, particularly ornithologists, to seek security for the rookeries against future raids by leasing the islands. A range of other interests became entangled in this decision, as some ornithologists also sought to prevent local Aboriginal people from harvesting bird eggs in the area. Examining these events and their consequences, this article has two related goals. The first goal is to show the role of animals and their environments in co-shaping legal geographies. The second is to examine the contours and histories of competing ideas about protection, killing, and private property that shaped the legal geography of the Coorong.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42720542, "asset_id": 22031526, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2818202, "first_name": "Emily", "last_name": "O'Gorman", "domain_name": "mq", "page_name": "EmilyOGorman", "display_name": "Emily  O'Gorman", "profile_url": "https://mq.academia.edu/EmilyOGorman?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2818202/922491/1168556/s65_emily.o_gorman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18609, "name": "Cultural Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Historical_Geography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 46741, "name": "Legal Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_Geography?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 13521009, "title": "'The Larrikin Girl', Journal of Australian Studies, 34.4 (2010)", "created_at": "2015-07-01T19:49:22.337-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13521009/The_Larrikin_Girl_Journal_of_Australian_Studies_34_4_2010_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_13521009", "summary": "The male larrikin, or street rowdy, is a common figure in late-colonial Australian history. His female counterpart is much harder to find. Rather than presenting us with images of female larrikins, many commentators tell us that the closest equivalent to the male larrikin was the prostitute, or that adolescent girls only participated in the larrikin subculture as \u2018donahs\u2019 (meaning \u2018moll\u2019 or \u2018girlfriend\u2019). These commentators mostly reach this conclusion from reading the Bulletin and the fictional work of its contributors. This over-reliance on the Bulletin is problematic because its images of the larrikin and \u2018donah\u2019 in the 1890s were heavily influenced by Cockney vaudeville routines. In this article, I offer alternative evidence to show that there were adolescent Australian girls who acted as larrikins in their own right rather than simply as girlfriends or sexual conveniences to the boys. These girls held prize fights, got drunk on street corners, participated in attacks on police and in rare cases even formed members of pushes \u2013 all activities considered to be hallmarks of larrikinism in Australia at the time. I also suggest that these girls' relationships with each other were more significant to them than their relationships with male larrikins. It is thus time to set aside the image of the \u2018donah\u2019 in favour of the brazen larrikin girl among her female friends.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38092602, "asset_id": 13521009, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5921829, "first_name": "Melissa", "last_name": "Bellanta", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "MelissaBellanta", "display_name": "Melissa  Bellanta", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/MelissaBellanta?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5921829/9758083/10870738/s65_melissa.bellanta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16893, "name": "Youth Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Subcultures?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18826, "name": "Girlhood Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Girlhood_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1984207, "name": "Rough Femininity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rough_Femininity?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 36425549, "title": "Stephen G.

The accounts of emigration, expatriation, and exile by Anna Brownwell Jameson, Catharine Parr Traill, Susanna Moodie, Ada Cambridge, Isak Dinesen, and Alyse Simpson illustrate the implications of this loss, as each woman struggled to recover a sense both of home and of grounded identity. The writings span more than a hundred years, from the 1830s to the 1950s, and tell of lives lived in locations as different as Canada, Australia, and British East Africa (now Kenya), places that variously proved to be confining and/or liberating. By narrating the ways in which identity adapts to and is transformed by a new environment, these texts provide access to the construction and alteration of the self in relation to place. This study probes this process by using the concept of place, rather than the more conventional one of time, as the dominant category of analysis. \r\nMy readings are both intertextual and interdisciplinary: they rely on theorizing by sociologists and psychologists concerned with the relationship between place and identity, studies on the same subject by literary scholars, and formulations by women\u2019s autobiography theorists. My investigation reveals, among other discoveries, that the gender-specific aspects of the process of adaptation persistently centre on the notion of homecoming and that they are articulated with reference to the figure of the mother.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34735026, "asset_id": 8322192, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14501684,

The missionary Lancelot Threlkeld used his linguistic skills and access to Indigenous communities to collect and circulate testimony about violence and conflict. Threlkeld passed on such information in a variety of ways, for a variety of purposes and through a diverse network of correspondence and print. This article analyses how such testimony was framed within the language of colonial violence into humanitarian narratives, how it was mobilised for specific local and international effects, and how print culture mobilised (or countered) evidence of colonial conflict as part of broader debates about the British Empire, Indigenous peoples and the law. It argues for a nuanced approach to legal sources which enables us to see the crucial role of the Australian settler colonies in nascent human rights discourses and legal practices. The Supreme Court in New South Wales (established 1823) was a vehicle through which evangelical humanitarianism was mediated and circulated in the 1820s to 1830s cases in which Rev. Lancelot Threlkeld became involved. This was neither uncontroversial nor uncontested at the time; yet, crucially, the tension between humanitarian sensibilities and settler interests was fully present in the court room and in the court records, published at the time in the newspapers. Colonial law had only recently moved away from the preceding military system and, as a consequence, was open to debate and influence by a range of sectional interests. So, too, the English common law that had been brought to the colonies was a dynamic and contested discourse. Natural law, common law and public law was already a complex mix, which then took on new meanings in the context of what Ian Hunter terms the 'volatile tripartite relations' between settlers, governmental officials and Indigenous peoples. 1 Settlers and their lawyers, colonial governors working both independently and as conduits for the British Colonial Office, humanitarian agitators and the diverse polyglot of a mobile multicultural colonial world (including Indigenous people) used the law courts as crucial social institutions within which they tested their rights and responsibilities. This is particularly evident in the early foundational criminal law cases, in many of which Threlkeld and his Aboriginal collaborator Biraban played a role. They appeared at ten cases between 1827 and 1838 and were present at eight of the twenty-one NSW Supreme Court cases between 1827 and 1836 in which Aboriginal people were tried, convicted and executed. Their presence was usually solicited because of recognised problems with Aboriginal witness testimony and trying Aboriginal defendants in a system of which they had little knowledge and to which it had not yet been established they were subject. Threlkeld and Biraban assisted by translating and explaining legal procedures. 2 Heather Douglas and Mark Finnane rightly emphasise the distinctiveness of Australian colonial debates about law and sovereignty. 3 Yet comparisons with other colonial", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56104819, "asset_id": 36203390, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3882808, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Johnston", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "AnnaJohnston", "display_name": "Anna  Johnston", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/AnnaJohnston?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3882808/1444659/36046520/s65_anna.johnston.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7397, "name": "Missionary History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Missionary_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22974, "name": "History of Humanitarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Humanitarianism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 290589, "name": "Colonialism and Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Law?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 23060812, "title": "ASIS and ASIO in Chile: Transparency and Double Standards Four Decades after the Coup in: 40 Years Are Nothing: History and Memory of the 1973 Coups D'\u00e8tat in Uruguay and Chile. 2014-15", "created_at": "2016-03-09T15:47:31.898-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23060812/ASIS_and_ASIO_in_Chile_Transparency_and_Double_Standards_Four_Decades_after_the_Coup_in_40_Years_Are_Nothing_History_and_Memory_of_the_1973_Coups_D%C3%A8tat_in_Uruguay_and_Chile_2014_15?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_23060812", "summary": "On 4 June 2014, the Opposition Shadow Attorney-General, Labor Senator Mark Dreyfus, presented a petition to the Federal Parliament on behalf of the Chilean community in Australia. Around 600 Chilean expatriates, most of them Australian citizens, demanded the government approve the extradition request of former intelligence agent Adriana Rivas,\nwho escaped from trial in Chile where she is accused of seven cases of torture and aggravated kidnapping and disappearance.\n\nThis petition followed what started a year earlier when Adriana Rivas was found by investigative reporter Florencia Melgar living in one of Sydney\u2019s housing commission buildings. The Special Broadcasting Services\u2019 report of her declarations triggered the reaction of human rights movements and political activists in Chile and Australia and the extradition request. These groups are manifestly against the presence of Chilean violators of human rights living in the same land where they, as refugees, were welcomed after Augusto Pinochet\u2019s coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in 1973.\n\nThe fact that Adriana Rivas has been living for decades in Australia might not be a mere coincidence or plain misfortune. According to author Mark Aarons, there have been hundreds of war criminals hidden in Australia since 1945. Aarons has said that the war criminals living in the country come from many places and organisations, including Chile\u2019s DINA, the Directorate of National Intelligence, the dictatorship\u2019s secret police between 1973 and 1977. These security officers who found \u201csanctuary\u201d in Australia, Aarons added, are guilty of \u201ctorture and summary executions\u201d. More tellingly, Aarons argued that a number of those people were brought to Australia \u201cas intelligence assets by our intelligence services and resettled here for purposes of ongoing intelligence operations by our own services\u201d.\n\nThe current presence of a former intelligence agent in Sydney might show another aspect of the practices of support of the Australian secret services to the same Chilean forces that unleashed the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and sustained a violent dictatorship.\n\nAs ambiguously revealed in Australia during the years after the coup, the secret services of Australia worked in Chilean territory to undermine the democratic government of Salvador Allende (1970-1973). This chapter looks into how Australia\u2019s involvement in Chile\u2019s coup four decades ago remains under a cloak of secrecy, encouraged by the same secret services that seemed to have worked above government and parliament powers. Together with the contentious issue of transparency in today\u2019s world, this four-decade old history is still prominent and continues to haunt thousands of Chilean-former refugees\nliving in Australia and many others in Chile that were victims of DINA and other secret services.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43562675, "asset_id": 23060812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9736368, "first_name": "PABLO", "last_name": "LEIGHTON", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "leightonpablo", "display_name": "PABLO LEIGHTON", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/leightonpablo?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9736368/3049359/3585117/s65_pablo.leighton.jpg"}, {"id": 8148732, "first_name": "Florencia", "last_name": "Melgar", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FlorenciaMelgar", "display_name": "Florencia Melgar", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FlorenciaMelgar?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8148732/11901113/13262284/s65_florencia.melgar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 994, "name": "Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3347, "name": "Latin American politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_politics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15262, "name": "Latin American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 37374, "name": "Transnational Organized Crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Organized_Crime?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 112528, "name": "Australian foreign policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_foreign_policy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 180881, "name": "Data Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Journalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 553375, "name": "Operacion Condor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Operacion_Condor?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 634630, "name": "Operation Condor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Operation_Condor?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1012216, "name": "Cross Border Crimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross_Border_Crimes?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1778826, "name": "Plan Condor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plan_Condor?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2421134, "name": "Transnational Investigative Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Investigative_Journalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2421135, "name": "Cross Border Journalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross_Border_Journalism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 566826, "title": "Australian Cold Warrior: The Anti-Communism of W.

It is a meander through the cultural abyss between black and white Australia, trying to see what I had never been shown, and unsee what I had been shown. I wonder how can I be complicit and complacent in a society that privileges me over others because of the colour of my skin? \n\nI combine a creative practice of storytelling to question the status quo that is the dominant culture, the mercurial methodology of poetics, and the autoethnographic eye that guides a reflexive process of personal decolonisation. I bring to the research a burgeoning awareness of colonised minds, bodies, spirits and lenses and am confident my fresh eyes, curiosity and commitment to unlearn, unsee and unsettle can be deftly deployed to challenge and disrupt the prejudices and perceptions of my fellow white Australians. \n\nThis is not a problem-solving piece of research, although I am exploring the nature of a problem. The problem \u2013 which is often erroneously cast as the \u2018Aboriginal Problem\u2019 when it is a Whiteness Problem \u2013 is the core of my research. But I am not focusing just on First Nations peoples and their legacy of colonisation; rather, I examine our shared legacy, turning the gaze back on white Australia, holding up a mirror, to ask with all sincerity: Who is the problem? Where is the problem? What have we done? Why weren\u2019t we told?

A farmer and grazier, he served with distinction in the first contingent of the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles in the Boer War starting as a private and ending up as a commissioned officer with the rank of Lieutenant. He returned to South Africa with the controversial second contingent of 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles which departed in February 1901.\n\nWithin a month of the break out of World War One, Gus Ebeling had enlisted in the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Ebeling was the officer-in-charge of 8th Infantry Battalion, \u2018F\u2019 Company.  The 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Battalions were recruited from Victoria and formed the 2nd Brigade of the First AIF. Gus Ebeling took part in the ANZAC landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915, as part of the second wave. During the landings, Ebeling was wounded in the head and foot as the result of a bursting shell. A few weeks later, he was promoted to Major and was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his efforts at the first landing and the intervening months.   \nAs with so many others at Gallipoli, he became very ill over the summer, developing diarrhoea and dysentery and was hospitalised at Lemnos later returning to Australia early 1916. He later commanded the Bendigo and Royal Park military camps.\n\nIn March 1931, he became involved with the League of National Safety (LNS), the so-called White Army, and created havoc in Victoria's Wimmera region with bizarre rumours about an army of communists, the unemployed and Catholics marching from Melbourne to overrun the area.  Ebeling also seems to have misrepresented his rank and military awards. It was said that the eccentric Ebeling used to drive around Avoca, Victoria in an old Chevrolet Coupe and even tried to enlist for the Second World War at the age of seventy.

Good transportation routes on land and water boosted the supra-regional contacts which ranged from the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea. Also, medieval settlements as well as mottes are known from this region. The here presented metal artifacts, which  were gathered around Bernhardsthal, Ringelsdorf, Dr\u00f6sing and Jedenspeigen, come from a private collection. The corpus of finds document the spectrum of metal everyday objects from clothes and jewellery of the Middle Ages. Finds from the late High Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages predominate. Beside the common Europe-wide forms, some few stand out through meticulous workmanship and gilding. Most of the medieval finds were dated to the time as the settlement Dr\u00f6sing (around 1296) was relocated to a dry area to the West. Finds which are dated to the Early modern prove that the area of the abandoned settlement did not fall into oblivion.

Fruchtbare B\u00f6den beg\u00fcnstigten die Besiedlung. Gute Transportwege zu Land und Wasser f\u00f6rderten \u00fcberregionale Kontakte, die von der Ostsee bis an die Adria reichten. Auch mittelalterliche Siedlungen sowie Hausberge sind aus der Region bekannt. Die hier vorgestellten Metallartefakte, die um Bernhardsthal, Ringelsdorf, Dr\u00f6sing und Jedenspeigen gesammelt wurden, stammen aus einem Privatbesitz. Die Funde belegen die Bandbreite metallener Alltagsgegenst\u00e4nde von Kleidung\r\nund Schmuck des Mittelalters. Funde des sp\u00e4ten Hochmittelalters und des Sp\u00e4tmittelalters \u00fcberwiegen. Neben den europaweit \u00fcblichen Formen stechen einige wenige durch sorgf\u00e4ltige Bearbeitung und Vergoldung hervor. Die meisten mittelalterlichen Funde datieren in jene Zeit, als die Siedlung Dr\u00f6sing (um 1296) in ein trockeneres Gebiet nach Westen verlagert wurde. Funde, die in die fr\u00fche Neuzeit datieren, belegen, dass der Bereich der  aufgelassenen Siedlung, nicht in Vergessenheit geriet. In Zukunft sollen systematische Ausgrabungen im Bereich der Kirche, dem mittelalterlichen Friedhof, der W\u00fcstung und dem Hausberg durchgef\u00fchrt werden.\r\nSchl\u00fcsselw\u00f6rter: Mittelalter, Nieder\u00f6sterreich, Metallfunde, Privatsammlung.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29571348, "asset_id": 2045737, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 317812, "first_name": "Claudia", "last_name": "Theune", "domain_name": "univie", "page_name": "ClaudiaTheune", "display_name": "Claudia Theune", "profile_url": "https://univie.academia.edu/ClaudiaTheune?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/317812/73441/7955663/s65_claudia.theune.jpg"}, {"id": 20761340, "first_name": "Isabella", "last_name": "Greu\u00dfing", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IsabellaGreu\u00dfing", "display_name": "Isabella Greu\u00dfing", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IsabellaGreu%C3%9Fing?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20761340/11603324/12939583/s65_isabella.greu_ing.jpg_oh_d0625e28c2bbba41e3b2c91adc604687_oe_57276955"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 403469, "name": "Medival Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medival_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34564108, "title": "Observations of red-giant variable stars by Aboriginal Australians", "created_at": "2017-09-13T23:54:20.854-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34564108/Observations_of_red_giant_variable_stars_by_Aboriginal_Australians?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34564108", "summary": "Aboriginal Australians carefully observe the properties and positions of stars, including both overt and subtle changes in their brightness, for subsistence and social application.

a small cohort, often deemed insignificant, the Irish in South Australia developed an extensive network of social, business and political connections with the wider colonial society which aided them in their support of the long constitutional struggle for self-government taking place in Ireland during the four decades from 1870. Through the lens of the colonial press and an investigation of the support given to Irish nationalists this study shows the extent to which that small cohort extended its influence to the wider South Australian community to the benefit of the Home Rule movement. This was no mean feat considering the established view of scholars that the group faced the \u2018unquestionable primacy of Anglo-Scottish colonisation\u2019.1 Looking at the visits of the envoys of the Irish Parliamentary Party which took place between 1883 and 1912, this study, through a consideration of fundraising, the reputation of the Irish in the colony, the colonial press\u2019 treatment of Irish issues and a lack of Orange opposition to Home Rule, investigates the impact and reach of this small Irish community during the years of Ireland\u2019s foremost constitutional political movement. In its conclusion the research shows that underlying the long assumed quiet assimilation of this ethnic group into the general \u2018Britishness\u2019 of the colony, the Irish, from the outset, were aware of and consistently\n1 Eric Richards. \"Irish Life and Progress in Colonial South Australia \" Irish Historical Studies 27, no. 107 (1991): 21\n\u2018Yet we are told that Australians do not sympathise with Ireland\u2019\n8\nmaintained a separate cultural identity and, during the period under consideration, this was augmented by an increased politicisation amongst the group \u2013 a world development which affected the Irish at both the macro and micro level. This thesis further reveals that in South Australia the Irish Home Rule movement garnered strong support in a colony where the majority of the inhabitants were neither Irish nor Catholic and this was due to a number of factors. Amongst these were factors which contrast sharply with characteristics of the Irish and the Home Rule movement in other Australian colonies, particularly the size, unity and nature of South Australian Irish nationalists, the lack of a structured opposition to Home Rule, the colony\u2019s natural affinity with the notion of self-government and the fraternal bonds which came about through the issue of land ownership and control. While fundraising was the prime object of a series of visits to Australia by Irish MPs between 1883 and 1912, acceptance of the Irish claim for Home Rule amongst Australians in general proved equally important. Despite the small community of Irish people residing in South Australia during the most active years of the movement the colony subscribed generously to the cause. While the loyalty and support of the Irish-born and perhaps even the next generation might be expected more surprising is the widespread involvement of the non-Irish and non-Catholic citizens of the colony.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43288315, "asset_id": 22718129, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 948649, "first_name": "Fidelma", "last_name": "McCorry", "domain_name": "adelaide1", "page_name": "FidelmaMcCorry", "display_name": "Fidelma McCorry", "profile_url": "https://adelaide1.academia.edu/FidelmaMcCorry?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/948649/4400119/39655141/s65_fidelma.mccorry.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 386, "name": "Irish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5631, "name": "Irish Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Diaspora?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6699, "name": "Australian society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_society?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8214, "name": "Irish Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9327, "name": "Fundraising", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fundraising?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10690, "name": "Irish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 37078, "name": "Famine Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Famine_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 75861, "name": "Irish Catholic Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Catholic_Diaspora?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 116066, "name": "Orange Order", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orange_Order?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 129906, "name": "South Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 168863, "name": "Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 200139, "name": "Irish Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Australian_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 242693, "name": "Home rule", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_rule?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 342835, "name": "Irish Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Nationalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 363336, "name": "John Dillon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Dillon?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 401838, "name": "Famines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Famines?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 429958, "name": "Irish Parliamentary Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Parliamentary_Party?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 476267, "name": "South Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 576344, "name": "Irish national identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_national_identity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 874759, "name": "Irish-Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish-Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1142037, "name": "Home Rule Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Rule_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1285954, "name": "Land Claims and Self Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Claims_and_Self_Government?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1415427, "name": "Geographies of the Irish Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographies_of_the_Irish_Diaspora?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1536109, "name": "Irish Nationalism Since 1800", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Nationalism_Since_1800?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1540165, "name": "Michael Davitt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Michael_Davitt?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1734455, "name": "Irish political and constitutional history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_political_and_constitutional_history?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 5234894, "title": "Negative Societalisation.

Since ancient times, these have been organised in pairs of opposites, which include, among others, the cultivated and the barbarians, the chosen and the outcasts, the civilised and the savages and finally the whites and the coloureds. Their logic turns the discriminated others into undifferentiated representatives of an inferior humanity. In comparison to them, the members of socially differentiated and hierarchically ordered societies can see themselves as a uniform and superior group. Even those who are economically and culturally declassed are therefore granted symbolic appreciation. This negative social integration requires the popularisation of racist stereotypes. The same applies to racial theory. Through the construction of races, such theory first develops an academic concept for the differentiation of humankind and the elevation of its so-called white part. Afterwards, whiteness is generalised and race is constituted as a social category. This is by no means only an ideological operation from above.

Those first twenty-two Australians had a mix of motivations, but Wendy Nott's seems particularly instructive. Hearing news of the organisation's founding over the radio 'while standing at the sink one evening' hit Nott, a homemaker from the working-class suburb of Essendon, Melbourne, like 'a bolt from the blue'. She had been involved in the Student Christian Movement and Aboriginal rights causes at university, and saw Amnesty as representing 'the idea of the brotherhood of man', an ambition not so distant from Benenson's own hope for 'a sort of secularised religious community which would \"rekindle a fire in the minds of men\"'. 3 Nott's history and perceptions immediately reveal some of the contradictions that underlay Amnesty's emergence. Its novel deployment of human rights ideas and, like many organisations of the 1960s, its eschewing of binary Cold War hostilities, sat alongside a much older-indeed ancientimperative to aid those in need. In this chapter, I use Amnesty as a window into the way humanitarian action was transformed and complicated by its ever-closer relationship with human rights in the second half of the twentieth century. Historian Samuel Moyn argues that 'the slow amalgamation of humanitarian concern for suffering with human rights', sped up from the 1970s onwards, culminating in the two becoming 'fused enterprises'.

This essay explores analogous areas of cultural production, such as painting, to determine how historians might begin to produce work that lies outside the Western, Euro-Christian imaginary. It focuses on the case of Australia and the means by which Aboriginal artists have reanimated and recalibrated traditional forms of knowledge, offering new bases for thinking about the history and temporalities of Australia. The work of the painter Tim Johnson is then presented as an example for history in his demonstration of the ways in which indigenous methods and ways of seeing the world can be deployed by Others. The ethical, theoretical, and practical challenges that accompany such work are detailed, alongside a historiographical account of the way in which these discussions mesh with seminal debates in postcolonialism, subaltern studies, and settler colonialism as they relate to historical theory. Drawing on recent work in History and Theory, the article asks: what might be the consequences for history were it not to develop a meaningful \u201cglobal turn,\u201d arguing that a critical moment has been reached in which modes of understanding the world that come from outside the West need to be incorporated into historians\u2019 repertoires for thinking and making.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53877108, "asset_id": 33476421, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4439894, "first_name": "William", "last_name": "Gallois", "domain_name": "exeter", "page_name": "WilliamGallois", "display_name": "William Gallois", "profile_url": "https://exeter.academia.edu/WilliamGallois?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4439894/1812157/2159950/s65_william.gallois.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9465, "name": "Philosophy of History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 23637750, "title": "The modern Hydra: the Exclusive Brethren's online critics A case study of cult awareness activism and community formation in cyberspace", "created_at": "2016-03-23T17:19:32.836-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23637750/The_modern_Hydra_the_Exclusive_Brethrens_online_critics_A_case_study_of_cult_awareness_activism_and_community_formation_in_cyberspace?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_23637750", "summary": "A sociological study of online mobilization against the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church (the 'Exclusive Brethren').

The main town of the Lockyer Valley is Gatton, which lies 100 kilometres west of Brisbane.

Yet, most visitors are surprised to discover that rock art was still being produced at this site in the 1960s. In this paper, we explore the most recent rock art created at the Anbangbang Gallery. Most importantly, we present new evidence from a first-hand account of the paintings being created in 1963/64 and discuss the implications of these new insights for our understanding of the practice, the artists , and the social context of rock art in northern Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61071728, "asset_id": 40790433, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 601559, "first_name": "Sally", "last_name": "May", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "SallyMay", "display_name": "Sally K May", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/SallyMay?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/601559/316636/17443202/s65_sally.may.jpg"}, {"id": 3192625, "first_name": "Iain", "last_name": "Johnston", "domain_name": "aiatsis", "page_name": "IainJohnston", "display_name": "Iain G Johnston", "profile_url": "https://aiatsis.academia.edu/IainJohnston?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3192625/1050168/1311558/s65_iain.johnston.jpg"}, {"id": 959122, "first_name": "Joakim", "last_name": "Goldhahn", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "JoakimGoldhahn", "display_name": "Joakim Goldhahn", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/JoakimGoldhahn?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/959122/802853/30539532/s65_joakim.goldhahn.jpg"}, {"id": 140940895, "first_name": "Kadeem", "last_name": "May", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KadeemMay", "display_name": "Kadeem May", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KadeemMay?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 134648141, "first_name": "Murray", "last_name": "Garde", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GardeMurray", "display_name": "Murray Garde", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GardeMurray?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 644535, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Tacon", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "PaulTacon", "display_name": "Paul Tacon", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/PaulTacon?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/644535/221961/18217935/s65_paul.tacon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1628, "name": "Ethnoarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnoarchaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3834, "name": "Rock Art (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Art_Archaeology_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5439, "name": "Australian Indigenous Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 26821, "name": "Australian Aboriginal art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41774, "name": "Prehistoric Rock Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Rock_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 220287, "name": "Rock art research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_art_research?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 241534, "name": "Contact Period Rock Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contact_Period_Rock_Art?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 31777929, "title": "Reading between the recipes of 'Our Cookery Book'", "created_at": "2017-03-08T15:00:15.913-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31777929/Reading_between_the_recipes_of_Our_Cookery_Book?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_31777929", "summary": "Abstract: Our cookery book is both a culinary and historical source.

Early attempts to reach the Australian Aborigines by William Walker between 1821 and 1825 met with little success. The Maori people of New Zealand and the Pacific Islanders of Fiji, Tonga and Samoa proved much more open to Methodist missionary work so that a relatively strong Methodist work was established throughout many parts of the Pacific by the late nineteenth century. Wesleyans also established a successful mission to the Chinese people of the Victorian goldfields in the 1850s. This paper will explicitly address Methodist missionary responses to the religious beliefs encountered in \u2018the Southern World\u2019 of the nineteenth century. It will seek to discover to what extent these religious beliefs were dismissed as pagan and superstitious and to what extent there was any attempt to understand these beliefs on their own terms. It is hoped that this paper will contribute to the Wesley and Methodist Historical Studies Working Group in its attempt to understand how \u2018Methodist missionary enterprises represented and communicated with persons from other religious traditions and other cultures.\u2019 It will also assist the broader project in which I am engaged, along with Professor Hilary Carey of the University of Newcastle (NSW) of publishing a new scholarly history of Methodism in Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32899847, "asset_id": 5922006, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 439923, "first_name": "Glen", "last_name": "O'Brien", "domain_name": "divinity", "page_name": "GlenOBrien", "display_name": "Glen O'Brien", "profile_url": "https://divinity.academia.edu/GlenOBrien?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/439923/141030/18481984/s65_glen.o_brien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8495, "name": "History of Missions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Missions?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19464, "name": "History of New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_Zealand?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 142391, "name": "History of Australian Methodism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Australian_Methodism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 166847, "name": "Missionaries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Missionaries?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 285346, "title": "Companions In the Wilderness?

Here the Australians dug in \u201cusing their bayonets, bully beef tins and steel helmets\u201d, an officer wrote later, and met the Japanese with \u201cBren-gun and Tommy-gun, with bayonet and grenade \u2026 with the buffet of fist and boot and rifle-butt \u2026 [in] vicious fighting, man to man and hand to hand\u201d.  Isurava was one of the first major actions of the Kokoda campaign. It was where exhausted, poorly trained Militiamen from the Australian 39th Battalion and the Middle East veterans of the 2/14th Battalion of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) fought vainly to halt the Japanese 144th Infantry Regiment of the South Seas Force advancing across Papua\u2019s Owen Stanley Range. Epitomising those values of \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201csacrifice\u201d, here 24-year-old Private Bruce Kingsbury was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions during a critical moment during the battle. At Isurava, Prime Minister Howard said, the battle \u201cbrought out all that is best in the Australian traditions and the Australian fighting spirit\u201d. \nThe bitter campaign fought in Papua along the Kokoda Trail between July and November 1942 has become one of the defining wartime experiences of Australia during the Second World War. The attributes displayed by the Australian soldiers \u2013 their courage, determination, resourcefulness and, above all else, mateship \u2013 have become closely identified with perceived \u201cAustralian values\u201d. It is this association that in part helps explain the significance of the name \u201cKokoda\u201d today. \nIt is easy to be parochial. Kokoda and Milne Bay were significant battles in Papua, but it was the naval battles of Coral Sea and Midway fought in May and June 1942, and the epic struggle for Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands from August to February 1943, that blunted the Japanese thrust south into the Pacific. The fighting in Papua was conducted on the fringe of a vast war fought by the Allies to defeat Japan. This war was waged from the frozen Aleutian Islands in the North Pacific, across China and Burma, over the vastness of the Central Pacific, to the dense jungles of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific. The British Commonwealth \u2013 including Australian airmen and sailors \u2013 and the United States continued the fight against Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in North Africa, the Atlantic Ocean, and in the skies above occupied Europe. The titanic German and Soviet clashes on the Eastern Front dwarfed anything experienced by Australian forces in the war. It is important to remember that the fighting in Papua was just one front in a global war.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53898207, "asset_id": 33930255, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2668666, "first_name": "Karl", "last_name": "James", "domain_name": "awm", "page_name": "KarlJames", "display_name": "Karl James", "profile_url": "https://awm.academia.edu/KarlJames?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2668666/852153/19048169/s65_karl.james.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 579, "name": "Strategy (Military Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategy_Military_Science_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 12739, "name": "Second World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_World_War?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16389, "name": "World War II", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_II?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20606, "name": "Papua New Guinea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua_New_Guinea?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 38062, "name": "Second World War (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_World_War_History_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 43023, "name": "Nazi Germany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nazi_Germany?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 46271, "name": "Strategy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 87883, "name": "Adolf Hitler", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adolf_Hitler?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 99522, "name": "Australian Army", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Army?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 181544, "name": "Papua", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1710262, "name": "Defence and Stragic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defence_and_Stragic_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 81420898, "title": "Refugees, Asylum Seekers, and Emotions", "created_at": "2022-06-13T15:36:36.178-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81420898/Refugees_Asylum_Seekers_and_Emotions?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_81420898", "summary": "The issue of asylum seekers and refugees is one of the most contested political issues in Australia. This chapter examines ensuing debates, focusing closely on how refugees and asylum seekers are perceived and responded to in relation to the spatial and emotional dynamics that prevail in Australian society and politics. Specifically, the chapter examines how the issue of asylum is intimately connected to and influenced by highly emotional im ages circulating in the national media. To do this, the authors first discuss the history of refugees at Australia's borders. In doing so, the authors underline the key role that politi cal and media representations play in shaping refugee debates and policy. The chapter then undertakes an empirical investigation of two crucial recent periods when refugee debates proliferated in both the media and in politics: August to December 2001 and Oc tober 2009 to September 2011. By conducting a content analysis of front-page coverage in The Australian and the Sydney Morning Herald, the authors focus on the particular vi sual framing that has been used to depict asylum seekers and its emotional and political consequences, highlighting how recurring frames have been used to dehumanize and fur ther displace asylum seekers and refugees in the Australian context. The authors then ar gue that these visual media depictions associate refugees not with humanitarian chal lenges and responsibilities, but instead with threats to sovereignty and security.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87469542, "asset_id": 81420898, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 263927, "first_name": "Roland", "last_name": "Bleiker", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "RolandBleiker", "display_name": "Roland Bleiker", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/RolandBleiker?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/263927/55391/27501207/s65_roland.bleiker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 813, "name": "Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Philosophy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 951, "name": "Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanities?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1483, "name": "Foreign Policy Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Policy_Analysis?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1696, "name": "Political Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Theory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3705, "name": "International Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Security?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 39869, "name": "Refugees", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 42162, "name": "Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 80078340, "title": "Victims of their own ambition - Lutheran missions and NSDAP", "created_at": "2022-05-27T17:21:49.295-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80078340/Victims_of_their_own_ambition_Lutheran_missions_and_NSDAP?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_80078340", "summary": "I argue the Neuendettelsauer Mission made a strategic choice in the early 1930s to reverse its transnational politics of the 1920s. It did so to make its institution richer, more powerful, and influential. This decision backfired. When the field personnel founded a NSDAP stronghold in 1936, it exposed the fragile and precarious transnational position the home base had manoeuvred itself into, leaving it paralyzed, unable to act. This paralysis extended to the mission\u2019s representative Otto Theile, and the leadership of the Australian UELCA. The Lutherans involved in mission work were thus powerless, unwilling and unable to assist those under their care - in particular the Aboriginal community at Hope Vale - when support was critical. It is in the tension between the seeking of power and influence in 1933 and the lack of it when it counted in 1942 that an ethical reading unfolds of the foundation of the Finschhafen stronghold. \r\n\r\nDer Beitrag rekonstruiert die Rolle der Neuendettelsauer Mission bei der Gr\u00fcndung des NSDAP-Stuetzpunktes in Finschhafen (PNG).

It wishes to consider the body in space - the body as a mean to think geographically - and space in the body - as spaces are made places through our bond with them. The text looks at Film sets as evidence of the landscape as lexicon; Moffatt\u2019s often surreal, expressionist sets function at the intersection between internal and external landscape, unveiling the land as bearer.\nIn the postcolonial context of contemporary Australian society, I consider how the land may assume the quality of traumatic contact zone, a site susceptible to \u2018hauntings\u2019. The intent, here, is one that considers Sedgwick\u2019s notion of reparative reading practices; that is, one that proposes imaginative solutions to oppression. In the case of this text, such proposed solution lay in an affective turn within the Humanities, one that widens the borders of what experiences and styles of articulation can be recorded into history.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51574881, "asset_id": 26432070, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27310273, "first_name": "Costanza", "last_name": "Bergo", "domain_name": "optusnet", "page_name": "CostanzaBergo", "display_name": "Costanza Bergo", "profile_url": "https://optusnet.academia.edu/CostanzaBergo?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27310273/7759031/14024949/s65_costanza.bergo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 815, "name": "Epistemology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epistemology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6100, "name": "Video Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6106, "name": "Trauma Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6519, "name": "Cultural Landscapes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Landscapes?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6699, "name": "Australian society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_society?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14261, "name": "Film and Video Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Video_Art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 17330, "name": "Affect Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Theory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 21190, "name": "Landscape (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Art_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 23855, "name": "Affect Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35686, "name": "Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 53039, "name": "Haunting and Spectrality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Haunting_and_Spectrality?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 76095, "name": "Transmission", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transmission?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 124376, "name": "Australian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Cinema?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 206816, "name": "Tracey Moffatt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tracey_Moffatt?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 249304, "name": "Borders and Borderlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Borderlands?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 454641, "name": "Contemporary Australian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Australian_Art?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 33451657, "title": "2015.

Wilhelmina (Mina) Rawson (1851\u20131933) is lauded in both academic and popular circles as the author of the first uniquely Australian cookbooks, which she wrote between 1876 and 1895. Rawson was a prolific writer and stressed that she was the first white woman settler at Boonooroo in the colony of Queensland, where she was 'beholden to the blacks' to show her what to eat (Rawson, 1895, p. 54). Rawson's cookbooks famously codified how to use Australian non-human animals, including wallaby, parrot and goanna, as meat, and her published memories of this time detailed the context in which she implemented and refined these recipes. Rawson organised and policed racialised frontier space as a white woman, claiming British sovereignty over Butchulla country in order to profit from and teach other settlers to profit from the coastal land and waterways. This paper draws on ecofeminist and postcolonial theory and works to explore how Rawson organised food production to exercise violent colonial claims to sovereignty as a white woman, explicitly advising other settlers to do the same.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51580983, "asset_id": 31146264, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30054, "first_name": "Shannon", "last_name": "Woodcock", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ShannonWoodcock", "display_name": "Shannon Woodcock", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ShannonWoodcock?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30054/9769/14114760/s65_shannon.woodcock.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68567, "name": "Queensland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 255797, "name": "History Aboriginal Queensland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Aboriginal_Queensland?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 455653, "name": "Colonial history, Aboriginal history and cultural studies, Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_history_Aboriginal_history_and_cultural_studies_Australian_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 985866, "name": "Queensland Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_Politics?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 25215895, "title": "Hmong Australian History 1975 - 2016", "created_at": "2016-05-10T21:56:21.110-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25215895/Hmong_Australian_History_1975_2016?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_25215895", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45527229, "asset_id": 25215895, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3552927, "first_name": "Austin", "last_name": "Virathone", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AustinVirathone", "display_name": "Austin Virathone", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AustinVirathone?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3552927/7926080/15311209/s65_austin.virathone.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56851, "name": "Hmong Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hmong_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 129909, "name": "Melbourne", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melbourne?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 470670, "name": "Hmong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hmong?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 24696050, "title": "\u00c9migr\u00e9 Architects and the Australian Architecture Establishment", "created_at": "2016-04-23T15:18:25.131-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24696050/%C3%89migr%C3%A9_Architects_and_the_Australian_Architecture_Establishment?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_24696050", "summary": "The scholarship of \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects that arrived in Australia in the period between 1930 and 1960 has focused on developing an understanding of individual architects and their particular contribution to the discipline and profession integral to a dominant architectural historiography. Examination of how architects together form movements, aesthetic\naffinities, and attitudes about architecture generates an understanding of the collective dimension of the discipline, and the complexities of architectural production. Significant\nto the capacity of the individual \u00e9migr\u00e9s architects were the opportunities gained firstly, through the network of the architecture profession and institution, and secondly with one\nanother. On arrival, except for migrants from Britain, many \u00e9migr\u00e9s faced a difficult path of migration and struggled to gain registration and thus employment in the architectural\nprofession. What were the relationships between \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects and architecture\u2019s institutional infrastructure \u2013 the institute, the university, and the profession? And how did\nthis affect their experience of migration and resettlement, as well as their capacity for architectural production? This paper will argue that the potential contribution of \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects to Australian architecture was limited by institutional structures, operations and the boundaries constituted through social networks. Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s theory of habitus elaborates a\nprocess in which modes of speech, bodily mannerisms (such as gait), gestures, are internalised, unconscious and embodied; and that an individual\u2019s aspirations and ambitions are conditioned by what members of that community are expected to want.

A communist Red Army was expected to sweep northwards onto the Murray River border town of Mildura from Bendigo, Maryborough and Ballarat.  In small towns along the way, it was anticipated that local Catholics would rise as a Fifth Column in support of the Reds.  It was during the dark days of the Great Depression and the League of National Safety (LNS) aka the White Army began swearing-in all reputable citizens, bar the Catholics.\n\nTensions in Australia were running very high in early March 1931and unemployment had grown to alarming levels.  The Labor Party was self-destructing over what do about the Depression and Joseph Lyons would soon quit the party on 13 March, after voting against Ted Theodore\u2019s bill to print money for relief works.  Meanwhile, NSW Labor Premier, Jack Lang, was preaching \u2018repudiation\u2019 on outstanding government loans to Great Britain with his \u2018rabid\u2019 supporter, Eddie Ward, winning the Federal seat of East Sydney at a by-election on 7 March - after which \u2018Lang Labor\u2019 MPs were no longer welcome in the Labor caucus - Labor thus officially splitting in two.  Meantime, the various citizens\u2019 leagues, comprising many tens of thousands and regional secessionists, such as the Riverina Movement, advocating \u2018sound finance\u2019 and anti-repudiation were mushrooming.  \n\nIt was within this context that the strange episode of early March 1931 occurred.  According to some the White Army had 30,000 members in Victoria and that they had ready access to the armouries of the army reserve.  Nation-wide there were up to 100,000 members in so-called \u2018fascist\u2019 groups and on that day in March in western Victoria, as some Australians \u2018contemplated civil war, other patriots such as Sir John Monash, were also stirred to action\u2019 to ensure that \u2018fascists\u2019 dampened their ardour.  \n\nThere had been a considerable build-up to the much-heralded \u2018Unemployed Day\u2019 on 6 March 1931 and there were expectations that violence would occur, largely as a result of claims by communists that there would be disturbances in the streets in support of their demands.  Consequently, big crowds gathered on the footpaths to watch the various marches, if not participate in them.  But nothing happened - there was no uprising, there wasn't a revolution, the nuns did not hand out .303s to the rebels.\n\nFears of Langism and rumours about a Bolshevik takeover had abounded in some circles and in January 1931 and there was even talk of communists planning to launch the revolution by blacking out the city with an attack on power plants. In reality, the 6 March episode was a dreadful disaster for the LNS.  The authorities concluded that the panic protective measures were grotesquely unnecessary, while the apparent childish belief in the existence of a moving and devouring Red Army on the part of men regarded as sane and solid seemed beyond belief. Further, the whole story appeared to be the result of hysteria on the part of certain ex-military types aided no doubt by some individuals who were endeavouring to seek the limelight.\n\nThe LNS was essentially a \u2018defensivist\u2019, Protestant, \u2018King and Country\u2019 organisation.  It was not a \u2018fascist\u2019 or even \u2018proto-fascist\u2019 organisation in the mould of the Nazis, Mussolini\u2019s Blackshirts or even the New Guard and saw itself as a defender of democracy and the existing Constitution but it did have authoritarian tendencies, was sectarian and possessed anti-democratic features.  Like similar organisations elsewhere in Australia, it was short-lived and its feverish, overreactive and embarrassing performance during the events of 1931 ensured that its credibility was quickly found wanting amongst many of the \u2018reliable\u2019 and \u2018solid\u2019 citizens it had sought to attract in the first place.\n\nThe high drama surrounding the perceived threats of Bolshevism and Langist \u2018repudiation\u2019 soon dissipated with the changes in government both Federally and in NSW and after the first shock waves of the Great Depression subsided; not least due to much better governmental responses in providing assistance for the unemployed.  Finally, the military authorities stepped in to ensure that no serving officers could have any involvement in these so-called secret armies, including measures to ensure that the army reserve did not become a base for LNS activities.  In other words, Australia\u2019s extremely stable democratic institutions and instincts remained both rock solid and capable of dealing with even the most debilitating and destabilising impacts of the Great Depression.  The likelihood of a fascist takeover had about the same chance as a communist one \u2013 Buckley\u2019s and none!", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63126740, "asset_id": 41406784, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7258811, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Vodicka", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PeterVodicka", "display_name": "Peter Vodicka", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PeterVodicka?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7258811/2698151/35309995/s65_peter.vodicka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5781, "name": "Fascism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fascism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7443, "name": "Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12118, "name": "Great Depression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Great_Depression?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 21941, "name": "The Great Depression of 1930s", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Great_Depression_of_1930s?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41501, "name": "Catholicism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catholicism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 59779, "name": "History of Communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Communism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77501, "name": "Anti-communism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-communism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 129909, "name": "Melbourne", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melbourne?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 152642, "name": "Australian Labor Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Labor_Party?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 160382, "name": "Mallee", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mallee?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 448997, "name": "Victoria, Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victoria_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 612293, "name": "Australian Imperial Force", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Imperial_Force?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1732028, "name": "Fifth Column", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fifth_Column?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2141490, "name": "Post WW1 Soldier settlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_WW1_Soldier_settlement?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3201091, "name": "Victorian Mallee", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Mallee?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3209645, "name": "Australian Military", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Military?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3393575, "name": "proto-fascism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/proto-fascism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 39308178, "title": "History as Landscape: Why Australia needs a Bill of Rights Ray Gibbons Update V 1.1", "created_at": "2019-05-29T18:32:55.590-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39308178/History_as_Landscape_Why_Australia_needs_a_Bill_of_Rights_Ray_Gibbons_Update_V_1_1?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_39308178", "summary": "This is an essay on Australian values, what we hold important; how these values affect our changing multi-dimensional social contract, the prescriptive relationship between people (involved parties) and the State; and why we need a superordinate Bill of Rights. \nAustralian post-contact history has a shape defined by its evolving value-embedded juridical constraints - by its Constitutional purpose, by its legislative provisions, by its beliefs about what is right or wrong and what is important, by its changing rule-based order, by its social contracts - that deliver the nation\u2019s momentum and trajectory through time. \nWe are now in denial.

Unless we dishonor her. We can become scavengers or builders. It is up to us.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59446016, "asset_id": 39308178, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7108589, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "gibbons", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "raygibbons", "display_name": "ray gibbons", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/raygibbons?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7108589/9711758/10817367/s65_ray.gibbons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 37445780, "title": "Marie Celeste de Villentroy Launay", "created_at": "2018-09-19T19:28:28.916-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37445780/Marie_Celeste_de_Villentroy_Launay?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_37445780", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57412832, "asset_id": 37445780, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1378293, "first_name": "Lisa Keane", "last_name": "Elliott", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "LisaKeaneElliott", "display_name": "Lisa Keane Elliott", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/LisaKeaneElliott?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1378293/501651/42201347/s65_lisa_keane.elliott.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7513, "name": "Archives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archives?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33957321, "title": "Have Poets Left a Patch to Sew?

Ileen was a member of Rudolf Steiner\u2019s Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners (from 1936). Ernesto was the first Australian member (from 1928). At their Demeter Farm in Dandenong, Victoria, they practiced biodynamic agriculture on over 40 acres (16 ha) through the years of the Great Depression, through World War II, and for the first decade of the post-war years, producing milk, fruit, and vegetables. Ileen was an early Australian Anthroposophist and follower of Rudolf Steiner. It was a blow to their Demeter Farm enterprise when she fell ill. Eventually she was no longer able to manage physical work at all and this fell to Ernesto. Although she is remembered as \u2018the woman in the wheelchair\u2019 this paper reveals that she was previously an active, fit and keen sportswoman, participating in basketball, tennis, running, hockey, and dancing. At school she was known as \u2018Ikey\u2019, she was a prefect, she was a member of the school sports committee, and she won the prize for \u201cbest all-round sport\u201d. Ileen was confined to a wheelchair for the last four decades of her life. The cause has generally been misunderstood and misattributed, and is revealed here to be pernicious anaemia (lack of vitamin B12). This condition is now easily and successfully treatable, but it was then generally fatal. Ileen was a financial supporter of the Anthroposophical movement in Australia during her lifetime. Her benefaction has continued since her death via the Ileen Macpherson Trust which reports having dispensed over $600,000 for Anthroposophic causes in Australia.

By the end of the century, Anzac Day, the anniversary of the first landings of a campaign that ultimately failed, was the key date for national self-reflection.  Yet the intervening period was marked at times by concern that interest in Gallipoli was waning.  This article traces the shifting level of public interest in Anzac Day in Australia by comparing two milestones, its 50th and 75th anniversaries. Both occasions followed the familiar pattern of commemorative events, both prompted a return trip to Gallipoli for a party of veterans; both gave rise to newspaper coverage and public musing on the meaning of the anniversary and its future. But the scale and mood of these two occasions were quite different.

With a design and demography that mirrored the management ideals of the new system, Cascades provides a unique opportunity to study a successful probation station in operation. This paper seeks to discuss and test a number of questions, chief among them being the following. How did Cascades fit into the wider dynamics of the peninsula? How did the convicts extract the timber resource? How did the officials combine the need for reformative labour with the necessities of economy? And how did the station respond to shifts in the convict administrative system both within the peninsula and beyond it?\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32046389, "asset_id": 1758815, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2042648, "first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Tuffin", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "RichardTuffin", "display_name": "Richard Tuffin", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/RichardTuffin?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2042648/770003/25885412/s65_richard.tuffin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5014, "name": "Industrial Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_Archaeology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10432, "name": "Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transportation?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 127025, "name": "Convict labor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_labor?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 149101, "name": "Van Diemen's Land", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Van_Diemens_Land?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 150444, "name": "Tasmania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasmania?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 528017, "name": "Convict Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Labour?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 40114727, "title": "Hello, Mr America: The United States R&R scheme in Sydney, 1967-1972", "created_at": "2019-08-18T17:01:43.926-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40114727/Hello_Mr_America_The_United_States_R_and_R_scheme_in_Sydney_1967_1972?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_40114727", "summary": "The American presence in Australia during the Vietnam War was one aspect of what has often been described as a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the two nations.

As far as the Dalit writing is concerned, it is contesting both the very basis of caste-discrimination as well as the institutional claim that caste no longer functions as a social force in modern India. As for Aboriginal narratives, it has been claimed by many Aboriginal women writers that while the narrative they unfold is their personal story, their experiences are similar to those of many other Aboriginal women. For this reason their autobiographies can be viewed as \" testimonies \" to the way Aboriginal people were treated by non-Aboriginal people. Many of the writings are a \" testimony \" to the struggle to survive because of the human rights denied to Aboriginal people. Thus, both writings seek to create a new alternative agency in the form of an alternative marginalized discourse in the emergence of a form of \" resistance literature \". They exemplify a form of \" testimony \" to the kind of injustices that occur to them and also to the struggles to survive because of the human rights denied to them. Dalit life is excruciatingly painful, charred by experiences. Experiences that did not manage to find room in literary creation. We have grown up in a social order that is extremely cruel and inhuman. And compassionless towards Dalits. 1 It might help if we non-Aboriginal Australians imagined ourselves dispossessed of the land we lived on for 50,000 years, and then imagined ourselves told that it had never been ours. Imagine if ours was the oldest culture in the world and we were told that it was worthless. Imagine if we had resisted this settlement, suffered and died in the defence of our land, and then were told in history books that we had given it up without a fight. Imagine if non-Aboriginal Australians had served their country in peace and war and were then ignored in history books. Imagine if our feats on the sporting field has inspired admiration and patriotism and yet did nothing to diminish prejudice. Imagine if our spiritual life was denied and ridiculed. Imagine if we had suffered the injustice and then were blamed for it. 2 Dalit writing in India and Aboriginal writing in Australia have begun to emerge discursively as powerful visible forms of protest against a chequered history of exploitation both in socio-politically materialist and discursive realities.

In the first section I begin with a brief introduction to the history of the IRS system and some of its legacies, as well as attempts at redress. These include financial compensation through the 2006 IRS Settlement Agreement, an official apology, and the creation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which has been a nodal point for articulating claims of genocide. I follow this in section two with an analysis of the history wars in the United States and Australia over indigenous genocide, before engaging in section three with debates about genocide in Canada. Overt debates about genocide have been relatively slower in developing, in part because of the creation of a TRC, mandated with collecting the \u201ctruth\u201d about the IRS system while similarly engaging in \u201creconciliation\u201d (a contested term) with settler Canadians. While Canada\u2019s history wars may seem slow in getting off the ground, they may have a greater effect in stimulating national awareness than in the United States and Australia because of the more sustained mandate and national presence of the TRC. However as I will later discuss, a certain inbuilt caution on the part of the TRC due to lessons learned from the US and Australia may prevent any official finding of genocide.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37012969, "asset_id": 11495238, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1509294, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "MacDonald", "domain_name": "uoguelph", "page_name": "DavidMacDonald", "display_name": "David MacDonald", "profile_url": "https://uoguelph.academia.edu/DavidMacDonald?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1509294/535350/52184413/s65_david.macdonald.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 299, "name": "Native American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_American_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 381, "name": "Canadian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2412, "name": "Canadian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8920, "name": "History of Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Canada?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 13116, "name": "Aboriginal history in Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_history_in_Canada?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 29461, "name": "Canadian Culture & Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Culture_and_Identity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 37665, "name": "First Nations of Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Nations_of_Canada?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41128, "name": "First Nations History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Nations_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 51753, "name": "Genocide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 54114, "name": "Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canada?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77293, "name": "Holocaust and Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocaust_and_Genocide_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 87107, "name": "Aboriginal Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_Rights?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 112210, "name": "Native Americans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_Americans?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 147877, "name": "Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 8030794, "title": "Amphibious Operations and the Evolution of Australian Defense Policy", "created_at": "2014-08-20T04:20:04.586-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8030794/Amphibious_Operations_and_the_Evolution_of_Australian_Defense_Policy?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_8030794", "summary": "This article traces the role of amphibious operations in the evolution of Australian defense policy.

Thus, during the Cold War and immediate post\u2013Cold War years the amphibious capabilities of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) were not robust. However, with the end of the Cold War the ADF was forced to reorient its security strategy toward one requiring moderate projection and sustainment of forces\r\nto promote regional stability.

This small agricultural industry has a remarkably interesting but little-known history. The development of the industry was due to irrigation (which resulted in environmental degradation), entrepreneurialism combined with powerful, persuasive marketing and the tyranny of the distance to markets. Soldier settlers, Alfred Deakin, Justice Henry Higgins and several cookbook authors all played their part. In its infancy, the industry looked to the United States for inspiration but then returned to its natural friends in the Commonwealth for help when markets were bloated and prices were low. Apart from two celebratory, anniversary publications, the history of the industry has been largely overlooked. This paper addresses this oversight by highlighting how the dried fruits industry has influenced some of the key themes and important events in Australia's cultural, political and legal history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54787675, "asset_id": 34926162, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 60026387, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Wishart", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "AlisonWishart", "display_name": "Alison  Wishart", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/AlisonWishart?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/60026387/15649962/19850777/s65_alison.wishart.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26510, "name": "Interdisciplinary Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interdisciplinary_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 793490, "name": "Cookery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cookery?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 827218, "name": "Mildura", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mildura?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 966953, "name": "History of Cooking and Food Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cooking_and_Food_Culture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1552918, "name": "Dried Fruit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dried_Fruit?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2141490, "name": "Post WW1 Soldier settlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_WW1_Soldier_settlement?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 34242781, "title": "(2002), Armando Marques Guedes, Wanders and Wonders.

Langham wrote of Matthew Flinders that he possessed \u2018a personality of singular strength and charm.\u2019 In this lecture, Gillian Dooley will look to the primary sources to build up a portrait of this man who was the first to circumnavigate Australia and who charted a large portion of the country\u2019s coastline.\n\tFlinders was born in Lincolnshire, the son of a \u2018man-midwife\u2019 and surgeon apothecary in the small town of Donington. His father intended him to follow in the same profession but Matthew had other ideas. He was determined to join the Navy and by perseverance and good luck he was able to do so. He was ambitious, and put himself forward whenever he saw an opportunity of doing so, most famously in writing to Sir Joseph Banks to offer to complete the charting of the Australian coasts begun by Captain James Cook.\nDetermination, perseverance and ambition meant Flinders took risks, and luck was not always on his side. When things went badly for him, he responded with indignation but eventually recovered his equanimity and made the best of his situation, at the same time displaying a gift for warm friendship and a wry sense of humour. He was a devoted husband, a meticulous cartographer, and an expert navigator and leader, with a scientific mind and a romantic soul.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39354746, "asset_id": 17151155, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2687377, "first_name": "Gillian", "last_name": "Dooley", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "GillianDooley", "display_name": "Gillian Dooley", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/GillianDooley?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2687377/859718/1072318/s65_gillian.dooley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 694259, "name": "Matthew Flinders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Matthew_Flinders?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1778127, "name": "Maritime History.

When these came to affect the interests of Chinese-born residents of the colonies the Chinese hit back. As in British Columbia and California, the Chinese of Victoria and New South Wales deployed law in asserting rights of movement and residence. When the Supreme Courts of those colonies ruled in their favour, the self-governing colonials turned their minds to ever tighter restrictions through statutory reform. In this way the White Australia Policy of the twentieth century might be considered the perverse product of Chinese litigation in colonial courts. In this paper I argue that the Victorian and NSW immigration cases of 1888 demand greater respect than has been afforded them in the historiography and the legal literature of immigration policy and practice in Australia.

Tall with a trim build, the general was intelligent, austere, quiet yet forceful, and highly principled. He could be highly strung yet he never displayed excitement. Rowell had been among the first cadets to enter the Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon, in Canberra, Australian, and had served in the Gallipoli campaign. During the interwar period he devoted himself to his professional study, attending Staff College and the Imperial Defence College in Britain, and serving on exchange with the British Army. In the Second World War Rowell held key senior staff appointments with the Australian forces in the Middle East in 1941. Following his dismissal from New Guinea Force in 1942, Rowell was banished to Egypt and Britain. His career was not revived until after the war when the new Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee appointing Rowell Vice Chief of the General Staff (VCGS). Rowell succeed Sturdee as CGS in 1950, and he remained Australia\u2019s top soldier until his retirement in 1954.\n\nIn partnership with Sturdee, Rowell did much to shape Australia\u2019s post-war army. At a time when recruits and resources were limited, Rowell was a strong advocate for the new Australian Regular Army. With the onset of the Cold War he oversaw the army\u2019s expansion, the deployment of Australian forces to the Korean War, and the introduction of compulsory military service under the National Service scheme in 1951. Rowell believed in the continued importance of the British Empire, and saw the spread of communism in South-East Asia as a direct threat to Australia. \n\nDespite his long service, Rowell is best known for his clash with Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey. This chapter will examine Rowell\u2019s contribution to the Australian Army by concentrating on his relationships with the three men who most shaped his career: Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, Blamey and Sturdee.

By 1932 there were so many Australians in Shanghai that the British government asked Prime Minister Joseph Lyons to issue an official warning dissuading Australians from travelling there for employment. One result of this migration was the generation of files on Australians in the Special Branch surveillance files of the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) archives. Using these files, as well as Chinese language newspapers circulating in Shanghai at the time, this article examines links between Australians in Depression-era Shanghai and the development of Chinese anti-colonialism. It also suggests that reports on Australian behaviour in treaty port China in Australian newspapers recast the ways in which some Australians understood inter-colonial exchanges. Much is known about Australian attitudes to Asia in the first half of the twentieth century. Little, however, has been written about how Asian populations viewed Australians. The Shanghai Municipal Police files provide one register through which these viewpoints can be excavated.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51961041, "asset_id": 31639099, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33055810, "first_name": "Sophie", "last_name": "Loy-Wilson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "SophieLoyWilson", "display_name": "Sophie Loy-Wilson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/SophieLoyWilson?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33055810/9816264/16316688/s65_sophie.loy-wilson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8233, "name": "Transnational History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10469, "name": "Whiteness Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 460980, "name": "History and Urban Culture of Shanghai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Urban_Culture_of_Shanghai?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 8894929, "title": "'\"A very bad business'': Henry Dangar and the Myall Creek massacre 1838' ", "created_at": "2014-10-21T13:22:26.404-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8894929/_A_very_bad_business_Henry_Dangar_and_the_Myall_Creek_massacre_1838?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_8894929", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35224707, "asset_id": 8894929, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6437317, "first_name": "Lyndall", "last_name": "Ryan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LyndallRyan", "display_name": "Lyndall  Ryan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LyndallRyan?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6437317/10104092/11273350/s65_lyndall.ryan.jpg_oh_3ea619008c0b1ffe3ecf751e08f4ddbe_oe_566c18c6___gda___1450623567_b91d7edf5b98cf19e93cd3c430e3405f"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5416782, "title": "Outlaw Fan: Judith Anderson, international star, grows up in Adelaide", "created_at": "2013-12-13T12:01:49.116-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5416782/Outlaw_Fan_Judith_Anderson_international_star_grows_up_in_Adelaide?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_5416782", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32548211, "asset_id": 5416782, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7395134, "first_name": "desley", "last_name": "deacon", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "desleydeacon", "display_name": "desley deacon", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/desleydeacon?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7395134/2716908/30344562/s65_desley.deacon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1332, "name": "Theatre History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8233, "name": "Transnational History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8265, "name": "Biography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 12444, "name": "Film History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20483, "name": "History of Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Mining?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 117130, "name": "Public Honours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Honours?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 129907, "name": "Adelaide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adelaide?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 43835505, "title": "I'm Not Racist, But...

It is a meander through the cultural abyss between black and white Australia, trying to see what I had never been shown, and unsee what I had been shown. I wonder how can I be complicit and complacent in a society that privileges me over others because of the colour of my skin? \n\nI combine a creative practice of storytelling to question the status quo that is the dominant culture, the mercurial methodology of poetics, and the autoethnographic eye that guides a reflexive process of personal decolonisation. I bring to the research a burgeoning awareness of colonised minds, bodies, spirits and lenses and am confident my fresh eyes, curiosity and commitment to unlearn, unsee and unsettle can be deftly deployed to challenge and disrupt the prejudices and perceptions of my fellow white Australians. \n\nThis is not a problem-solving piece of research, although I am exploring the nature of a problem. The problem \u2013 which is often erroneously cast as the \u2018Aboriginal Problem\u2019 when it is a Whiteness Problem \u2013 is the core of my research. But I am not focusing just on First Nations peoples and their legacy of colonisation; rather, I examine our shared legacy, turning the gaze back on white Australia, holding up a mirror, to ask with all sincerity: Who is the problem?

In analysing a collection of rare historical photographs from this period, taken by Ngarrindjeri photographers and retained in Ngarrindjeri families, we bring the perspectives of contemporary Ngarrindjeri Elders to bear. Significantly, the photographs can be observed to operate both as a rich counter archive to colonial representation and settler memory, and as esteemed cultural objects capable of drawing the weight of the ancestral past into the present moment, thereby tangibly enlivening cultural and spiritual connections generationally today. Our exploration in this article provides new theoretical perspectives and fresh historical insight into the ways in which photography has been substantially deployed by an Australian Aboriginal nation as a subtle and potent tool to assert self-determination, document survivance, and enact visual sovereignty.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58200060, "asset_id": 38165615, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1142361, "first_name": "Karen", "last_name": "Hughes", "domain_name": "swinburne", "page_name": "KarenHughes", "display_name": "Karen Hughes", "profile_url": "https://swinburne.academia.edu/KarenHughes?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1142361/1371719/3147055/s65_karen.hughes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 863, "name": "Visual Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 925, "name": "Visual Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Anthropology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1589, "name": "Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3987, "name": "History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Memory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10503, "name": "Photography Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography_Theory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 20079, "name": "History of photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_photography?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 26821, "name": "Australian Aboriginal art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_art?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 50690, "name": "Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 125771, "name": "Visual Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Sovereignty?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 689114, "name": "Ngarrindjeri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ngarrindjeri?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1685982, "name": "Survivance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Survivance?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 35906229, "title": "Collecting the Criminal: murder and mayhem in cultural institutions", "created_at": "2018-02-12T13:02:16.161-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35906229/Collecting_the_Criminal_murder_and_mayhem_in_cultural_institutions?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_35906229", "summary": "Cultural institutions, across Australia, collect works of crime fiction and true crime\r\nthat tell narratives about a range of unlawful activities.

Crime\r\nhas long held a prominent position in the popular imagination; a position supported\r\nby galleries, libraries, archives and museums. From small, incidental collections that\r\nform only one element of a wide-ranging repository to large, significant collections\r\nthat focus on the criminal in deed and in impact.

In the Australian context, which features a widely acknowledged tradition of sympathizing with the criminal, some malefactors have disturbed our ideas of right and wrong. Moreover, crime-focused collections can serve to elevate our fear of crime and influence how we feel about different forms of punishment. In this way, cultural institutions demonstrate they play an important role in a field often considered to be the exclusive domain of law makers and law enforcers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60659593, "asset_id": 35906229, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2875103, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Franks", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "RachelFranks", "display_name": "Rachel Franks", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/RachelFranks?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2875103/948516/15833348/s65_rachel.franks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8348, "name": "Library and Information Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Library_and_Information_Science?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23333, "name": "Collecting and Collections", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collecting_and_Collections?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 50088, "name": "Punishment and Prisons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punishment_and_Prisons?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 67360, "name": "Crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crime?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 34041728, "title": "Against fascism, for racial equality: communists, anti-racism and the road to the Second World War in Australia, South Africa and the United States", "created_at": "2017-07-26T07:12:45.988-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34041728/Against_fascism_for_racial_equality_communists_anti_racism_and_the_road_to_the_Second_World_War_in_Australia_South_Africa_and_the_United_States?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34041728", "summary": "The Second World War (after June 1941) was a high point for the international communist movement with the Popular Front against fascism bringing many new people into Communist Parties in the global West.

Essentially, both the Australian media and sociologists have provided perceptions of Greek-Australian women generally denuded of detailed and insightive historical context. Furthermore, the submerging of early Greek-Australian female voices by their numerically dominant male counterparts has compounded this situation. Stereotypes have consequently evolved and persisted.\r\n\r\nYet, the stories of Greek-Australian women over almost 200 years reveal and revel in individual and collective successes, failures, hopes and dreams, of an Australia of challenges, a Greece of memory and a faith in the unfolding of a potentially unlimited future. This paper attempts to instigate a commencement along the road of detailed inquiry into a historical understanding of Greek-Australian women. Failure to seriously address the stereotypes through which Greek-Australia women have been projected \u2013 together with their ethnic gender\u2019s deeply marginalised historical status \u2013 can only undermine the important role that Greek-Australian history can potentially play in evidencing the diversity and hybridism of Australia\u2019s past.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37417107, "asset_id": 12100247, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29095623, "first_name": "Leonard", "last_name": "Janiszewski", "domain_name": "mq", "page_name": "LeonardJaniszewski", "display_name": "Leonard Janiszewski", "profile_url": "https://mq.academia.edu/LeonardJaniszewski?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29095623/8292239/9275057/s65_leonard.janiszewski.jpg_oh_9cee1aedec4a18c8bc088e4ea5cff1c4_oe_55ba088c___gda___1436604912_52e7f788b9ab6bf492296d883a2623b1"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4374, "name": "Immigration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27475, "name": "Greek Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Diaspora?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35731, "name": "Women and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Culture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 563608, "name": "Greek Australians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Australians?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 966781, "name": "Australian Greeks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Greeks?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1911455, "name": "Greek-Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek-Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 47523368, "title": "The Trespassers (a novel)", "created_at": "2021-04-22T18:59:16.043-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/47523368/The_Trespassers_a_novel_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_47523368", "summary": "A shipload of migrant workers flees the pandemic-stricken UK, seeking a fresh start in Australia.

Although it is too simplistic to summarise this as a simple binary, there are nevertheless common features of each approach to its subject matter. Popular approaches for instance commonly privilege emotion, and emotion without accompanying cognition significantly limits an appreciation of the war\u2019s complexities. Critical documentary has significant potential to broaden and nuance understandings by using a popular educative tool to embed scholarly approaches. This chapter analyses three examples of critical documentary from the centenary of Anzac\u2014Why Anzac with Sam Neill, Lest We Forget What? and The War that Changed Us. It argues that the evolving form of historical documentary in these examples not only communicates revisionist scholarly interpretations, but also makes use of key devices to connect audiences to the lived experience of wartime and its impact. \n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53808618, "asset_id": 33824865, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18313056, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "auckland", "page_name": "JamesBennett", "display_name": "James Bennett", "profile_url": "https://auckland.academia.edu/JamesBennett?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18313056/5144225/5893667/s65_james.bennett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23214, "name": "Documentary Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26296777, "title": "Horticultural experimentation in northern Australia reconsidered", "created_at": "2016-06-18T23:59:33.077-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26296777/Horticultural_experimentation_in_northern_Australia_reconsidered?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_26296777", "summary": "Did the banana, yam and taro arrive in Australia at the hands of Europeans or come across the Torres Strait 2000 years before?

Since they were effectively aliens in their own land, the demonstrators said, they needed an Embassy on the lawns opposite Parliament House to represent their interests to the government. The Embassy was borne out of disappointment following the 1967 referendum, which raised expectations that \u2018full citizenship\u2019 would be extended to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Although the referendum was successful, the Federal Government\u2019s inaction, continued commitment to assimilation and denial of land rights fostered further resentment among Aboriginal people. In this chapter, we highlight how the demand for full citizenship by Aboriginal people who campaigned in the referendum was consistent with the struggle for land rights and self-determination that found dramatic expression in the Aboriginal Embassy. We then discuss how the Tent Embassy was both a negative demonstration of the dispossession and political alienation experienced by Aboriginal people and a positive demonstration of the rights to land and self-determination that they claimed. By dis-identifying as Australian citizens, the Tent Ambassadors constituted a counter public sphere within which to renegotiate the terms of political belonging between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Australia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33070179, "asset_id": 3850418, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51689, "first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Schaap", "domain_name": "exeter", "page_name": "AndrewSchaap", "display_name": "Andrew  Schaap", "profile_url": "https://exeter.academia.edu/AndrewSchaap?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51689/83650/4985808/s65_andrew.schaap.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2933, "name": "Democratic Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratic_Theory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 4992, "name": "Global Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Citizenship?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8994, "name": "Social Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Activism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16016, "name": "Citizenship and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_and_Identity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16124, "name": "Citizenship Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_Theory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16188, "name": "Citizenship, Identity And Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_Identity_And_Social_Movements?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 17123, "name": "Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 17126, "name": "Citizenship And Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_And_Governance?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 43386, "name": "Advocacy and Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advocacy_and_Activism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 63903, "name": "Land Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Rights?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 374844, "name": "Democracy and Citizenship Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy_and_Citizenship_Education?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 455099, "name": "Post Colonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Colonial_Theory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 535592, "name": "Citizenship identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_identities?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019274, "name": "Nationalism and Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_and_Decolonization?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019276, "name": "Ethnicity and Nationality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Nationality?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 3559752, "title": "An SOS from Beyond Gallipoli: Victoria and the Armenian Relief Movement", "created_at": "2013-05-18T19:53:43.333-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3559752/An_SOS_from_Beyond_Gallipoli_Victoria_and_the_Armenian_Relief_Movement?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_3559752", "summary": "In 1915, news of the Armenian genocide sparked a relief movement in Victoria which eventually spread throughout Australia.

Victorians were also involved in relief work amongst the survivors of the tragedy in both Syria and Greece.

We use archaeological data to test the hypothesis that southeast Australian bora grounds have a preferred orientation to the position of the Milky Way in the night sky in August, when the plane of the galaxy from Crux to Sagittarius is roughly vertical in the evening sky to the south-southwest. We accomplish this by measuring the orientations of 68 bora grounds using a combination of data from the archaeological literature and site cards in the New South Wales Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System database.

When the convicts and freemen started to arrive in the Oceania region, the various denominations of Calvinism were transmitted into the colonial land of Great Britain in the nineteenth century. The Presbyterianism that was based on the Church of Scotland and European Reformed heritages was founded in the 1820s. The Congregational Church was established by Charles Price in New South Wales in 1833. The Wesleyan Methodist Church emerged in the region of Australasia (including New Zealand) in 1875. Each Calvinistic tradition denominationally witnessed its prosperity of unity at the turn of the twentieth century, but there was an interdenominational unity movement through the so-called, the Uniting Church in the 1970s. Many local churches voluntarily re-joined the new religious organization from the Calvinistic denominations. Then, who are the Uniting Church? What do they believe and pursue? How are they innovative in comparison with the traditional churches? What kind of conflict or confusion exists between the old ones and the new one? This paper explores the religious figures of the new uniting movement in relation to the context of Euro-British Calvinism. The social liberalism of the Uniting Church is particularly regarded to depict an authentic identity of Australian Calvinism in the late twentieth century.

By extension, the language utilised to control, disseminate and record knowledge can actively challenge, or sustain, existing power dynamics. In libraries and archives across Australia the power over Aboriginal artefacts and records is complicated by competing interests, various approaches to collection development and management as well as a constantly changing political context. This paper explores the idea of power, in the context of Indigenous collections, through three diverse points of view that serve to highlight some of the ethical and logistical issues that circulate around three key areas: reclaiming power (exploring how Aboriginal communities can connect with historical texts documenting culture, language and events to understand the past and inform the future); returning power (exploring the role of cultural institutions in the digital return of cultural patrimony and enabling connections with collections); and giving up claims to power and the \u2018ownership\u2019 of knowledge (exploring how every citizen can contribute to the restoration of power to facilitate the \u2018return\u2019 of knowledge to traditional owners). This paper aims to, through these three brief narratives, highlight some of the historical issues that construct common views around Indigenous collections. In addition, this paper seeks to demonstrate the many opportunities that arise from exploring tensions that may be evident in library and archive collections. It will also explore how staff from diverse backgrounds can be professionally engaged to promote and explore, in strategic and thoughtful ways, Aboriginal materials in libraries and archives.",

This particular focus is adopted in order to make sense of the ways in which the formally inclusive institution of Australian citizenship has long served to exclude migrant subjects and bodies from the physical and symbolic space of the nation. Using Foucault\u2019s notion of governmentality together with Butler\u2019s concept of performativity, this thesis seeks to trace the ways in which the liberal political rationality underlying constructions of \u2018inclusive\u2019 citizenship reproduces the discourse of Whiteness. More than this, the thesis suggests that such state articulations of citizenship, in deploying this liberal governmentality, work as tools to regulate the population through the resignification of bodies in terms of the self-regulating, invisible White subject and its regulated, conspicuous Other. Focusing particularly on the Hawke and Howard governments, this thesis will consider three key moments that are cited in histories of Australian migrant policy, examining the official position adopted by government in the context of these moments through speeches and policy papers, with a view to understanding how the citizen is discursively positioned in these texts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40557767, "asset_id": 19326528, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38929578, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Sarian", "domain_name": "mq", "page_name": "EmmaSarian", "display_name": "Emma Sarian", "profile_url": "https://mq.academia.edu/EmmaSarian?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3231, "name": "Governmentality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Governmentality?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6013, "name": "Performativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performativity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 11832741, "title": "Official Apologies, Reconciliation, and Settler Colonialism: Australian Indigenous Alterity and Political Agency", "created_at": "2015-04-07T11:22:34.138-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11832741/Official_Apologies_Reconciliation_and_Settler_Colonialism_Australian_Indigenous_Alterity_and_Political_Agency?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_11832741", "summary": "The burgeoning literature on transitional justice, truth commissions, reconciliation and official apologies tends to ignore the conditions of settler states in which \u2018reconciliation\u2019 needs to take account of indigenous minorities.

This article highlights the postcolonial critiques of the Australian governments\u2019 apology to the indigenous peoples of the country. The authors of these critiques seek to protect indigenous alterity from the Australian state, which they regard as irredeemably colonialist, especially in its liberal and progressive mode.

This book offers a unique insight into the life trajectories of politically active Italian immigrants and their left-wing grassroots organisations. It does so in the light of fresh archival data and a string of oral accounts gathered from former and current members and collaborators of leading left-wing organisations, such as the Italian Federation of Migrant Workers and Their Families (FILEF).

In this paper I look at the function of maternity. While Pine Gap is often publicly remembered for its lesbian presence, when mothers became protestors their political agency was often recognised at the cost of their maternity. And yet maternalism was a major discursive argument for the protest. Drawing on newspapers and newsletters, pillowcases and poetry, mothers and memory, this paper seeks to create a sense of the controversial place of maternity, its uses and limits, in this particular event of 1980s feminism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30309245, "asset_id": 2257515, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 245230, "first_name":

Largely a legacy of the last decades of the Prison\u2019s operational years, it incorporates murals, graffiti, painted furniture, and works on canvas. Unlike much of the Fremantle Prison Collection, it speaks in the unmediated voice of the prisoner, rather than the institution. \r\n\r\nThis paper will give an overview of the history of the prisoner art program at Fremantle Prison and some of its alumni, including artists of national and international renown such as Jimmy Pike and Revel Cooper. The complexity of many of the works provide new opportunities for interpreting prison life, however preserving, researching and interpreting the collection also presents its share of challenges.  Many of the works, created and executed on ill-prepared surfaces using poor quality paints, have severely degraded since the Prison closed in 1991, and issues of copyright and privacy have ramifications for researching and interpreting the collection, including placing limitations on its digital dissemination. There are also other, more subjective considerations, such as whether some of these works may be regarded as unsuitable for public display, given the use of violent or sexual imagery. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34784179, "asset_id": 8387119, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14789731, "first_name": "Isa", "last_name": "Menzies", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "IsaMenzies", "display_name": "Isa  Menzies", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/IsaMenzies?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14789731/4638544/36485535/s65_isa.menzies.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 673178, "name": "Prisoner Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prisoner_Art?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 5752140, "title": "Sir Charles Nicholson, Who Do You Think You Are? in M.

This offensive to land the veteran 7th Australian Infantry Division at Balikpapan was the last of a series amphibious operations conducted by the Allies to liberate areas of Dutch and British territory on Borneo. It was the largest amphibious operation conducted by Australian forces during the Second World War. Within an hour some 16,500 troops were ashore and pushing inland, along with nearly 1,000 vehicles.  More than 33,000 personnel from the 7th Division and Allied forces were landed in the amphibious assault. \nBalikpapan is often cited as an example of the expertise achieved by Australian forces in amphibious operations during the war. It was a remarkable development. Four years earlier, the capability of Australia or even the United States to conduct amphibious operations in the South-West Pacific Area was limited if not non-existent.

Crimes of antisocial behaviour, food and forgery were of central concern to the early colonists, with the criminal act most likely to result in an executioner plying his craft being the stealing of food. The first person hanged in the new colony, for the theft of butter, peas and pork provisions, was young Thomas Barrett, executed one month and one day after the arrival of the First Fleet in New South Wales. Murder quickly followed crimes motivated by greed, hunger, and slovenliness, with punishment for such acts also quickly applied by administrators. Yet, the very brutal murder, in Sydney in August 1803, of Constable Joseph Luker \u2013 the first officer of the law to be slain in the pursuit of his duty in Australia \u2013 went largely unpunished due to a lack of evidence and a twist of fate. This paper discusses the death of Constable Luker and how his story was written, and offers a brief analysis of the non-death of those considered responsible for such a violent crime in the context of the colony's punishment systems.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57429311, "asset_id": 35006915, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2875103, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Franks", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "RachelFranks", "display_name": "Rachel Franks", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/RachelFranks?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2875103/948516/15833348/s65_rachel.franks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20628, "name": "Newspaper History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Newspaper_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33614, "name": "Capital Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capital_Punishment?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40302, "name": "True Crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/True_Crime?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80016, "name": "Police and Policing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Police_and_Policing?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 113148, "name": "Reportage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reportage?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 11857961, "title": "Myth and reality in Australian colonial history and beyond", "created_at": "2015-04-08T19:27:17.771-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11857961/Myth_and_reality_in_Australian_colonial_history_and_beyond?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_11857961", "summary": "Much of Australian history is in the form of \u2018myth\u2019.

Contemporary publications by experts in tropical medicine  highlight how thermal comfort research in Australia was intimately connected to the political objectives of white settlement in the tropical North. While outdoor work was seen to be safe for European men, the domestic thermal environment was considered a key impediment to the health and wellbeing of white Australian women. This paper critically examines three of the earliest surveys of the indoor thermal environment in Australia to establish how tropical medicine sought to understand domestic conditions of European settlers.

Researchers in those fields have highlighted how migration has left an indelible imprint on Australian capitalism. By contrast, Australian migration histories have given scant attention to the role ethnic groups played in Australian capitalism. This lack of attention is particularly curious in historical studies of Greek Australia given the significance of small business in facilitating migration and settlement. From Federation onwards, Greek ethnic capitalism - or, more precisely, the relations between Greek migrant labourers and their petite bourgeoisie employers - became a topic of media coverage. In fact, the relations between Greek workers and employers were so important that newspapers routinely reported on the subject. This article examines this media coverage, its racialist and criminalising connotations, and historical relevance. It concludes with some observations on how histories of capitalism can productively engage with the histories of ethnicisation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85075508, "asset_id": 57022474, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 767792, "first_name": "Andonis", "last_name": "Piperoglou", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "AndonisPiperoglou", "display_name": "Andonis Piperoglou", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/AndonisPiperoglou?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/767792/738480/75179663/s65_andonis.piperoglou.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3479, "name": "Business History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5176, "name": "Labour history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 7531, "name": "History of Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Capitalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9705, "name": "Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capitalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 13752, "name": "Modern Greek History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Greek_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19051, "name": "Transnational Labour Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Labour_Migration?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27475, "name": "Greek Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Diaspora?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 40716, "name": "Cafes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cafes?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 93550, "name": "White Australia Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/White_Australia_Policy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 133229, "name": "Labour migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_migration?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 951126, "name": "Ethnicity and Identity Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Identity_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 965123, "name": "Xenophobia and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Xenophobia_and_Racism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2402782, "name": "History of Race and Global Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Global_Capitalism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 49103482, "title": "\u2018South-West Pacific: amphibious operations, 1942\u201345\u2019, Royal Australian Navy Sea Power Centre, Soundings, no. 30, 2021", "created_at": "2021-06-02T20:18:59.571-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49103482/_South_West_Pacific_amphibious_operations_1942_45_Royal_Australian_Navy_Sea_Power_Centre_Soundings_no_30_2021?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_49103482", "summary": "On morning of 1 July 1945 hundreds of warships and vessels from the United States Navy, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and the Royal Netherlands Navy lay off the coast of Balikpapan, an oil refining centre on Borneo\u2019s south-east coast. This offensive to land the veteran 7th Australian Infantry Division at Balikpapan was the last of a series amphibious operations conducted by the Allies to liberate areas of Dutch and British territory on Borneo. It was the largest amphibious operation conducted by Australian forces during the Second World War. Within an hour some 16,500 troops were ashore and pushing inland, along with nearly 1,000 vehicles. Ultimately more than 33,000 personnel from the 7th Division and Allied forces were landed in the amphibious assault. Balikpapan is often cited as an example of the expertise achieved by Australian forces in amphibious operations during the war. It was a remarkable development. Four years earlier, the capability of Australia or even the United States (US) to conduct amphibious operations in the South-West Pacific Area (SWPA) was limited if not non-existent.

relationship between law, medical knowledge and romantic suffering in early twentieth-century Australia. Drawing upon a sample of breach of promise of marriage actions from 1824 to 1930, it argues that where the plaintiff's pain was largely presumed in the nineteenth century, by the twentieth century mastering the language and performance of anguish became crucial to legal success. The less that women suffered socially from romantic disappointment, the more they sought to prove it in court. Women dressed the lesions of their hearts in the disinterested language of medicine and borrowed psychological categories of trauma from victims of war and railway injuries. Heartbreak was thus legitimized as a species of pain by a convergence of law, medicine and women's audacity to take their feelings seriously. The court's response to these new bodily articulations of suffering provides a counter-history to the usual tale of law's preference for the tangible over the intangible. Somatic injury was relegated to special damages, determined by the evidence of doctors and with less lucrative compensation, while emotional injury occupied the dominant, more profitable category of general damages. The history of heartbreak thus demonstrates the historical contingency of legal hostility to emotional injury.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53918961, "asset_id": 33961614, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36733988, "first_name": "Alecia", "last_name": "Simmonds", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "AleciaSimmonds", "display_name": "Alecia Simmonds", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/AleciaSimmonds?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2098, "name": "Contract Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contract_Law?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 67978, "name": "Law of Torts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_of_Torts?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 829802, "name": "History and Theories of the Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Theories_of_the_Emotions?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 33788497, "title": "\"Without distinction of any kind\u201d: human rights in 1940s Australia", "created_at": "2017-07-05T23:49:20.042-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33788497/_Without_distinction_of_any_kind_human_rights_in_1940s_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_33788497", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53776404, "asset_id": 33788497, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 904696, "first_name": "Jon", "last_name": "Piccini", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "JonPiccini", "display_name": "Jon Piccini", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/JonPiccini?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/904696/333916/37777692/s65_jon.piccini.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 138, "name": "Diplomatic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diplomatic_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 35802, "name": "Cold War history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War_history?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 31483033, "title": "Aboriginality and historical consciousness: Bernard O 'Dowd and the creation of an Australian national imaginary", "created_at": "2017-02-17T02:40:29.251-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31483033/Aboriginality_and_historical_consciousness_Bernard_O_Dowd_and_the_creation_of_an_Australian_national_imaginary?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_31483033", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51834318, "asset_id": 31483033, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 170922, "first_name": "Frank", "last_name": "Bongiorno", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "FrankBongiorno", "display_name": "Frank Bongiorno", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/FrankBongiorno?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/170922/42934/39480/s65_frank.bongiorno.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24391, "name": "Australians (Biography)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australians_Biography_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187034, "name": "Australian Aboriginal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 26241162, "title": "Fearing Truganini", "created_at": "2016-06-16T21:21:15.153-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26241162/Fearing_Truganini?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_26241162", "summary": "David Hansen, Art Specialist for Sotheby's Australia, won the Australian Book Review's 2010 Calibre Prize with his essay 'Seeing Truganini'.

Less acknowledged are the attempts of Greeks to define themselves within the contours of the Australian nation and the implications of such endeavours. In 1898, a group of \u2018Greek Gypsies\u2019 arrived in South Australia. Coincidentally their arrival coincided with the establishment of the Greek community of Melbourne and the emergent politics of Australian nation-building. As a group of semi-nomadic, questionably \u201cGreek\u201d migrants they were treated in contradictory ways.

Supporting mission work and Christian witness in the Third World will, they believe, spread a global, confessing Anglicanism. Sydney Anglicans present their evangelical faith as a religion for humanity at large.\r\nThe consequence has been a convergence with the social justice agendas of the feminist and homosexual lobbies which have previously been at daggers drawn with the Sydney Diocese. The social justice agenda has more in common with secular progressivism than with the ethical foundations of Christian nationhood.

The Indigenous gallery was a major focus at a time when many museums around the world forged new ways of displaying Indigenous heritage. Named Bunjilaka (a Woiwurrung word meaning \u2018place of Bunjil\u2019, referring to the ancestral eaglehawk), the permanent Indigenous exhibit was a bold expression of community consultation and reflexive museum practice. At its heart was a life-size model of Baldwin Spencer, co-author of the classic anthropological monograph The Native Tribes of Central Australia (1899). When Bunjilaka was replaced with a wholly Indigenous-designed exhibit of Aboriginal Victoria in 2011, the model was infor- mally retained by museum staff. Initially sitting awkwardly on a trolley in a narrow room where objects were processed for accession, Spencer himself remained unrecorded in any database. With no official existence but considerable gravity, he ended up housed in the secret/sacred room, surrounded by restricted objects that Spencer the man had collected. This article traces Spencer\u2019s journey from a post-colonial pedagogical tool to a transgressive pseudo- sacred object in an emerging era of decolonial museology. I argue that Spencer\u2019s fate indicates a distinct period of post-colonial museology (c.1990\u20132010) that has ended, and illustrates how the shifting historical legacies of science operate in the present.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60868413, "asset_id": 40588542, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2540269, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Kowal", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "EmmaKowal", "display_name": "Emma Kowal", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/EmmaKowal?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2540269/791489/18837944/s65_emma.kowal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 244, "name": "Psychoanalysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychoanalysis?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24016, "name": "Museology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 42181, "name": "New Museology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Museology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 626410, "name": "Modernity/coloniality/decoloniality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernity_coloniality_decoloniality?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 38324354, "title": "Missionaries from Many Lands: The Nineteenth-Century Foundations of the Catholic Church in Western Australia", "created_at": "2019-02-10T19:15:52.198-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38324354/Missionaries_from_Many_Lands_The_Nineteenth_Century_Foundations_of_the_Catholic_Church_in_Western_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_38324354", "summary": "The ethnic diversity that is such an evident characteristic of the twenty-first century Catholic Church in Australia seems to some to be a novelty and a departure from a well-established cultural identity.

Established in Sydney on April Fool's Day in 1963 as a satirical magazine, the editors migrated to London in 1967, where the UK version of Oz garnered its status as the underground field guide for enlightened hippies. This paper claims that the visual and rhetorical editorial strategy of Oz, coupled with the technologies employed in its making, transformed the medium of the magazine to be more than simply a cipher for hippie life. In fact, it became a platform for immersive, multimedia experiences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54526010, "asset_id": 34666099, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

considers the work of Janet Matthews, an independent and nondenominational Protestant missionary, at the Maloga, Metco and Manunka Missions, all located on the Murray River (the first in New South Wales and the latter two in South Australia). While Maloga was founded and subsequently run as a joint\nundertaking, Janet was the primary founder and sole director at both Metco and Manunka, making her one of the first women to run an Australian mission entirely on her own. As such, the Maloga, Metco and Manunka archives constitute a useful\nresource for examining the different opportunities and obstacles associated with a transition into the role of the independent female missionary. Janet\u2019s management and representation of the missions, her relationships with Aboriginal people and their\nperceptions of her and her connections to local settlers and the settler-colonial state are all considered, first in the context of her partnership with her husband Daniel at Maloga, then during her period of transition at Metco, and finally in her solo work at\nManunka after his death in 1902 until her retirement in 1911.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39978528, "asset_id": 18294198, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2819014,

The potency of this body of work, alongside the Aboriginal community\u2019s vigorous political campaigns for cultural rights and land rights, has not translated into a distinctively Tasmanian Aboriginal film culture. Apart from several significant documentary films and photographic works\r\nthat indicate the emergence of a powerful decolonizing poetics there are no fictional feature films by Tasmanian Aboriginal film-makers. Moreover several recent feature films produced by non-Indigenous film-makers about Tasmania invoke the \u2018Tasmanian Gothic\u2019 trope, imagining an island without any Aboriginal presence. This article considers processes that contribute to decolonizing through the contemporary work of Tasmanian Aboriginal writers and artists, including Jim Everett, Julie Gough, Greg Lehman and photographer Ricky Maynard. I suggest their poetics are more than textual. They are grounded in country and community \u2013 linked to another realm beyond the \u2018shallow\u2019 time of colonization. Their decolonizing poetics are shared with Maori film-maker Barry Barclay\u2019s \u2018Fourth Cinema\u2019, where the camera is firmly in Indigenous hands, based in community and cultural practices.\" http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1386/sac.7.2-3.123_1\r\n(NB due to copyright restrictions the PDF loaded on Academia.edu is the final version before publication).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34139265, "asset_id": 5292803, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 299615, "first_name": "Jeni", "last_name": "Thornley", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "JeniThornley", "display_name": "Jeni Thornley", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/JeniThornley?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/299615/60567/230794/s65_jeni.thornley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3399, "name": "Documentary (Film Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film_Studies_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8331, "name": "Indigenous Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Knowledge?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 23214, "name": "Documentary Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 666360, "name": "Tasmanian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tasmanian_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 7761508, "title": "\u0421\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0420\u0413 \u0438 \u0410\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 \u0441 \u041a\u041d\u0414\u0420 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 XXI \u0432.

At least two phases of occupation are indicated. The most recent huts have their collapsed organic superstructure still present, while those of a presumably earlier phase are distinguished as bare, circular patches of earth which are conspicuous amongst the ubiquitous gibber, with or without stone bases, and lacking any collapsed superstructure. Immediately adjacent to the huts and also a few hundred metres away are clusters of small stone arrangements, and about 2 km to the southwest, along the same creekline, is another series of larger, more substantial stone arrangements; these features speak to the importance of the general Hilary Creek area for ceremonial purposes. Radiocarbon dating reveals use of the Hilary Creek complex dates to at least 300 years ago; the absence of any European materials suggests it was likely not used, or only used very sporadically, after the 1870s when pastoralists arrived in the area, and when traditional lifeways were devastated by colonial violence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66067538, "asset_id": 45588313, "asset_type":

Unlike the majority of western district squatters in Victoria, the Learmonth family (Thomas and Christian, their sons John, Thomas, Somerville and Andrew and daughters Elizabeth, Margaret and Christian) did not stay in Australia. They arrived in 1835 and by 1873 all (except Thomas\u2019s wife Christian, who died in Van Diemen\u2019s Land) had returned to Scotland, England, or India. One of the family\u2019s greatest legacies in Australia is Ercildoun, an extensive run near Ballarat on land they expropriated in 1837 and used as a base to breed some of the country\u2019s finest merino wool. Ercildoun was in the long term, however, of more benefit to the Learmonths in Britain than in Australia.

In a\ngrowing body of scholarship it is possible to discern a new\nand definite shift in scholarly emphasis away from\n\u201cmissionaries and empire\u201d towards what Hilary Carey has\nlabelled the \u201ccolonial missionary movement.\u201d An important\ndebate within this burgeoning field concerns the national\ncharacter and mission of Anglicanism, by far the largest\ncontributor to the colonial missionary movement. Anglican\nclergy, in particular, have been seen as key agents of\ncolonial expansion and English national identity, a High\nChurch-Tory intellectual elite, charged with the\nresponsibility of transmitting both English and Anglican\nculture to the colonies. Scholars such as C.A. Bayly have also\ncharacterized Anglican Church and clergy as tools of empire,\nor part of what he calls an imperial \u201cAnglican design.\u201d In the\nAustralian context there has likewise been a longstanding\npopular and scholarly view that Australian Anglicanism was\n\u201cquintessentially English,\u201d particularly during its formative\nphase up to 1850. In terms of churchmanship, recent scholarship has also foregrounded the \u201cHigh Church\u201d character\nof Anglicanism over a predominantly \u201cevangelical\u201d character.\nThese views have been questioned more recently, however, by\nrecognition of the significant numbers of Irish Anglican\nclergy who were recruited for the English-speaking settler\ncolonies. Many of these Anglican clergymen were actually Irish\n- or worse (in the opinion of some contemporaries): Irish\nevangelicals.\n\nA key contention of this volume is that there existed\nduring the period of the Second British Empire a \u201cGreater\nIreland,\u201d akin to the old concept of \u201cGreater Britain,\u201d in\nwhich the Irish transformed into a global people, actively\nparticipating in British imperial expansion and colonial\nnation building in Australia, Canada, India, South Africa,\nSouth America, New Zealand and the United States. A lacuna in\nthe existing literature, however, is a detailed study of Irish\nclergy in the Australian colonies. The purpose of this\nchapter, therefore, is to examine the backgrounds and\ninfluence of Irish clergy in colonial Australian Anglicanism\nbefore 1850. Irish clergymen, as we shall see, made up nearly\na quarter of Australian Anglican clergymen during this period.\nMoreover, they adapted well to colonial conditions and exerted\ninfluence out of all proportion to their numbers, in the\nAnglican Church and in colonial Australia\u2019s fledgling\ncultural, intellectual and political life. Contemporary observers identified their Irishness in their confident\nreformism, national pride, combativeness and their enhanced\nProtestant identity. In turn, this green hue in the complexion\nof Australian Anglicanism casts doubt on monolithic ideas of\nAnglican clergy as agents of Englishness. Additionally, the\nIrish clergy\u2019s complex and sometimes adversarial relationship\nwith colonial and imperial projects challenges notions of\nclergy as tools of an imperial \u201cAnglican design.\u201d", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45928088, "asset_id": 25598660, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88280, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Gladwin", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "MichaelGladwin", "display_name": "Michael Gladwin", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/MichaelGladwin?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88280/24576/3458989/s65_michael.gladwin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 109, "name": "Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10322, "name": "Nineteenth Century British History and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_British_History_and_Culture?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10535, "name": "Anglicanism (Anglicanism)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglicanism_Anglicanism_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 29842, "name": "Ireland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ireland?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 30425, "name": "Anglican Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anglican_Church_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 200139, "name": "Irish Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Australian_history?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 24377882, "title": "The British Political and Economic Uses of Tasmanian Genocide: the targeted destruction of the Palawa, Volume 3, Lemkinian Genocide as a Process", "created_at": "2016-04-13T16:15:21.822-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24377882/The_British_Political_and_Economic_Uses_of_Tasmanian_Genocide_the_targeted_destruction_of_the_Palawa_Volume_3_Lemkinian_Genocide_as_a_Process?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_24377882", "summary": "Britain wanted the Australian Aboriginals\u2019 land.

It concludes that museum exhibitions can usefully be seen as emerging from a dynamic \u2018field\u2019 of associations, and that understanding of this \u2018field\u2019 can be enhanced with reference to the Polynesian concept of \u2018v\u0101\u2019, and the related idea of activation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40284773, "asset_id": 18841575, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6215886, "first_name": "Huw", "last_name": "Rowlands", "domain_name": "royalholloway", "page_name": "HuwRowlands", "display_name": "Huw Rowlands", "profile_url": "https://royalholloway.academia.edu/HuwRowlands?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6215886/2569358/2983716/s65_huw.rowlands.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3148, "name": "Actor Network Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Actor_Network_Theory?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 48608, "name": "Australian Indigenous History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 81688, "name": "British Museum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Museum?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 12785117, "title": "\u2018That\u2019s not a knife\u2019: Appropriation, Gender & Wolf Creek", "created_at": "2015-06-03T18:40:24.549-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12785117/_That_s_not_a_knife_Appropriation_Gender_and_Wolf_Creek?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_12785117", "summary": "Allegedly based on real events, Wolf Creek (McLean: 2005) follows three travellers, two British females and one Australian male, as they set off from Broome, Western Australia, to drive across the centre of the continent, to Cairns, Queensland.

Capital: Volume 1, Karl Marx discusses E.G. Wakefield\u2019s insights into the colony in the Swan River district in Western Australia and pokes fun at the \u2018unhappy Mr Peel\u2019 (1976: 933). Despite Thomas Peel\u2019s foresight to bring \u2018means of subsistence and production to the amount of \u00a350,000\u2019, along with 300 working class persons, he failed to arrange for \u2018the export of English relations of production\u2019 to the isolated district (ibid.)1. In the years that followed the colony\u2019s establishment in 1829, it approached collapse. Unable to generate capital and extract surplus labour, by the early 1840s colonists were petitioning for the first \u2018free\u2019 colony of Australia to introduce convict transportation2. It was ultimately through the introduction of unfree labour to Swan River in 1850 that capitalist social relations were able to advance, and almost 10,000 convicts were relocated to the location by 1868, when transportation ceased. A question that emerges from the story of Swan River, and from the early years of the other Australian colonies further east, is whether a land lacking virtually any \u2018doubly free\u2019 labour should be considered part of the capitalist mode of production.\r\n\r\nThis article argues that, despite the early Australian colonies encompassing the extensive use of unfree convict labour and a virtual absence of wage-labour, the \u2018English relations of production\u2019 (definitively capitalist relations) were present from the start. That is, the colonies were, during the first few decades after 1788, part of the British capitalist mode of production. The colonies were not pre-capitalist because they were largely a gaol and penal state, as some have argued, but were capitalist because that goal served an important social purposefor British capitalism. Further, this article argues that the failure of the colonies to trade within the world market is not itself sufficient to argue that another mode of production, non-capitalist or pre-capitalist, was in place.

With the growing population came families, and children needing education. \r\n\r\nAt first many of the squatters were single men with no children, but later, those with children either sent them 'home' to England of Scotland to be educated, or employed governesses and tutors, or sent them to boarding schools. One of the first boarding schools was at Buninyong.\r\n\r\nAfter the major gold rushes of the early 1850s the peaceful isolated life of the squatters was shattered by tens of thousands of gold seekers. At first they came alone, but soon tey brought their families and children, and with the children came a need for education - at least in the eyes of some.\r\n\r\nItinerant tent schools followed the rushes around the gold fields, then, when towns looked like becoming established more permanent schools were established either under the National Schools Board or the Denominational Schools Board. One of those towns developed on the old Daisy Hill goldfield at Amherst.\r\n\r\nThis Master of Education study looks at the history of education in the area that eventually centred on Amherst between 1836 and 1862 when the tow competing schools boards were combined into the Common Schools Board.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study includes a comprehensive history of the early gold discoveries in the Amherst, Back Creek and Talbot districts.\r\n\r\nThe book based on this study can be purchased from this link: http://historiaincognita.net/2015/05/16/the-sink-of-iniquity/.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37935018, "asset_id": 895037, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 497428, "first_name": "Douglas", "last_name": "Wilkie", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "DouglasWilkie", "display_name": "Douglas Wilkie", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/DouglasWilkie?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/497428/170863/14829758/s65_douglas.wilkie.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 150496, "name": "Victorian Gold Rushes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Gold_Rushes?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 218814, "name": "Amherst", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amherst?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 218815, "name": "Victoria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victoria?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 218816, "name": "Buninyong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buninyong?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 289348, "name": "Talbot", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Talbot?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 289349, "name": "Back Creek", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Back_Creek?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 289350, "name": "Daisy Hill", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Daisy_Hill?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 268815, "title": "Henry Lawson's \"Bogan\" Stories edited with an introduction by David Rathbone - just the introduction", "created_at": "2010-07-20T10:56:09.217-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/268815/Henry_Lawsons_Bogan_Stories_edited_with_an_introduction_by_David_Rathbone_just_the_introduction?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_268815", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 1163879, "asset_id": 268815, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 217701, "first_name": "David Albert", "last_name": "Rathbone", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "DavidRathbone", "display_name": "David Albert Rathbone", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/DavidRathbone?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/217701/49533/5973883/s65_david_albert.rathbone.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2717, "name": "Etymology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etymology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6698, "name": "Australian history (Australia)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_history_Australia_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6699, "name": "Australian society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_society?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6701, "name": "Australian multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_multiculturalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8303, "name": "Friedrich Nietzsche", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Friedrich_Nietzsche?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 17576, "name": "Australian Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Philosophy?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 162292, "name": "Australian cultural studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_cultural_studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 39617909, "title": "The Cost of Catholicism: Catholic Leadership and Colonial Chaplains in Western Australia, 1852-86", "created_at": "2019-06-17T21:17:29.071-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39617909/The_Cost_of_Catholicism_Catholic_Leadership_and_Colonial_Chaplains_in_Western_Australia_1852_86?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_39617909", "summary": "There was a significant monetary cost associated with establishing Catholicism in colonial Western Australia. The bishops and clergy funded the development of the local Catholic Church through donations from European benefactors, offerings from the congregation, and sponsorship from the Colonial and British Governments. As donations from Europe were variable and the resident Catholic population were largely poor, the government grants were the most reliable income for the Diocese of Perth. The government issued grants to support the establishment of congregations, schools, and social welfare institutions. The development of congregations in new settlements was the Catholic Church\u2019s core ministry and the government issued stipends to Catholic chaplains to administer spiritual care to settlers and convicts in particular districts. Government grants were based on the census results and the Catholic Church was required to establish local church congregations and recruit clergy, and demonstrate an ability to contribute towards the maintenance of both. From 1852 to 1886, Bishops Joseph Serra, Rosendo Salvado and Martin Griver took charge of establishing congregations, managing clergy and lobbying the governors and other civil officials to fund colonial chaplaincies.    The government also expected that the chaplains would promote moral and social order among the ex-convicts transported from Britain. \n\nThroughout the mid-colonial period the colonial chaplains developed an important role in the frontier society of Western Australia, and Catholic and civil leaderships partnered to resource the establishment of Catholic congregations. Despite the significance of the chaplaincy to Catholicism and broader society, little attention has been given to these clergy and their work. Among the few who have considered the chaplains are Marian Aveling, who questioned whether civil officials preferred the Church of England over the Catholic claim to state aid, and D.F. Bourke, who stated that officials actively undermined applications by Catholics for funding.  Exploring the work of chaplains and the engagement of Catholic leaders with officialdom will further the scholarly understanding of the role that Christianity and Christian leadership played within the social structure of the colony. It will also test the thesis of Renae Barker, that the colonial authorities created a plural Christian establishment, and Rowan Strong, who has argued that the Colonial Government implemented the principle of religious equality in the colony.  Finally, it will provide insight into Catholic leadership, particularly in relation to its ability to access government resources and sustain the Catholic mission in providing spiritual care for settlers. The study of these themes in this article is based on an expansive survey of nineteenth-century ecclesiastical correspondence within the Colonial Secretary\u2019s Office records, the colony\u2019s peak administrative apparatus.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59775074, "asset_id": 39617909, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2717611, "first_name": "Odhran", "last_name": "O'Brien", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "OdhranOBrien", "display_name": "Odhran O'Brien", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/OdhranOBrien?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2717611/874956/16129240/s65_odhran.o_brien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10322, "name": "Nineteenth Century British History and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_British_History_and_Culture?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158189, "name": "Catholic Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catholic_Church_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38781657, "title": "Re-visiting Gallipoli", "created_at": "2019-04-11T23:28:52.918-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38781657/Re_visiting_Gallipoli?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_38781657", "summary": "I am talking with Turkish filmmaker K\u00f6ken Ergun at the Rotterdam International Film Festival about a documentary that all Australian and New Zealand audiences should see.

Local folklore suggests that it was intentionally fortified as protection against Aboriginal attack and a 2009 replica of the homestead in the main street of Richmond presents this story as a central part of the region\u2019s history. A survey of the structure, however, reveals a building that is atypical but not necessarily fortified. Archaeological and architectural studies of supposedly fortified structures elsewhere are similarly equivocal. We argue that such accounts are part of a long tradition of representing Aboriginal people as a threat. The attacks that such architecture is intended to deter are on domestic spaces, and often on the sacrosanct spaces of family, women and children. As such, they enhance visions of \u2018ordinary\u2019 people as battlers and are automatically cast in terms of choices that are defensive rather than offensive. While fear was a very real experience on the frontier (on both sides), uncritical acceptance of accounts of fortified structures obscures the complexity of the frontier in the past and prevents us from seeing the ways in which such claims are being used to remember or forget the consequences of the frontier in the present.

Several themes will be examined: masculinity, femininity and defence force service; the exclusion (but also inclusion) of gay personnel in the draft; and the effects of the diffusion of social movement activism on LGBTQ culture and politics in these countries. This political history project will make a substantial contribution to knowledge, as it is a relatively understudied aspect of the Vietnam War and the social change of the 1960s and 1970s.

It seems warranted to reflect on the fact that we adopted the white killers as lost tribal members who were reincarnated. The new 'white man' was an anomaly. We adopted them into our tribe, into our cosmology and understanding of the world, and gave them names and totems because without doing so, they would simply not exist. This is because our belief systems, dreaming, law, and the nature of all things, are inter-connected. Hopefully, Australians can see value in the fact that we were initially very open and inviting to strangers, to the 'other'. Our inherent accepting nature, if practiced today by all of us, would foster a greater understanding between our two worlds. Given the white strangers to this country were incorporated into our dreaming, it follows that all Australians today, especially those who were born in this great country, are part of our dreaming. The more we can accept this the better we can live together in peace. Other important ingredients to reconciliation are respect and recognition, something we as Aboriginal people still strive for. This book contributes heavily towards this goal, by allowing readers to understand our true history.\n\nIan has documented with much precision the extreme social and economic dispossession which colonisation wrought upon Djabwurrung people. Like me, the pages may evoke a high emotional response in readers, as one is reminded of the genocidal impact of it all. However, my heart is warmed as I believe Ian's work will serve as an invaluable resource for future generations of Djabwurrung people, and will assist in reinvigorating traditional practices, language and law. It will also enlighten anyone interested in discovering more about the colonisation of our lands.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45267762, "asset_id": 19086642, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8565744, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Clark", "domain_name": "federation", "page_name": "IanClark", "display_name": "Ian Clark", "profile_url": "https://federation.academia.edu/IanClark?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8565744/2923986/3420282/s65_ian.clark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9959887, "title": "Lenton, D.A. & Frieman, C.J. 2014.

So effluxion of time brought the adoption of policy for the appointment of an Ombudsman by the Queensland Government.\r\n\r\nSuch an explanation belies the variety of factors that both aided and hampered the Queensland Ombudsman's creation throughout much of the 1960s and early 1970s. Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen made official announcement of Longland's appointment on 12 August 1974 through the provisions of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1974 that had entered into force on 1 July 1974. Longland's appointment ended more than a decade of lobbying in Queensland, providing the community with an important means of addressing complaints of administrative error in an apolitical and non-adversarial manner. Most scholarship on this topic has assessed election promises, lobbying efforts from academics, internal political negotiations and the opposition of Joh Bjelke-Petersen to the Ombudsman concept. While each is an essential component of the Ombudsman's foundation in Queensland, there has been no effort to understand how the political debate was influenced by other policy actors, particularly

Regarding the former, I explore the history, concepts and strengths/limitations of the 'working-class power resource' theory that Schulman advances to account for differences in the behaviour of neoliberal labour governments in the three study states. Despite the fact that it imbues organised labour with a certain sense of agency in the rise of neoliberalism, I argue that, as a mid-range institutional theory, it has limited explanatory power when disarticulated from a rigorous hierarchy of abstraction. Certain other weaknesses of the approach, such as a formalistic and mechanistic account of working-class power, also see Schulman overstate the case for Australian exceptionalism. I suggest a way forward that combines Schulman's excellent account of the institutional articulation between trade unions and labour parties with a carefully formulated construction of neoliberalism as a concept.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60052463, "asset_id": 39869573, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14701639, "first_name": "Brett", "last_name": "Heino", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "BrettHeino", "display_name": "Brett Heino", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/BrettHeino?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14701639/4001442/16436966/s65_brett.heino.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29, "name": "Industrial And Labor Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_And_Labor_Relations?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3357, "name": "Industrial Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_Relations?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19464, "name": "History of New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_Zealand?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 34047279, "title": "'\"The Dawn\" of Australian Archaeology: John Mulvaney at Fromm\u2019s Landing', Journal of Pacific Archaeology 8(1) (2017), 100-111.", "created_at": "2017-07-26T19:03:09.163-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34047279/_The_Dawn_of_Australian_Archaeology_John_Mulvaney_at_Fromm_s_Landing_Journal_of_Pacific_Archaeology_8_1_2017_100_111?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_34047279", "summary": "When Vere Gordon Childe returned to Australia in 1957 a er thirty-six years abroad, he despaired at the lack of research into Australia\u2019s Aboriginal past.

C.J. Dennis was an enormously popular Australian writer in the early Twentieth century, noted for many humorous and touching verse-novels about ordinary Australians. Part of Dennis's style and the charm of his writing was the sustained use of spoken Australian vernacular. Unfortunately, more than 100 years later, the slang has become obsolete and is hard to understand, and the gritty urban and rural contexts are very different from modern Twenty-first century, highly technologized, global life. The annotating of C.J. Dennis's original verse-novel and the expansion of the Glossary that Dennis originally felt was necessary, is intended to (reintroduce e Dennis and his vividly depicted characters to a modern audience. Ginger Mick is the bachelor friend of Dennis's other main fictional character, the Sentimental Bloke, himself the subject of a 1915 book. It is immediately obvious that Dennis writes his stories as though they are being told by the Sentimental Bloke himself, with his phonetic pronunciation and intense use of slang. The verse-novel of Ginger Mick and his moods tells how Ginger Mick decides, eventually, to volunteer for the Australian Army, and is then trained, sent first to Egypt for further battle training, and then becomes part of the ANZAC and Allies invasion of the Ottoman Turkish Empire at Gallipoli. To properly understand the verse-novel, the Bloke's slang needs to be carefully translated, and the contextual and (now, more than 100 years later) historical references need to be explained.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52296329, "asset_id": 32033311, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15278309, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Gough", "domain_name": "emaxhealth", "page_name": "JohnGough", "display_name": "John Gough", "profile_url": "https://emaxhealth.academia.edu/JohnGough?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15278309/5677909/6459501/s65_john.gough.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14482, "name": "World War I", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_I?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 56281, "name": "English language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_and_literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 72080, "name": "Gallipoli", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gallipoli?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 101404, "name": "Australian Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Popular_Culture?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 31862913, "title": "The Seven Pillars of Aboriginal Exception to the Australian State: Camps, Refugees, Biopolitics and the Northern Territory Emergency Response (NTER)", "created_at": "2017-03-14T10:00:36.590-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31862913/The_Seven_Pillars_of_Aboriginal_Exception_to_the_Australian_State_Camps_Refugees_Biopolitics_and_the_Northern_Territory_Emergency_Response_NTER_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_31862913", "summary": "Published as part of the collection: Baehr, Elisabeth, and Barbara Schmidt-Haberkamp, eds. 2017. \"And there'll be NO dancing\".

I situate the novel in the context of America\u2019s cyclically neo-colonial history in Australia and draw upon the work of Homi K.

I further suggest that, in the tradition of satire, the novel could be read as a warning to Australians against following the United State too closely.\nWith the rise of the self-proclaimed Islamic State, Australia has witnessed the re-emergence of the political climate that is reflected in Underground, renewing its relevance to contemporary audiences.\n\nThe original article appears in the Open Access Journal [Inter]sections.

This paper will discuss the statement of Marxist historian, Humphrey McQueen, from his book, A New Britannia: An Argument Concerning the Social Origins of Australian Radicalism and Nationalism, in which he claimed that 'racism is the most important single component of Australian nationalism'. The discussion will include an examination of the ideology and background that informed McQueen\u2019s writings, a review of the impact of racism on Australian nationalism, and a brief overview of some of the debates that the book and statement have attracted. The conclusion upholds McQueen\u2019s argument that racism has been the single most important component in the imaging of Australian nationalism and identity, and that it remains deeply embedded in the contemporary national psyche.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36933864, "asset_id": 11363683, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26382657, "first_name": "Nicole", "last_name": "Meyer Conner", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "NicoleMeyerConner", "display_name": "Nicole  Meyer Conner", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/NicoleMeyerConner?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26382657/7301951/8214038/s65_nicole.meyer_conner.jpg_oh_7262bdf25efe8c068069a2cf5e5a9be7_oe_55551025___gda___1435600989_204886881381c5c5e2add1fa8775a5be"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 134, "name": "Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9339045, "title": "Menangle Australian Light Horse Camp 1916", "created_at": "2014-11-16T11:02:12.589-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9339045/Menangle_Australian_Light_Horse_Camp_1916?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_9339045", "summary": "A little known military facility in the local area during the First World War was the Menangle Australian Light Horse Camp based on the Menangle Park racecourse in 1916.

"dom_id": "work_3732763", "summary": "Growing up in the small River Murray town of Wellington, South Australia as the twentieth century turned, Henrietta (Ruth) Sabina Heathcock (nee Rayney) enjoyed a childhood shaped as much by Ngarrindjeri Aboriginal friends and elders, as by her close-knit Anglo-Irish family. The Rayney family lived on the eastern, Aboriginal, side of town, where Ngarrindjeri had lived for millennia, and where, in the 1880s, a group of Ngarrindjeri families from nearby Point McLeay Mission had been granted hard-won title  to farm the land and raise their families (Jenkin 1979, 229-231). Wellington, indeed, was one of a number of pockets across colonial Australia where lived processes of negotiation and exchange between Aboriginal peoples and newcomers blurred social boundaries and mapped dynamic inter-cultural terrains on the frontier (see for example Hughes 2012, Balint 2012, Ryan 2011, Landon and Tonkin 1999, Yu 1994).  Reflecting on her childhood friendships forged at Wellington in the first two decades of the 1900s, Ruth Heathcock recalled, \u2018I went to school with Aboriginal children. Skin colour?  It was all the same to me. I didn\u2019t even know it existed\u2019 (Hughes 1986).\r\n\r\nIn the following article I explore continuities in the nature of cross-cultural intimacy over time by examining the friendships that Ruth Heathcock sustained with Aboriginal people at Wellington, and later across a range of other sites. These played out against a backdrop of restrictive race-based legislation that attempted to foreclose possibilities for such connectivity in early and mid-twentieth century Australia.

The stories of Ruth and Sereste Khama, exiled from colonial Botswana, and those of Chinese refugees threatened with deportation and separation from their white Australian wives along with their Australian wives, reveal how legal rearticulations in the immediate postwar era created new, if quixotic, points of opposition for ordinary people to make their voices heard. As the British Empire became the Commonwealth, codifying the freedoms of the imperial subject, and ideas of universal human rights \u201cirrespective of race, color, or creed\u201d slowly emerged, and claims of rights long denied seemed to take on a renewed meaning. The sanctity of marriage and family, which played central metaphorical and practical roles for both the British Empire and the United Nations, was a primary motor of contention in both cases, and was mobilized in both metaphorical and practical ways to press for change. Striking similarities between our chosen case studies reveal how ideals of imperial domesticity and loyalty, and the universalism of the new global \u201cfamily of man,\u201d were simultaneously invoked to undermine discourses of racial purity. Our analysis makes a significant contribution to studies of gender and empire, as well as the history of human rights, an ideal which in the late 1940s was being vernacularized alongside existing forms of claim-making and political organization in local contexts across the world.

This article explores the role that flogging played in enforcing work- discipline, with particular attention to the relationship between the lash, alternative disciplinary punishments and labour incentives. Focusing on the evolution of labour incentives between 1788 and 1838, the article uses governmental reports and eyewitness accounts of discipline in the colonies to identify the changing policies of the colonial government toward flogging. In doing so, it seeks to analyse the balance between discipline and inducement the colonial authorities were required to strike under the influence of British penal philosophy and the immediate labour requirements of the colonies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55670934, "asset_id": 35794484, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52541315, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Firth", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MatthewFirth", "display_name": "Matthew Firth", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/MatthewFirth?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52541315/13880517/36179932/s65_matthew.firth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 77882, "name": "Corporal Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporal_Punishment?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 32864965, "title": "\"Access to legal representation by criminal defendants in Victoria, 1861-1961,\" University of New South Wales Law Journal 40, no. 2 (2017) 638-663.", "created_at": "2017-05-05T10:18:13.605-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32864965/_Access_to_legal_representation_by_criminal_defendants_in_Victoria_1861_1961_University_of_New_South_Wales_Law_Journal_40_no_2_2017_638_663?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_32864965", "summary": "This article begins by tracing the origins of defence counsel\u2019s inclusion in felony trials by surveying the major scholarship in the history of legal representation and highlighting the current article\u2019s contribution.

Using the study\u2019s sample of trials of indictable crimes, we consider who had access to legal representation and how the background of defendants influenced their capacity to retain counsel. Finally, we conclude by considering the history of public provision of defence counsel to impoverished accused, and why the schemes introduced during the early 20th century failed to deliver substantially increased levels of representation.

In response to these problems, a growing number of policy makers, public and private organizations, and academics have pushed for the development and implementation of justice reinvestment (JR) initiatives in Australia. This article provides an overview of JR. It highlights some of the more pertinent problems facing the justice system, offenders,\nvictims of crime, and local communities in regards to the use of punishment and incarceration in Australia.

Australian criminal justice histories like those elsewhere remain underdeveloped despite attention to specific areas of inquiry such as gender, which bear on the subject of child victims. Serious problems of access to public archives, where materials involving children are invariably closed or otherwise strictly controlled, frustrate scholarly efforts to assess the scope and detail of the law\u2019s response. These factors are exacerbated for institutions that had charge of children \u2013 researchers have had to wait for public inquiries such as the current Royal Commission into Institutional Child Sexual Abuse to open organisational policies and practices to greater scrutiny. This chapter reconsiders the popular assumption that mechanisms of prosecution and punishment for sexual offences against children are a very recent historical phenomena. While recognising that responses to the maltreatment of children are not always located in the court room, we argue that the historical volume of criminal justice responses constitute a significant index of social attitudes towards children. In that context, we review briefly some of the historical conditions for recognition of child sexual assault, the policing and justice responses that follow from its recognition, and conclude by considering associated problems of silence and invisibility. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48502517, "asset_id": 28191337, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16423950, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Finnane", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "MarkFinnane", "display_name": "Mark Finnane", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/MarkFinnane?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16423950/4469675/5215078/s65_mark.finnane.jpg"}, {"id": 16837580, "first_name": "Yorick", "last_name": "Smaal", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "YorickSmaal", "display_name": "Yorick Smaal", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/YorickSmaal?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16837580/5015555/11063415/s65_yorick.smaal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6463, "name": "History of Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Sexuality?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7337, "name": "History of Childhood and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Childhood_and_Youth?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73740, "name": "Child Sexual Abuse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_Sexual_Abuse?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27990516, "title": "EBENEZER -A NEW SONG", "created_at": "2016-08-24T17:45:01.471-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27990516/EBENEZER_A_NEW_SONG?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_27990516", "summary": "Within a period of fifty years, the Aborigines of the Wimmera witnessed the initial European exploration into their territory in the late 1830s, witnessed and participated in first contacts with the Europeans in the early 1840s, saw the establishment of Ebenezer Mission Station at \nthe beginning of 1859, entered into the spiritual successes of the mission in the 1860s, and in the late 1870s became instrumental in the mission's change of emphasis to a more secular approach.

At crucial periods in Australian history tensions involving minorities that did not conform to majoritarian expectations have flared up. The late nineteenth century was rife with racist and religionist tensions, particularly focused on the Chinese community, which influenced the Federation (1901) agenda for Australia. This agenda, enshrined in legislation such as the Immigration Restriction Act (1901) and other Acts constituting the White Australia Policy, determined Australian immigration until the late 1960s. Sexual minorities, particularly gays and lesbians, have not generally posed the overt and public challenge to \u2018Australian values\u2019 that alien ethnic and religious groups have. However, there are important synergies between the two cases and the challenges they pose for mainstream Australia. What is central to majoritarian Australia is peripheral to them; what is normative is alien. Their communities gather in areas that are \u201cundesirable\u201d or unwanted by the establishment, and their \u201cdeviant\u201d practices take place in mysterious, substantially hidden locations. \r\n\r\nThis paper examines two case studies of communities that challenged majoritarian Australia, and the places and constructed spaces associated with them in Sydney. The first case study is focused on the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Chinese community and the two temples in which the Chinese carried on their religious life; Sze Yup in Glebe (1904) and Yui Ming in Alexandria (1909). The witch-hunt against the Chinese culminated in a Royal Commission in 1891, which exonerated them on all counts (opium addiction, sexual immorality, and stealing the jobs of whites). The second case study examines the police raids on Club 80, a gay male venue that was located at various addresses in the inner city suburb of Darlinghurst. This witch-hunt was the last gasp of a long campaign waged by conservative elements of society against homosexuals in Sydney. The first Gay Mardi Gras parade in 1978 and the ultimate failure to close venues like Club 80 signalled profound social change. This research is a significant contribution to scholarship, in that it establishes important parallels between deviant ethnic religion and deviant sexuality and raises questions concerning what is regarded as decent and indecent, central and peripheral, healthy and unhealthy, normal and abnormal, \u201cother\u201d and \u201csame,\u201d safe and dangerous, in the Australian context. These issues are located within Australia\u2019s emerging multiculturalism and multi-faith post-Christian religious landscape, and Sydney\u2019s emerging reputation as one of the premier gay cities of the world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35207437, "asset_id": 738509, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 444509, "first_name": "Carole", "last_name": "Cusack", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "CaroleCusack", "display_name": "Carole Cusack", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/CaroleCusack?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/444509/195379/74283631/s65_carole.cusack.jpg"}, {"id": 2847740, "first_name": "Jason", "last_name": "Prior", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "JasonPrior", "display_name": "Jason Prior", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/JasonPrior?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2847740/935611/40445125/s65_jason.prior.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 213, "name": "Sociology Of Deviance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_Of_Deviance?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2837, "name": "Chinese Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Religions?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4918, "name": "Gay And Lesbian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_And_Lesbian_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 16192, "name": "Australian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Politics?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 22181, "name": "Representation of Others", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation_of_Others?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 26979, "name": "Gay and Lesbian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_and_Lesbian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 129908, "name": "Sydney", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sydney?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 44177258, "title": "'The Chinese Doctor James Lamsey': performing medical sovereignty and property in settler colonial Bendigo.", "created_at": "2020-09-27T18:05:14.154-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44177258/The_Chinese_Doctor_James_Lamsey_performing_medical_sovereignty_and_property_in_settler_colonial_Bendigo?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_44177258", "summary": "This article traces the spatially grounded operation of \u2018medical sovereignty\u2019 by reading property alongside medical practice and regulation in a settler colonial city. It does so through the lens of the Antipodean life of one Canton-born doctor, James Lamsey, who was a prolific proprietor in the regional Australian city of Bendigo and used his interlinked proprietorial and medical powers to mediate between the Bendigo Chinese community and white settlers and doctors. Reading medical power through the lens of Lamsey\u2019s life, shaped, as it was, by European-made laws, shows how settler medical sovereignty was enacted in a dynamic relation with Chinese medical sovereignty, performed here in the urban context of Bendigo, on unceded Indigenous Dja Dja Wurrung land. With support from the common law system, health-related boards were, in the late nineteenth century, intensifying a settler sovereignty, where board members and doctors practised increasingly exclusive forms of discretionary power and exercised the right to exclude non-white people from membership. At the same time, Lamsey was enacting a diasporic medical sovereignty that drew on Chinese imperial and British colonial authority. He leveraged his medical sovereignty towards promoting collective Chinese entitlements to health and to counter the exclusions of a whitening settler sovereignty.\n\n   ", "downloadable_attachments":

The Uluru statement from the heart of the country invoked the potent politics of heart, and can be understood as part of a long lineage or repertoire of political and affective Indigenous/settler invocations for peace building and agreement-making in settler colonies that have been shaped by violence and dispossession, and can be located within a global a paradigm of reconciliation and redress. This lecture explores the way that such reconciliation performances, however fraught, have sought transition to a new moral order and may be understood as critical rites of passage in settler societies, working towards an imagined refounding of nation. Importantly, in search of a new emancipatory politics, the paper considers Indigenous-led refutations or reworkings of the consensus politics of reconciliation in Australia\u2019s public culture, where state based rituals may falter. Taking account of the cultural politics of emotion, truth telling, and embodied performance in pressing matters of history, the paper shows how these Indigenous led performances are risky and often experimental border-crossings that offer us glimpses of new postcolonial futures. Includes a postscript on the Government's rejection of the Statement from Heart in late October 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish to dedicate this lecture to my colleague and dear friend Associate Professor Tracey Banivanua Mar, of La Trobe University, Melbourne, who passed away in Australia this year. Many of us have learned so much from Tracey\u2019s critical insights. Brilliant, passionate and steadfast in her politics, Tracey has gifted us with activist, emancipatory scholarship of the highest calibre.

It demonstrates just how proficient women were in employing a diverse vocabulary of emotions \u2013 drawing on concepts like embarrassment, humiliation, honour, courage, and chivalry \u2013 in the attempt to achieve their political goals. It looks at how far nationalist contexts informed each gendered emotional community at a time when British imperial networks were under extreme duress. The book presents a unique history of gender and shame which demonstrates just how versatile and ever-present this social emotion was in the feminist politics of the British Empire in the early decades of the twentieth century. It employs a fascinating new thematic lens to histories of anti-feminist/feminist entanglements by tracing national and transnational uses of emotions by women to police their own political communities. It also challenges the common notion that shame had little place in a modernizing world by revealing how far groups of patriotic womanhood, globally, deployed shame to combat the effects of feminist activism.\r\n\r\nhttps://books.google.com.au/books/about/Shame_and_the_Anti_Feminist_Backlash.html?id=ZJxADwAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y\r\nhttps://www.routledge.com/Shame-and-the-Anti-Feminist-Backlash-Britain-Ireland-and-Australia-1890-1920/Crozier-De-Rosa/p/book/9780415635868\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81868625, "asset_id": 35424199, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 126741, "first_name": "Sharon", "last_name": "Crozier-De Rosa", "domain_name": "uow", "page_name": "SharonCrozierDeRosa", "display_name": "Sharon  Crozier-De Rosa", "profile_url": "https://uow.academia.edu/SharonCrozierDeRosa?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/126741/33801/18777174/s65_sharon.crozier-de_rosa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17416, "name": "History of Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Feminism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18970, "name": "British Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperialism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28508, "name": "History of Nationalism and Nation-Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Nationalism_and_Nation-Building?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 342835, "name": "Irish Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irish_Nationalism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 642528, "name": "History of Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Emotions-1?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 32017937, "title": "\u201cFifty shades of bully beef: Food at Gallipoli in 1915\u201d.

Historians have noted that the investment from the imperial government provided for much-needed development in the settlement following successive stretches of economic stagnation. The effect was even more far-reaching than the current historical landscape has suggested, particularly in regards to the religious ramifications. Prior to the transportation of convicts, senior Catholic clergyman and governors had long debated the equitable level of state-aid for the Diocese of Perth. The arrival of convicts both accelerated and exacerbated the diocese's impetus for support from the government. The spiritual and physical care given to convicts became a central concern of the Church. Prison riots, the dramatic escape of incarcerated Fenians and other events associated with convicts acted as the catalyst for conflict between the colonial governors and Bishops Joseph Serra, Rosendo Salvado and Martin Griver. Despite intermittent conflict, these clergy were able to gain significant state-aid. Therefore, this paper explores the response of Catholic and civil leadership to convictism in Western Australia and its impact on Catholic Church-state relations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51650743, "asset_id": 31243712, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2717611, "first_name": "Odhran", "last_name": "O'Brien", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "OdhranOBrien", "display_name": "Odhran O'Brien", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/OdhranOBrien?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2717611/874956/16129240/s65_odhran.o_brien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8495, "name": "History of Missions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Missions?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14893, "name": "Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116468, "name": "Church and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_and_State?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 158189, "name": "Catholic Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catholic_Church_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1769654, "name": "Western Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Australian_history?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 30756718, "title": "Crux Matters, Queensland History Journal, February 2017, Vol.23 No.4 (pp.286 - 291)", "created_at": "2017-01-04T22:57:40.520-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30756718/Crux_Matters_Queensland_History_Journal_February_2017_Vol_23_No_4_pp_286_291_?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_30756718", "summary": "Explores the notion that Australia's most famous aircraft - Charles Kingsford Smith's 'Southern Cross' - might have borrowed its name not from the heavens or the Antipodes but rather, from a little known Masonic Lodge in British Columbia.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51418100, "asset_id": 30756718, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33055190, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Clayton", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MarkClayton15", "display_name": "Mark Clayton", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MarkClayton15?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33055190/10938341/15984909/s65_mark.clayton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63917, "name": "Aviation History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aviation_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 103599, "name": "Masonic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masonic_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 270870, "name": "Vancouver BC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vancouver_BC?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 554355, "name": "Pacific ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_ocean?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 681851, "name": "Fokker", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fokker?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1003939, "name": "Masons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masons?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2606300, "name": "Crux", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crux?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2606301, "name": "Southern Cross", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Cross?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2606302, "name": "Charles Kingsford Smith", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Charles_Kingsford_Smith?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 29282120, "title": "A much misunderstood monster: the German ogre and Australia\u2019s final and forgotten recruiting campaign of the Great War", "created_at": "2016-10-19T19:50:30.335-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29282120/A_much_misunderstood_monster_the_German_ogre_and_Australia_s_final_and_forgotten_recruiting_campaign_of_the_Great_War?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_29282120", "summary": "In the final weeks of the First World War, the Australian government released a poster of a monstrous German threatening the globe with his bloody hands.

Subjectively, however, it was a different matter. In the public imagination, the two dominions were saturated with German spies, who were passing information back to the Fatherland, carrying out acts of sabotage and subverting the loyalty of \u2018British\u2019 Australians and New Zealanders through pacifist and socialist propaganda. This fear of the \u2018enemy within the gates\u2019, in historian Ernest Scott\u2019s phrase, is well known. But the fear of the enemy at the gates, the fear of external attack, is not. While the spectre of a German invasion and occupation was frequently employed for propaganda purposes in both Australia and New Zealand during the war, it is not clear how many people saw this as a realistic threat. Perhaps surprisingly, though, at least by the last year of the war, the main danger was perceived to come not on land or from the sea\u2014at least not directly\u2014 but from the air. The little-known mystery aeroplane panic of 1918 is the most extreme example of this fear. The hundreds of reports received by the press and the authorities in Australia and, to a lesser extent, New Zealand, of otherwise unexplainable aircraft flying over widely separated parts of both countries were widely interpreted as being German in origin, operating from naval raiders off the coast or from secret bases inland. The reports were spurious, misperceptions or hoaxes, but both governments took them seriously; Australia, at least, undertook substantial defensive precautions as a result, turning what otherwise would have been a minor scare into a major panic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60730252, "asset_id": 27322399, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27179, "first_name": "Brett", "last_name": "Holman", "domain_name": "canberra", "page_name": "BrettHolman", "display_name": "Brett Holman", "profile_url": "https://canberra.academia.edu/BrettHolman?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/a78adc2c40454776ebae36ca99e5d942?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557, "name": "History of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Technology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3877, "name": "Twentieth Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twentieth_Century_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14452, "name": "Aviation History (Transport History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aviation_History_Transport_History_?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19464, "name": "History of New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_Zealand?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19600, "name": "Air Power History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Air_Power_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 19977, "name": "War and society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_and_society?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 25166, "name": "20th Century", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20th_Century?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 25786437, "title": "'What a howl there would be if some of our folk were so treated by an enemy': The evacuation of Aboriginal people from Cape Bedford Mission, 1942 1", "created_at": "2016-06-01T15:39:22.197-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25786437/What_a_howl_there_would_be_if_some_of_our_folk_were_so_treated_by_an_enemy_The_evacuation_of_Aboriginal_people_from_Cape_Bedford_Mission_1942_1?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_25786437", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46145594, "asset_id": 25786437, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 879120, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Richards", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "JonathanRichards", "display_name": "Jonathan Richards", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/JonathanRichards?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/879120/686616/14372629/s65_jonathan.richards.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 22572324, "title": "\"\u2018De l\u2019ombre \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re\u2019: Remembering Fromelles through a Century of Private Grief and Public Politics\", in The French Australian Review, issue 59, Australian Summer 2015-2016, pp. 7-29", "created_at": "2016-02-28T21:35:44.512-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22572324/_De_l_ombre_%C3%A0_la_lumi%C3%A8re_Remembering_Fromelles_through_a_Century_of_Private_Grief_and_Public_Politics_in_The_French_Australian_Review_issue_59_Australian_Summer_2015_2016_pp_7_29?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_22572324", "summary": "For decades Fromelles was Australia\u2019s forgotten battle, an orphan to Australia\u2019s Great War experiences. While Fromelles paled in comparison to the public\u2019s awareness of Gallipoli, Fromelles was nevertheless a significant battle, not only because it was the Australian Imperial Force\u2019s first foray on the Western Front, but because of the significant casualties endured: 5,533. For each life destroyed by the Battle of Fromelles, a family survived to endure the tragedy of loss. As every wounded veteran returned home they struggled to have their efforts acknowledged. This article examines the commemorative practices that have surrounded Fromelles since 1916. Predominant was the persistent nature of both familial remembrance and the corporate memory of veterans. Regarded as already forgotten in 1919, this paper confronts the complexities of forgetting and remembering as Fromelles entered the national consciousness again in the 1980s as part of a wider reconnection with Anzac and the later discovery of missing Fromelles war dead by Lambis Englezos.  Fromelles has now found its place within the Anzac tradition.

Involvement by Australian practitioners in IPRA began in 1959 and became intensive during a 15-year period from 1982 to the late-1990s when a number of Australians took global leadership roles. Drawing from the IPRA archive and recent interviews by the authors with prominent practitioners in Europe and Australia, who were involved in IPRA\u2019s management and leadership, this article establishes the narrative of international engagement by the burgeoning Australian PR sector and explores the aims and effects of its involvement in IPRA. It concludes that IPRA\u2019s impact on the development of the Australian public relations sector and Australian influence on IPRA was  largely ephemeral, limited to a decade from 1983 to 1993, and reveals some problematic aspects of industry practice and governance. Nevertheless, Australian practitioners made use of both the symbolism of international endorsement and international connections established through IPRA to transform the national PR sector from a predominantly local focus to an increasingly international outlook at a time when public relations services were expanding rapidly worldwide.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36026478,

When placed in dialogue with one another, new cross-culturally nuanced narratives emerge from within the women's domestic spaces and everyday lives that exhibit agency and negotiation; producing an historical understanding that is localised, embodied, and very often oppositional to federation's imperative to create a nation based on cultural pillars of whiteness.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 25992140, "asset_id": 1853192, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1142361, "first_name": "Karen", "last_name": "Hughes", "domain_name": "swinburne", "page_name": "KarenHughes", "display_name": "Karen Hughes", "profile_url": "https://swinburne.academia.edu/KarenHughes?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1142361/1371719/3147055/s65_karen.hughes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1192, "name": "Feminist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Theory?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8032, "name": "Cross-Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 10469, "name": "Whiteness Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 12760, "name": "Postcolonial Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Feminism?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 13626, "name": "Microhistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Microhistory?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15588, "name": "Social History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 1578854, "title": "Sports fan movements to save suburban-based teams threatened with amalgamation in different football codes in Australia.", "created_at": "2012-05-21T11:45:11.714-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1578854/Sports_fan_movements_to_save_suburban_based_teams_threatened_with_amalgamation_in_different_football_codes_in_Australia?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_1578854", "summary": "During the late 1980s and 1990s there has been an international acceleration in the rationalisation and relocation of professional sporting teams and competitions. While this process has had a long history in the United States, it has occurred much more rapidly in other societies. In Australia, there has been a dual process of national expansion of professional sporting competitions and pressures placed on historic suburban-based clubs. In addition, there has been a massive infusion of international capital in the form of television interest in Australian professional sports. In rugby league this caused a temporary split in the national competition. In rugby union it has led to open professionalism and greater integration with South Africa and New Zealand. And, in Australian Rules football, the governing\nbody has worked to protect itself against an outside takeover such as has plagued rugby league. At the same time, both the Australian Football League (AFL) and the National Rugby League (NRL) and their predeessors have worked to rationalise the number of suburban Melbourne and Sydney-based clubs respectively while promoting a policy of national expansion and for rugby league even international expansion to Auckland, New Zealand. We examine fan responses to these changes\nparticularly when their club is threatened with merging with other clubs, We discuss the dynamics of this process that are unique to the Australian context in our analysis of global capital and local audiences and suggest how this connects with a theoretical understanding of such processes more generally and comparisons that can be made between Australia and other countries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 27181764, "asset_id": 1578854, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1059175, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Nauright", "domain_name": "lhup", "page_name": "JohnNauright", "display_name": "John Nauright", "profile_url": "https://lhup.academia.edu/JohnNauright?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1059175/365761/32897215/s65_john.nauright.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4216, "name": "Sports History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 182063, "name": "Australian sports history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_sports_history?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 398358, "title": "TURNER, S. 2005.

It is argued that this framework is anachronistic, creating a barrier to a proper appreciation of religion in Australian political history. In keeping with much British Enlightenment thinking, religion through much of Australia\u2019s history was deemed to have great social utility and its promotion was of central secular significance. This understanding framed the education debates of the second half of the nineteenth century as well as the social welfare reforms and institution building around the Federation period. Such developments cast doubt on claims that secularism of an exclusionary kind is a key element of the now widely invoked category of the Australian settlement.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61447910, "asset_id": 39320040, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19845487, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Chavura", "domain_name": "campion", "page_name": "StephenChavura", "display_name": "Stephen A Chavura", "profile_url": "https://campion.academia.edu/StephenChavura?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19845487/5516507/49083540/s65_stephen.chavura.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12624, "name": "History of Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Political_Thought?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14971, "name": "Politics of Secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Secularism?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19283, "name": "Secularisms and Secularities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secularisms_and_Secularities?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21096, "name": "Separation of Church and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Separation_of_Church_and_State?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 38610039, "title": "'Convict Suffering and Salvation in New Caledonia and Australia: The Life and Writing of French Bagnard-Poet Julien de Sanary,' The French Australian Review, 65 (2019), pp. 23-47.", "created_at": "2019-03-22T18:54:31.186-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38610039/Convict_Suffering_and_Salvation_in_New_Caledonia_and_Australia_The_Life_and_Writing_of_French_Bagnard_Poet_Julien_de_Sanary_The_French_Australian_Review_65_2019_pp_23_47?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_38610039", "summary": "This article offers a contextualised analysis of the published writing of the French convict-poet Julien de Sanary. Transported from France to the penal colony in New Caledonia in 1881, Sanary spent almost forty years of his life incarcerated in the archipelago before his case was taken up by an Australian woman, Wolla Meranda, who successfully petitioned for his release in 1920. Here I offer the first extended study of Sanary\u2019s life and work, and provide the first ever translation of Sanary\u2019s poetry into English. I discuss the meaning of the act of writing for the French convict and provide an analysis of some of the major themes of his poetry. In addition I point out the greater significance of Sanary\u2019s life and poetry to the histories of New Caledonia and Australia as European settler colonies, arguing that his experiences and relationship with Meranda are illustrative of a prevailing trope in the early twentieth century concerning the backwardness of New Caledonia as a European settler colony relative to Australia.

It describes what characterises the Australian use of humour, the origins and etymology of \"the larrikin\" which operates as a visual short-hand to depict Australian national identity.

It does so through the testimony of Chinese gold miners who protested the seizure of their gold by customs officials in Sydney Harbour. As a result of these protests, a \" New South Wales Select Committee into the Seizure of Gold from Chinese Miners \" was established in 1857 to investigate customs law and \" coolie \" rights. The findings of this committee uncovered Chinese and white settler memories over failed coolie transportation schemes, revealing the ways in which the legacies of coolie migration continued to shape understandings in the Australian colonies of law, labor rights, and fair taxation well after the cessation of such schemes in the 1840s. The archive of Chinese grievance against the colonial state, preserved in testimonies given to the select committee, reveal the long shadow of slavery in the British Empire, the complexities of multiracial communities, and the role of law and legal institutions in shaping both. In 1857, a scandal erupted in Sydney over New South Wales (NSW) customs offi-cials' seizure of gold from Chinese gold miners. These men were returning to China with gold earnings without paying a newly introduced duty tax. Much more than a dispute over unpaid taxes, the act was a violent expropriation of the Chinese miners' gold. This article focuses on arguments made by NSW authorities in defense of the seizure, including the accusation made by customs officials that Chinese miners were taking part in a conspiracy to reintroduce a \" coolie \" trade. A little known footnote in the history of the Australian gold rushes, this scandal has never been studied before. Here I use it to probe the legacy of the coolie trade in the Australian colonies and how it informed debates in NSW over free and unfree labor. Chinese miners protested the confiscation of their gold forcing the colonial government to conduct a formal investigation. A select committee into the seizure was established by the NSW legislative assembly as a result. 1 I show how their findings uncovered settler memories over failed Asian indentured labor schemes in Australia, revealing how the legacies of forced Asian migration continued to shape understandings in the Australian colonies over labor rights and fair taxation well after the cessation of such schemes in the early 1850s. In the process, two populations\u2014Chinese indentured laborers and Chinese gold miners\u2014became closely entwined symbols of a new social order that saw Chinese migrants deeply embroiled in a transitional moment in colonial systems of labor. The petitions of the Chinese and the hearings of the select committee also offer rare documentation of the claims of the Chinese.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53155256, "asset_id": 33047172, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33055810, "first_name": "Sophie", "last_name": "Loy-Wilson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "SophieLoyWilson", "display_name": "Sophie Loy-Wilson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/SophieLoyWilson?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33055810/9816264/16316688/s65_sophie.loy-wilson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6283, "name": "History of Slavery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Slavery?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36390, "name": "Australian Gold Rush", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Gold_Rush?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 118778, "name": "Coolie trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coolie_trade?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 700343, "name": "Chinese indentured labor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_indentured_labor?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 32693787, "title": "Too many cooks: prints of Paddy Fordham", "created_at": "2017-04-27T20:45:42.696-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32693787/Too_many_cooks_prints_of_Paddy_Fordham?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_32693787", "summary": "Catalogue for exhibition 'Plotting the Island', curated by Kerrianne Stone, Noel Shaw Gallery, The University of Melbourne, 2017.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52857840, "asset_id": 32693787, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3363124, "first_name": "Susan", "last_name": "Lowish", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "SusanLowish", "display_name": "Susan  Lowish", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/SusanLowish?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3363124/6355704/7191671/s65_susan.lowish.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48670, "name": "Rock Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rock_Art?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32379587, "title": "Between Memory and History: Remembering Johnnies, Mehmets, and the Armenians", "created_at": "2017-04-11T08:10:06.625-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32379587/Between_Memory_and_History_Remembering_Johnnies_Mehmets_and_the_Armenians?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_32379587", "summary": "The magnanimous and heart-rending elegy, attributed to the founder of the Turkish\nRepublic Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, 'Those heroes that shed their blood, and lost their lives ...' is probably the most well-known quotation to commemorate the Gallipoli Campaign.

Weir\u2019s 1981 feature film, Gallipoli, is perhaps the most influential modern text on the 1915 campaign in Turkey. Underpinned by a radical nationalist interpretation of\nevents, Weir\u2019s film is a text that reinforced Australian (and Turkish) national mythologies and simplified a complex multiethnic campaign with key international linkages through its exclusive interrogation of the British\u2013Australian imperial\nrelationship. Weir\u2019s film has been profoundly influential in educational circles both within and beyond Australia. The limitations of the nationalist paradigm have increasingly been challenged in the new millennium by historians and filmmakers who have reinterpreted Gallipoli through a more layered and nuanced transnational lens. Two prime examples of such visual texts that embody the work of leading historians in the field are Wain Fimeri\u2019s Revealing Gallipoli and Tolga Ornek\u2019s 'Gallipoli: The Frontline Experience', each made in 2005 for the ninetieth anniversary of the campaign. A comparative analysis of these two texts demonstrates the value of the new documentary form as a tool for recovering memory of the campaign outside Australia and for exploring its multiple meanings. This article discusses the transnational production dimensions of both documentaries and their varying intercultural reception\nby considering the distinctive meanings and role in collective memory in turn for a New Zealand, Turkish and Irish audience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42340295, "asset_id": 21668793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18313056, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "auckland", "page_name": "JamesBennett", "display_name": "James Bennett", "profile_url": "https://auckland.academia.edu/JamesBennett?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18313056/5144225/5893667/s65_james.bennett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8233, "name": "Transnational History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19464, "name": "History of New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_New_Zealand?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23214, "name": "Documentary Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Documentary_Film?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 16104395, "title": "Introducing Fictocriticism: Writing Reflexivities of History, Culture and Subjectivity", "created_at": "2015-09-23T15:47:41.475-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16104395/Introducing_Fictocriticism_Writing_Reflexivities_of_History_Culture_and_Subjectivity?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_16104395", "summary": "The purpose of this paper is to introduce fictocritical writing to Japanese audiences. This paper commences by locating fictocritical writing at the critical end of Communication Studies. Rather than defining the formal characteristics of what fictocritical writing might be, more interest is given to the theoretical concerns of representing experience that have driven this development. Once these writing practices have been located in the field of Cultural Studies, a close reading of one example of fictocritical writing will hopefully offer some sense of how that range of theoretical concerns can be configured into one text. The article in question,  'Slight Anthropologies\u2019 by Gabrielle Lorraine Fletcher, integrates a number of genres that span from the beginning of life until a critical moment of identity crisis.  Although the expectations associated with some genres are subverted by the text in question, there are important meanings being created in the contrasts between certain  sections by that article.

museums for granted. After all, most Australians are descended from immigrants, Australia\u2019s cultural diversity is celebrated as a national strength, and museums must represent and explain that diversity in order to tell stories of the nation\u2019s past. However, it is only in the last thirty years that experiences of migration have become the subject of collections, exhibitions, and even entire museums in Australia. In light of recent research and scholarly work this article surveys how migration history is portrayed in Australian museums. It reveals that creators of migration exhibitions have constantly negotiated a tension between an inclusive and affirming \u2018nation of immigrants\u2019 story and the more difficult histories of conflict, difference and exclusion that characterise Australia\u2019s history of migration. Curatorial approaches to this tension have been shaped by changing political climates, public attitudes to migrants and multiculturalism, and community demands for representation in cultural institutions. International museological events, such as the opening of Ellis Island Immigration Museum in New York in 1990, have also been influential. When located within these institutional, social and political contexts, exhibitions of migration history in Australia can be understood within three broad and overlapping phases. The earliest exhibitions, beginning in the mid-1980s, aimed to integrate minority migrant experiences into a pluralistic national story in order to overturn previous mono-cultural narratives of national becoming. A second phase of exhibitions, from the mid-1990s, overtly democratised this \u2018new\u2019 migration narrative in an attempt to appeal to Anglo-Celtic Australians who did not identify with multiculturalism. While elements of both approaches remain, in last decade Australian museums have begun to look beyond migrations to the nation and towards an exploration of transnational networks, personal belonging and dislocation, and the idea of home.

Issues and events such as the Irish struggle for independence, the quest for a distinctly Australian national identity, conscription, working class radicalism, the Labor Party split, state aid for Catholic schools, the deportation of Father Charles Jerger and the Sister Liguori affair made the period one of the most turbulent in Australian history. The book examines the period from the Irish Catholic perspective by tracing the history of the Catholic Federation of New South Wales, a mass organisation that was part of a worldwide movement for Catholic defence, which at its peak claimed a membership of 100,000 out of the 400,000 Catholics living in the State. To present-day Australians, for whom social harmony is the accepted norm, this book will be a revelation of a very different Australia, one characterised by deep divisions and social conflict that at times threatened the social fabric of the nation.

However, poets who found themselves living in times of war often spoke of God in a more earnest and even urgent way. They saw God as a means of protection and succour. As someone to be with in good times and to turn to in the worst moments. This is of course most normal, however, the Australian Great War poets, who also saw God in these ways, saw God in their fellow man and the world around them. They saw the destruction caused by war as a desecration of God and a sacrilege against Him. Australian poets, men and women, servicemen, nurses and civilians, saw God as the first and last refuge of sane men. Not in any pantheistic way, God was seen in the soldier\u2019s fellow man and the landscape of Australia. In the case of man, who was made in God\u2019s image, Australian poets saw God\u2019s image in the reflection of innocence and good deeds, while in the case of the Australian landscape, poets saw God\u2019s hand of creation.

"summary": "This paper explores campaigns for white racial improvement emerging out of the Australian women's movement in the inter-war years. It argues that, compared to the relatively limited attention paid to the 'Aboriginal problem', concerns about white degeneracy abounded. The paper focuses on the female-dominated Racial Hygiene Association of New South Wales, Australia's largest and longest-lasting eugenic organisation, and its campaigns around venereal disease and the segregation and sterilization of 'mental deficients'. Eugenics has usually been associated with moves to limit white women to their domestic and reproductive roles, to their status as 'mothers of the race'. However, this paper demonstrates how such racial discourses were also appropriated by elite women to support their own reforming agendas and to argue for a larger public role for themselves in working to halt the perceived threat of white racial degeneracy. These activities are significant beyond understanding the impact of racial thinking on the women's movement alone. They point to the ways in which discourses of whiteness, like eugenics, formed a major field of racial discussion more broadly. Since the 1970s historians have looked largely, if not exclusively, towards white western constructions of 'others' to understand ideas about 'race'. What I wish to suggest here is that such an approach is not always sufficient.

The debate has been extremely fruitful in situating emerging scholarship that seeks to extend postcoloniality, its theoretical framing, and the internal processes of social categorization for peoples caught within the nation-state's territorial sphere. Unfortunately, disability and indigeneity remain largely absent from these fresh debates; or when included, are explored as singular fields of analytical inquiry with little intersectional dialogue. With this paper, I aim to extend these nascent debates by critically engaging with both disability and indigeneity as two interlocking sites of (post)colonial nation-state power. To explicate this argument, my analysis focuses on a key historical moment in the Australian experience \u2013 the formation of the colonial white-settler society of Australia in its early years (1901\u20131920s), comparing and contrasting the systems of administrative management of disability and indigeneity. In doing so, the paper reveals the deep materialities of white, able-bodied, masculine, (post)colonial settler rule that bring together disability and indigeneity via gender reproductive controls. The conclusion reflects on the transformative effects of managing transgressive bodies and minds under the white able-bodied settler state and the potential this opens to negotiate practices of solidarity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48661991, "asset_id": 11644737, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1144901, "first_name": "Karen",

construction of the Islamic / Arab / Middle Eastern \u2018other\u2019 in the news media is not in itself a new phenomena and arguably dates back to the very earliest days of the modern media industry. Tracing such negative portrayals to the origins of the printing press in Europe, this paper therefore seeks to investigate the relationship between Edward Said\u2019s notion of Orientalism and the printing press. Moving forward, this paper also examines the impact this lineage had on the Australian press of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Beginning with its deplorable coverage of Australia\u2019s Indigenous people and the paranoia surrounding the \u2018Asian Invasion\u2019 this paper sheds new light on the coverage of Islam and the Middle East in the early Australian press and the emergence of the \u2018Muslim Menace\u2019. Finally, this chapter concludes by noting that such a racialist history raises a host of questions and challenges for the contemporary Australian news media.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Born in Ballarat East, his early years were difficult. After he was abandoned by his parents at the age of 12, he began working as a farm labourer. By the time he enlisted in the army in 1940, the 23-year-old was a tall and powerfully built man who earned the nickname \"Bull\" for charging through the opposition on the football field.

As well as being Australia's longest-serving prime minister, Menzies was the most thoughtful. Menzies' world picture was one where Britishness was the overriding normative principle, and in which cultural puritanism and philosophical idealism were pervasive. Unless we remember this cultural background of Menzies' thought then we will seriously misunderstand what he meant by the very project of liberalism. The Forgotten Menzies argues that Menzies' greatest aspiration was to protect the ideals of cultural puritanism Australia from two kinds of materialism: communism; and the mindset encouraged by affluence and technological progress. Central to Menzies' project of cultural and civilisational preservation was the university, an institution he spent much of his career extolling and expanding. The Forgotten Menzies makes an important contribution to the history of political thought and ideology in Australia, as to understanding the largely forgotten but rich intellectual origins of the

emerging story of the Southern Cross. Faced with the reality of war, the churches hoped that the atonement story of innocent sacrifice and divine reconciliation could become Australia's story too. They encouraged enlistment with the thought that this new nation might redeem a sinful past through war for God, King and Empire. They dreamt that a nation built under a heavenly cross might fulfil the Christian destiny promised in its skies. These themes and more are explored in the poetry of two Congregationalist women who published prolifically in the church and the mainline press throughout the Great War and in the years that followed. Their poems were patriotic and pastoral, addressing both the landscape of home and the suffering of the women who remained. They wrote of sons and soldiers sacrificed, memorializing them as innocents through a mother's memory of boyhood. They brought images of suffering soldiers into proximity with Christ's cross, allowing poetic allusion to make their sons sacred in death. Finally, they sought and found reconciliation between the bereaved and their sacralized soldiers not in heaven but under the stars of the Southern Cross. In the dark years of the Great War, those left at home in Australia needed a means to speak of bleak tragedy elsewhere. They found it in poetry. In rhyming couplets men and women attempted to reconcile the experience of home with a distant conflict. Their verses hinted at the conflict felt within families and within the hearts of the grieving. An outpouring of poetry appeared in city newspapers, church journals and locally published booklets. 1", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54725446, "asset_id": 34866433, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26097042, "first_name": "Kerrie", "last_name": "Handasyde", "domain_name": "divinity", "page_name": "KerrieHandasyde", "display_name": "Kerrie  Handasyde", "profile_url": "https://divinity.academia.edu/KerrieHandasyde?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26097042/12174785/96913723/s65_kerrie.handasyde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2122, "name": "Death", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 6118, "name": "Women and War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_War_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 8572, "name": "Congregational Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Congregational_Studies?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14482, "name": "World War I", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_War_I?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 14893, "name": "Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 15263, "name": "First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_World_War?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 52853, "name": "Immortality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immortality?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 93556, "name": "Twentieth-Century Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Twentieth-Century_Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 114861, "name": "Anzac", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anzac?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 125540, "name": "Cultural History of the First World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History_of_the_First_World_War?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 33746933, "title": "Launch speech for The Art of Time Travel: Historians and Their Craft by Tom Griffiths", "created_at": "2017-07-03T00:53:13.245-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33746933/Launch_speech_for_The_Art_of_Time_Travel_Historians_and_Their_Craft_by_Tom_Griffiths?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_33746933", "summary": "Launch speech for The Art of Time Travel: Historians and Their Craft by Tom Griffiths, 26 February 2016, University House, The Australian National University, Canberra", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53739191, "asset_id": 33746933, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 170922, "first_name": "Frank", "last_name": "Bongiorno", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "FrankBongiorno", "display_name": "Frank Bongiorno", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/FrankBongiorno?f_ri=18659", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/170922/42934/39480/s65_frank.bongiorno.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1554579, "name": "Australian historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_historiography?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31758057, "title": "Between the personal and the political: Dennis Altman, Homosexual and the meaning of liberation", "created_at": "2017-03-07T14:14:29.430-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31758057/Between_the_personal_and_the_political_Dennis_Altman_Homosexual_and_the_meaning_of_liberation?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_31758057", "summary": "The 1970s were in many ways transformative for Australian society. \u2018Fixed, fast-frozen relations\u2019 were challenged in ways never previously thought possible.

This paper adds to our understanding of a tumultuous decade by exploring a micro-history of the publication of Dennis Altman\u2019s Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation (1971/2). I look closely at the work itself and Altman\u2019s personal archive to explore the different reactions the author\u2019s brief minor celebrity engendered in the form of letters, reviews and polemic. In so doing, the complexities of making the personal political are explored, with particular emphasis given to Altman\u2019s theory of \u2018liberation\u2019. Melding Marxism with Black Power and Psychoanalysis, liberation for Altman \u2013 much like similar employments by the second wave feminist movement \u2013 meant more than just \u201cthe absence of oppression\u201d in personal relations, but a social, and necessarily political, revolution. Yet, Altman\u2019s marrying of political theory and everyday life was deeply controversial, revealing significant contestation and debates around politicising the personal in Australian radical movements and broader society.

William Chidley was a lifestyle reformer who thought he had found the key to human happiness on earth: it could be attained by a revolution in the mode of sexual intercourse. The British Medical Association, promising its own millennium in the form of perfect health, represented the mainstream of orthodox and increasingly scientific medical practice. A central plank of this was the proposition that masturbation was a major cause of organic and mental disease in both men and women, and the single most important cause of spermatorrhoea, impotence and inexplicable wasting illnesses \u2013 often referred to as debility \u2013 in men. What these three nineteenth century cults had in common is that they placed male sexuality, and more specifically the male genitals, at the centre of their world view and action program. Indeed, it was not just the male genitals, but the penis that was their focus, and in the case of the Wroeites and the BMA, a specific part of the penis known to anatomy as the prepuce, more commonly referred to as the foreskin, or forey, as lucky Queenslanders say. I therefore warn you now that the content of my paper is adult in nature. If you do not wish to hear explicit talk about the male genitals and sexual acts, please don't attend. I cannot claim that this is a particularly coherent or polished paper. It consists of a few bits and pieces hewn from the work I have been doing over the past four or five years on male sexuality, and more particularly on changing attitudes to male sexuality and the male genitals in Britain \u2013 and the anglophone world more generally \u2013 from the seventeenth to the twentieth century. This began as a more limited project to write an account of the rise and fall of routine male circumcision in Australia, from the late nineteenth century to the 1990s, by which time it seemed as though it was going the way of such valued therapies as bleeding, phrenology and frontal lobotomy. To understand the emergence of circumcision in Australia, however, it was necessary to go back to the British home base, and once I got there I found that the key to the whole question lay in the masturbation phobia \u2013 a phenomenon which reached its peak in the late nineteenth century, but which had its origins in the late seventeenth, and even before then in Jewish and Christian religious teaching. After that, among other finds, I discovered the importance of syphilis and the purity movement. In this way my intended introduction on the British background grew into a book in its own right which, I hope, is to be published by an American university press some time next year. What these cults further had in common was a tendency to pathologise male sexuality as a major source of physical, mental and moral decay, and in this they were part and parcel of the Victorian construction of sexuality as a nest of problems, very different from the generally positive attitudes which had", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45492809, "asset_id": 25176337, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11926074, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Darby", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RobertDarby", "display_name": "Robert Darby", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RobertDarby?f_ri=18659", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=18659", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13274, "name": "Masculinities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinities?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=18659"}, {"id": 60428, "name": "Medical History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_History?f_ri=18659"}]}, {"id": 21704957, "title": "History and the horse: exploring narratives of equine significance", "created_at": "2016-02-08T15:58:49.204-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21704957/History_and_the_horse_exploring_narratives_of_equine_significance?f_ri=18659", "dom_id": "work_21704957", "summary": "The horse retains a strong position in the national imagination.

To explore this idea, I examine whether the horse can be constructed as an historical actor in its own right. Drawing on animal studies scholarship and the notion of animal agency, I reexamine constructions of the horse as historically significant, and find that there is little evidence to support a view of the horse as a significant historical actor in Australian history. I argue that such attempts to locate the horse's historical agency are thwarted by the disciplinary limitations of history. Entrenched anthropocentricity within the field presents a barrier to undertaking more considered animal history.
