How to make sense of the shadow-play as a form of world-making? In Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind, Bernard Arps explores this question by considering an all-night performance of Dewa Ruci, a key play in the repertoire. Thrilling and profound, Dewa Ruci describes the mighty Bratasena\u2019s quest for the ultimate mystical insight.\n     The book presents  Dewa Ruci as rendered by the distinguished master puppeteer Ki Anom Soeroto in Amsterdam in 1987. The book\u2019s unusual design presents the performance texts together with descriptions of the sounds and images that would remain obscure in conventional formats of presentation. Copious annotations probe beneath the surface and provide an understanding of the performance's cultural complexity. These annotations explain the meanings of puppet action, music, and shifts in language; how the puppeteer wove together into the drama the circumstances of the performance in Amsterdam, Islamic and other religious ideas, and references to contemporary Indonesian political ideology. Also revealed is the performance\u2019s historical multilayering and the picture it paints of the Javanese past.\n     Tall Tree, Nest of the Wind not only presents an unrivalled insight into the artistic depth of wayang kulit, it exemplifies a new field of study, the philology of performance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45693702, "asset_id": 22488991, "asset_type": "Work",

Martha Quest and The Summer Before the Dark present before their readers two similar tales where Martha and Kate, one a young girl and the other a mother and wife of long years set out on their paths to discover who they are. A journey undertaken by the protagonist in search of her identity is a repeated motif in Lessing's canon. This journey, which can be physical, psychological and (at times) spiritual, opens up new vistas of life and provides an opportunity to her protagonists to learn more about themselves. This paper compares the journeys of two of Lessing's protagonists \u2013 Martha, the young teenage girl who leaves her home in the African farm to carve a new life for herself and Kate, a mother of four children who starts a new phase of her life when she sets on a journey that takes her to places across the world. Martha is the protagonist of an entire series of novels, The Children of Violence. The series which comprises of five novels, namely Martha Quest, A Proper Marriage, A Ripple from the Storm, Landlocked and The Four Gated City was written by Lessing in a time period spanning from 1952 to 1969. The series traces the social, spiritual and psychological growth of Martha from her early years in the colony till the time of her death. As such, the series can be read as a Bildungsroman. This genre includes the Entwiklungsroman or the novel of general growth, the Erziehungsroman or the novel of educational development and the Kuntelsrroman or the novel of artistic realisation (Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m 4). The present paper deals with the first novel of the series Martha Quest and reads it as Martha's beginning of a long journey in the quest of her identity and as a bildungsroman, comparing it with The Summer Before the Dark (published in 1973) which follows the spiritual, psychological and physical wanderings of Kate Brown, who leaves her home somewhat grudgingly, only to realize as the novel progresses that this journey", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48371255, "asset_id": 28058887, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2922726, "first_name": "Sneha", "last_name": "Pathak", "domain_name": "banasthali", "page_name": "SnehaPathak", "display_name": "Sneha Pathak", "profile_url": "https://banasthali.academia.edu/SnehaPathak?f_ri=576036", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2394, "name": "Women's writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_writing?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=576036"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=576036"}, {"id": 27020, "name": "Doris Lessing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Doris_Lessing?f_ri=576036"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=576036"}, {"id": 243219, "name": "20c British Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20c_British_Novel?f_ri=576036"}, {"id": 576036, "name": "Quest Narratives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quest_Narratives?f_ri=576036"}]}, {"id": 35290664, "title": "Drona's betrayal and Bima's brutality: Javanaiserie in Malay culture [2018]", "created_at": "2017-11-29T09:54:55.055-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35290664/Dronas_betrayal_and_Bimas_brutality_Javanaiserie_in_Malay_culture_2018_?f_ri=576036", "dom_id": "work_35290664", "summary": "The presence of elements explicitly identified as \"Javanese\" or \"from Java\" in traditional Malay literature and performance \u2014 settings, characters, objects, idioms, stories, texts, even entire genres like the renditions of Mahabharata story-matter \u2014 has mostly been ascribed to the putative prestige of the historical civilization of Java. Here I explore another point of view. Focusing on religiosity and ethics in a hikayat with Mahabharata stories, I propose the notion of javanaiserie, the creation of texts, performances, and other cultural artefacts designed to be considered Javanese. Javanaiserie has proven alluring in Malay contexts.

This inverted re-telling of the Iliad and the Odyssey raises more questions than it answers.\r\n\r\nAeneas is a persistently unwilling hero. He would rather have fought and died in Troy than have fled the city and begun his quest as the saviour of his people. He would happily have stayed in Carthage with his beloved Dido, forsaking destined greatness. He would have avoided war with the Latins, indeed never would have come to Italy, if fate had not forced him. Aeneas is a hero in spite of himself who fulfills his heroic destiny in spite of himself.\r\n\r\nA second problematic point is that Aeneas does not make decisions, but is commanded, guided and assisted by the gods. He leaves Carthage only after receiving a direct command from an exasperated Jove, he plots his course with the aid of soothsayers and seers, and relies on the supernatural aid of his mother Venus to counteract the supernatural malignancy of Juno. He and his people seem little more than storm-wrack drifting across the Mediterranean, powerless to meaningfully affect their course or ultimate fate. This is a heroic quest shaped by a lack of individual agency. It is not men, but the gods who decide.\r\n\r\nThis perhaps helps to excuse the horrific fulfillment of Aeneas\u2019s quest. Arriving in Italy, all of his good intentions are frustrated. A pact between Trojan and Latin, destined brothers, is broken, and war breaks out. This is a war of terror and treachery and ambushes, of blood pointlessly and irremediably spilled over issues that are ultimately beyond human control. It is a war narrated in the heroic style of the Illiad but fought by mere humans, weak and vacillating. Aeneas claims to fight not for kingship or dominion, but for equality between the people\u2019s of Italy and the Trojans, yet he ends the war by mercilessly slaying his enemy Turnus.\r\n\r\nThis is the ultimate ambivalence of Aeneas\u2019s quest: it is the one thing he does without divine guidance. Is this murder a failure, the Aeneid asks, brutal revenge replacing idealism, or is it an ultimate acceptance of personal responsibility, a recognition that in order to complete his quest he must commit necessary crimes?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35878265, "asset_id": 9685260, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1753765, "first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Sandberg", "domain_name": "cityu-hk", "page_name": "EricSandberg", "display_name": "Eric  Sandberg", "profile_url": "https://cityu-hk.academia.edu/EricSandberg?f_ri=576036", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1753765/774773/3538493/s65_eric.sandberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 14754, "name": "Aeneid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aeneid?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88366, "name": "Virgil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virgil?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 576036, "name": "Quest Narratives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quest_Narratives?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 610232, "name": "Virgil's Aeneid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virgils_Aeneid?f_ri=576036", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41714642, "title": "\"What a Loser That Guy Was\": Norm Macdonald's Humorous Critique of the Romantic/ Warrior Narrative", "created_at": "2020-01-23T09:32:38.983-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41714642/_What_a_Loser_That_Guy_Was_Norm_Macdonalds_Humorous_Critique_of_the_Romantic_Warrior_Narrative?f_ri=576036", "dom_id": "work_41714642", "summary": "Illness narratives are stories that focus on, or are inspired by, the sometimes life-altering experience of illness. Most narrative constructions of these illness experiences are built upon one of three broad narrative \"skeletons.\" One skeletal subform, the romantic/warrior narrative, is critiqued by comedian Norm Macdonald in a humorous anecdote that mocks the expectation that cancer patients must wage an epic and heroic battle against their pernicious cancer to have a chance to survive. Macdonald explicates that such a mentality produces heroes and villains, winners and losers, and places additional burden on cancer patients. In this analysis, I argue that Macdonald's effective use of humor and fulfillment of the five functions of health-related narration enable his story to gain narrative rationality and serve as effective rhetorical tools in encouraging the audience to accept the narrator's critique of the romantic/war-rior subform.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61874169, "asset_id": 41714642,
