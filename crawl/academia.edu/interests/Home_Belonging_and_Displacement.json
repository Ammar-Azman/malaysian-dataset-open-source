Circa 90% of these refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) remain in the global South, and most of them, in turn, reside in urban spaces.[1] However, while it clear that we are facing a period of protracted displacement in (peri- )urban settings, it is less frequently acknowledged that this is also a period of overlapping displacements. This is the case in at least two senses. Firstly, refugees and IDPs have often both personally and collectively experienced secondary and tertiary displacement, as in the case of Palestinian and Iraqi refugees who had originally sought safety in Damascus only to be displaced once more by the on-going Syrian conflict, and of Sahrawi and Palestinian refugees who had left their refugee camp homes in Algeria and Lebanon respectively to study or work in Libya before being displaced by the outbreak of conflict in that country in 2011 (Fiddian-Qasmiyeh 2012). Secondly, refugees are increasingly experiencing overlapping displacement in the sense that they often physically share spaces with other displaced people in diverse spaces of asylum: Turkey hosts refugees from over 35 countries of origin, Lebanon from 17, Kenya 16, Jordan 14, Chad 12, and both Ethiopia and Pakistan 11 (Crawford et al: 2015). However, in spite of the widespread reality of these overlapping groups, and given the interest in \u2018superdiversity\u2019 and \u2018cosmopolitanism\u2019 in urban spaces across migration studies writ large (Vertovec, 2007; Derrida 2007), it is particularly notable that refugees\u2019 positions, identities, beliefs and behaviours in relation to other groups of refugees remain almost entirely unexplored to date.\n\nIndeed, a large proportion of studies of urban refugees focus on one particular refugee group in one city (i.e. Lyytinen 2015; Bartolomei 2015), while multisited, comparative studies often focus on one group dispersed across a number of cities or divided across a city and a camp setting (i.e. Fiddian-Qasmiyeh 2012, 2013; and Malkki 1995 respectively), or compare the conditions and dynamics of one group of refugees in one city with another group in another city (i.e. Sanyal 2014). In contrast, only a small number of studies explicitly examine the experiences of different refugees in the same city (i.e. Brown et al 2004; Fiddian-Qasmiyeh and Qasmiyeh 2010). Of particular relevance to the argument I make below vis-\u00e0-vis the \u2018relationality\u2019 of refugees in shared spaces of refuge, Buscher (2011: 21- 22) analyses the relative strength of social ties and networks within Somali, Congolese and Burundian refugee communities in the city of Kampala. While Buscher\u2019s article thus recognizes the overlapping presence of refugees from different countries of origin in Kampala, it seemingly highlights both the relative isolation of Somalis and Congolese refugees from other refugee communities, and the extent to which fractures and mistrust characterize relations within the Burundi refugee community. This may helpfully demonstrate that segregation, rather than social integration via cohabitation, can maximize livelihood strategies for certain refugees (in this case, Burundian refugees), and yet this focus on nationality-based social networks continues to render invisible the relationality of refugees in spaces inhabited by multiple, and often overlapping, groups of refugees in urban contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51422900, "asset_id": 30244835, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22265047, "first_name": "Elena",

What is more, the topic in itself raises the much-debated question of theodicy. Faced with the traumatic death of a family member, the main protagonists \u2013 who were brought up Christians \u2013 are forced to revise their conceptions of God on their return home after the tragedy. Where is the ordered and safe God of their childhood in the face of suffering and the difficulties of life? Using the work of the literary scholars Laurie Vickroy and Cathy Caruth, the analysis demonstrates how trauma shatters the main characters\u2019 inherited and largely unquestioned Christian beliefs. The question quickly appears to be not only who God is, but also where He is. Due to their religious upbringing, the protagonists mainly associate God to what they consider their home place. Relying upon Gaston Bachelard\u2019s The Poetics of Space, I will therefore consider the role home plays in the construal of the Godhead. It is mainly in the intimacy and safety of the home that the characters are able to confront their suffering and difficult past, and to reassess their former beliefs in God. The conspicuous contrast between their understanding of God at home and what they have experienced abroad iis also  explored as it enlightens their renewed vision of the Christian divinity. In this paper, I thus examine and compare the way the diegesis as well as the interconnection between beliefs and geographical places are used by the two novelists to convey a sense of God, thereby showing how similar devices may bring different images of the Godhead.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31074731, "asset_id": 3189596, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Talk about place, and one's self in it, is particularly complex when the environment poses risk or is otherwise problematized. This study, a secondary analysis of interview data, seeks to extend discursive work on place-identity by examining the ways in which 14 residents of a small English village talk about themselves and their locale. The locale accommodates an active quarry, and many residents had lodged complaints to the quarry about dust, noise and vibrations from blasting. Attention to the interactional context of the interviews illustrates the ways in which (simply) interviewing people about their locale can threaten self- and place-identity. When asked about life in the village, interviewees oriented to two main dilemmas in protecting self- and place-identity: (1) how to justify continued residence in a challenging environment and (2) how to complain about the locale whilst maintaining positive place-identity. Discursive responses to these dilemmas drew upon typical identity processes, such as self- and place distinctiveness and the formulation of out-groups, as well as upon constructions of localized power-sharing and morally obligated tolerance of risk. We suggest that research on problematical places, and of environmental risk, needs to be sensitized to how it may constitute a threat to self- and place-identity, and how this may mediate formulations self and place, as well as of environmental risk.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31245396, "asset_id": 2325937, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Amsterdam over a 10-year period (1999\u20132008). First, to analyse these data, this paper discusses the impact of institutional and housing market contexts on the residential-mobility patterns of households and subsequently discusses the outcomes of gentrification processes. The general Continental-European context and the specific context of Amsterdam are highlighted in particular. We argue that in highly regulated markets, marginal gentrification can form an important process of neighbourhood upgrading. This contrasts the gentrification stage model. Second, using a unique, individual-level longitudinal dataset, we show that gentrifying neighbourhoods in Amsterdam arguably form cases of marginal gentrification. Recent in-migrants possess incomes that are structurally lower than the incomes of sitting residents. However, in-migrants experience significant incumbent upgrading after moving in, more so than the sitting population. The Amsterdam housing market, dominated by social-rental housing, is key to explaining these mobility patterns.

Nevertheless, the establishment of camps to house people fleeing political violence is often framed as an emergency measure of limited duration. These are depicted as \u201ctemporary\u201d spaces in which people are provided with aid and support until such time that they are able to return to their \u201cpermanent\u201d homes. In this article, we focus on the actions and aspirations of camp residents to imbue their dwellings with a sense of home. Our empirical material has been generated by fieldwork in two camps in Jordan housing people displaced from Syria. \u201cHomemaking\u201d in this location calls into questions the rigid opposition between \u201ctemporary\u201d and \u201cpermanent\u201d: an opposition that, for diverse reasons, host states, donors, humanitarians, and camp residents may strive to maintain, at least in rhetorical terms. Attending to the creation of dedicated space for receiving guests, we consider the content of homemaking as shaped by residents\u2019 ideals of home in combination with the constraints imposed by institutions responsible for funding, hosting, and managing the camps. While this analysis highlights the fragility and contingency of homemaking, it also reveals the agency of displaced people in acting to improve their surroundings and conduct normative social relations.

The article draws on the narratives of 46 Palestinians to examine perceptions of statelessness as a marker of rightlessess, home(land)lessness and voicelessness. It then explores statelessness through the paradigm of the \u2018threshold\u2019, reflecting both on interviewees\u2019 ambiguity towards this label, status and condition, and the extent to which even Palestinians who hold citizenship remain \u2018on the threshold of statelessness\u2019.

Yet behind the nation\u2019s official image of multicultural \u2018unity in diversity\u2019 lurk deep socio-economic inequalities and inter-ethnic tensions that are insistently critiqued in its literature. This book analyses how the idea of belonging \u2013 a sense of attachment to, and identification with, a place or people \u2013 is articulated in a range of contemporary francophone Mauritian novels. The island-nation\u2019s complex, contested history and the multi-ethnic composition of its modern-day population mean that belonging is a central but fraught issue in both reality and fiction. Adopting an eclectic, multi-dimensional theoretical framework, Waters explores how affirmative forms of affective belonging intersect with, and are frequently inhibited by, the exclusionary \u2018politics of belonging\u2019 at communal, national and international levels. Waters offers in-depth and comparative analyses of novels by Nathacha Appanah, Ananda Devi, Shenaz Patel, Bertrand de Robillard, Amal Sewtohul and Carl de Souza. Despite their striking thematic and formal diversity, these novels are shown to be characterised by a common rejection of dominant discourses of ethnic, diasporic affiliation and by a strong, common commitment to the ongoing, future-orientated project of Mauritian nationhood. As such, this book offers an original insight into the dynamics of belonging and exclusion in diverse, multi-ethnic societies.

Specific attention is given to the seminal space of the school, with the aim of undermining the monolithic application of the \u2018cultural conflict thesis\u2019 and its attendant separation of Anglo-Australian and ethnic cultural expectations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32425465, "asset_id": 3611296, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 518675, "first_name": "Alexandra", "last_name": "Dellios", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "AlexandraDellios", "display_name": "Alexandra  Dellios", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/AlexandraDellios?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/518675/182029/16626545/s65_alexandra.dellios.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8099420, "title": "Who is (South) African?: Thabo Mbeki\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m an African\u2019 speech & the banned Nando\u2019s TV advert", "created_at": "2014-08-26T23:33:24.355-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8099420/Who_is_South_African_Thabo_Mbeki_s_I_m_an_African_speech_and_the_banned_Nando_s_TV_advert?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_8099420", "summary": "Who qualifies as an African?

By following the story of one ogbanje, this paper unravels their significance for social life, for local epistemologies and cosmologies in Freetown. The paper discusses personhood and morality, conceptions of femininity and motherhood as well as the search for culprits. It argues that ogbanjes have to be understood as avengers who, in the name of society, penalize those deeds of women which meet with the disapproval of the community. Ogbanjes embody a breakdown of accepted social concepts as they are able to openly articulate criticism towards their parents and elders and thus serve as a way to negotiate the coming of age. The negotiations over appropriate treatment of ogbanjes highlight the interplay between different forms of belief. In addition, ogbanjes provide coping mechanisms and explanatory tools for untimely deaths.

Turner, Jr. In Finding a Way Home, thirteen essays by scholars from four countries trace Walter Mosley's distinctive approach to representing African American responses to the feeling of homelessness in an inhospitable America. Mosley (b. 1952) writes frequently of characters trying to construct an idea of home and wrest a sense of dignity, belonging, and hope from cultural and communal resources. These essays examine Mosley's queries about the meaning of \"home\" in various social and historical contexts. Essayists consider the concept--whether it be material, social, cultural, or virtual--in all three of Mosley's detective/crime fiction series ( Easy Rawlins, Socrates Fortlow, and Fearless Jones), his three books of speculative fiction, two of his \"literary\" novels ( RL's Dream, The Man in My Basement), and in his recent social and political nonfiction. Essays here explore Mosley's modes of expression, his testing of the limitations of genre, his political engagement in prose, his utopian/dystopian analyses, and his uses of parody and vernacular culture. Finding a Way Homeprovides rich discussions, explaining the development of Mosley's work.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46176693, "asset_id": 1193162, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1087186, "first_name": "Derek C.", "last_name": "Maus", "domain_name": "potsdam", "page_name": "DerekCMaus", "display_name": "Derek C.

The article serves three purposes: to present an overview of the area of inquiry; to develop an analytical framework for under- standing home and homemaking for forced migrants in protracted displacement; and to introduce the special issue . It explores how protracted displacement has been defined\u2014from policy definitions to people\u2019s experiences of protractedness, including \u201cwaiting\u201d and \u201cthe permanence of temporariness .\u201d The article identifies the ambivalence embedded in experiences and practices of homemaking in long-term displacement, demonstrating how static notions of home and displacement might be unsettled . It achieves this through examining relationships between mobility and stasis, the material and symbolic, between the past, present, and future, and multiple places and scales . The article proposes a conceptual framework\u2014a triadic con- stellation of home\u2014that enables an analysis of home in different contexts of protracted displacement . The frame- work helps to explore home both as an idea and a practice, distinguishing among three elements: \u201chome\u201d as the day- to-day practices of homemaking, \u201cHome\u201d as representing values, traditions, memories, and feelings of home, and the broader political and historical contexts in which \u201cHOME\u201d is understood in the current global order and embedded in institutions . In conclusion, the article argues that a feminist and dynamic understanding of home-Home-HOME provides a more holistic perspective of making home in protracted displacement that promotes a more extensive and more sophisticated academic work, policies, and practices .", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37215046, "asset_id": 11801322, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3783481, "first_name": "Cathrine", "last_name": "Brun", "domain_name": "oxfordbrookes", "page_name": "CathrineBrun", "display_name": "Cathrine  Brun", "profile_url": "https://oxfordbrookes.academia.edu/CathrineBrun?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3783481/9945897/11090405/s65_cathrine.brun.jpg"}, {"id": 1271029, "first_name": "Anita", "last_name": "Fabos", "domain_name": "clarku", "page_name": "AnitaFabos", "display_name": "Anita Fabos", "profile_url": "https://clarku.academia.edu/AnitaFabos?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1271029/868642/19291466/s65_anita.fabos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1192, "name": "Feminist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Theory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2835, "name": "Refugee Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14580, "name": "Forced Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14581, "name": "Protracted Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protracted_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1028140, "name": "Homemaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homemaking?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 8667632, "title": " Tradition and Modernity in Kamila Shamsie's Salt and Saffron", "created_at": "2014-10-06T21:34:52.722-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8667632/Tradition_and_Modernity_in_Kamila_Shamsies_Salt_and_Saffron?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_8667632", "summary": "This article analyses the changing trends of globalization and modernity that transform the social and individual\r\nperceptions.

The novel is a playful account of past memories revisited and preserved by family lore. It is also an appropriation of those traditional views in the modern scene by the members of new generation. Therefore, the novel becomes a microcosm of traditional versus modern values conceived by the family members of Dard-e-dil family. The novel is an effective display of past Muslim cultural and political glory yet it revisits the current issues of identity,\r\ndisplacement and immigration. The article situates the story of Dard-e-dils within the theoretical context of globalization\r\nand postcolonialism, and reads the flux and change that the Pakistani fiction reflects as it enters a new realm of changed\r\nnational, social and individual perception in the post\u2013partition and postcolonial era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35023933, "asset_id": 8667632, "asset_type":

In   its very beginning, the armed insurgency jolted the venerable bond of peace and harmony between Kashmiri Muslims and Kashmiri Pandits. The growing fear and insecurity forced Kashmiri Pandits to leave their homes for safety and survival. Their long cherished dream to return to their homeland could not materialize all these years. Over the years, this displaced community has produced a burgeoning generation of writers. These writers have successfully fictionalized and still continue to fictionalize the agonizing memories of past, of rootlessness, of identity crisis of their community, scattered around the country and outside the country. In this paper, I will work out how one such writer, Siddhartha Gigoo, fictionalizes the same agonized memories of his displaced community, in his debut novel \u2018The Garden of Solitude\u2019? In the paper, I will study the plight and agony of Kashmiri Pandit migrants on two levels; physical and psychological. Besides, the paper will also explore how Gigoo transcends beyond the confines of dominant Political narratives (these narratives were politically motivated and formulated with national interests in mind. The motive of these contending narratives was to disrupt the Pandit-Muslim harmony) and centers his narrative on the lived experience of a common man? Gigoo purposely excludes the convoluted political controversies and instead highlights the harm done by the same to a religious minority.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38681560, "asset_id": 15443418, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33077292, "first_name": "Ghulam Mohammad", "last_name": "Khan", "domain_name": "cuharyana", "page_name": "GhulamMohammadKhan", "display_name": "Ghulam Mohammad Khan", "profile_url": "https://cuharyana.academia.edu/GhulamMohammadKhan?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33077292/9820251/12386088/s65_ghulam_mohammad.khan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2252782, "title": "Southern Hospitality and the Politics of African American Belonging: An Analysis of Photographs in North Carolina Tourism Brochures", "created_at": "2012-12-07T00:32:42.081-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2252782/Southern_Hospitality_and_the_Politics_of_African_American_Belonging_An_Analysis_of_Photographs_in_North_Carolina_Tourism_Brochures?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_2252782", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30617112, "asset_id": 2252782, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 861074, "first_name": "Derek", "last_name": "Alderman", "domain_name": "utk", "page_name": "DerekAlderman", "display_name": "Derek H Alderman", "profile_url": "https://utk.academia.edu/DerekAlderman?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/861074/307960/29352985/s65_derek.alderman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 296, "name": "Black Studies Or African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Studies_Or_African_American_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 942, "name": "Tourism Marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Marketing?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 3394, "name": "Southern Studies (U.S. South)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Studies_U.S._South_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 5792, "name": "Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Justice?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 6426, "name": "Content Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content_Analysis?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14912, "name": "African American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_American_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 22656, "name": "Hospitality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 34853594, "title": "ANYWHERE BUT NOW LANDSCAPES OF BELONGING IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN", "created_at": "2017-10-13T14:45:21.467-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34853594/ANYWHERE_BUT_NOW_LANDSCAPES_OF_BELONGING_IN_THE_EASTERN_MEDITERRANEAN?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_34853594", "summary": "How can we articulate the intangible sense of being and belonging, the rupture of apart-ness, and the paradoxes contained in the where and now of places east of the Mediterranean, a region in constant flux?

Therefore, migrant youth who have grown up in their parents\u2019 adopted cities and aspire for higher education have to return to their registered hometowns to prepare for the tests. This article rejects the binary origin and destination model of migration, and criticizes the naturalizing discourse that assumes an unproblematic linkage between home and return. It offers a critical rethinking of migrant youth\u2019s remigration as a process of both emplacement and displacement under structural rural\u2013urban inequalities in late-socialism. By analyzing the experiences and subjectivities of these migrant students adapting to the rural schooling system, the article demonstrates how institutional discrimination, regional disparities, and sociocultural differences cause these often taken-for-granted \u201chome\u201d journeys to be fraught with contradictions and frustrations. The experiences of migrant students reveal the politics of mobility in everyday practice, in which educational remigration perpetuates rather than breaks down structural inequalities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54427609, "asset_id": 25299863, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48670944, "first_name": "Minhua", "last_name": "Ling", "domain_name": "ias", "page_name": "MinhuaLing", "display_name": "Minhua Ling", "profile_url": "https://ias.academia.edu/MinhuaLing?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48670944/12807418/14223709/s65_minhua.ling.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 20604, "name": "Migrant Children's Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Childrens_Education?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 46644, "name": "Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inequality?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 481227, "name": "Education and Children of Migrants-First Generation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_Children_of_Migrants-First_Generation?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 42207735, "title": "Migration and Displacement", "created_at": "2020-03-13T01:26:24.280-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42207735/Migration_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_42207735", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62355317, "asset_id": 42207735, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6075072, "first_name": "Lijo", "last_name": "Devadhas", "domain_name": "oti", "page_name": "LijoDevadhas", "display_name": "Lijo Devadhas", "profile_url": "https://oti.academia.edu/LijoDevadhas?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6075072/20513482/73568180/s65_lijo.devadhas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 361488, "name": "Forced migration and displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_migration_and_displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1000347, "name": "Migration and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 2058825, "title": "Lifestyle mobilities: The crossroads of travel, leisure and migration", "created_at": "2012-10-25T20:41:39.590-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2058825/Lifestyle_mobilities_The_crossroads_of_travel_leisure_and_migration?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_2058825", "summary": "\"\"\"This article examines how the mobilities paradigm intersects with physically moving as an on-going lifestyle choice.

Through careful examinations of various transnational, hybrid, border, and diasporic forces and practices, these essays push at the edge of cultural studies, postmodernism, and postcolonial theory and raise crucial questions about ethnographic methodology. \r\n\r\nThis volume exemplifies a cross-disciplinary cultural studies and a concept of culture rooted in lived experience as well as textual readings. Anthropologists and scholars from related fields deploy a range of methodologies and styles of writing to blur and complicate conventional dualisms between authors and subjects of research, home and away, center and periphery, and first and third world. Essays discuss topics such as Rai, a North African pop music viewed as westernized in Algeria and as Arab music in France; the place of Sephardic and Palestinian writers within Israel\u2019s Ashkenazic-dominated arts community; and the use and misuse of the concept \u201cpostcolonial\u201d as it is applied in various regional contexts. \r\n\r\nIn exploring histories of displacement and geographies of identity, these essays call for the reconceptualization of theoretical binarisms such as modern and postmodern, colonial and postcolonial. It will be of interest to a broad spectrum of scholars and students concerned with postmodern and postcolonial theory, ethnography, anthropology, and cultural studies.\r\n\r\nContributors.

Having been actively encouraged to immigrate by the Ivorian state for generations, Burkinabe migrant labourers were now forced to leave their homes and livelihoods behind and return to a country they had left in their youth or, as second-generation immigrants in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, had never seen. \nBased on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Burkina Faso and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the thesis explores the narratives and everyday practices of returning labour migrants in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second-largest city, in order to understand the subjective experiences of displacement that the forced return to Burkina Faso engendered. The analysis questions the appropriateness of the very notion of \u201creturn\u201d in this context and suggests that people\u2019s senses of home are multiplex and tend to rely more on the ability to pursue active processes of emplacement in everyday life than on abstract notions of belonging, e.g. relating to citizenship or ethnicity.\nThe study analyses intergenerational interactions within and across migrant families in the city and on transformations of intra-familial relations in the context of forced displacement. A particular emphasis is placed on the experiences of young adults who were born and raised in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and arrived in Burkina Faso for the first time during the Ivorian crisis. These young men and women were received with scepticism in Burkina Faso because of their perceived \u201cIvorian\u201d upbringing, language, and behaviour and were forced to face new forms of stigmatisation and exclusion. At the same time, young migrants were able to exploit their labelling as outsiders and turn their difference into an advantage in the competition for scarce employment opportunities and social connections.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35716605, "asset_id": 9484603, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19669659, "first_name": "Jesper", "last_name": "Bjarnesen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JBjarnesen", "display_name": "Jesper Bjarnesen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JBjarnesen?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19669659/8377379/58244879/s65_jesper.bjarnesen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 4527, "name": "Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Africa?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 35225479, "title": "CLAIMING VOICE & VISIBILITY FROM THE IN-BETWEEN: CONTEMPORARY NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN WOMEN & DISPLACEMENT", "created_at": "2017-11-22T13:30:04.745-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35225479/CLAIMING_VOICE_and_VISIBILITY_FROM_THE_IN_BETWEEN_CONTEMPORARY_NATIVE_NORTH_AMERICAN_WOMEN_and_DISPLACEMENT?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_35225479", "summary": "Native North Americans were long ago displaced from ancestral lands. Many continue to experience the aftermath of displacement in a wide variety of forms. This organic inquiry Master's thesis sought the voices of 5 contemporary Native American women. The primary research question was: How do contemporary Native American women address and/or heal the impact of displacement in their lives? The study utilized organic inquiry, a transpersonal and feminist research modality that emphasizes the transformative potential of research for all involved-- the researcher, coresearchers, and the readers. Data included are dreamwork, insights gained through spiritual practice, and interactive storytelling between the researcher and 4 coresearchers. The 4 coresearchers were preselected based on their participation in Native American public forums that pertained to the topic of Native North American displacement. Findings include 14 themes that are detailed with specific comments from the coresearchers. This work is done with both my ancestors and descendants in mind, for the benefit of those who have come before and those who will follow, as well as for the community at large.

The inheritance of the implications of enforced homogeneity led writers to return to Smyrna to explore the instability of identities behind the traumatised narratives of war and expulsion and to interrogate the narrative production of \u2018home.\u2019 This article examines how three novels originally published in the English language and thus widely available, namely Eric Ambler\u2019s The Mask of Dimitrios (1939), Jeffrey Eugenides\u2019s Middlesex (2002) and Panos Karnezis\u2019s The Maze (2004), return to 1922 Smyrna as to a site traumatised by war and create a discursive space lining 1922 to other historical times and to other narratives and modern anxieties.

In particular, it examines the houses built or refurbished by Albanians in their home-country, which is no longer their place of permanent residence. This is a widespread phenomenon in Albania, but it is also a frequently appearing practice amongst other international migrants. Why do migrants living outside their home-countries build houses there even though they do not plan to return? I seek to answer this question in the case of Albania by focusing empirically on the process of constructing these houses, rather than merely on the material entity of the house\r\nas such. I propose that such \u2018house-making\u2019 by Albanian migrants is not only a simple house-building process; it also ensures a constant dwelling and dynamic \u2018proxy\u2019 presence for\r\nmigrants in their community of origin.

It explores how Somali women actively negotiate belonging between three key processes: place, identity and acceptance. It does this by situating their resettlement in the context of the Somali civil conflict. I argue that home in New Zealand is based on emotional and physical attachments to multiple locales across space and time, as enacted and embodied through performances of \u2018Somali woman\u2019 identities across social fields. I show how intersectional differences produce diverse experiences of re-imagining home, and the ways that a \u2018Somali woman\u2019 identity is changing through the actions of \u2018edgewalking\u2019 participants. It also explores how belonging is a two-sided process that is affected by discourses of tolerance in New Zealand. This thesis is structured through both anthropological and feminist frameworks and thus emphasises the voices and positions of the participants at all times. The understandings presented here unfolded from interviews with eight participants, four Somali women and four non-Somalis who had extensive connections with the Somali community. Using the stories from these eight participants, this thesis demonstrates the importance of the homeland, Somaliness and tolerance in creating a sense of belonging in Wellington communities after resettlement processes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51226399, "asset_id": 30793124, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41758767, "first_name": "shani", "last_name": "luxford", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "shaniluxford", "display_name": "shani luxford", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/shaniluxford?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41758767/13309997/14562613/s65_shani.luxford.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 13671, "name": "Refugee Resettlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Resettlement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 19640, "name": "Somali Muslim Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Somali_Muslim_Women?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 21360, "name": "Somalia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Somalia?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 26521, "name": "Tolerance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tolerance?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 30031, "name": "Somaliland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Somaliland?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 43931280, "title": "Le souci du territoire.

Discussions of al-Haj Saleh\u2019s work centre around his analysis of the Syrian revolution and the Assadist regime. As refugee knowledge, in this chapter, I describe al-Haj Saleh\u2019s understanding of exile. His emerging account aims to articulate the phenomenon of exile beyond its personified, literary and figurative aesthetics. For al-Haj Saleh, exile is not exclusively about displacement and uprooting. Exilement, as a cluster of practices and forces, is a modality of government which is constitutive of the Assadist regime\u2019s rule in Syria. Diverging from that, I present al-Haj Saleh\u2019s view on undoing exile and turning it into home, which is inspired by his personal experience both in prison and in exile.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82308410, "asset_id": 73993365, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 64985581, "first_name": "ElSayed Mahmoud", "last_name": "ElSehamy", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "ElSayedMahmoudElSehamy", "display_name": "ElSayed Mahmoud ElSehamy", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/ElSayedMahmoudElSehamy?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/64985581/18467120/41485983/s65_elsayed_mahmoud.elsehamy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10767, "name": "Exile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 169938, "name": "Arab Spring (Arab Revolts)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arab_Spring_Arab_Revolts_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 233192, "name": "Syrian Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Syrian_Revolution?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3381219, "name": "Yassin al-Haj Saleh ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yassin_al-Haj_Saleh?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 45178055, "title": "Barriers to leisure-time social participation and community integration among Syrian and Iraqi refugees", "created_at": "2021-02-23T14:32:29.447-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45178055/Barriers_to_leisure_time_social_participation_and_community_integration_among_Syrian_and_Iraqi_refugees?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_45178055", "summary": "One important, yet understudied aspect of refugees\u2019 resettlement experience is social participation.

Twenty face-to-face interviews were conducted with Iraqi and Syrian refugees in a Connecticut resettlement community. Primary social activities included attending small family gatherings and worship services.\nSeveral constraints emerged, including the transition to American life, little leisure time (i.e., time scarcity), maintaining dual time schedules, and varying levels of social network connections as central barriers to more active social participation. Overall, findings indicate that having less unstructured, leisure time results in lower levels of social participation and fewer friendships. \n\nWithin-group differences find that some participants report feeling more socially isolated, and generally less supported, compared to others (e.g., women and single men). This research suggests that a lack of leisure time and limited social networks may hinder or delay relationship formation and community building, and should be explored further.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65763070, "asset_id": 45178055, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2680369, "first_name": "H.

These residential\nareas were deliberately constructed to stage \u201cspontaneous\u201d encounters between neighbors to stimulate social bonding and to encourage\nidentification with the built environment. This article examines the discrepancy between the underlying assumptions of an ideal community,\nmaterialized in the design of cauliflower neighborhoods in the 1970s and 1980s, and the daily life experiences of contemporary residents living in two such neighborhoods.

Interviews with, and participant observation among, both undocumented migrant mothers from the South and Belgian white adoptive mothers of black Ethiopian-born children provide an insight into the way in which mothering plays an important role in the pursuit of citizenship. In our analysis, we draw on critical theorizations of citizenship from feminist, multicultural and globalization perspectives, and of care, intimacy and the affective in order to show how mothering can be viewed as a citizenship practice that transcends boundaries of the private, public and the nation. In their \u2018carework\u2019 and \u2018culturework\u2019, both undocumented migrant and white adoptive mothers negotiate prevalent ideologies of mothering that are often exclusionary of their own and their children's sense of identity and belonging. Their mothering involves building new networks and strengthening their children's identities in culturally creative ways. We argue that although these mothering practices are embedded in a multiplicity of intersecting privileges and inequalities, within restraints imposed by the nation-state context, this carework attests to the agentic capacity of mothering and its potential to affect politics of inclusion, recognition and changing hegemonic understandings of citizenship and belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35056784, "asset_id": 6680306, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 98842, "first_name": "Chia", "last_name": "Longman", "domain_name": "ugent", "page_name": "ChiaLongman", "display_name": "Chia  Longman", "profile_url": "https://ugent.academia.edu/ChiaLongman?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/98842/27276/22170398/s65_chia.longman.jpg"}, {"id": 3139410, "first_name": "Tine", "last_name": "Brouckaert", "domain_name": "ugent", "page_name": "TineBrouckaert", "display_name": "Tine Brouckaert", "profile_url": "https://ugent.academia.edu/TineBrouckaert?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3139410/1032024/17588946/s65_tine.brouckaert.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48586, "name": "Mothering, Migration and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mothering_Migration_and_Citizenship?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82379, "name": "Citizenship Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_Education?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111400, "name": "Mothering Expericences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mothering_Expericences?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 140070, "name": "Mothering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mothering?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 535592, "name": "Citizenship identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_identities?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 650724, "name": "Intensive Mothering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intensive_Mothering?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1036988, "name": "Feminist Mothering Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Mothering_Studies?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 452311, "title": "Claiming a Place Through Memories of Belonging: Politics of Recognition on the Island of Imbros", "created_at": "2011-02-22T02:16:18.575-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/452311/Claiming_a_Place_Through_Memories_of_Belonging_Politics_of_Recognition_on_the_Island_of_Imbros?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_452311", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2107896, "asset_id": 452311, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 130153, "first_name": "Elif", "last_name": "Babul", "domain_name": "mtholyoke", "page_name": "ElifBabul", "display_name": "Elif Babul", "profile_url": "https://mtholyoke.academia.edu/ElifBabul?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/130153/95718/108744/s65_elif.babul.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19675, "name": "Modern Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Turkey?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24584, "name": "Non-Muslim Minorities in Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non-Muslim_Minorities_in_Turkey?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24587, "name": "Minorities in Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minorities_in_Turkey?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 486809, "name": "G\u00f6k\u00e7eada/ Imbros", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gokceada_Imbros?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 2402787, "title": "Coping Through Music: Displacement Music in the Jewish Identity (WWII)", "created_at": "2013-01-15T02:41:08.448-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2402787/Coping_Through_Music_Displacement_Music_in_the_Jewish_Identity_WWII_?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_2402787", "summary": "Rebuilding Jewish identity in post-World War II displacement camps was a daunting task for any Holocaust survivor. Using the music of Henry Baigelman and The Happy Boys as a lens, displacement camp songs and their place in the new phase of Ashkenazic culture are explored. The songs \u201cWe Long for a Home,\u201d \u201cI May Fall in Love Only Once,\u201d and \u201cThere Awaits the Day\u201d are used as examples of Baigelman's work because they capture the attitude of eternal hope in spite of despair and destruction that characterized Jewish life after the Holocaust. Jewish Holocaust survivors continued to live in fear after the end of the Holocaust, especially in Poland, where anti-Semitic pogroms still took place regularly. Their identity as citizens of a European country had been compromised by persecution, and many were unwilling to be repatriated to their home countries. The only identity left to these survivors was their Jewishness, their Ashkenazic roots, the culture of which had been nearly annihilated. Through incorporation of pre-war musical and Jewish culture, a return to their religious roots, the advent of Zionism, and the versatile expression of music, a Jewish identity could be rebuilt and reframed, and the deep psychological scars of persecution and displacement could be soothed. The Happy Boys, as survivors from Vilna, Poland, exemplify these aspects by placing lyrics about the Jewish experience in displacement camps to songs (specifically jazz-influenced songs) that existed prior to the war, itself a meaningful practice in Ashkenazic folk culture. Through exploration of prior Jewish and European culture and of The Happy Boys, the traditionally based yet unique displacement camp song and its value in rebuilding an Ashkenazic identity among Polish Jews is revealed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30434308, "asset_id": 2402787, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 916908, "first_name":

self-evident alternative to human society, Nature has always been the other place where the subject - the  narrative subject in our case - tries to re-position itself in order to gain a new point of view on its life, on its relations, and on the society he/she used to belong to, in the attempt to negotiate a new existence. A new existence supposed to be more real, pure, authentic, sincere, paradoxically even more human, than the one he/she used to live among human beings. A new positioning supposed to give the subject a better view on the society and the self, a new connection with the roots of life and a less conditioned voice. A better way for human cognitive processes. \r\nThe paper will take into account H. D. Thoreau\u2019s 'Walden' (1854), Italo Calvino\u2019s 'Il barone rampante' (1957) and the movie 'In to the wild' (Sean Penn, USA 2007, from the novel by Jon Krakauer, 1996), in order to understand how the displacement of the subject is carried out. It will also try to trace a development of the 'nature alternative' from Thoreau\u2019s short-timed experience of a new possibility of existence, through the fantastic model of the Barone rampante\u2019s one-man revolution, to the tragic, extreme ending of 'In to the wild'. From the middle of the XIX century to our days something is changed in our relationship with the 'otherness' of Nature and in the reasons to choose that 'otherness' against human society, the paper will outline the changes in Western culture which lie behind the differences shown in these three works.\"        ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30429244, "asset_id": 2393274, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2194369, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Giusti", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "FrancescoGiusti", "display_name": "Francesco Giusti", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/FrancescoGiusti?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2194369/725210/68052630/s65_francesco.giusti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 197, "name": "Human Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Ecology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2123, "name": "Death Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16201, "name": "Ecocriticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecocriticism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19019, "name": "Thoreau", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thoreau?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19031, "name": "Geographies of Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographies_of_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 25133, "name": "Italo Calvino", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italo_Calvino?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 25613, "name": "Philosophy of Nature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Nature?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36008, "name": "Internal Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56163, "name": "Otherness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Otherness?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 70069, "name": "Ecocriticism, Eco-Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecocriticism_Eco-Aesthetics?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 146652, "name": "Dystopian Literature, ecocriticism, postcolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dystopian_Literature_ecocriticism_postcolonialism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 242545, "name": "Sean Penn", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sean_Penn?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 398314, "name": "Nature and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nature_and_Literature?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 677793, "name": "Jon Krakauer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jon_Krakauer?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 932610, "title": "Whose street is it anyway?

This methodological approach allows the researcher to move beyond the rigidness of academic discourse and consequently enables a more intimate connection with the object of research.\n\nFindings \u2013 The main outcome of this paper is realization that the presence of the researcher and her own autobiography affects the results of research and that articulation as much as execution of research is always subjective. A significant implication of this kind of approach is uncertainty and unreliability which questions the positivist objectivism dominating in both consumer studies and marketing. A subsequent limitation is a free reading which evades possibility of definite conclusions.\n\nOriginality/value \u2013 By providing a film and a commentary to it in one publication, this paper overcomes the traditional separation between the visual and the textual and contributes to the multisensory model of academic practice. It is particularly important for ethnography and visual studies where the application of the senses has both a theoretical and a practical value.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5682082, "asset_id": 932610, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 84573, "first_name": "Marta", "last_name": "Hawkins", "domain_name": "chester", "page_name": "MartaHawkins", "display_name": "Marta Hawkins", "profile_url": "https://chester.academia.edu/MartaHawkins?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/84573/23554/37274324/s65_marta.hawkins_aka_rabikowska_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 29947153, "title": "Sense of Place and Belonging in a Redeveloping Waterfront Area.pdf", "created_at": "2016-11-18T13:35:12.843-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29947153/Sense_of_Place_and_Belonging_in_a_Redeveloping_Waterfront_Area_pdf?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_29947153", "summary": "This study seeks to understand and illustrate how landlords, owner-occupiers and tenants feel about both the place, and fellow residents of Ocean Village, Southampton, UK.

"This paper explores the concept of home by looking at the experiences of expellees and refugees in Germany after the Second World War, situating these in the literature on migration, displacement and home, and in particular transnational anthropological literature. After conducing autobiographical interviews with expellees, their narratives, influenced by their historical, social and economic context, reveal that their understanding of home has undergone profound changes throughout their life-course, and can loosely be categorised into three phases: the loss of home, itinerancy, and settlement. Throughout these phases the meaning of home was constantly being contested and negotiated by expellees. This has led to an imagined, idealised and romanticised notion of their 'Heimat' (homeland) that now only exists in their (common) memory and is combined with their current home where they describe themselves as 'Zuhause' (at home.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35528548, "asset_id": 9261950, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 236887, "first_name": "Vanessa", "last_name": "Hughes", "domain_name": "lse", "page_name": "VanessaHughes", "display_name": "Vanessa Hughes", "profile_url": "https://lse.academia.edu/VanessaHughes?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/236887/2564623/12270917/s65_vanessa.hughes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2835, "name": "Refugee Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3987, "name": "History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Memory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12739, "name": "Second World War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_World_War?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 39347828, "title": "Belonging, Indigeneity, Land and Nature in Southern Africa under Neoliberal Capitalism: An Overview", "created_at": "2019-06-02T12:10:39.468-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39347828/Belonging_Indigeneity_Land_and_Nature_in_Southern_Africa_under_Neoliberal_Capitalism_An_Overview?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_39347828", "summary": "This is the editorial to the part-special issue in the Journal of Southern African Studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59488981, "asset_id": 39347828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1964548, "first_name": "Stasja", "last_name": "Koot", "domain_name": "wageningen-ur", "page_name": "stasjakootcom", "display_name": "Stasja Koot", "profile_url": "https://wageningen-ur.academia.edu/stasjakootcom?f_ri=56160", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 23437549, "first_name": "Catie", "last_name": "Gressier", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "CatieGressier", "display_name": "Catie Gressier", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/CatieGressier?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23437549/6460929/16145786/s65_catie.gressier.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8331, "name": "Indigenous Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Knowledge?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13135, "name": "Southern Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Africa?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14768, "name": "Land Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Law?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15149, "name": "Indigenous Peoples Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples_Rights?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 33319, "name": "Nature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nature?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 61866, "name": "South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 133605, "name": "Namibia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Namibia?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 133960, "name": "Nature Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nature_Conservation?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 768477, "name": "Politics of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1285954, "name": "Land Claims and Self Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Claims_and_Self_Government?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 19963223, "title": "CfP Temporality and Displacement -

It began as a series of personal answers to the question: \u201cWhere would you consider as home?\u201d, and now seeks to reach out to other debates on this essential question. For several months, we\u2014two women from different origins, of different ages, with different skin tone and very different memories\u2014have been reflecting on our past inhabitancies and the mobility turns that we have taken in our lives. In doing so, we find that the German term \u201cHeimat\u201d and its English translations \u201chome\u201d and \u201chomeland\u201d, are all fuzzy, flexible concepts. Finding a place one calls \u201chome\u201d is no easy task in the ever-changing and chaotic world that we currently live in; that is, a place in which we are experiencing significant mobility, alongside a loss of physicality via the internet. At the same time, questions of belonging and rootedness gain importance: \u201cWhere do I come from?\u201d, \u201cWhere do I belong?\u201d and \u201cWho am I?\u201d Additionally, within a contradictory complexity such as ours, the inquiry \u201cwhat do we mean by belonging in a digital age\u201d must arise. It is in pursuit of a semblance of an answer to such a crucial question that we offer our academic and personal contemplations on the concepts \u201cHeimat\u201d, \u201chome\u201d and \u201chomeland\u201d, as well as our ruminations on the effects of spatial mobility and digitalization (e.g., New Media) on the definitions of those concepts and their accompanying senses of belonging. We believe it is critical for us to try to understand these complicated constitutions of our possessive selves, especially if one seeks to determine how to foment a pluralistic, post-oppositional and loving sense of belonging\u2014even within the social constructions of our diverse becomings.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38433306, "asset_id": 14819997, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 973591, "first_name": "Epifania", "last_name": "Amoo-Adare", "domain_name": "zef", "page_name": "EpifaniaAmooAdare", "display_name": "Epifania Amoo-Adare", "profile_url": "https://zef.academia.edu/EpifaniaAmooAdare?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/973591/2646643/36117881/s65_epifania.amoo-adare.jpg"}, {"id": 29170963, "first_name": "Crossroads Asia", "last_name": "University of Bonn", "domain_name": "uni-bonn", "page_name": "CrossroadsAsia", "display_name": "Crossroads Asia  University of Bonn", "profile_url": "https://uni-bonn.academia.edu/CrossroadsAsia?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29170963/8323070/9989440/s65_crossroads_asia.university_of_bonn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1712, "name": "Globalisation and cultural change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_cultural_change?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 6865, "name": "Digital Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Culture?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 9778369, "title": "A Community in Limbo: Negotiating Notions of \u2018Home\u2019 and Belonging amongst Third Culture Kids", "created_at": "2014-12-15T06:04:56.542-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9778369/A_Community_in_Limbo_Negotiating_Notions_of_Home_and_Belonging_amongst_Third_Culture_Kids?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_9778369", "summary": "A Third Culture Kid (TCK) is a person who has spent a significant part of his or her developmental years outside the parents\u2019 culture.

By deconcentrating poverty and giving opportunities for social interaction, remaining residents are believed to benefit from middle class presence. This study looks at a post-war neighbourhood in Amsterdam which has undergone comprehensive renewal. By making use of survey data in combination with GIS techniques, this study shows that perceptions are\nstructured by physical characteristics, activity patterns and symbolic boundaries. These perceptions are highly dependent on social position. While some residents in renewal areas display inclusionary attitudes, there is also evidence of middle class and lower class disaffiliation. Interestingly, these translate into different mental maps for both groups.

It argues against the tendency to reduce commodification of land to \u201cprimitive accumulation\u201d or \u201caccumulation by dispossession.\u201d It presents an ethnography of the process of the commodification of land under speculative conditions. The growing demand for land for urbanization and industrialization, along with the availability of speculative finance capital in the real estate market, has made land a scarce commodity. In this land market, local capitals piggyback on finance capital and bid up the prices exponentially in the micromarkets. Speculation makes it impossible for the state to match the market price, and its compensation for the land losers is always quite low, which the latter refuse to accept. The landowning farmers, on the other hand, have developed a capacity to adjust to the speculative conditions and to control the supply of land in the market. Even though they can receive a very good price for their land, they show no urgency to sell it. As a consequence, the state\u2019s plan to urbanize a given area, to create a stable arrangement of clear property titles, and to control land prices become uncertain.", "downloadable_attachments":

We argue that the practices of the biopolitics of citizenship and governmentality\u2014surveillance, immigration documents, employment forms, birth certificates, tax forms, drivers\u2019 licenses, credit card applications, bank accounts, medical insurance, car insurance, random detentions, and deportations\u2014enclose, penetrate, define, limit, and frustrate the lives of undocumented 1.5-generation Latino immigrants. We examine data from a random-sample telephone survey of 805 Latinos and 396 whites in Orange County, California, to provide general patterns that distinguish 1.5-generation Latino immigrants from their first-generation counterparts and to suggest the contours of their lives as undocumented immigrants. We then examine in-depth interviews with 80 respondents also in Orange County who provide extensive qualitative information and personal narratives. The analysis shows how abjectivity and illegality constrain daily life, create internalized fears, in some ways immobilize their victims, and in other ways motivate them to engage politically to resist the dire conditions of their lives.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 23725004, "asset_id": 1564699, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 994967, "first_name": "Roberto G.", "last_name": "Gonzales", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "RobertoGGonzales", "display_name": "Roberto G.

This essay argues that Sebbar\u2019s protagonist fails to find a home in his writing because to do so depends on finding a hospitable reader. Only once a hospitable reader takes in his writing might he then find a home in his writing. Writing is thus the means by which the protagonists seeks \u2013 and fails to find \u2013 a hospitable community. \r\n\r\nLe silence des rives (1993) de Leila Sebbar raconte le dernier jour de la vie d\u2019un homme qui a immigr\u00e9 en France dans sa jeunesse, s\u2019est mari\u00e9 avec une Fran\u00e7aise et n\u2019est jamais rentr\u00e9 chez lui sur \u00ab l\u2019autre rive. \u00bb De nombreux \u00e9crivains en exil ont parl\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9criture comme d\u2019une patrie de substitution, mais peu d\u2019entr\u2019eux se sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s au r\u00f4le du lecteur.

To fill this gap, between 2011 and 2015, the comparative research project, (Re)Conceptualising Stateless Diasporas in the European Union, has conducted over one hundred individual interviews and ten household interviews with Kurds, Palestinians, and Roma who hold a wide range of legal statuses in France, Italy, Sweden, and the UK, in order to examine how they construct, negotiate and/or reject both statelessness and diasporic identity in the EU.... Overall, the project has critically explored how individual and collective experiences complement, and at times challenge, the official discourses and policies developed by policy- makers and academics. Transcending the legal focus of much research regarding stateless- ness, this has also entailed exploring key questions pertaining to the diasporic nature of certain stateless groups, examining whether, and how, individuals of Kurdish, Palestinian and Roma backgrounds develop and maintain connections with other members of their com- munities across time and space, and socio-political commitments to their respective home- lands.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38808279, "asset_id": 15837443, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

border", "created_at": "2013-08-13T22:59:40.977-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4237574/Feeling_at_home_producing_and_consuming_things_in_Karenni_refugee_camps_on_the_Thai_Burma_border?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_4237574", "summary": "This article concentrates on production and consumption, particularly of food and textiles, and the contribution of such processes and bodily action to feeling at home, for the highly heterogeneous population of Karenni refugees from Burma living in camps on the Thai border. Looking at eating, weaving and wearing, I examine the implications and associations of the production and consumption processes and their similarities and differences with pre-exile life. I argue that an investigation into sensory aspects of such issues can illuminate how it feels to be a refugee, in a physical sense: to be out of one's familiar place and ecology, seeking actively to bring about a sense of being \u2018at home\u2019 in the exiled context of a border camp. Being displaced inevitably alters forced migrants' connections with the physical world of places, objects and other people of which they are a part. To focus on this aspect of forced migration, rather than following the more usual emphases on causes, protection and assistance, or psychosocial impacts, facilitates exploration of the fundamentally cultural processes through which refugees make meaning out of the rupture they have experienced. It is an approach that demonstrates local agency and makes it clear that refugees are not passive victims, but active agents working hard to make the best of their circumstances. For the Karenni as for other displaced and non-displaced peoples alike, an important part of feeling \u2018at home\u2019 is the cultivation of a sense of spatiotemporal continuity of place and of emplacement. Yet real, physical continuity of place is impossible for refugees: the camp is not and never will be the place whence they have come. I demonstrate that refugees make considerable efforts to create a sense of purpose and home in displacement, and that embodied knowledge and the opportunity for its repeated enactment, and especially, sensory experience, are central components in this. While the camp is in some ways perpetually becoming more like home, it will never quite be it. Nonetheless, repeated and active engagement in the present with the objects and actions of the past, are in a refugee setting particularly powerful and dynamic in forming and re-forming connections with the pre-exile past.

this article I ask why gay and lesbian people in Poland mourned their infamously homophobic president Lech Kaczynski, and, in turn, what it means to mourn one's own enemy. In examining this extraordinary case of national bereavement and the collective performance of grief, I point to complex models of attachment that position Polish homosexual subjects in a locus where they are able to enter the national discourse as subjects, and not only as abjects. I stress the role of identification rather than identity, relationality, processuality and performativity in understanding the relations between nationhood and homosexuality. Homosexual subjects attaining the rituals of national bereavement break the chains of interlinked subject positions and social expectations. In doing so, nationhood is rendered a \u201chybrid\u201d space of identification for the homosexual subject. Consequently, mourning becomes an act of \u201cqueering\u201d the nation, a wilful subversion of culturally and traditionally sanctioned performative recollections of nationhood (Polishness).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37938320, "asset_id": 9824189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7982, "first_name": "Roberto", "last_name": "Kulpa", "domain_name": "napier", "page_name": "RobertoKulpa", "display_name": "Roberto Kulpa", "profile_url": "https://napier.academia.edu/RobertoKulpa?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7982/2872/105912061/s65_roberto.kulpa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8104, "name": "Mourning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mourning?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10802, "name": "Subversion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subversion?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76967, "name": "Homonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homonationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 159218, "name": "Death, Grief, and Mourning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_Grief_and_Mourning?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 234644, "name": "Mourning and melancholia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mourning_and_melancholia?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 640768, "name": "Melancholic Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melancholic_Nationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 640769, "name": "Melancholic Sexual Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melancholic_Sexual_Politics?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 832210, "name": "LGBT In Central and Eastern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_In_Central_and_Eastern_Europe?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1723408, "name": "Queer Melancholia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Melancholia?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 1817269, "title": "Why Do They Count?

"summary": "The psychological concept of belonging (or belongingness) is a strong motive found in human nature. When not satisfied or is lost, it causes highly problematic behaviors and relationships, leading sufferers to try to satisfy their need to belong. This article studies how belongingness finds reflections in the isolated and traumatized soldier characters of the two significant plays, namely Penetrator (1993) by Anthony Neilson and Blasted (1995) by Sarah Kane, of the 1990s British drama, known as the In-Yer-Face theatre. In order to achieve this, this article analyzes the soldier characters-Tadge from Penetrator and Soldier from Blasted-found in these plays by means of the theories and related studies on the concept of belonging such as those put forth by Roy Baumeister, Mark Leary, Abraham Maslow, Sigmund Freud, and Jacques Lacan. The study expands the analyses of the soldier characters in the plays by juxtaposing the theories of belonging and sense of belonging with related studies on several other psychological concepts, such as recognition, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and transference.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68977257, "asset_id": 51135571, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37784, "first_name": "Mustafa", "last_name": "Bal", "domain_name": "etu", "page_name": "MustafaBal", "display_name": "Mustafa  Bal", "profile_url": "https://etu.academia.edu/MustafaBal?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37784/12552/99839/s65_mustafa.bal.jpg"}, {"id": 105773044, "first_name": "\u00c7a\u011fan", "last_name": "F\u0131rt\u0131na", "domain_name": "metu", "page_name": "\u00c7a\u011fanF\u0131rt\u0131na", "display_name": "\u00c7a\u011fan F\u0131rt\u0131na", "profile_url": "https://metu.academia.edu/%C3%87a%C4%9FanF%C4%B1rt%C4%B1na?f_ri=56160", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 947, "name": "Theatre Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1332, "name": "Theatre History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_History?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3381, "name": "Contemporary British Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_British_Theatre?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6222, "name": "Drama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drama?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 9396, "name": "Contemporary Drama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Drama?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 12737, "name": "Sarah Kane", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sarah_Kane?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 29102, "name": "Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36864, "name": "In-Yer-Face Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In-Yer-Face_Theatre?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36865, "name": "In Yer Face Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In_Yer_Face_Theatre?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 49234, "name": "Contemporary Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Theatre?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 109750, "name": "Anthony Neilson", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthony_Neilson?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 841574, "name": "Blasted", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blasted?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1282006, "name": "Belongingness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belongingness?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 3852500, "name": "Penetrator (play by Anthony Neilson)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Penetrator_play_by_Anthony_Neilson_?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 28887029, "title": "BOUNDARIES OF DISPLACEMENT: Belonging and Return among Forcibly Displaced Young Georgians from Abkhazia", "created_at": "2016-10-03T08:08:06.404-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28887029/BOUNDARIES_OF_DISPLACEMENT_Belonging_and_Return_among_Forcibly_Displaced_Young_Georgians_from_Abkhazia?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_28887029", "summary": "PhD dissertation, introductory chapter.

The analysis is based on a field study of over 100 biographical interviews in two local communities situated in the borderland regions which were particularly exposed to post-war displacement, resettlement and population exchange: Ukrainian Galicia and Western Poland. The author claims that although the history of these two distant communities was totally different, contemporary memory of being a refugee/deportee/forced migrant, losing one's home/homeland and watching the deportation of the previous inhabitants of one's new place of residence bear many similarities. While analysing autobiographical narratives, I attempt to find common threads and topics generated by their experiences as children, as well as explain the differences by exploring the social context of individual memory, with a special accent on post-war socialisation and the Polish and Ukrainian memory culture. The author also strives to show how and why the children's memories differ from those of their parents.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38365710, "asset_id": 11930686, "asset_type": "Work",

started in Syria in 2011 have made the migration phenomenon as a current issue both Turkey and the World. No doubt that, every act of migration has a \u2018challenge\u2019 in itself. The most important of these challenges is the acquiring of livable place that evolves due to the need for shelter that is one of the most essential needs of humankind. On that point, the task of the people, who specialized in the disciplines of design and architecture, is to draw this contemporary issue through the spatial aspects of migration. Today, the spatial distribution of migration in Turkey is divided into two groups as accommodation centers and cities in general. In the case of emergency, well-intentioned accommodation centers were built as temporal response to this problem to find an immediate solution. It is aimed that meeting the basic human needs in the proper way, but these spaces couldn\u2019t give the feeling of being at home. Instead of staying in the accommodation centers, due to the various difficulties and dissatisfactions experienced in these areas, the process of acquiring a place by migrating to various cities results with establishing a \u2018home\u2019. In the process of searching for livable place and re-establishing of the home, individuals past experiences and the role of the new place in memories becomes essential. Therefore, this article focuses on this issue within the scope of the theoretical framework based on \u2018acquiring a livable space\u2019, \u2018developing sense of belonging\u2019 and \u2018establishing a cultural attachment\u2019.

The unrequited longings of migrant women who work in factories and as caretakers demonstrate how marginal hubs are created through disjunctures of emplacement and mobility, which are intensified as these women attempt to bridge the contradictions entailed in care work and industrial labour across the supply chains.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58801803, "asset_id": 38717474, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2362325, "first_name": "Nellie", "last_name": "Chu", "domain_name": "dku-cn", "page_name": "NellieChu", "display_name": "Nellie Chu", "profile_url": "https://dku-cn.academia.edu/NellieChu?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2362325/744502/64164929/s65_nellie.chu.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29, "name": "Industrial And Labor Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_And_Labor_Relations?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 97290, "name": "Women's Work", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Work?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 782724, "name": "Displacement and Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement_and_Migration?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 697224, "title": "Latino Migrants in the Jewish State: Undocumented Lifes in Israel (full book)", "created_at": "2011-06-26T19:01:37.197-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/697224/Latino_Migrants_in_the_Jewish_State_Undocumented_Lifes_in_Israel_full_book_?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_697224", "summary": "In the 1990s, thousands of non-Jewish Latinos arrived in Israel as undocumented immigrants. Based on his fieldwork in South America and Israel, Barak Kalir follows these workers from their decision to migrate to their experiences finding work, establishing social clubs and evangelical Christian churches, and putting down roots in Israeli society. While the State of Israel rejected the presence of non-Jewish migrants, many citizens accepted them. Latinos grew to favor cultural assimilation to Israeli society. In 2005, after a large-scale deportation campaign that drew criticism from many quarters, Israel made the historic decision to legalize the status of some undocumented migrant families on the basis of their cultural assimilation and identification with the State. By doing so, the author maintains, Israel recognized the importance of practical belonging for understanding citizenship and national identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52238402,

who were disappeared (desaparecidos) and killed (ejecutados pol\u00edticos) during Pinochet's dictatorship (1973\u20131990). This piece draws on the authors' recent participation in a specific tree-planting ceremony performed by this group in Wales. By looking at the relocation of bodies, and the enactments and artefacts within the site-specificity of this event, a reflection on both the diasporic space developed and the unexpectedly complex character of the \u201cliving memorial\u201d the group aims to cultivate will be elaborated. Ecomemoria's members match their living memory project with the trees that commemorate the life of the disappeared. Yet this conception here is complicated by highlighting the transnational, as well as the active, social, embodied and uncanny character of the ceremony which, as it will be argued, comprises a living memorial in its own right. This essay starts by briefly presenting Ecomemoria, to then describe and deconstruct the ceremony's diasporic and haunting qualities. Finally, to conclude, a much more complex idea of a living memorial will be developed in consideration of the mobile, affective, embodied and ghostly mise-en-sc\u00e8ne the ceremony produces.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32914137, "asset_id": 1817254, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1569910, "first_name": "Carolina", "last_name": "Ramirez", "domain_name": "ucsh", "page_name": "CarolinaRamirez", "display_name": "Carolina Ramirez", "profile_url": "https://ucsh.academia.edu/CarolinaRamirez?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1569910/653876/22944396/s65_carolina.ramirez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 12644, "name": "Commemoration and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_and_Memory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 25453, "name": "Experimental Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Ethnography?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 126797, "name": "Affective Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affective_Labour?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 158253, "name": "Chilean Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chilean_Diaspora?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 16201224, "title": "Bones in the wrong soil\u2019: reburial, belonging, and disinterred cosmologies in post-conflict northern Uganda", "created_at": "2015-09-26T10:15:52.877-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16201224/Bones_in_the_wrong_soil_reburial_belonging_and_disinterred_cosmologies_in_post_conflict_northern_Uganda?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_16201224", "summary": "n the aftermath of the war in northern Uganda between the Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan government, most of the internally displaced have returned to pre-displacement areas of residence. As efforts to remake homes and reorder lives take centre stage, reburials from sites of displacement to former homesteads have become a widespread practice. Based on an ethnographic study in the formerly largest internal displacement camp in Acholiland, northern Uganda, we argue that the importance of reburial is twofold: first, it stems from a cosmological idiom in which, while in constant flux, belonging is spiritually embedded and territorially circumscribed; and second, the practice of reburial becomes implicated in post-conflict agendas of development and \u2018reconstruction\u2019 with pronounced material and cosmological consequences. Yet, contemporary debates in refugee studies have failed to grasp the importance of cosmological concerns and the ways these are bound up with questions of territoriality in post-displacement societies. It is therefore theoretically important to shift the contours of debate around post-conflict return and reconstruction from a focus on the critique of fluidity of social identities \u2013 or alternately emphasizing livelihoods and material \u2018reconstruction\u2019 \u2013 to an interrogation of the myriad ways in which place is made meaningful through ritual action invoking the material and the non-material alike, while at the same time being attentive to how the politics and materiality of post-conflict developmentalism continually shape, intersect with, and disrupt cosmological practice.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38899572, "asset_id": 16201224, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35357170, "first_name": "Ina", "last_name": "Jahn", "domain_name": "wits", "page_name": "Jahn", "display_name": "Ina R Jahn", "profile_url": "https://wits.academia.edu/Jahn?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35357170/11982684/13350857/s65_ina.jahn.jpg"}, {"id": 6838971, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Wilhelm-Solomon", "domain_name": "wits", "page_name": "MatthewWilhelmSolomon", "display_name": "Matthew Wilhelm-Solomon", "profile_url": "https://wits.academia.edu/MatthewWilhelmSolomon?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6838971/2643449/3074696/s65_matthew.wilhelm-solomon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2835, "name": "Refugee Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 172801, "name": "northern Uganda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/northern_Uganda?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 324649, "name": "Funeral Rites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funeral_Rites?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 466726, "name": "Reburial", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reburial?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 846020, "name": "Effects of War in Northern Uganda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Effects_of_War_in_Northern_Uganda?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 12490143, "title": "2012\tBorders and the Rhythms of Displacement, Emplacement and Mobility.

In 1991, Colombia adopted policies of multiculturalism to codify rights for collective political subjects. Struggling against acute dispossession, social movements are using multiculturalism's openings in a bid to claim land. I argue that multiculturalism in Colombia spatializes and ethnicizes rights possibilities, particularly rights to land. The state privileges land claims by ethnicized political identity groups able to demonstrate an autochthonous presence in specific, delimited territories. Drawing primarily on semi-structured interviews with leaders of the Campesino Association of Inz\u00e1, Tierradentro (ACIT), I explore how the state simultaneously forecloses land claims by much of the subaltern population, while re-legitimizing its authority through a seemingly progressive agenda of rights protection. I also consider how recognition based on autochthony risks naturalizing divisions between similarly marginalized groups, and complements the oppressions and exclusions fostered by neoliberal globalization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35446148, "asset_id": 9161417, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 310315, "first_name": "Sarah-Jane", "last_name": "Hamilton", "domain_name": "carleton-ca", "page_name": "SarahJaneHamilton", "display_name": "Sarah-Jane Hamilton", "profile_url": "https://carleton-ca.academia.edu/SarahJaneHamilton?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/310315/133530/155467/s65_sarah-jane.hamilton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 802, "name": "Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Economy?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 264379, "name": "Campesinos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Campesinos?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 786914, "name": "Movimientos Campesinos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Movimientos_Campesinos?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 3607201, "title": "(2013).

"Forced into exile and subsequently coming home, the \u00e9migr\u00e9 encounters a different place, often causing strong emotional reactions. Four accounts of displacement and return are discussed in terms of Maurice Halbwachs\u2019s cadre spatial, the spatial framework of the collective memory that enables the distinction between a space remembered and its physical counterpart. On the basis of these accounts, the chapter argues that such situations give rise to, not one, but two or more, memory constructions of the home environment: spatial frameworks corresponding to pre-exile home, to the conflicted environment, and to the reconstructed or normalised environment, respectively. By differentiating between the place\u2019s different temporal phases, it appears as if the returning person can access and reconstruct memories of events, people, emotions, etc., connected to each particular epoch. The term epochal-spatial framework is proposed to distinguish the separate spatial frameworks, each corresponding to a phase in the history of an environment, for the individual and his or her social milieu.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32151734, "asset_id": 4494467, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 305767, "first_name": "Mattias", "last_name": "Ekman", "domain_name": "ostfoldmuseene", "page_name": "MattiasEkman", "display_name": "Mattias Ekman", "profile_url": "https://ostfoldmuseene.academia.edu/MattiasEkman?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/305767/61620/98574331/s65_mattias.ekman.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6736, "name": "Lebanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lebanon?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8084, "name": "Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13950, "name": "Collective Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collective_Memory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14580, "name": "Forced Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 59265, "name": "Maurice Halbwachs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maurice_Halbwachs?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 64064, "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 66540, "name": "Architecture and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Memory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 105232, "name": "Croatia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Croatia?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 114367, "name": "Architecture and collective memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_collective_memory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 139944, "name": "Place and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Memory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 361488, "name": "Forced migration and displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_migration_and_displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1011617, "name": "Spatial Frameworks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Frameworks?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1031518, "name": "Memory and Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_and_Architecture?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 2708447, "title": "\u00centre \u0219emineu \u0219i pomana porcului: Schimburi pe ruta Cajvana -

Movements of machines, of people and of thinking are something which we see on a daily basis. We go to offices, meet relatives and family members and do many other activities which involves movement from one place to another. We also live in an age of conflict, of our struggle for our space, of our rights. The lack of human dignity is a major factor in this struggle for space. Displacement, be it forced or voluntary, is one of the most serious problems which most countries have had to face. Although globalisation and democratisation in many countries has helped people better their lives, at the same time this development has contributed to disparity between the rich and the poor. The hardship of the displaced people has been captured in movies, theatre, literature and many other mediums of art. In this paper I propose to analyse displacement through two contemporary novels which have displacement as the central theme. La Multitud Errante (Tale of the Dispossessed in English) by Colombian writer Laura Restrepo and The Hungry Tide by Amitav Ghosh. Both India and Colombia have witnessed displacement. Colombia in fact is the country with the second most internally displaced people in terms of percentage. India, on the other hand, has seen the violence that took place post the partition which created the country of Pakistan. Many people were displaced in both the countries around a similar time period: in the late 40s and 50s. In the case of Colombia it was the civil war called La Violencia, which took place from 1948-1958, between two political parties, the Partido Conservatorio and the Partido Liberal, whose respective supporters fought major parts of the war in the country side. It resulted in the death of almost 20,000 people and more than one million were displaced. Later emerged the guerrilla group FARC (Revolutionary Armed forces of Colombia). It fought against the Colombian army in support of the displaced people. The current problems of drug cartels and violence that we see in Colombia is because of the consequences of the Civil War, La Violencia. This forms the background of the novel La Multitud Errante.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61170352, "asset_id": 40884040, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46181782, "first_name": "Siddharth", "last_name": "Chandrashekhar", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SChandrashekher", "display_name": "Siddharth Chandrashekhar", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SChandrashekher?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/46181782/17200142/17336132/s65_siddharth..chandrashekher.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30948482, "title": "MA Thesis 'Living in between: how refugees and volunteers in negotiation (re)construct citizenship and humanitarian care in the camps of Grande-Synthe, France'", "created_at": "2017-01-16T07:08:04.756-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30948482/MA_Thesis_Living_in_between_how_refugees_and_volunteers_in_negotiation_re_construct_citizenship_and_humanitarian_care_in_the_camps_of_Grande_Synthe_France?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_30948482", "summary": "\"This thesis will discuss the limitations and possibilities of sustainable citizenship and hospitality in the refugee camps of Grande-Synthe, France.

They reduce the last group to an anonymous mass of either criminals or suffering victims and stimulate thinking in terms of exclusion, enlarging the gap between us and them . Having spent one month in camp Basroch (the Jungle of Grande-Synthe ) and two months in camp La Lini\u00e8re ( the first official refugee camp of Europe ), I will draw on my own ethnographic experiences and daily conversations as a volunteer in the camp to illustrate the complex and nuanced ways in which both refugees and volunteers question the concepts of statelessness and national belonging and in negotiation (re)construct citizenship and care in relation to each other. It s a story about the numerous challenges that limit their hospitality and their powerful attempts to cross the borders that hold them apart.\" ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51377769,

"Following forced expulsion and campaigns of ethnic cleansing, substantial portions of national communities affected by conflict no longer live within the boundaries of the state. Nevertheless, existing wartime and post-war public opinion research is largely confined to countries directly affected by conflict. As a result, current research may overlook important war-affected populations and processes shaping their opinions. I address this problem by examining the question: does incorporation in settlement countries reduce support for conflict ideology? Examining this question requires new micro-data. I examine the results of a large-scale survey of ex-Yugoslavs in Sweden. The findings suggest that incorporation undermines support for conflict ideology by increasing the socioeconomic security and social identity complexity of migrants. This has important implications for multiculturalism policies in the context of the current global migration crisis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41638412, "asset_id": 15226165, "asset_type":

Post-conflict areas evoke specific meanings and emotions, and the narratives of violent events have profound effects on the individual and collective interpretations of the venues of violence. This paper addresses the interdependent relation between violence and place, considering the structural and multi-scalar conditions of a relational and discursive making of places. By linking them with an empirically grounded analysis of the materialisation of violence, we follow Gear\u00f3id \u00d3 Tuathail\u2019s (2010) claim for a more grounded study of place-specific causes for violent conflict. We employ an empirical example of violent conflict, the post-election violence in Kenya 2007/08, and look into one of its venues, a poor and heterogeneous workers\u2019 settlement at Lake Naivasha in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley. Considering the specific socio-political setting in Kenya, we examine (a) the factors that explain why the violence broke out at that place in particular. We synthesise the structural conditions that determined the violence, and which still regulate social life at present, with the individual accounts of people directly or indirectly involved in the violence in Naivasha. We look at (b) how the experience of violence has influenced the imaginations of the place, and if these localised imprints of violence in Naivasha continue to regulate social and spatial (re)organisation after the events. The study reveals that politically instigated societal divides continue to exist, and that memories of the violence induce intensified processes of segregation at the surveyed settlement during times of political uncertainty.

provides one phenomenological interpretation of writer and director Alan Ball\u2019s popular Home Box Office cable-television series, Six Feet Under, which completed its fifth and final season in 2005. The chapter considers how home and at-homeness are portrayed in the series, drawing on two contrasting phenomenological conceptions: First, Edmund Husserl\u2019s homeworld/alienworld as interpreted by Anthony Steinbock in Home and Beyond (Steinbock 1995); and, second, Kristen Jacobson\u2019s being-at-home (Jacobson 2009). The argument is made that an open sense of at-homeness, grounded in family and place, allows for personal and communal transformation partly impelled by unsettling moments when characters suddenly encounter, in their home lifeworld, compelling situations and understandings before out of sight\u2014i.e., the uncanny.\r\n\r\nKey words: home, at-homeness, dwelling, homeworld, alienworld,

First, I look back at the criticism Magali Bessone addresses to the \u201cparadigm of hospitality\u201d, targeting Derrida in particular for his assertion, in the middle of the 1990s, of a principle of unconditional hospitality in support of (undocumented) migrants\u2019 struggles. I subsequently argue that Bessone\u2019s criticism does not take into account the case in point for Derrida; \u201ccase\u201d referring here to both the contextual circumstances and a specific judicial case. If Derrida appeared to put the emphasis on \u201cprivate\u201d hospitality, it was largely because of a peculiar legal case, \u201cL\u2019affaire Jacqueline Deltombe\u201d. Derrida was instrumental in bringing this case to the public\u2019s attention and in shaping its public perception and understanding. Finally, tracing back the Heideggerian and Levinasian backdrops of his work, I further argue that his philosophy of hospitality overlooks some fundamental dimensions of hospitality, neglecting the pole of reception and hypertrophying the pole of donation.\r\n\r\nCentr\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9thique de l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9 de Jacques Derrida, cet article proc\u00e8de en trois temps. D\u2019abord, j\u2019y reviens sur les critiques que Magali Bessone adresse au \"paradigme de l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9\", ciblant sp\u00e9cialement Jacques Derrida qui avait fait valoir un principe d\u2019hospitalit\u00e9 inconditionnelle, d\u00e8s le milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990, en soutien aux luttes des sans-papiers et migrants. Je montre ensuite que les critiques de Magali Bessone ne tiennent pas compte de ce qui \u00e9tait le cas pour Jacques Derrida : cas s\u2019entend ici comme circonstances et comme affaire. L\u2019apparente centration de Jacques Derrida sur l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9 \u00ab priv\u00e9e \u00bb faisait \u00e9cho \u00e0 une affaire, \u00ab l\u2019affaire Jacqueline Deltombe \u00bb, dont il a inform\u00e9 la compr\u00e9hension publique. Enfin, via un retour \u00e0 son arri\u00e8re-plan heideggerien et levinassien, j\u2019essaye de montrer en quoi la philosophie derrid\u00e9enne de l\u2019accueil oublie d\u2019essentielles dimensions de l\u2019hospitalit\u00e9, en n\u00e9gligeant tout sp\u00e9cialement le p\u00f4le de la r\u00e9ception au profit d\u2019une hypertrophie du p\u00f4le de la donation.\r\n\r\n",

Using ideas of territory and place as loci for understanding how territorial regimes are constructed and contested, the analysis opens the scope of displacement to explore its temporal and affective dimensions. Re-conceptualising displacement as an intricate loss of place, and with it, the loss of values, identities, livelihoods, and meanings imbued in spaces, can help clarify the complex geographies of suffering wrought by extractive logics, which may imperil peace-building projects. \n\nThis conference paper is based on my MSc dissertation research.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55792248, "asset_id": 35911828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12025976, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "Faciolince", "domain_name": "lse", "page_name": "MariaFaciolince", "display_name": "Maria Faciolince", "profile_url": "https://lse.academia.edu/MariaFaciolince?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12025976/3455469/8877139/s65_maria.faciolince.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3472, "name": "Political Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Anthropology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16047, "name": "Extractive industries (Economic Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extractive_industries_Economic_Anthropology_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16106, "name": "Anthropology of Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Development?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17067, "name": "Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internally_Displaced_Persons_IDPs_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 18496, "name": "Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mining?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 23931, "name": "Political Ecology (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology_Anthropology_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36008, "name": "Internal Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 47006, "name": "Development Induced Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Induced_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 47642, "name": "Accumulation by Dispossession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Accumulation_by_Dispossession?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 80317, "name": "Coal Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coal_Mining?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 132796, "name": "Anthropology of Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Mining?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 171274, "name": "Development and Dispossession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_and_Dispossession?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 362556, "name": "Extractive industries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extractive_industries?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 686083, "name": "Post Extractivismo Y Derechos De La Naturaleza", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Extractivismo_Y_Derechos_De_La_Naturaleza?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 771982, "name": "Extractivismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extractivismo?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 878538, "name": "Proceso De Paz En Colombia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Proceso_De_Paz_En_Colombia?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 30695982, "title": "Migration and the Search for Home: Mapping Domestic Space in Migrants' Everyday Lives", "created_at": "2017-01-01T08:13:26.026-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30695982/Migration_and_the_Search_for_Home_Mapping_Domestic_Space_in_Migrants_Everyday_Lives?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_30695982", "summary": "Home is usually perceived as what placidly lies in the background of everyday life.

How (if at all) a sense of home relies on a dwelling place, on an intimate relationship, on memories of the past or on aspirations for the future \u2013 and what difference this makes in practice \u2013 are the questions underlying the migration-home nexus as an emerging research field. From an apparently intimate and domestic concern, home, or the search for it, turns into a major public question. It raises claims, conflicts and dilemmas which should not go unnoticed. An original map of migrants\u2019 ways of homing, over space and time, is then necessary.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51140892, "asset_id": 30695982, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4308065, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Boccagni", "domain_name": "unitn", "page_name": "PaoloBoccagni", "display_name": "Paolo Boccagni", "profile_url": "https://unitn.academia.edu/PaoloBoccagni?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4308065/2806980/18323385/s65_paolo.boccagni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7261, "name": "Domesticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domesticity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15928, "name": "Domestic Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Space?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17497, "name": "Sociology of Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Everyday_Life?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 96320, "name": "Dwelling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dwelling?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 190143, "name": "Home-Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home-Making?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 24703965, "title": "\u201cI Feel Proud to Be an Immigrant\u201d: How a Youth Program Supports Ibasho Creation for Chinese Immigrant Students in the US (Routledge, 2016)", "created_at": "2016-04-24T01:50:30.390-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24703965/_I_Feel_Proud_to_Be_an_Immigrant_How_a_Youth_Program_Supports_Ibasho_Creation_for_Chinese_Immigrant_Students_in_the_US_Routledge_2016_?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_24703965", "summary": "This chapter examines the ways in which \u201cCYLP,\u201d a Chinese immigrant youth program run jointly by a community-based organization and high school, supports creating Ibasho (a Japanese concept of places where one feels comfortable and accepted) for 18 first generation Chinese immigrant high school students in the United States.

It is suggested that extended leisure travel can provide exposure to varied cultural praxes that may contribute to a sense of social saturation. Whilst a minority of the respondents embraced a saturation of personal identity in the subjective formation of a cosmopolitan cultural identity, several of the respondents were paradoxically left with more identity questions than answers as the result of their travels.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: identity work; leisure travel; lifestyle; cosmopolitanism; identity confusion\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 4568255, "asset_id": 293082, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 231617, "first_name": "Scott", "last_name": "Cohen", "domain_name": "surrey", "page_name": "ScottCohen", "display_name": "Scott Cohen", "profile_url": "https://surrey.academia.edu/ScottCohen?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/231617/51224/10374802/s65_scott.cohen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1711, "name": "Sociology of Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Tourism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4017, "name": "Recreation & Leisure Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Recreation_and_Leisure_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 7236, "name": "Backpacker Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Backpacker_Tourism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 21557, "name": "Lifestyle & Consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lifestyle_and_Consumption?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 162366, "name": "Lifestyle Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lifestyle_Mobilities?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 43900109, "title": "On the question of \"Where is Home?\"", "created_at": "2020-08-19T15:21:19.517-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43900109/On_the_question_of_Where_is_Home_?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_43900109", "summary": "For many migrants home is felt and lived in multiple geographical and social locations.

Can we long for a home we never occu-pied? After we leave, does it continue to inhabit us? Is it possible to feel at home and out of place within the same space, to be simultaneously rooted and displaced? This article explores such questions in the context of women's struggles within political, legal, social, and cultural homes. It is based on a qualitative analysis of narratives by Modern Orthodox Jewish activists who fight for Jewish women's right to divorce within Israel's Rabbinic Courts (Beit Din).\n\nThis paper conceptualizes \u201cat home\u201d and \u201cdisplaced\u201d as mutually constituted theoretical signifiers that are not limited to the idea of territorial or spatial dislocation. We propose a consideration of home making and displacement as conceptually interrelated, potentially simultaneous lived experiences, and as political strategies of socio-cultural change. We present a narrative study of religious women activists\u2019 embodied experiences in Israel\u2019s Rabbinic Courts (IRC). The IRC is a contentious religious national institution accorded sole power over Jewish citizens\u2019 marriage and divorce by the democratic secular State. We explore how the IRC and other interconnected \u201chouses\u201d shape the Jewish-Israeli collective. We critically examine how these spaces are underpinned by gendered power relations and produce gendered dis/belongings. We examine how the \u201cthe Jewish home\u201d is critically transformed by religious women inhabiting the IRC and how this space transforms them. Our case-study suggests that being \u201cat home\u201d and \u201cdisplaced\u201d can be experienced simultaneously within the same space. We understand them to be processual, interactive and culturally contingent experiences. Building upon notions of a \u201choming desire\u201d and the \u201cunhomely\u201d, we highlight the vital role of imagining as a transformative political act.

examines the impacts of the Arab Uprisings (2010 \u2013 ongoing) on Palestinians both inside and outside of the Middle East and North Africa through the narratives of 46 Palestinians interviewed in France, Sweden and the United Kingdom between 2012 and 2014. Through an analysis of Palestinians\u2019 personal, familial and collective experiences of violence and dispossession both in the near diaspora (in particular in Libya and Syria) and in the far diaspora (in Europe), the article highlights the centrality that these Palestinians give to their relationship to different \u2018home-spaces\u2019, including their Palestinian homeland and European host-society, but also a variety of \u2018home-camps\u2019 which they, their extended families, and broader refugee communities, have inhabited in the Middle East. Furthermore, the article highlights that Palestinians have been involved in a range of spaces of political activism since the start of the Uprisings\u2014spaces that might or might not physically overlap with either the Palestinian homeland or with their European host-society. By emphasizing the social and political meaning that Palestinians in the diaspora hold for spaces that fall in between their historic homeland and the current host-society, we argue that a politico-spatial expansion is key to understanding the ways in which Palestinians who are outside not only of their homeland but also of their region of origin have been affected by the Arab Uprisings.

Jung pointed out that our collective culture mirrors an individual who is suffering deeply from soul loss. The general apathy that appears so rampant in our culture may derive from dread and a deep despair we all carry that lives just under the surface and our inability to deal effectively with the trauma.

More than half of the population of Syria has been forced to flee their houses. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in December 2017 accounted for more than six and a half million, more than a third of the total of population of Syria in 2011 (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), 2012. http://www. inter nal-displ aceme nt.org/middl e-east-and-north -afric a/syria /). Displaced Syrians have experienced constraints in getting adequate housing for the short- and mid-term inside and outside the country. However, internal displacement, in particular, adds a dimension to the complex notion of mass sheltering. Sheltering policies, or lack thereof, as well as the shelter itself as a design and construction product all express the power of those who govern more than the aspirations of those who inhabit. Affected groups find solutions by themselves, via national or international organisations, or a combination of both. However, such solutions function under the influence of authorities controlling the area in which IDPs are received. Among the alternatives available to displaced communities, this paper reviews two cases of internally displaced families in Syria: a collective centre in government-controlled Damascus (schools) and a planned camp in Afes village in a rebel-held area near Idlib.

I will focus on examples that occurred within spaces that have been influenced, dominated or administrated by the Portuguese, and I will argue that this displacement has contributed to setting up an imaginary concept concerning those spaces, as well as to the designated Portuguese Colonial Empire. The human displacements I will focus on were stimulated by the propaganda produced by the Estado Novo (New State), in particular between the 1930s and the 1960s. My argument was inspired by the movie script of O Feiti\u00e7o do Imp\u00e9rio (\u201cThe Spell of the Empire\u201d), a film directed by Ant\u00f3nio Lopes Ribeiro in 1940, in which, at the end, one of the characters \u2014named Vitorino\u2014 states emphatically: \u201cWe, the Portuguese and the sea, are like you and me. And being in Africa, it is like being in Beira or in Alentejo\u201d. The defence of the theory that the Portuguese people can be in Africa or in any of the provinces of the metropolis synthesizes an idea conveyed by the colonial propaganda during the Estado Novo, which included the thought that the tropics comprised similar elements to the ones also existing in Portugal, encouraging the departure of people from the metropolis to the colonies, or places under Portuguese influence, and the displacement to and from some of these colonies or areas administrated by the Portuguese. On the other hand, an idea that has been very widely conveyed by the media outside the academic circle, but, surprisingly, also by academics, is that the Portuguese colonization took place as an original, innovative and humanistic process. For example, some authors extoled the adaptive capabilities of the Portuguese to distant places and their inhabitants. Furthermore, it is also common to find some preconceived ideas, such as that the Portuguese colonization was different and \u201cgood\u201d for those who were under its administration.",

These displacements bring about different conceptualizations of home and belonging during pivotal stages of identity formation in military brats. For those that were constantly on the move during childhood, a sense of belonging and home prove more elusive. Severing ties one adds another variable when trying to define the self, since defining self is always in relation to others. Where do we brats call home? Does a military brat struggle with belonging? Do military brats identify with the concept of home as a traditional geographically rooted civilian? My goal is not to provide answers, rather to evoke feelings that have often been silenced and call attention to our social experience and complicated identity. This is an autoethnographic representation of the military brats who were identified through self-declaration, surveys, interviews, and observations of web group forums. Based on the questions posed to military brats by civilians upon their arrival in a new setting, it is well understood that civilians view home differently. Findings suggest that military brats conceptualize home not as a rooted and established geographical position. Home and belonging are bounded to relationships. This hybrid text of creative nonfiction, poetry, vignettes and statistical data as a mirror for understanding the military brats\u2019 social position as a group with particular kinds of experiences.

Although politically important , overemphasis on strategic aspects of wartime sexual violence can be misleading. Alternative explanations tend to understand rape either as exceptional a departure from 'normal' sexual relationships-or as part of a continuum of gendered violence. This article shows how, even in war, norms are not suspended; nor do they simply continue. War changes the moral landscape. Drawing on ethnographic research over 10 years in northern Uganda, this article argues for a re-sexualization of understandings of rape. It posits that sexual mores are central to explaining sexual violence, and that sexual norms-and hence transgressions-vary depending on the moral spaces in which they occur. In Acholi, moral spaces have temporal dimensions ('olden times', the 'time of fighting' and 'these days') and associated spatial dimensions (home, camp, bush, village, town). The dynamics of each help to explain the occurrence of some forms of sexual violence and the rarity of others. By reflecting on sexual norms and transgressions in these moral spaces, the article sheds light on the relationship between 'event' and 'ordinary', rape and war.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58874756, "asset_id": 38784963, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26321580, "first_name": "Holly", "last_name": "Porter", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "HollyPorter", "display_name": "Holly Porter", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/HollyPorter?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26321580/7976047/18297526/s65_holly.porter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 954, "name": "Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Anthropology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 4424, "name": "Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-conflict_Reconstruction_and_Development?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 4801, "name": "Sexual Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_Violence?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14943, "name": "Social Norms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Norms?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17067, "name": "Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internally_Displaced_Persons_IDPs_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28981, "name": "Ethnic Conflict and Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict_and_Civil_War?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36677, "name": "Rape Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rape_Culture?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 63231, "name": "Rape as a Weapon of War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rape_as_a_Weapon_of_War?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1025498, "name": "Gender Violence and Military Rape", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Violence_and_Military_Rape?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1195619, "name": "Rape and Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rape_and_Violence?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 30943416, "title": "Constructions of 'home' among first generation migrants living in Belgium and England", "created_at": "2017-01-16T02:08:17.332-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30943416/Constructions_of_home_among_first_generation_migrants_living_in_Belgium_and_England?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_30943416", "summary": "The aim of this chapter is to explore the variety of ways in which the idea of \u2018home\u2019 is created amongst first generation migrant groups, especially those who are ageing in place in deprived urban neighbourhoods. This chapter draws upon approaches which aim to understand the experiental dimension of older people\u2019s relationships with home and the environment (Chaudhury and Rowles, 2005; Rowles and Bernard, 2013). In this perspective, the concept of \u2018home\u2019 involves the development of emotional attachments and feelings of belonging to particular places that result in a sense of familiarity and comfort, and is closely related to well-being. Following this, the meaning of \u2018home\u2019 is not only related to the physical place but may involve symbolic constructions of Heimat (Huber and O\u2019Reilly, 2004) \u2013 \u2018spaces of belonging\u2019 (and identity) at different geographical scales \u2013 the local, national or transnational communities in which people think of themselves of \u2018feeling at home\u2019 (Morley, 2001).

Taking Lebanese immigrants\u2019 forms of identification, community attachments and cultural expression as manifestations of diaspora experiences, Dalia Abdelhady delves into the ways members of Lebanese diasporic communities move beyond nationality, ethnicity and religion, giving rise to global solidarities and negotiating their social and cultural spaces.\n\nThe Lebanese Diaspora explores new forms of identities, alliances and cultural expressions, elucidating the daily experiences of Lebanese immigrants and exploring new ways of thinking about immigration, ethnic identity, community, and culture in a global world. By criticizing and challenging our understandings of nationality, ethnicity and assimilation, Abdelhady shows that global immigrants are giving rise to new forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.",

via the digital age is upon us, demanding a new ethics and an intercultural awareness while the dialectics of globalism and cyberspace mandate a committed reflection on what the synthesis between the digital realm and global citizenship entails. In many ways, the borders that previously separated us as citizens physically and culturally have begun to dissipate, replaced by a call for an intercultural accountability and a form of global citizenship that, on one hand, surpasses borders, patriotism, and nationalism alike, but while on the other, demands an understanding and respect for the cultural idiosyncrasies among us, acknowledging the unique existential paradox of universal citizenship that posits each of us as both stranger and citizen on a commonly shared globe.\r\n\r\nWhat is cosmopolitan in the digital age? Is a global digital citizen the same as merely a digital citizen? While talk of digital citizenship has increased in recent years, usually centered on a capitalist drive, encouraging a full electronic participation in society and a responsibility to digital commerce, many questions remain unanswered.  Is the netizen the citizen of a democratic state, and of digital democracy? As a citizen of the world interacting online, how will one\u2019s \u201crights\u201d and \u201cduties\u201d be determined? And are these \u201crights\u201d universal, and in such a case, what does \u201cuniversal\u201d mean? What are the legal parameters of netizenship, and what will they be as globalization further takes hold? Is democracy critical to citizenship, or is it not? What are the political landscapes of global citizenship in the digital age? And last of all, is the concept of digital citizenship even tangible? Is it real?\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35178471, "asset_id": 8837870, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1776652, "first_name": "Jared",

the start of the occupation of Palestine in 1967, Israel has demolished approximately 27,000 Palestinian structures, most of which are family homes. Porteous and Smith (2001) coined the word domicide to mean the intentional destruction of one\u2019s home by another, which causes distress to those who have become displaced. Domicide, or even the possibility that one\u2019s home may be destroyed, causes significant psychological effects; nevertheless, we only know generally what these effects are and we know even less about the effects on children and families as a social system. Drawing from  qualitative place-based research with 18 Palestinian families, this paper explores how loss of home or the threat of loss of home affects their everyday lives. After providing an overview of the factors that lead to domicide\u2014Israel\u2019s \u201cmatrix of control\u201d and the proliferation of illegal Israeli settlements in Palestine\u2014the paper describes the effects of domicide or the threat of domicide on Palestinian children and families and how they resist domicide through sumud (steadfastness). The paper concludes with recommendations to conceptualize home as a human right, and correspondingly, include domicide as a human rights\u2019 violation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34320774, "asset_id": 7818234, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 193650, "first_name": "Bree", "last_name": "Akesson", "domain_name": "wlu-ca", "page_name": "BreeAkesson", "display_name": "Bree Akesson", "profile_url": "https://wlu-ca.academia.edu/BreeAkesson?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/193650/46446/5794987/s65_bree.akesson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1909, "name": "Family studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3454, "name": "Children and Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children_and_Families?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4421, "name": "Homelessness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homelessness?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6184, "name": "Israel/Palestine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel_Palestine?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 6693, "name": "Palestine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palestine?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 10342, "name": "Political Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Violence?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17067, "name": "Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internally_Displaced_Persons_IDPs_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 19031, "name": "Geographies of Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographies_of_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 21507, "name": "Homelessness And Housing Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homelessness_And_Housing_Exclusion?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 21639, "name": "Children's Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_Rights?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36008, "name": "Internal Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 54533, "name": "Children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 99705, "name": "Displaced Persons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displaced_Persons?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 361488, "name": "Forced migration and displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_migration_and_displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 5343979, "title": "When German Children Come \u2018Home\u2019: Experiences of (re-)migration to Germany \u2013 and some remarks about the \u2018TCK\u2019-issue, in: Kn\u00f6rr, J.

The new insights to architectural phenomenology discourse lie in film\u2019s making visible of the invisible, as pointed out by film theorists: \u201ccinema disintegrates familiar objects and brings to the fore \u2013 often just in moving about \u2013 previously invisible interrelationships between parts of them\u201d (Kracauer, 1960); \u201cthe film experience uniquely opens up and exposes the inhabited space of direct experience as a condition of singular embodiment and makes it accessible and visible to more than a single consciousness who lives it\u201d (Sobchack, 1991).\r\n\tWhat this paper calls \u201cmoving images of home\u201d are not mere depictions of familiar spaces, but hypostases of these images in which sensorial perception is interwoven with memories and emotional associations, as Bergman puts it: \u201cI can still roam through the landscape of my childhood and again experience lights, smells, people, rooms, moments, gestures, tones of voice and objects. These memories seldom have any particular meaning, but are like short or longer films with no point, shot at random\u201d. In this context, the space of the childhood home is taken as a spatial experiential matrix, to which all later understandings of places relate; therefore, the discussion will revolve around two film makers with an acute awareness for the sense of place, Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007) and Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986), who have both worked extensively on depicting their childhood, while a closer look reveals infusions of these architecturally-situated memories on the spatiality of home places even in their non-autobiographical productions.\r\n\tThe paper\u2019s discourse situates the two artists at opposing poles. The Swedish Bergman is renowned for treating the interior of home in films in terms of tensions and emotions translated in big close-ups of the artists\u2019 facial expressions, meanwhile, the Russian Tarkovsky deals with mostly the same existential topics, but has a completely different answer and expresses these domestic atmospheres, emotions and conflicts in terms of architectural, profoundly sensorial characteristics of space. Tarkovsky would say: \u201cjuxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, relating a person to the whole world \u2013 that is the meaning of cinema\u201d. Nevertheless, their films are not characterized by either large open spaces, nor by placeless bodies in anonymous surroundings, instead narratives unfold and are framed in spaces imbued with a sense of home. Therefore, this sense of home, of the familiar, becomes a mediation between the two opposing approaches, and traces a movement from body to space, with all its intricate nuances, a movement reflecting the fundamentals of architectural phenomenology.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30692509, "asset_id": 2703421, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2042702, "first_name": "Ruxandra", "last_name": "(Kyriazopoulos) Berinde", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RuxandraKyriazopoulosBerinde", "display_name": "Ruxandra (Kyriazopoulos) Berinde", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RuxandraKyriazopoulosBerinde?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2042702/671592/4906396/s65_ruxandra.berinde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5178, "name": "Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14640, "name": "Architectural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_Theory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 22778, "name": "Ingmar Bergman Films", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ingmar_Bergman_Films?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28083, "name": "Andrei Tarkovsky", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andrei_Tarkovsky?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 42042, "name": "Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 841891, "title": "Where and When is Home?

However, feeling at home is positively associated with the location's connectedness to Ecuador. The importance of social relations (especially inviting friends) and infrastructural characteristics for feeling at home in a place also increases over time, contrary to the influence of nostalgic homeland reminders.

Turkish people in Vienna create a collective sense of belonging and position themselves in a complex web of diasporic relations, through the materiality and aesthetics of their homes. It aims to show how the efforts of displaced people to construct a belonging to the new place of dwelling are intertwined with the aesthetic and material practices of making homes. Based on ethnographic research, it will be argued that a particular \u201cTurkish home\u201d is collectively created through shared aesthetic practices and discourses and serves as a material and social medium both for imagining and building collectivities and for constructing and expressing ambiguities, conflicts, multiplicities and contests, played out in the aesthetics of the everyday. Challenging the common view that homes in diasporic or migratory resettlements reflect past lives and locations or a mixture of two cultures and two sets of different objects associated with them, it will be argued that Turkish homes in Vienna are made through a new and particular aesthetic, which serves to produce and reproduce a communal Turkish narrative of migration to and dwelling in Vienna.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64381205, "asset_id": 44041391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17853065, "first_name": "\u00d6zlem", "last_name": "Sava\u015f", "domain_name": "europa-uni", "page_name": "\u00d6zlemSava\u015f", "display_name": "\u00d6zlem Sava\u015f", "profile_url": "https://europa-uni.academia.edu/%C3%96zlemSava%C5%9F?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17853065/47283822/36270705/s65__zlem.sava_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7773, "name": "Everyday Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Everyday_Aesthetics?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19035, "name": "Turkish migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkish_migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 3056122, "name": "Home culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_culture?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 38804746, "title": "Narratives of a Fractured Trust in the Swedish Model: Tenants' Emotions of Renovation", "created_at": "2019-04-14T05:37:12.913-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38804746/Narratives_of_a_Fractured_Trust_in_the_Swedish_Model_Tenants_Emotions_of_Renovation?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_38804746", "summary": "Research shows there is a current wave of housing renovation in Swedish cities, where private as well as public rental housing companies use \"renoviction, \" or displacement through renovation, as a profit-driven strategy. This article focuses on emotions and renoviction, in particular the emotions of tenants currently facing forced renovations, in Sweden. We discuss how power is reproduced and questioned , and illustrate methods used by housing companies to carry out extensive renovation. The following questions have guided our analysis: What kinds of emotions are evoked among tenants experiencing an extensive, top-down and costly renovation? What particular injustices and violations are identified by the tenants in this situation? How can these violations be understood in relation to the current housing policy? Our research is qualitative and builds on semi-structured interviews with tenants as well as extensive ethnographic work in a neighborhood undergoing renovation, followed by steeply increased rents. We use the metaphor of \"fractured trust\" to conceptualize the emotional reaction of tenants, and argue that citizens\u00b4trustcitizens\u00b4trust in the Swedish welfare system is being broken locally, in the wake of ongoing top-down renovation processes, by use of a rationality that does not take into consideration tenants' perspectives and needs. We conclude that anxiety, angst, anger, and loss, attached together in a common feeling of shock, were the most prevalent emotions expressed and were described by tenants as a response to unfair treatment. In the interviews, a complex set of violations performed by the housing company in a renoviction neighborhood is brought to the forefront here, and set in this context of systemic violence exerted against tenants in contemporary Sweden.

It is particularly concerned with the ways in which interrelated issues of belonging, community identity, and social diversity were negotiated during the anti-dam campaign. As an unusual alliance of farmers, environmentalists, urban retirees, some Aboriginal people and others, it takes a view of the anti-Traveston Crossing Dam campaign as a fluid network of people and approaches the notion of community identity as the symbolic construction of similarity. Locally specific, the paper describes pertinent aspects of community politics in the context of rural socioeconomic change, and the mobilisation of heritage. With regard to local senses of belonging, it also discusses the involvement of Aboriginal people during the campaign. More \r\nbroadly then, this paper attempts to make an ethnographic contribution to the study of environmental disputes and the politics of alliance in peri-urban areas of settler-descendant \r\nsocieties such as Australia.

The study of lifestyle offers a lens through which to study the kinds of moorings, dwellings, repetitions and routines around which mobilities become socially, culturally and politically meaningful. Bringing together scholars from geography, sociology, tourism, history and beyond, the authors illustrate the breadth and richness of mobilities research through the concept of lifestyle. \r\nOrganised into four sections, the book begins by dealing with aspects of bodily performance through lifestyle mobility. Section two then looks at how we can use mobile methods within social research, whilst section three explores issues surrounding ideas of mobility, immobility and belonging.

As our fieldwork with Ecuadorian migrants in Europe and their left-behind counterparts shows, remittance houses are more than investments, or resources for migrants' emotional attachment and dreams of return. They are also central to the negotiation of class, status and belonging, and to the very interplay between housing and home along the course of migration. As 'agents' in themselves, these houses shape the transnational connections between distant and disparate places, and the circulation of home-related ideas and practices across them. Over time, they embody a variety of meanings and expectations that, unlike the buildings, are far from fixed or immobile.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68660257, "asset_id": 50793745, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4308065, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Boccagni", "domain_name": "unitn", "page_name": "PaoloBoccagni", "display_name": "Paolo Boccagni", "profile_url": "https://unitn.academia.edu/PaoloBoccagni?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4308065/2806980/18323385/s65_paolo.boccagni.jpg"}, {"id": 137112616, "first_name": "Luis Eduardo", "last_name": "Perez Murcia", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LuisEduardoPerezMurcia", "display_name": "Luis Eduardo Perez Murcia", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LuisEduardoPerezMurcia?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/137112616/50546579/38576715/s65_luis_eduardo.perez_murcia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17439, "name": "Ecuador", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecuador?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 54939, "name": "Remittances", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remittances?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1028140, "name": "Homemaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homemaking?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 49283998, "title": "My lost Lithuanian home: An autobiographical essay on belonging and not belonging", "created_at": "2021-06-18T09:52:10.607-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49283998/My_lost_Lithuanian_home_An_autobiographical_essay_on_belonging_and_not_belonging?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_49283998", "summary": "This Working Paper can be accessed in full here: https://erchoming.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/ homing-wp_robin-cohen_pb.pdf \nThe paper is posted on a site called HOMinG which has many resources on the themes of belonging, migration and identity.

While theorists have identified the resultant mode of cultural hybridity as transculturalism(Vauclair, 2014), and home is across disciplines accepted as a \u201cmultidimensional concept\u201d resulting in a \u201cproliferation of writing on the meaning of home\u201d (Mallet, 2004: 1), for a constantly growing population of said transcultural individuals the question of home is far from scholarly. Growing cultural complexity is rapidly becoming the \u201cnew normal\u201d, as is the predicament of modern homelessness vocalized by Simon Malpas as having no and yet too many homes. (Malpas, 2006.) \nThis thesis pursues understanding and insight into the ways in which both 'home\u2019 and \u2018belonging\u2019 may be achieved, regained, and meaningfully maintained \u2013 or lost \u2013 in an era dominated by dislocation, using J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings as the primary source. The novel offers a diverse range of case-studies: individuals, groups, cultures and their homes/homelands \u2013 and with the support of the Appendices and other auxiliary material by Tolkien is optimally suited for the purposes of this study both in scope and subject matter. This being a TCK-reading, the operating premise is that home and belonging are not reduceable to one another. The concepts are parallel: the processes of home-making correlating to and complementing the processes that establish belonging. Neither is dislocation categorically antithetical to either home or belonging. The high-mobility lifestyle characteristic to the TCK experience producing an awareness of endings, goodbyes and leaving as being an inseparable part of the cycle. \nIn this study the overarching concept of \u2018home\u2019 has been divided into three sub-categories: the \u2018idea of Home\u2019, the \u2018homeplace\u2019 and the feeling of being \u2018at home\u2019. Representing the culturally transmitted image of home as it should be, the locatable area with defined boundaries identified as home, and the side of home-being characterized by a sense of belonging, respectively. Belonging, in turn, is approached both as an experience, as in the sense of belonging, and as an action: a performed process of commitment and identification.\nThe first half of this thesis deals with the question of homeplace and belonging from the point of view of a collective identity. This is done through the analysis of three homelands and their corresponding peoples: the Shire, Moria and Rivendell. In the Shire, I recognize a rendering of a nation-state, in which dislocations of the pre-historic past have been all but forgotten in favor of the current localized identity. Hence my analysis of the Shire is largely centered on the politics of identity narrative building: including the streamlining of history into an official narrative, and the systematic separation from the Other as part of strengthening internal cohesiveness. Moria, or Khazad-d\u00fbm, functions as the localized anchor of the Dwarven identity, the mythical home of origin, the long-lost homeland for which they long and to which they strive to return to. This portion of the analysis juxtaposes the Legacy of Home with the lived experience it: contrasting Moria as it is remembered by the Dwarves with the available \u201chistorical\u201d records, lore and memories, and with the present reality of it, as experienced by the Fellowship of the Ring. The final homeland, Rivendell presents an alternative model to the traditional home \u2013 one feels like home and functions like home to many, while neither demanding nor offering a permanent claim on its residents. It is a \u201cthird space\u201d, neither Elven nor Mortal, one that embraces the flux of change and transience as part of its identity instead of fighting against the increasingly dislocated and/or transcultural reality of its time. The analysis of Rivendell focuses on the inner interplay between its founding purpose, values and their execution, giving recognition to the strengths and weaknesses induced by the aforementioned lack of permanence. \nThe second half of this thesis analyzes the individual TCK experience through the examples of Frodo and Aragorn. It explores the effects of dislocation during their formative years on their identity, behavior, sense of belonging and relationships. Following their development throughout the novel, Frodo and Aragorn appear as counter-narratives. Frodo\u2019s is the cautionary tale of unhealthy coping mechanisms, namely self-sufficiency, and undealt grief: the cycle of trauma and self-isolation chipping at his already fragmented identity until he essentially fades out from existence. In comparison, Aragorn\u2019s is the story of unification: his quest for the throne and a unified of kingdom simultaneously a quest for a unified self, his growing following a tribute to his cross-cultural skills as well as to his ability to belong to multiple people, places, and roles at once. \nBy formulating and comparing the processes through which the collective ideas of Home and Belonging are constructed: what role location and dislocation play in regards to group identity, how are the geographical and social boundaries drawn, what are the narratives justifying them, and how these compare them to the lived experience of natives and/or visitors; this study hopes to uncover the factors that make home sustainable even in the face of past, present and future dislocation. The character studies explore the significance of individual intent and when it comes to the pursuit home. They map out the steps through which belonging can be cultivated in comparison to the behaviors that disallow it, particularly those stemming from unresolved trauma and underdeveloped emotional skills.\n\nKeywords\nHome, belonging, dislocation, Third Culture Kids, trauma, identity, Tolkien\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65731413, "asset_id": 45155274, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 136674098, "first_name": "Roseanna", "last_name": "Babashkina", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RosinkaBabashkina", "display_name": "Roseanna Babashkina", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RosinkaBabashkina?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/136674098/36306969/44555755/s65_roseanna.babashkina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73661, "name": "Transculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transculturalism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 426492, "name": "Tolkien Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tolkien_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2254235, "name": "Applied Literary Theory and Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Literary_Theory_and_Criticism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43905142, "title": "'Bhonsle' : Of Home and Belonging, Fathers and Sons, God and Man", "created_at": "2020-08-20T06:24:08.803-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43905142/Bhonsle_Of_Home_and_Belonging_Fathers_and_Sons_God_and_Man?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_43905142", "summary": "An analysis of Devashish Makhija's film 'Bhonsle' \n\nhttps://thepunchmagazine.com/culture/entertainment/bhonsle-of-home-and-belonging-fathers-and-sons-god-and-man?fbclid=IwAR1Rtp9XqtW7QMYHQtxWEHCesI3otEHNu2WBZq_ZhuqHuaO_egQXe3hbxeU", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64228879, "asset_id": 43905142, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7506837, "first_name": "Rituparna", "last_name": "Sengupta", "domain_name": "ashokauniversity", "page_name": "RituparnaSengupta", "display_name": "Rituparna Sengupta", "profile_url": "https://ashokauniversity.academia.edu/RituparnaSengupta?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7506837/16563989/16887363/s65_rituparna.sengupta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3301, "name": "Film Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Analysis?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 146932, "name": "Mumbai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mumbai?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 828913, "name": "Fathers and Sons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fathers_and_Sons?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 41027057, "title": "Bicentenaries and belonging: Public heritage of the lower Blue Mountains and the politics of place attachment", "created_at": "2019-11-22T21:31:56.684-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41027057/Bicentenaries_and_belonging_Public_heritage_of_the_lower_Blue_Mountains_and_the_politics_of_place_attachment?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_41027057", "summary": "This photo essay explores some of the meanings of belonging, place\nattachment, community and heritage within my local community of the\nlower Blue Mountains, on the urban fringe to the west of Sydney,\nAustralia.

The ruin is understood as the penultimate stage before the remains of the home are totally erased through demolition. In place of only understanding the ruined home as rubbish that needs removal this chapter suggests that the ruin offers a time and place, usually through the practice of fossicking, for the re-imagining and re-connection of the material house and the emotionally produced home. As a ruin, the colonial practices of settlement through home-making come to be more clearly seen as the \u2018cleared block\u2019 becomes the ideal unpopulated site upon which people can build again and again. In a related way the other material elements of home such as the environment and climate it works within and the forces of the more-than-human that act with it come to be seen and felt through the body as a ruin. The contemporary home as ruin ultimately suggests an understanding of home/house as a feral thing of singular form. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48610506, "asset_id": 28281182, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9094892, "first_name": "Katrina", "last_name": "Schlunke", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "KatrinaSchlunke", "display_name": "Katrina Schlunke", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/KatrinaSchlunke?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9094892/3461612/42433315/s65_katrina.schlunke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3407, "name": "Environmental Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11483, "name": "Cultural Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Memory?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 42234, "name": "Natural Disasters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_Disasters?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 24210927, "title": "A Critical Approach to Hannah Arendt\u2019S Concept of Worldliness and its Applicability in the Social Sciences", "created_at": "2016-04-08T08:33:04.359-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24210927/A_Critical_Approach_to_Hannah_Arendt_S_Concept_of_Worldliness_and_its_Applicability_in_the_Social_Sciences?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_24210927", "summary": "This article will explain and critically examine Hannah Arendt\u2019s concept of worldliness with the aim of clarifying its limitations when it is used in the context of the social sciences, particularly where understanding and contributing to solving the problem of the forced displacement of people are concerned.

Her ideas regarding the worldliness of tribes and stateless people will be discussed and criticized, together with her avoidance of considering the relevance of oral history and oral resources and her position on human rights.

"summary": "This introductory paper to this special issue of Housing Studies questions whether various characteristics of the debate and research on gentrification, displacement and restructuring justify a largely negative perspective on the processes and outcomes of \u2018forced\u2019 residential relocation. We argue that a proper and fuller consideration of issues around policy, context, process and outcomes enable researchers and commentators to avoid ready characterisations and self-fulfilling investigations of restructuring which serve to present it as a singular (and somewhat suspicious or conspiratorial) phenomenon. For this purpose, we present a broad conceptual framework for restructuring and relocation studies, based on these four themes. Subsequently, we review major issues in restructuring and gentrification discourses, and briefly reflect upon some of the factors underlying the negative loading of the term displacement. We also identify caveats in the evidence base of relocation studies, both in the United States and in Europe. Finally, we introduce the papers in this special issue. The overall aim of this issue is to offer a more open, balanced starting position for analysis of urban restructuring processes and relocation outcomes, particularly in relation to areas of social housing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38333177, "asset_id": 12924010, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32097131, "first_name": "Reinout", "last_name": "Kleinhans", "domain_name": "tudelft", "page_name": "ReinoutKleinhans", "display_name": "Reinout Kleinhans", "profile_url": "https://tudelft.academia.edu/ReinoutKleinhans?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32097131/9716704/16677883/s65_reinout.kleinhans.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6422, "name": "Urban Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Regeneration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7455, "name": "Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19031, "name": "Geographies of Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographies_of_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47281, "name": "Social Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Housing?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56707, "name": "Residential Relocation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residential_Relocation?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 68838, "name": "Public Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Housing?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 2018983, "name": "Neighbourhood Restructuring", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neighbourhood_Restructuring?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 11547733, "title": "Nano-media and connected homeliness", "created_at": "2015-03-20T06:08:35.281-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11547733/Nano_media_and_connected_homeliness?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_11547733", "summary": "This article explores how digital communication platforms influence the everyday life of migrants in transnational milieus and how they shape the migrants\u2019 sense of home.

The project is a portable, netless (without an Internet connection) Wi-Fi network, a free access unlocked digital platform, transmitting within the urban environment of various cities during a series of specific time periods and events. The artists carry the network through space and time, as an unrevealed, private, performative act within the realm of the public urban space, leaving only temporary transmitted digital traces/data within the vicinity of the transmission range, thus producing interactions and exploring the boundaries between the private and the public, the physical and the digital space and challenging the notion of surveillance in urban environments. New action patterns are introduced, which look into new ways of performing the physicality of the body within a digital nomadism.

interdisciplinary approach, speaking to current themes in anthropology, archaeology, history, historical geography, cultural studies, migration studies, tourism studies, Scottish studies, Paul Basu explores the journeys made to the Scottish Highlands and Islands to undertake genealogical research and seek out ancestral sites.\r\n\r\nUsing an innovative methodological approach, Basu tracks journeys between imagined homelands and physical landscapes and argues that through these genealogical journeys, individuals are able to construct meaningful self-narratives from the ambiguities of their diasporic migrant histories, and recover their sense of home and self-identity.\r\nThis is a significant contribution to popular and academic Scottish studies literature, particularly appealing to popular and academic audiences in USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Scotland.\r\n\r\n\u2018\u2026 in integrating and drawing upon work within both anthropology and geography, he takes

It is within this context that an examination of the meaning of home is relevant. For home tends to represent a beloved and \u201csafe\u201d place for children in families in the context of political violence. Yet, as this paper illustrates, the meaning of home is much more complicated, and can be both positive and negative. Drawing\r\nfrom qualitative research with 18 families living in Palestine, home is first considered as a positive physical space, or a castle, for families affected by occupation and political violence. As a castle, home serves as (1) a site of family practices, (2) a center of identity, and (3) a place of protection. Secondly, this paper will conceptualize home as a cage for many of these same families, exploring (1) the unhealthy conditions that families live in, (2) the lack of privacy that characterizes many homes, and (3) the feeling that one is a prisoner within one\u2019s home. The paper ends by suggesting how practitioners and policymakers can better understand children and families multiple meanings of home in order to encourage the positive and mitigate the negative elements of home.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33905589, "asset_id": 6554381, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 193650, "first_name": "Bree",

Durante este periodo se entablan nuevas maneras de hacer pol\u00edtica, de luchar por su autonom\u00eda y de apropiarse de su historia.\nMientras hacen el rescate cultural-identitario, la comunidad se enfrenta a varios temas relacionados a ese rescate, como por ejemplo, cu\u00e1les son elementos que definen mejor la cultura Jaguaribarense, y c\u00f3mo se define la identidad del grupo \u00bfQui\u00e9nes son y como se representa su comunidad? \nEl proceso de organizaci\u00f3n de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Vecinos en torno a objetivos como la vivienda, servicios p\u00fablicos, infraestructura agraria y preservaci\u00f3n de sus bienes y patrimonios culturales, implicaba la inserci\u00f3n de sus miembros en la v\u00eda de la acci\u00f3n social.

Design/methodology/approach-This paper extends the understanding of the role of ethnic solidarity networks on the labour market participation of migrants with insecure legal status. It draws on data from a questionnaire survey of 178 Iraqi-Kurdish migrants with insecure legal status, four focus groups and ten expert interviews. Working conditions and sectors of employment are explored alongside strategies for accessing work and the role of ethnic solidarity networks. Findings-The analysis of the data provides strong support for the theoretical expectations outlined above, assuming that the conflict-generated diaspora communities display a very distinct solidarity among its members, embedded in a shared history of conflict, persecution and identity struggles. Ethnic solidarity is put to the ultimate test in times of intensified enforcement of employment and immigration law. It stretches to accommodate the risks that employers take to provide work to their insecure co-ethnics, facing the tangible threat of raids, business closure, defamation and colossal fines, to mention but a few. In this context, the authors have defined \"stretched solidarity\" as a form of support and resource sharing among certain conflict-generated ethnic groups, embedded not only within a shared history of displacement, collective memory and trauma, and shared culture, language, loyalties, obligations and experiences but also in the \"reception context\", which may limit ethnic solidarity through restrictive immigration controls. Research limitations/implications-The authors recognise the limits of the paper, which are that analysis is mainly based on experiences of the majority of whom were young and male migrants with insecure migration legal status, rather than employers. Social implications-This paper has identified the social phenomenon of \"stretched solidarity\" and has set out a model for understanding its embeddedness within conflict-generated diasporic networks. By drawing together research insights and data on Iraqi-Kurdish migrants with insecure legal status, it addressed the central research question how \"unauthorised\" migrants get access to the segmented labour market at a time of increased in-border controls in the UK. Originality/value-The paper contributes towards an enhanced understanding of the complex phenomenon of \"stretched solidarity\" and its role in migrants' gaining access to and maintaining employment in the host labour market. The notion of \"stretched solidarity\" developed here provides a platform for identifying a number of emerging areas for further empirical study and policy thinking. This requires advanced research not only into the processes of migrants' access to the host labour market but also into the role of ethnic networks, resources and structures that enable migrants in precarious situations to survive.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60591558, "asset_id": 40346076, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 235032, "first_name": "Dr Janroj Yilmaz", "last_name": "Keles", "domain_name": "mdx", "page_name": "Drjanrojkeles", "display_name": "Dr Janroj Yilmaz  Keles", "profile_url": "https://mdx.academia.edu/Drjanrojkeles?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/235032/51695/47612/s65_dr_janroj_yilmaz.keles.jpg"}, {"id": 3196937, "first_name": "Eugenia", "last_name": "Markova", "domain_name": "brighton", "page_name": "EMarkova", "display_name": "Eugenia Markova", "profile_url": "https://brighton.academia.edu/EMarkova?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3196937/45827141/35609089/s65_eugenia.markova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5548, "name": "Kurdish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12570, "name": "Undocumented Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undocumented_Immigration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28981, "name": "Ethnic Conflict and Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict_and_Civil_War?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 39474, "name": "Kurdistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdistan?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 118798, "name": "Politics of Solidarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Solidarity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 134693, "name": "Refugees and Forced Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees_and_Forced_Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 200092, "name": "Kurdish migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 524619, "name": "Ethnic Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Networks?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 618870, "name": "Ethnicity and Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Social_Capital?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 800551, "name": "Kurdistan Regional Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdistan_Regional_Government?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1884152, "name": "Ethncity and migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethncity_and_migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 3378523, "name": "Stretched solidarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stretched_solidarity?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 35977656, "title": "Leary-Owhin (2018) Rebuttal Proof of Evidence Aylesbury Estate Compulsory Purchase Order London Borough of Southwark Public Inquiry January/April", "created_at": "2018-02-21T04:59:15.855-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35977656/Leary_Owhin_2018_Rebuttal_Proof_of_Evidence_Aylesbury_Estate_Compulsory_Purchase_Order_London_Borough_of_Southwark_Public_Inquiry_January_April?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_35977656", "summary": "This rebuttal proof is a response to several proofs of evidence submitted by objectors at this public inquiry.

displacement have focused on our attachments to large-scale places, like cultural homelands or countries.  The aim of this essay, in contrast, is to attract attention to a kind of displacement that is under-examined in philosophy: moving home. In this article, I sketch an account of the harms of displacement from one\u2019s home.  Using insights from the philosophy of mind, I explain how moving house can be burdensome for individuals and families on multiple cognitive levels, because the home serves as part of our extended mind.  The essay proceeds by first, defending the claim that a decrease in cognitive functionality is a pro tanto, extrinsic harm.  Next, I use extended mind theory to explain how we can outsource cognitive functionality to our home environments.  Third, I employ this theory to explain how moving home could upset cognitive functionality.  Fourth, I highlight how vulnerable people, those without financial security or social stability, may be more susceptible to experience the harms of moving house than non-vulnerable people.  Finally, I suggest that this research can be a beneficial addition to the philosophical debate on displacement.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56603379, "asset_id": 32747578, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76508, "first_name": "Cara", "last_name": "Nine", "domain_name": "ucc-ie", "page_name": "CaraNine", "display_name": "Cara Nine", "profile_url": "https://ucc-ie.academia.edu/CaraNine?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76508/21166/2233097/s65_cara.nine.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 813, "name": "Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Philosophy?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4421, "name": "Homelessness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homelessness?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10191, "name": "Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Justice?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10498, "name": "Extended Mind", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extended_Mind?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14580, "name": "Forced Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 22547, "name": "Social and Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Political_Philosophy?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 36008, "name": "Internal Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 39673, "name": "Feminism and Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism_and_Social_Justice?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 47006, "name": "Development Induced Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Induced_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 134693, "name": "Refugees and Forced Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees_and_Forced_Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 361488, "name": "Forced migration and displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_migration_and_displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 546867, "name": "Gentrification and displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification_and_displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 794631, "name": "Social Psychology, Place Attachment, Place Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology_Place_Attachment_Place_Identity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1000347, "name": "Migration and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 29364040, "title": "CfP AAG 2017 for the paper session \"Affective Borderscapes: The Multiple Senses of State, Law and Technology at the Border\"", "created_at": "2016-10-23T06:41:57.768-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29364040/CfP_AAG_2017_for_the_paper_session_Affective_Borderscapes_The_Multiple_Senses_of_State_Law_and_Technology_at_the_Border_?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_29364040", "summary": "From the shores of Lesvos, Lampedusa and Nauru islands to the Indo-Pakistani fence; along the Israel-Palestine wall and across the Rio Grande; into the besieged Southern Damascus where hundreds perish of starvation trapped behind man-made lines and beyond, the intensifying plight of border-crossing populations has progressively turned into a ghastly global spectacle of border enforcement, surveillance and control. This border spectacle utilizes affect as an intangible substance of politics and taps into the distribution of sentiment as a technology of state governance, legal production and promotion of specific political rationalities. Multiple agents (human, non/more-than-human, bureaucratic, state, corporate etc.) are engaged in this 'theatrialisation' of borders. Individually or collectively they are performing competing practical and symbolic borderwork from 'above' and from 'below' as they trespass, surveil, inhabit, regulate and de/construct borders and boundaries. Those actors' imaginaries, materialities and practices interlock and often clash within the 'manifold overlapping topologies' of emergent borderscapes that span scales from the global to the local, down to lines of distinction inscribed upon the 'geography closest in' \u2013 the body. In this light, this session seeks to bring the discussion of affect into critical debate with border studies and the anthropology of state and law. The session's theme is designed to be inclusive enough to solicit a wide range of applicants exploring multidimensional aspects of bordering practices from around the world. Researchers are invited to submit abstracts of ethnographically grounded accounts whose empirical scope includes-but is not restricted to-the investigation of state borders and traces affective intensities that erupt as bodies cut through lines of exclusion encountered at various scales, locations and domains.

We therefore examined how the institutional context of forced relocation affects displaced tenants\u2019 choice processes and strategies. The results of a qualitative analysis of interviews with 144 displaced tenants from five Dutch cities show that they can be considered active agents because they adopt different choice strategies. Nevertheless, the choice strategies and experienced freedom of choice differed between tenants who were confronted with different relocation regulations. The limits imposed by and the opportunities of institutional contexts steer the choice processes and strategies of displaced tenants, but are by no means deterministic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38348388, "asset_id": 12924017, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32097131, "first_name": "Reinout", "last_name": "Kleinhans", "domain_name": "tudelft", "page_name": "ReinoutKleinhans", "display_name": "Reinout Kleinhans", "profile_url": "https://tudelft.academia.edu/ReinoutKleinhans?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32097131/9716704/16677883/s65_reinout.kleinhans.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6422, "name": "Urban Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Regeneration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47281, "name": "Social Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Housing?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56707, "name": "Residential Relocation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residential_Relocation?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1786835, "name": "Housing Choice Optimization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Choice_Optimization?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1973352, "name": "Housing Allocation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Allocation?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 12080743, "title": "Learning from the In-Between Spaces of Filipina Immigrant Youth in Japan", "created_at": "2015-04-23T06:47:31.722-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12080743/Learning_from_the_In_Between_Spaces_of_Filipina_Immigrant_Youth_in_Japan?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_12080743", "summary": "This article examines the experiences of first generation Filipina immigrant girls and young women in Japan (ages 13-22) and explores the ways in which they enact human agency while experiencing multiple dimensions of inequality.

As young immigrant women in Japan, who often indicate that they are exceedingly displaced from home, school, and mainstream Japanese society, exploring the in-between spaces reveals otherwise unseen belonging, skills, and abilities and suggests ways to support the development of similar spaces in schools and communities where marginalized immigrant youth can thrive.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37402051, "asset_id": 12080743, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12305444, "first_name": "Tomoko", "last_name": "Tokunaga", "domain_name": "tsukuba", "page_name": "TomokoTokunaga", "display_name": "Tomoko Tokunaga", "profile_url": "https://tsukuba.academia.edu/TomokoTokunaga?f_ri=56160", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 79868, "name": "Immigrant youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_youth?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 109054, "name": "Out-of-school time & learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Out-of-school_time_and_learning?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 204223, "name": "Filipina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Filipina?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9852944, "title": "Reformulations of Muslim Identity Post 9/11", "created_at": "2014-12-21T07:00:49.089-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9852944/Reformulations_of_Muslim_Identity_Post_9_11?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_9852944", "summary": "A Study of Mohsin Hamid\u2019s The Reluctant Fundamentalist\n\nGeographical dislocations and cross-blending of cultures often necessitate traumatic experiences for the immigrants...", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21801624, "first_name": "Shirin", "last_name": "Bismillah", "domain_name": "roehampton-online", "page_name": "ShirinBismillah", "display_name": "Shirin Bismillah", "profile_url": "https://roehampton-online.academia.edu/ShirinBismillah?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21801624/6445173/92591803/s65_shirin.bismillah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 20012, "name": "Identity And Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_And_Culture?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25690, "name": "Migrant and Diasporic Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_and_Diasporic_Literature?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34611, "name": "Exile Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile_Literature?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102607, "name": "Immigrant Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_Literature?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 4974429, "title": "2013 - Regimes semi\u00f3ticos do pertencimento nas metr\u00f3poles contempor\u00e2neas", "created_at": "2013-11-03T02:37:47.506-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4974429/2013_Regimes_semi%C3%B3ticos_do_pertencimento_nas_metr%C3%B3poles_contempor%C3%A2neas?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_4974429", "summary": "O artigo prop\u00f5e um quadro te\u00f3rico fenomenol\u00f3gico e semi\u00f3tico para a inteligibilidade do sentido do pertencimento, um dos conceitos mais fundamentais nas culturas e sociedades atuais.

is about the children of Greek labour migrants in Germany. We focus on two life-stages of \u2018return\u2019 for this second generation: as young children brought to Greece on holidays or sent back for longer periods, and as young adults exercising an independent \u2018return\u2019 migration. We draw both on literature and on our own field interviews with 50 first- and second-generation Greek-Germans. We find the practise of sending young children back to Greece to have been surprisingly widespread yet little documented. Adult relocation to the parental homeland takes place for five reasons: (i) a \u2018search for self\u2019; (ii) attraction of the Greek way of life; (iii) the actualisation of the \u2018family narrative of return\u2019 by the second, rather than the first, generation; (iv) life-stage events such as going to university or marrying a Greek; (v) escape from a traumatic event or oppressive family situation. Yet the return often brings difficulties, disillusionment, identity reappraisal, and a re-evaluation of the German context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30613301, "asset_id": 1906656, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2426719, "first_name": "Jill", "last_name": "Ahrens", "domain_name": "mediaartscultures", "page_name": "JillAhrens", "display_name": "Jill Ahrens", "profile_url": "https://mediaartscultures.academia.edu/JillAhrens?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2426719/904870/6603383/s65_jill.ahrens.jpg"}, {"id": 16859200, "first_name": "Russell", "last_name": "King", "domain_name": "sussex", "page_name": "RussellKing", "display_name": "Russell King", "profile_url": "https://sussex.academia.edu/RussellKing?f_ri=56160", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8011, "name": "Intra-European Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intra-European_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 11001, "name": "Second generation identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_generation_identity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 13009, "name": "Modern Greece", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Greece?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 27475, "name": "Greek Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_Diaspora?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 50576, "name": "Germany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Germany?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 156351, "name": "Second generation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_generation?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 199120, "name": "Gastarbeiter", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gastarbeiter?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 245584, "name": "Hyphenated-identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hyphenated-identity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 364997, "name": "Return Migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migrants?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 399875, "name": "Guestworker programs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Guestworker_programs?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 453018, "name": "Narratives of return, exile, diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narratives_of_return_exile_diaspora?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 584292, "name": "Ancestral Return", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancestral_Return?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 585013, "name": "Greek-Germans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek-Germans?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 42135458, "title": "Appartenances et identifications \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve.

The analysis is based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Spain and Cuba. By focusing on disjunctures between the aspirations and positionings of returnees, and the way in which they are perceived and treated by their fellow nationals in Cuba, I show how identifications and belongings are played out, negotiated, and reframed in these return visits. The experience and assessment of relations with family, friends, and the country more generally leads migrants to rethink the parameters of their \u201cbeing Cuban\u201d and their place in Cuba. The analysis of such \u201ctests\u201d of returning sheds light on the important work of renegotiation of ideals and moralities that takes place, leading notably to the rearticulation and reworking of notions of \"Cubanness\", family, intimacy and economic practice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62271870, "asset_id": 42135458, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 117763, "first_name": "Valerio", "last_name": "Simoni", "domain_name": "graduateinstitute", "page_name": "ValerioSimoni", "display_name": "Valerio  Simoni", "profile_url": "https://graduateinstitute.academia.edu/ValerioSimoni?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/117763/31647/20956777/s65_valerio.simoni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 910, "name": "Anthropology of Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Tourism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3725, "name": "Cuban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cuban_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 275682, "name": "Anthropology of migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_migration?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 39709193, "title": "Immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia: A Sense of Belonging and Acceptance in the New Social Environment", "created_at": "2019-06-27T06:36:48.623-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39709193/Immigrants_from_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_in_Croatia_A_Sense_of_Belonging_and_Acceptance_in_the_New_Social_Environment?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_39709193", "summary": "According to the 2011 census, among the 584,947 people born abroad who live in Croatia\n70 per cent were born in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H).

It focuses on the experiences of both gentrifiers and long-term residents of a neighbourhood, including those displaced. The housing pathways approach is framed around a combination of the theory of the habitus as interpreted by Bourdieu and phenomenological philosophy. Findings are based on a case study area of neighbourhoods close to a recent mass transit line extension, where two new stations were built. The study consisted of in-depth interviews with households living in the condominiums, in the neighbourhood, and in cases outside of the neighbourhood if they had been displaced from the area. There were also in-depth interviews with individuals from estate agencies, development companies, the Bangkok planning department, and the national low-cost housing provider. The research contributes to knowledge by adding to the literature on housing pathways. This is achieved through employing the concepts of the structural and biographical habitus and using vignettes to bridge these two approaches. It also contributes to knowledge by adding to the literature on gentrification, finding that although contextual factors must be considered, the theories developed in the West can provide significant insights when applied to neighbourhood change in Bangkok. The first key finding is that housing pathways have been shown to be complex in nature, influenced by traditional values but intertwined with emerging cultural shifts within contemporary Thai society. Another key finding of this study is that gentrification is intrinsically linked to aspects of mobility and proximity, similar in nature to the gentrification in the West seen by those as driven by practical considerations. Like in the West, it has also been found that social mixing between the new and old populations is limited and that displaced households and those in insecure tenurial positions suffered significantly in dealing with gentrification and attempting to resettle if they had been forced to move.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 89480559, "asset_id": 38722221, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14658607, "first_name": "Russell", "last_name": "Moore", "domain_name": "shu", "page_name": "RussellMoore", "display_name": "Russell D Moore", "profile_url": "https://shu.academia.edu/RussellMoore?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14658607/4218785/5730616/s65_russell.moore.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7455, "name": "Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23797, "name": "Phenomenology (Research Methodology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_Research_Methodology_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30259, "name": "Bourdieu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bourdieu?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47006, "name": "Development Induced Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Induced_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 95023, "name": "Ontological Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ontological_Security?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 199671, "name": "Bangkok", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 209664, "name": "Mass Transit Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mass_Transit_Systems?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 274448, "name": "Mass Rapid Transit and Light Rapid Transit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mass_Rapid_Transit_and_Light_Rapid_Transit?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 545354, "name": "Spatial Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Capital?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 565794, "name": "New-Build Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New-Build_Gentrification?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 3188599, "name": "Housing Pathways", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing_Pathways?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 34988538, "title": "Mater Omnium \r\nA study of belonging, care and social change in superdiverse Italy", "created_at": "2017-10-29T04:01:14.418-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34988538/Mater_Omnium_A_study_of_belonging_care_and_social_change_in_superdiverse_Italy?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_34988538", "summary": "Crisis can be considered a context in the modern European narrative, as economy, mass-migrations and environmental factors create a superdiverse, ever shifting social and cultural pavement.

The film, one of the first to be seen as part of the \u2018nov\u00edsimo cine chileno\u2019, shows the unravelling of a wealthy family from Santiago in their beachside house, and draws explicit connections between the organization of the household and that of the Chilean nation. Ten years later, Pablo Larra\u00edn\u2019s El club demonstrated equal ferocity in its denunciation of the crimes of the Catholic church itself, and did so in a strikingly similar setting: an isolated house on the Chilean coast, home to priests guilty of child sexual abuse and other crimes.\n \nThis paper suggests that the persistence of the figure of the household on the edge, at the verge of destruction, points to the complexity and incompleteness of the task which Lelio\u2019s and Larra\u00edn\u2019s films seem to set themselves: that of dismantling the nexus of relations between religion, territorial authority and familial intimacy which, in these accounts, operates in Chile. The analysis engages with Giorgio Agamben\u2019s work on the Christian foundations of oikonomia and with recent critiques of Carl Schmitt\u2019s Nomos of the Earth (for instance by Gareth Williams), as well as focusing on the films\u2019 formal characteristics.

In order to understand the conditions that preceded the Tension better, I draw on ethnographic fieldwork, archival research and an analysis of court records to examine some of the shifts in land tenure arrangements occurring from the 1950s onwards. While land disputes are often approached as contests over economic resources, I suggest that the arguments mobilised before the courts reveal the profoundly epistemological or ontological challenges that urbanisation raises.

Exclusionary practices span scales from the global to the local, down to lines of distinction inscribed upon the \u2018geography closest in\u2019 \u2013 the body.\r\n\r\nIn this light, this session seeks to ethnographically approach the dynamic practices of emplacement and displacement today, as well as illuminate the technologies and tactics permeating a multitude of current exclusionary policies and measures. We wish to identify today\u2019s \u2018undesirables\u2019 \u2013with a special focus on those found in urban settings\u2013 and foreground their narratives and lived experiences. As migrants, refugees, \u2018Travelers\u2019, people of color, the homeless, children, and the urban poor \u2013among others- struggle to take space and make place for themselves under the pressures and paradoxes of uneven urban geographies, they claim the centre ground and threaten, even if imperceptibly, social hierarchies impinged on space.\r\n\r\nTwo questions thus emerge: what commonalities and shared logics can be revealed through the study of narratives and the lived experiences of people subjected to a range of different social and spatial exclusionary processes; and how do the everyday practices of various actors produce, reproduce, sustain or contest these contemporary exclusionary dynamics?\r\n\r\nThe session\u2019s theme is designed to be inclusive enough to solicit a wide range of applicants. Researchers are invited to submit abstracts that broadly serve to feed into the discussion of narratives and lived experiences of social and spatial exclusions, such as, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Narratives of emplacement and displacement\r\n- Intersecting inequalities: Gender, class, ethnic, and spatial dynamics in cities that contribute to urban exclusion \r\n- Contestations over place and space\r\n- The sense of border between self and \u2018other\u2019\r\n- (Im)material urban boundaries and frontiers \r\n- Lived experiences of exclusion and marginalization\r\n- Strategies and technologies of forced relocation \r\n- The commodification and marketable representation of the urban poor and their spaces\r\n- The growing dissociation between border functions and border locations\r\n- The murky backside of gentrification\r\n- Renovation and eviction processes\r\n- Social categories/mechanisms by which inequalities are constituted, legitimized, questioned, and tackled in diverse societies\r\n- Political subjectivity and contestation in urban settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaper Submissions:\r\nTo submit a paper proposal, please submit the following, in the order listed below, all in a single Microsoft word file or pdf document, by Thursday October 15th 2015:\r\n\r\n1. Applicant\u2019s name, affiliation, and contact information.\r\n2. Paper abstract of no more than 250 words.\r\n3. Brief bio-sketch of 200-300 words.\r\n\r\nPlease email complete applications to Emil Pull at emil.pull@mah.se. Questions or clarifications prior to abstract submission should be directed to the same email address.\r\n\r\nSuccessful applicants will be contacted by the 20th of October 2015 and will be expected to pay the registration fee and submit their abstracts online at the AAG website by October 29th 2015.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38649261, "asset_id": 15352855, "asset_type": "Work",

As with so many other fields, the associated debate has witnessed the perception of a gap between policy and research among both researchers and policymakers. Using four examples, this paper argues that this perception of a gap fails to reflect properly what is happening in the interchange between research and policy. Drawing on a broader typology of the use of research in policy-making (Stevens, 2007), the paper shows that the relationship is more complex and critically highlights the role of researchers herein. Moreover, ignoring or \u2018cherry-picking\u2019 of research by policymakers does not necessarily reflect a lack of relevance, which is a fundamental discussion within current geography research. The four discussed examples are: ambivalent outcomes of relocation research, the selection of renewal target areas, potential negative spillover effects on other areas, and the stubbornness of the concept of social cohesion in policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38342194, "asset_id": 12924012, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32097131, "first_name": "Reinout", "last_name": "Kleinhans", "domain_name": "tudelft", "page_name": "ReinoutKleinhans", "display_name": "Reinout Kleinhans", "profile_url": "https://tudelft.academia.edu/ReinoutKleinhans?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32097131/9716704/16677883/s65_reinout.kleinhans.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 43632, "name": "Demolition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Demolition?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47281, "name": "Social Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Housing?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56707, "name": "Residential Relocation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residential_Relocation?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60827, "name": "Social cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_cohesion?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 84925, "name": "Urban Restructuring", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Restructuring?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 1243561, "name": "Spillover Effect", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spillover_Effect?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 14265841, "title": "EUROPEAN CITIZENSHIP OR NARROW NATIONALISMS?

2013 general elections in Kenya entailed no recurrence of the 2007-08 post-election violence. Closer examination at the local level, though, indicates that the experiences of violence continue to influence the social sphere. Divisions between a long-established population and newcomers are blatant especially at places with high levels of immigration. This paper addresses how experiences of violent conflict over identitary and territorial belonging affect and transform socio-spatial organisation. The analysis is based on an empirical study at one of the venues of the post-election violence, a poor and heterogeneous workers\u2019 settlement in Naivasha in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley. Naivasha area is internationally known for its horticultural production and massive labour immigration. After the 2007 elections, radical individuals of the local Kikuyu ethnic majority claimed Naivasha as their territory as a reaction to the displacement of Kikuyus from other parts of the country. Migrants of unwanted ethnic identity or political positioning were murdered or forcibly evicted from the place. Yet, due to poor job opportunities, especially in western Kenya, job seekers continue to migrate to Naivasha. \r\nThe repercussions of the violence are expressed in the lack of acceptance, on the part of the long-established population at the place, of the presence of labour migrants. Experiences of ethnicised prejudice, mistrust, and fear between the self-described autochthonous population and labour migrants are tenacious. Kikuyus perceive Naivasha as their place of refuge and are willing to defend it if necessary. Migrants barely develop feelings of belonging to Naivasha, seeking rather to enhance their own security during their stay at the place. This study illustrates that memories of the violence still regulate socio-spatial realities and reinforce and accelerate processes of spatial and societal division.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35059485, "asset_id": 7002304, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1795409, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Sakdapolrak", "domain_name": "univie", "page_name": "PatrickSakdapolrak", "display_name": "Patrick  Sakdapolrak", "profile_url": "https://univie.academia.edu/PatrickSakdapolrak?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1795409/800368/995979/s65_patrick.sakdapolrak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1697, "name": "Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8507, "name": "Rural-urban migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural-urban_migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 18892, "name": "Kenya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kenya?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 994175, "name": "Lake Naivasha Basin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lake_Naivasha_Basin?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 6857320, "title": "Chilean Women Making Home in London", "created_at": "2014-04-24T03:16:04.626-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6857320/Chilean_Women_Making_Home_in_London?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_6857320", "summary": "This research explores the process of \u2018making home\u2019 for Chilean women living in London from two different generations and diverse reasons for migrating: exiles from Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and women who were born during the dictatorship and moved to London more recently. This ethnographic approach of four women\u2019s homes holistically compares and explores this process through home possessions, everyday practices and representations about themselves and the societies to which they \u2018belong\u2019. This process involves challenges and inevitable change, since it means a continuous negotiation between adopting new cultural elements from the host country and maintaining elements from the country of origin. This study contributes to a better understanding of how migrants shape their material and cultural environments in order to refashion their identities and settle down. Yet, at the same time, it shows how the migrants themselves are shaped by the material environments they build and the cultural environment of the city, which leads to a process of selective identification with \u2018being Chilean\u2019 that is beneath their experiences of migration. Making a home provides not only a way to express themselves and materialize their hybrid identities, but also to materialize their social relationships, their belonging to Chile and above all, their integration into the host society.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 504331, "first_name": "Macarena", "last_name": "Bonhomme", "domain_name": "goldsmiths", "page_name": "MacarenaBonhomme", "display_name": "Macarena Bonhomme", "profile_url": "https://goldsmiths.academia.edu/MacarenaBonhomme?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/504331/174386/65167297/s65_macarena.bonhomme.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10767, "name": "Exile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 4737347, "title": "Fragmenting And Re-framing Bodies (Book chapter - Radical Research", "created_at": "2013-10-10T06:42:12.955-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4737347/Fragmenting_And_Re_framing_Bodies_Book_chapter_Radical_Research?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_4737347", "summary": "Chapter explores approaches to discourse analysis - structuralist, poststructuralist, Lacanian and Laclau-ian - in relation to thinking about the 'body', physical and abstract, real and virtual.

"work_3134661", "summary": "Monica Ali\u2019s 2003 novel Brick Lane depicts a Bangladeshi community living on a Tower Hamlets estate in East London. Despite the well-known public setting referenced by the novel\u2019s title, the majority of the story\u2019s action takes place within the intimate spaces of the home. However, the novel itself is often perceived as a document that opens up (unveils) a \u2018hidden\u2019 population to the view of the outsider. Members of the community depicted in the novel have publicly contested the accuracy of this unveiling, while literary critics have defended it on account of its fictionality. In this paper, I argue that the novel calls attention to the performative nature of both place and character, rendering suspect any claims of \u2018truth\u2019 about either Brick Lane or the people that inhabit it. \r\nWith reference to Judith Butler\u2019s assertion that gender is a practice of \u2018improvisation within a scene of constraint\u2019, I discuss the dual nature of the novel\u2019s protagonist Nazneen. Through the contrast between the character who speaks and acts and the voice that narrates her thoughts and observations, we are made aware that Nazneen is performing a role that allows her to be easily read by those around her. Similarly, the novel\u2019s setting contains this dual nature. There is the visible and knowable Brick Lane that can be easily consumed by outsiders but this serves to obscure the \u2018real\u2019 Brick Lane, which remains unknowable and inaccessible. By drawing a parallel between the performativity of the novel\u2019s protagonist and setting, I provide a new interpretation of the work\u2019s controversial reception.

Through the analysis of ethnographic material and the case of the displaced community of Jaguaribara, we argue that local political rituals function as meaning-making practices that affect the political visibility of women, through the manipulation of local gender ideologies and local perceptions of society and the environment. We further suggest that awareness of such a state of affairs and the pragmatic strategic use of cultural prescriptions do not grant a group political visibility, if this group does not find ways to act upon the semiotic configuration of the context where social actions unfold; that is, upon dominant local interpretive genres.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 4827766, "asset_id": 561963, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 423288, "first_name": "Ana Laura", "last_name": "Gamboggi Taddei", "domain_name": "senac", "page_name": "AnaLauraGamboggiTaddei", "display_name": "Ana Laura Gamboggi Taddei", "profile_url": "https://senac.academia.edu/AnaLauraGamboggiTaddei?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/423288/109512/260807/s65_ana_laura.gamboggi_taddei.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 98, "name": "Semiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Semiotics?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14966, "name": "Big Dams", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_Dams?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19031, "name": "Geographies of Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographies_of_Displacement?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 149329, "name": "Cear\u00e0", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cear%C3%A0?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 193158, "name": "Jaguaribara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jaguaribara?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 193162, "name": "Political visibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_visibility?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 72269906, "title": "Displacement and estate demolition: multi-scalar place attachment among relocated social housing residents in London", "created_at": "2022-02-22T17:48:23.533-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/72269906/Displacement_and_estate_demolition_multi_scalar_place_attachment_among_relocated_social_housing_residents_in_London?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_72269906", "summary": "The forced relocation\u2014displacement\u2014of social housing residents resulting from estate regeneration involving demolition has been the subject of considerable academic and policy debate.

This paper contributes to this debate, and to the wider \u2019post-displacement\u2019 research agenda, by providing an experiential perspective on residential relocation with reference to in-depth interviews with social housing residents in London who returned to new-build flats at the redeveloped mixed-tenure estates. The paper employs a multi-scalar approach to place attachment which is illustrated and analysed at three spatial scales: domestic (home/dwelling), intermediate (block of flats) and neighbourhood (estate).

My first claim that the motivation for this type of return is primarily emotional and, although the much researched (Brown, 2014) emotion of \u201cpatriotic love\u201d is certainly part of the returnees\u2019 emotional landscape, other emotions play an equal, and in some cases more important, role. Secondly, due to the emotionally motivated return, the returnees, many of whom are also dual citizens, possess a uniquely significant perspective on the theoretical concepts relevant to this thesis. The unifying conceptual framework of the study is citizenship, also seen as a \u201cprism through which to address the political\u201d (Nyers, 2007, p. 3), and more specifically its emotional dimension, which scholars have so far conceptualized through home and belonging. This perspective on citizenship builds on the foundations set by George Marcus, inspired by David Hume, who presents a treatise of the connection between citizenship and emotions, radically asserting that, contrary to the conventional view in political theory, emotions enable rationality and good citizenship, mainly because they foster democratic action. The emotional dimension of citizenship has been further theorized by geography scholars, such as Elaine Lynn-Ee Ho and Lucy Jackson, both of whom employ the concepts of home and belonging as instrumental to our understanding of citizenship. Although these concepts have been developed with contributions from feminist scholars, geographers, social psychologists and anthropologists, a thorough analysis of the theoretical connections between citizenship and emotions is still in its initial stages. Also, an analysis of the actual, specific and distinct emotions comprising home, belonging and the emotional dimension of citizenship, is gravely missing. Based on a qualitative study of 35 in-depth interviews conducted with members of the Bosnia and Herzegovinian diaspora/transmigrants, who have voluntarily decided to return and settle in BiH, I argue that, in the case of a post-conflict society, the emotional dimension of citizenship is not conceptualized as home and belonging, primarily due to the lack of security/safety provided by the state to its citizens and the inherent challenges of developing sustainable civic belonging. \n\nKeywords: emotional citizenship, home, belonging, return migration, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 887589, "first_name": "Aida", "last_name": "Ibri\u010devi\u0107", "domain_name": "ssst", "page_name": "AidaIbri\u010devi\u0107", "display_name": "Aida Ibri\u010devi\u0107", "profile_url": "https://ssst.academia.edu/AidaIbri%C4%8Devi%C4%87?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/887589/323698/28687603/s65_aida.ibri_evi_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3136, "name": "Qualitative methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_methodology?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6578, "name": "Emotions And Political Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions_And_Political_Theory?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9456, "name": "Emotions (Social Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions_Social_Psychology_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16421, "name": "Nvivo Based Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nvivo_Based_Qualitative_Research?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 64064, "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 535592, "name": "Citizenship identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_identities?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 40377825, "title": "The Shape of a Life", "created_at": "2019-09-17T16:23:19.768-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40377825/The_Shape_of_a_Life?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_40377825", "summary": "This experimental writing explores the meaning of home and belonging in the context of border, margins, and migration.

Although very significant, theirs is a lesser known history compared to the global impact of Holocaust memory. More recently, however, memoirs witnessing to Mizrahi (Middle Eastern Jewish) experiences have emerged within Western publishing houses as part of a post\u2010 September 11 shift in attention towards the Middle East. \n\nThis paper, as the final Oral Presentation of Stephanie's PhD candidature, provides an overview of her project \u2013Mizrahi Memoirs: History, Memory, and Identity in Displacement \u2013 which focuses on the English language life\u2010writing of Iraqi, Iranian, and Egyptian Jews displaced during the mid\u2010 to late\u2010twentieth century.

I initially assumed that speaking the same language as the writers whose works I study, and their ethnic community, would position me as a person sharing the same cultural knowledge, and allow me immediate access to research participants. Yet, the language I considered to be the major marker of ethnic identity exhibited multiplicity instead of unity of experiences, positions and conceptual worlds. Instead, gender, which I had considered a fluid and unstable category highly context\u00addependent especially in the migration framework, proved to be an important element of interaction and communication between myself and my research participants. I have learnt that it is critical for research on diaspora, including diaspora's literary cultures, to account for other identity markers that include me as a researcher into some Polish community groups while excluding from others.

This paper seeks to build on such work, by considering the effects that the expansion of the colonial homespace had on both the women expected to manage them, and those living in and around these homes, including the lands original owners.\r\n\r\nRethinking the idea of the frontier as a convergent boundary, this paper considers the tensions that resulted from these settlers seeking to make their houses feel \u201cat home\u201d, through gaining sense of control and familiarity over the land and pushing at the boundaries of the \"frontier\"; control and familiarity that often came to the detriment and exclusion of things that did not conform to this vision: the native landscape and Aboriginal people. Focussing on Anglophone female settlers in nineteenth-century Australia, this paper argues that in the process of creating a secure and stable home for their families, in many cases these colonists contributed to the creation of increasingly hostile homelands, which were marred with violence, dispossession and exclusion. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20765286, "first_name": "Felicity", "last_name": "Berry", "domain_name": "universityofsydney", "page_name": "FelicityBerry", "display_name": "Felicity  Berry", "profile_url": "https://universityofsydney.academia.edu/FelicityBerry?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20765286/8856281/11021931/s65_felicity.berry.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15928, "name": "Domestic Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestic_Space?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 14346815, "title": "Repossession: Material Absences, Affective Presences, and the Life-Resumption Labors of Bosnians in Britain  pp. 96-112(17)  Author: Ryan-Saha, Eleanor", "created_at": "2015-07-23T16:08:38.662-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14346815/Repossession_Material_Absences_Affective_Presences_and_the_Life_Resumption_Labors_of_Bosnians_in_Britain_pp_96_112_17_Author_Ryan_Saha_Eleanor?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_14346815", "summary": "Reflecting on ethnographic research undertaken in 2010\u20132011, I conceive of dispossession as fundamental to the individual and social experience of displacement for Bosnian former refugees residing in Britain.

Repossession is achieved through dynamic interplay between the affective influence of new material absences and presences. At the same time, it includes the reflexive construction of new rhetorical stances regarding materialism. I examine how the attainment of 'materially qualified life' through repossession contributes both to personal recovery and to the formation and consolidation of the British Bosnian diaspora.

Immigrants and their descendants are not definitively \u201csettled,\u201d but rather engage in an ongoing process of adaptation. In order to understand this process of settling, we must pay particular attention to immigrants not only as consumers, but as producers of culture, since artistic production provides a unique and nuanced perspective on immigrants\u2019 sense of home and belonging, especially within the multi-generational process of settling.

The material culture of home embodies both their experiences and migrant trajectory, and the process of integration into the host society, representing the continuum process of adjustment that they face in cultural, social and material terms. The results show that the ways in which migrants inhabit their homes are related to their processes of settling down,since through the material culture, the belonging to their two worlds, the one they came from and the one they settled into, is daily negotiated, generating the ambivalence of  being here and there simultaneously. Their homes become transnational, where emerges a cultural syncretism between two worlds that coexist: Peru is symbolized by photography and food, both of which allow the reproduction of their belonging and cultural identity, and Chile is represented by technological artifacts, which embody their sacrificing labour and courage, and allow them to feel part of the host society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32029636, "asset_id": 4699047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 504331, "first_name": "Macarena", "last_name": "Bonhomme", "domain_name": "goldsmiths", "page_name": "MacarenaBonhomme", "display_name": "Macarena Bonhomme", "profile_url": "https://goldsmiths.academia.edu/MacarenaBonhomme?f_ri=56160", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/504331/174386/65167297/s65_macarena.bonhomme.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=56160", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 13530, "name": "Chile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chile?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 17802, "name": "Diversity & Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity_and_Inclusion?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 19707, "name": "Social Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inclusion?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 43040, "name": "Home", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 43664, "name": "Cultural Identity and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 56410, "name": "Peruvian Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peruvian_Migration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 68523, "name": "Identidad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identidad?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 90609, "name": "Cultura Material", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultura_Material?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 134632, "name": "Migraciones Internacionales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migraciones_Internacionales?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 138336, "name": "Public and private spaces", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_and_private_spaces?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 176490, "name": "Migraci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migraci%C3%B3n?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 190143, "name": "Home-Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home-Making?f_ri=56160"}, {"id": 655997, "name": "Private Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Private_Space?f_ri=56160"}]}, {"id": 6922934, "title": "Self in the City: Radio Essay - Wisconsin Public Radio", "created_at": "2014-04-30T12:55:06.313-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6922934/Self_in_the_City_Radio_Essay_Wisconsin_Public_Radio?f_ri=56160", "dom_id": "work_6922934", "summary": "The ways we find and define a home depend on many different variables.

Este art\u00edculo explora y compara las vidas cotidianas y procesos de inserci\u00f3n, desde un enfoque de cultura material, de dos tipos de mujeres que vivieron su exilio en Inglaterra durante la dictadura de Pinochet: exiliadas retornadas y aquellas que a\u00fan residen en Inglaterra.

Los resultados desentra\u00f1an c\u00f3mo las memorias, experiencias y significados de hogar que emergen en el exilio se materializan cotidianamente en sus espacios privados e impactan sus procesos de integraci\u00f3n y, a su vez, c\u00f3mo sus identidades se van reconfigurando en el proceso de (re)construir sus hogares. Desde la experiencia del exilio, construir un hogar no es solo una forma de autoexpresi\u00f3n y materializaci\u00f3n de sus identidades, sino tambi\u00e9n les permite materializar sus memorias,
