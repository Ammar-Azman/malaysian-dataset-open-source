This also had impact on West Bengal, India as East Pakistan and West Bengal both shared the same linguistic and cultural heritage. Bengali race has a history of rich cultural and linguistic heritage and it first received its onslaught on race, culture and language when the state of Bengal was bifurcated by the British. It is regrettable that this onslaught on the language and culture continues still in post independent India. Today it faces hegemonic threats even in its own state from dominant languages such as Hindi and English. Employment opportunities, globalization, anglicised messaging and advertisements pose a threat to the importance as well as to its basic lexis. It is doubted whether an attempt to marginalise the culture, the base for any identity is at underplay. No proper linguistic policy either at the state or central level exists to prevent its degenerative indication. Why so? When Bengali is internationally recognised as a major language in the world, why is it not given the deserved respect in Her motherland. Although it is not as easy as it is said, but the promotion of multilingualism is needed at the level of policies and through academic curriculum in order to preserve the treasure inherent in the cultural repertoire of any linguistic identity or gradually languages might become redundant even to its user.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67616867, "asset_id": 49233021, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 178015334, "first_name": "Sohini", "last_name": "Dasgupta", "domain_name": "jawaharlalanehrunewdelhiindia", "page_name": "SohiniDasgupta", "display_name": "Sohini Dasgupta", "profile_url": "https://jawaharlalanehrunewdelhiindia.academia.edu/SohiniDasgupta?f_ri=636856", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/178015334/49307922/37760710/s65_sohini.dasgupta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=636856", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=636856", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 106029, "name": "Bengali Language & Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=636856", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 197283, "name": "Marginalisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marginalisation?f_ri=636856", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 636856, "name": "Discrimination on grounds of language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discrimination_on_grounds_of_language?f_ri=636856"}, {"id": 1125509, "name": "Postcolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonialism?f_ri=636856"}]}, {"id": 36845091, "title": "(2018) Language Policy, Linguistic Discrimination, and Thailand's Southern Impasse", "created_at": "2018-06-14T12:45:08.100-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36845091/_2018_Language_Policy_Linguistic_Discrimination_and_Thailands_Southern_Impasse?f_ri=636856", "dom_id": "work_36845091", "summary": "o credible claims can be made that the role of Malay has been entirely\r\noverlooked by those studying conflict dynamics in South Thailand.\r\nNevertheless, those concerned with religious factors dwarf the number of studies\r\ninterrogating issues related to language. Without suggesting that language\r\nrepresents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue\r\nthat anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand\u2019s southern\r\nimpasse must be more informed about language policy, linguistic justice, and how\r\nlinguistic repertoires are linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,
