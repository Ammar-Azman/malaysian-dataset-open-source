Vietnamese ceramics produced at Chu Dau kilns in Hai Doung province and Go Sanh kilns in Binh Dinh province were some of trade ceramics associated with Chinese Ming, Si Satchanalai ceramics exported for Ayutthaya Kingdom especially during the 15th to 16th centuries, which were found in shipwrecks, in-land cities and Buddhist temples around the middle of the peninsula represented the connection with maritime trade routes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54858708, "asset_id": 34994085, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 465031, "first_name": "Atthasit", "last_name": "Sukkham", "domain_name": "bu-th", "page_name": "AtthasitSukkham", "display_name": "Atthasit Sukkham", "profile_url": "https://bu-th.academia.edu/AtthasitSukkham?f_ri=515099", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/465031/154096/99826360/s65_atthasit.sukkham.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30723, "name": "Maritime Trade Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Trade_Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 166265, "name": "Ayutthaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayutthaya?f_ri=515099"}, {"id": 515099, "name": "Nakhon Si Thammarat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat?f_ri=515099"}, {"id": 677072, "name": "Binh Dinh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Binh_Dinh?f_ri=515099"}, {"id": 920795, "name": "Dai Viet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dai_Viet?f_ri=515099"}]}, {"id": 36256164, "title": "\u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0443\u0437\u044b \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b \u0433\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u0441\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430", "created_at": "2018-03-26T03:14:40.322-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36256164/%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85_%D0%B2_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B_%D0%B3%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B0_%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0?f_ri=515099", "dom_id": "work_36256164", "summary": "The conditional forms of a verb marking action which caused other action expressed by the main predicate of the sentence are presented in many languages. Researchers state the contradictory points of view concerning semantical-grammatical features of these forms in the Caucasian languages. In article we tried to define the place of the studied forms in the system of the Chechen verb and also their role in hypotaxical constructions.\nPrincipal and auxiliary means of expression of conditional semantics in the Chechen language are distinguished in the article. Thus, the most characteristic and frequent in use are the forms formed by the affixes -\u0127 and-\u0127\u0101r\u0103. In addition to them the following markers of conditional meanings are presented in the Chechen: the interrogative form of the indicative mood, the present-tense form with the -q particle, and the converb formed by adding the -\u010d\u0103 affix to one of the stem of the past.\nForms of verb ending with -\u0127 and -\u0127\u0101r\u0103, which are the main condition markers in polyclausal conditional sentences, are presented in different points in the works of scientists. Thus, some authors specify them as moods, others consider them as adverbial forms of a verb. Besides, there are contradictory views concerning the very type of sentences in which the forms function. Some linguists consider clauses formed around such forms as subordinate ones in a complex sentences, another point of view is advanced by the opponents of the theory of the developed hypotaxis in the Chechen language, distinguishing the subordinate conditional clauses as conditional non-finite construction.\nThe analyzed forms have some specific characteristics distinguishing them among the other converbs in Chechen language. Thus, they have category of absolute time and the own subject different from the subject of the main predicate. Forms of verb ending with -\u0127 and -\u0127\u0101r\u0103 differ from each other mainly on the basis of reality or unreality of the marked condition. Forms of verb with a suffix -\u0127 function as a predicate of a subordinate clause in the conditional sentences where the main predicate is a verb in the form of a future tense or the imperative. Not the alternative reality, but real-conditional one is expressed in such sentences. Forms on -\u0127\u0101r\u0103 function as a predicate of a subordinate clause as a part of the subjunctive sentence, marking alternative reality in all tense structure, often the time for the sentence is defined by a predicate of a subordinate clause.\nAnalysis of the grammatical and semantic features of the conditional forms in Chechen language allowed us to draw some conclusions on this question.\nIn our opinion, the developed taxis and subject-object relationships within the clause, predicated by conditional form, and also the nature of the relationship of this clause with the main clause in the structure of the polyclausal construction give us a reason to define these constructions as complex sentences.\nWe believe that it is unreasonable to define the conditional forms as forms of mood, by means of that the special meaning of these forms can\u2019t be considered as modal. A special function of the conditional form is the realization of the syntax connection between clauses as part of a complete conditional sentence. We haven\u2019t detected any other semantic, grammatical and modal functions or meanings at the forms. That is, the special formants -\u0127 and -\u0127\u0101r\u0103, forming conditional forms, are only the means of connection for parts of the sentence and on the grammatical meaning they are equivalent to the conjunctions.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56161311, "asset_id": 36256164, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51005942, "first_name": "Ayshat", "last_name": "Badaeva", "domain_name": "chesu", "page_name": "AyshatBadaeva", "display_name": "Ayshat  Badaeva", "profile_url": "https://chesu.academia.edu/AyshatBadaeva?f_ri=515099", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13347, "name": "Predication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Predication?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 95162, "name": "Grammar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grammar?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102356, "name": "Chechen language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chechen_language?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 181904, "name": "Converbs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Converbs?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 387632, "name": "Nakh languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nakh_languages?f_ri=515099"}, {"id": 515099, "name": "Nakhon Si Thammarat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat?f_ri=515099"}, {"id": 557615, "name": "Converb clauses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Converb_clauses?f_ri=515099"}, {"id": 1322896, "name": "Hypotaxis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hypotaxis?f_ri=515099"}]}, {"id": 49834960, "title": "Tourist Satisfaction in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province, Thailand: A Comparative Study", "created_at": "2021-07-12T20:30:38.155-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49834960/Tourist_Satisfaction_in_Nakhon_Si_Thammarat_Province_Thailand_A_Comparative_Study?f_ri=515099", "dom_id": "work_49834960", "summary": "The purpose of this study was to examine the difference in tourist satisfaction based on demographic characteristics among tourists who visited Nakhon Si Thammarat, a second-tier province in Thailand. A quantitative method was employed in which data were collected from 356 tourists using convenience sampling. Online-based self-administered questionnaires were distributed through social media platforms. Independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to evaluate hypotheses. There were significant differences in tourist satisfaction based on age, gender, educational level, and occupation. The findings imply that local business owners should serve tourists with appropriate attributes across various demographic groups. The study also provides important insights for researchers to further understand the differences in tourist satisfaction based on demographic variables. Particularly, government agencies and policy makers should recognize that there are differences in tourist satisfaction based on demographic characteristics. This study also contributes to the current literature as it extends the expectancy disconfirmation theory. Finally, this study highlights some limitations that open up avenues for future research.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68046453, "asset_id": 49834960, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 192818821, "first_name": "Asia Social", "last_name": "Issues", "domain_name": "wu-th", "page_name": "AsiaSocialIssues", "display_name": "Asia Social Issues", "profile_url": "https://wu-th.academia.edu/AsiaSocialIssues?f_ri=515099", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/192818821/55621454/70383120/s65_asia_social.issues.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69220, "name": "Tourist Satisfaction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourist_Satisfaction?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 515099, "name": "Nakhon Si Thammarat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nakhon_Si_Thammarat?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1963743, "name": "Demographic Characteristics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Demographic_Characteristics?f_ri=515099", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4022242, "name": "Thai tourists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_tourists?f_ri=515099"}]}]
