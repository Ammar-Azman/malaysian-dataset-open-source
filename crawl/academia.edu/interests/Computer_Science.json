DeepEX achieves this in a way that merges best of both worlds along with a reduction in the amount of data required to train these models. This direction has been explored in the past for single step forecasting by opting for a residual learning scheme.

LANs are characterized by higher communication and data transfer rates and the lack of any need for leased communication lines. Communication between remote parties can be achieved through a process called Networking, involving the connection of computers, media and networking devices. When we talk about networks, we need to keep in mind three concepts, distributed processing, network criteria and network structure.

For addressing the same, a few previous works perform phoneme specific modification in CLP speech. In CLP speech, both the articulation error and the nasalization distorts the intelligibility of a word. Consequently, modification of a specific phoneme may not always yield in enhanced entire word-level intelligibility. For such cases, it is important to identify and isolate the phoneme specific error based on the knowledge of acoustic events. Accordingly, the phoneme specific error modification algorithms can be exploited for transforming the specified errors and enhance the wordlevel intelligibility. Motivated by that, in this work, we combine some of salient phoneme specific enhancement approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness in improving the word-level intelligibility of CLP speech.

META-GLARE is thus a flexible and powerful vehicle for research about CIGs, since it supports easy and fast prototyping of new CIG systems.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81875097, "asset_id": 73302578, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33352421, "first_name": "Stefania", "last_name": "Rubrichi", "domain_name": "laborange", "page_name": "StefaniaRubrichi", "display_name": "Stefania Rubrichi", "profile_url": "https://laborange.academia.edu/StefaniaRubrichi?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 451, "name": "Programming Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Programming_Languages?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1432, "name": "Natural Language Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Natural_Language_Processing?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45213, "name": "Italy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italy?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 53293, "name": "Software", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 57939, "name": "Software Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Design?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 59587, "name": "Library and Information Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Library_and_Information_Studies?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 255453, "name": "Information Storage and Retrieval", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Storage_and_Retrieval?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 410370, "name": "Public health systems and services research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_health_systems_and_services_research-1?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 32955339, "title": "\u0412\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0456\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0439 \u043f\u0456\u0434 \u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0432\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0447\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443 \u044f\u043a \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0456\u0457", "created_at": "2017-05-11T05:12:38.294-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32955339/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D1%96%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%85_%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%96%D0%B9_%D0%BF%D1%96%D0%B4_%D1%87%D0%B0%D1%81_%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%87%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%83_%D1%8F%D0%BA_%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82_%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%97_%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%96%D1%97?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_32955339", "summary": "In the article the use of information technologies in an electoral process as an element of electronic democracy is investigated.

For this aim, an extensive experimental setup was designed in which three-dimensional ground reaction forces and sagittal plane kinematic as well as kinetic parameters were collected from 151 subjects.

The use of smart computational methods in the life cycle of drug design is relatively a recent development that has gained much popularity and interest over the last few years. Central to this methodology is the notion of computational docking which is the process of predicting the best pose (orientation + conformation) of a small molecule (drug candidate) when bound to a target larger receptor molecule (protein) in order to form a stable complex molecule. In computational docking, a large number of binding poses are evaluated and ranked using a scoring function. The scoring function is a mathematical predictive model that produces a score that represents the binding free energy, and hence the stability, of the resulting complex molecule. Generally, such a function should produce a set of plausible ligands ranked according to their binding stability along with their binding poses. In more practical terms, an effective scoring function should produce promising drug candidates which can then be synthesized and physically screened using high throughput screening process. Therefore, the key to computer-aided drug design is the design of an efficient highly accurate scoring function (using ML techniques). Methods: The methods presented in this paper is specifically based on ML techniques. Despite many traditional techniques have been proposed, the performance was generally poor. Only in the last few years started the application of the ML technology in the design of scoring functions; and the results have been very promising.\nMaterial: The ML-based techniques are based on various molecular features extracted from the abundance of protein-ligand information in the public molecular databases, e.g., protein data bank bind (PDBbind).\nResults: In this paper, we present this paradigm shift elaborating on the main constituent elements of the ML approach to molecular docking along with the state-of-the-art research in this area. For instance, the best random forest (RF)-based scoring function (Li, 2014) on PDBbind v2007 achieves a Pear- son correlation coefficient between the predicted and experimentally deter- mined binding affinities of 0.803 while the best conventional scoring function achieves 0.644 (Cheng, 2009). The best RF-based ranking power (Ashtawy, 2012) ranks the ligands correctly based on their experimentally determined binding affinities with accuracy 62.5% and identifies the top binding ligand with accuracy 78.1%.\nConclusions: We conclude with open questions and potential future research directions that can be pursued in smart computational docking; using molecular features of different nature (geometrical, energy terms, pharmacophore), advanced ML techniques (e.g., deep learning), combining more than one ML models.\nKeywords:\nmachine learning, random forest, support vector machine, drug discovery, computational docking, scoring function, virtual screening, complex binding affinity, ligands ranking accuracy, force field interaction, pharmacophore fingerprint.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39825375, "asset_id": 18007104, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37877592, "first_name": "Walid", "last_name": "Gomaa", "domain_name": "ejust", "page_name": "walid_gomaa", "display_name": "Walid  Gomaa", "profile_url": "https://ejust.academia.edu/walid_gomaa?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37877592/10632393/11942071/s65_walid.gomaa.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10408, "name": "Support Vector Machines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Support_Vector_Machines?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10640, "name": "Drug Discovery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drug_Discovery?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59654, "name": "Computer-Aided Drug Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer-Aided_Drug_Design?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 70037, "name": "Virtual screening", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_screening?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 70995, "name": "Random Forest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Random_Forest?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 166266, "name": "Docking Scoring Function", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Docking_Scoring_Function?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 170056, "name": "Random Forests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Random_Forests?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 191289, "name": "Support vector machine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Support_vector_machine?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 230896, "name": "Computational Docking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computational_Docking?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 275091, "name": "Computer Aided Drug Designing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Aided_Drug_Designing?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 357523, "name": "Support Vector Machines (SVMs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Support_Vector_Machines_SVMs_?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 395890, "name": "Molecular Docking and Virtual Screening", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Molecular_Docking_and_Virtual_Screening?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 638101, "name": "Bioinfrmatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioinfrmatics?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 970019, "name": "Support Vectort Machines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Support_Vectort_Machines?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1342831, "name": "Random Forest Models", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Random_Forest_Models?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1702038, "name": "random forest (RF)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/random_forest_RF_?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2225815, "name": "Binding affinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Binding_affinity?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2225855, "name": "Force field interaction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Force_field_interaction?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2225856, "name": "Ligand ranking accuracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ligand_ranking_accuracy?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2225858, "name": "Pharmacophore fingerprint", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacophore_fingerprint?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 79627949, "title": "Industrie 4.0 by Siemens", "created_at": "2022-05-22T00:07:03.290-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79627949/Industrie_4_0_by_Siemens?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_79627949", "summary": "The digital disruption is to transform all industries, leading to new business models based on the new technologies.

They have the potential to influence the user&amp;#39;s experience. This can be done by choreographing each area in a building in order to give a person different perceptions when going through those areas. We experience any visual frame as we pass through a built space and view it in relation to the neighboring frame. At the same time, we do not simply see them when moving via a space, but even our senses are also engaged in the space perception process. They are driving our front ward motion unintentionally and our unintentional pauses. As we pass through a construction, we see the various components of the building unfold. One needs to decipher the various layers that articulate these spaces in order to address the kinesthetic factor. The order of spaces not only controls the direction of motion and the pattern of motion, but also indicates that an individual pauses or continues. Many experiences are felt because of the sequential emergence of various spaces when going through Indian traditional architecture. These observations are not accidental but are the result of conscious design decisions. But the concept of kinesthetics is ignored as an incidental phenomenon if we focus at contemporary architecture. Architects have some goals that they tackle any project with. Among them, the user experience is typically given the least importance, even though it is the most vital issue. The opportunity for buildings built with sound kinesthetics is to construct a human environment that is conducive to its inhabitants.

We realized that though many such systems were available, not many had the capability of providing a video feed via an IP along with triggering an alarm and so forth using a mobile device. The present systems in the market are quite expensive and use too advanced technologies which require specialist installation and maintenance. Mobile integration is also not as optimized as it should be. Therefore our main goal in this research was to \u201cintegrate\u201d all these features and build a coherent mobile car security system with a centralized administration. The basic underlying idea of this project therefore is to provide a \u201cpractical\u201d and a \u201ccost effective\u201d car security system to the general public. In this project, we provide a camera feed (via IP) of the vehicle to the vehicle owner to his / her mobile device and then enable the user to control the system remotely. It also can detect any human activity, using the switches and report it to the owner via an auto generated sms notification. We have used a web camera which is connected to a Raspberry Pi chipset and powered using a power bank, switches, LED bulbs, 2 speakers and a Wi-Fi adaptor to build the system. When someone tends to open the door lock of the vehicle, a switch which is situated under the door lock of the vehicle, will trigger giving a signal to activate the chipset and send a sms notification to the owner. Then the owner can get an instant view of the situation (on his mobile), and if he wishes to, he can take necessary steps to protect his vehicle from any danger. We have tested the implementation under lab conditions and the results have been quite satisfactory. We were able to achieve the main goals which we wanted to achieve. However it needs to be noted that if this is to be implemented commercially we would have to develop our system to use \u201cport forwarding\u201d (so that the owner may view the video from anywhere in the world), and a city-wide Wi-Fi network or a high-bandwidth data connection would be necessary (HSDPA / WCDMA) for the system to work smoothly.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55537141, "first_name": "Samith", "last_name": "Dilanka", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SamithDilanka", "display_name": "Samith Dilanka", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SamithDilanka?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5473, "name": "Embedded Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embedded_Systems?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5766, "name": "Wireless Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wireless_Systems?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17832, "name": "Python", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Python?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37939, "name": "Arduino", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arduino?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 158331, "name": "Python Programming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Python_Programming?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 165242, "name": "Security Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_Systems?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 563750, "name": "Raspberry Pi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Raspberry_Pi?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1388430, "name": "Realtime Embedded Programming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Realtime_Embedded_Programming?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2505005, "name": "Raspbian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Raspbian?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 3795559, "name": "Privacy and Security in Mobile Computing and Wireless Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privacy_and_Security_in_Mobile_Computing_and_Wireless_Systems?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 3952399, "name": "Computer science project", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_science_project?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 32810255, "title": "\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0456\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u044f\u043a \u0443\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0432\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0447\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0443", "created_at": "2017-05-03T12:26:46.809-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32810255/%D0%94%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BF%D0%BD%D1%96%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_%D1%96%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D1%97_%D1%8F%D0%BA_%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%96_%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%87%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%83?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_32810255", "summary": "Abstract \u2013 In the article the governmental informational politics concerning providing electoral publicity is analyzed.

therefrom what one hacking. The main point is that someone need to do such an achievement wich seams even for the same professionals almost impossible or something completely different and this achievement throwing new light upon the field of investigation or it's broader environment too. In such a meaning the top scientists can be called hackers too as they gaining new knowledge from the Nature, from our closed environment, or in other words from the holographic virtual reality around us, from the Matrix. Deeper knowledge from our environment and from ourself has every time influenced our thinking and in broader sense our ideology and philosophy too. From the beginnings for us human beeings the most important questions are: Who are we really, where are we coming from, how does our mind and body work, how our physical world works and why are we here? To these questions one can find the answers only in case when one gaining knowledge not just from one field of life or science but from so much field of investigation as it is possible. Because of his accomplishment and work in that sense the greatest researcher in our history was Nikola Tesla, who from his very childhood made groundbreaking observations and discoveries first in his closer environment and later all around our planet Earth and in the whole Universe too. He discovered, invented and built such methodes, principles, parts, instruments and machines from conventional materials wich opened our closed reality and unraveled the hidden working of ourself and our physical world too. In that sense he really hacked the world around us perceptible only to our senses and instruments and gained such new informations and knowledge wich revolutionized our world view making it possible to reach undreamed goals. In the following notes we can read about those most outstanding discoveries of Nikola Tesla wich make him call \" the greatest hacker ever \" in our history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55665292, "asset_id": 35788558, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 38725523, "first_name": "Istv\u00e1n", "last_name": "Kocsis", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "istvankocsis", "display_name": "Istv\u00e1n G Kocsis", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/istvankocsis?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38725523/10785774/25287954/s65_istv_n.kocsis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 821, "name": "Philosophy of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17871, "name": "Physics Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physics_Education?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55850, "name": "Nikola Tesla", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nikola_Tesla?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 77363021, "title": "BER and channel capacity analysis of wireless system over $${\\kappa -\\mu /}$$inverse\u00a0gamma and $${\\eta -\\mu /}$$inverse\u00a0gamma composite fading model", "created_at": "2022-04-23T07:29:19.862-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77363021/BER_and_channel_capacity_analysis_of_wireless_system_over_kappa_mu_inverse_gamma_and_eta_mu_inverse_gamma_composite_fading_model?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_77363021", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84754918, "asset_id": 77363021, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41064739, "first_name": "Puspraj", "last_name": "Chauhan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PusprajChauhan", "display_name": "Puspraj Chauhan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PusprajChauhan?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41064739/15483073/16094668/s65_puspraj.chauhan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 440, "name": "Distributed Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distributed_Computing?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22992, "name": "Wireless networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wireless_networks?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 69887771, "title": "Contested histories, participatory movements and the making of memories in Bangladesh", "created_at": "2022-01-29T02:30:04.539-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69887771/Contested_histories_participatory_movements_and_the_making_of_memories_in_Bangladesh?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_69887771", "summary": "This is the Keynote Address presented at the CIRN 2016 Conference in Prato, Italy.

The use of DODAF by the DOD dates back to its initial conception and use for modeling command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) architectures in 1996.  This initial development and use was due to the Clinger-Cohen Act being passed.  The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1986 concerns itself with DOD information technology (IT) architectures and frameworks.  Clinger-Cohen put for rules on the development, acquisition, management, and maintenance of IT architectures.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) also put forth two circulars which call for the need of DODAF in DOD IT architecture projects (DOD, 2010, pp. 30-31).  DODAF version 2.0 is a complicated but essential framework for identifying the overall set of data that is required to model the enterprise architecture in order for decision makers to be able to understand and make clear decisions about the architecture (DOD, 2010, pp. 2-3).  DODAF uses models to represent the data.  Models can be diagrams, spreadsheets, or any data set organized in a form to fill the needs of the view.  Viewpoints are the collection of views required to show the design of the DOD enterprise architecture.

Immersion was examined because past studies have shown that years of immersion experience in the L2 can impact processing in the L1 (Dussias & Sagarra, 2007).

This includes making sure that technology is readily available and accessible to as large of a population as possible. Current consumer virtual reality (VR) headsets typically utilize two controllers to navigate a virtual environment, leading to accessibility issues for potential users that cannot effectively operate a controller. We propose NaVRgate, a proof of concept idea that removes the need for controllers in which a user uses expressions to navigate a virtual environment. The system utilizes the computer webcam and computer vision face and eye position tracking to capture the nature of expression tracking, with certain positional thresholds representing different facial expressions. To test this system, We design a game environment where a user navigates with either a controller or the face position tracker, collecting a set of orbs scattered around the map as quickly as they can, comparing the efficiency between navigation through the novel computer vision and traditional controller methods. Users are also questioned on the difficulty of use and experience with each control input method.

Objective: This paper examines the preconditions for setting up an experimentation system for continuous customer experiments. It describes the RIGHT model for Continuous Experimentation (Rapid Iterative value creation Gained through High-frequency Testing), illustrating the building blocks required for such a system. Method: An initial model for continuous experimentation is analytically derived from prior work.

There are three priority mechanisms governing the user\u2019s requests namely low, medium and high priority requests. Here, the priority is given to the amount of VM\u2019s requested. To implement the above concept, the Hybrid Cloud model is used by which the benefits of both the private and public clouds can be reaped. This model has its advantages that it proves to be cost-effective as the resources are effectively utilized from private clouds and only when exhausted are taken from public clouds which is cheaper.",

This function is obtained from the captured nominal data (given by the LTs used as a gauge instrument) and the data obtained by the AACMM and compares the measured and calculated coordinates of the target to obtain the identified model parameters that minimize this difference. Finally, results show that the procedure presented, using the measurements of the LTs as a gauge instrument, is very effective by ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79353365, "asset_id": 69144812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 167256355, "first_name": "JESUS", "last_name": "VELAZQUEZ", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JESUSVELAZQUEZ86", "display_name": "JESUS VELAZQUEZ", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JESUSVELAZQUEZ86?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 77, "name": "Robotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Robotics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64568, "name": "Humans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humans?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80221, "name": "Lasers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lasers?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 96893, "name": "Calibration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Calibration?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 128538, "name": "Arm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arm?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 63488844, "title": "Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering: A Practical Approach", "created_at": "2021-12-07T16:19:40.120-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63488844/Fundamentals_of_Kalman_Filtering_A_Practical_Approach?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_63488844", "summary": "This text is a practical guide to building Kalman filters and shows how the filtering equations can be applied to real-life problems.

Attendance statuses of students are tracked by classical methods in many higher education institutions. It is possible to track student attendance utilizing current information systems. In this paper, an attendance tracking system has been designed and developed by using contactless smart cards. Web applications for management of the system and tracking the student attendance have been developed. Tracking student attendance has become faster and more reliable with the system. The collected data is analyzed with the data-mining module integrated into this system, thus proactive measures can be taken and improvements can be made.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57470546, "asset_id": 37499238, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10943399, "first_name": "\u00d6mer", "last_name": "AYDIN", "domain_name": "bayar", "page_name": "omeraydin", "display_name": "\u00d6mer AYDIN", "profile_url": "https://bayar.academia.edu/omeraydin?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10943399/3257291/20557873/s65__mer.aydin.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56132, "name": "Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Students?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 189867, "name": "RFID Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/RFID_Technology?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 77212671, "title": "Interactive Rule-Based Design An experimental interface for conceptual design", "created_at": "2022-04-21T12:58:11.460-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77212671/Interactive_Rule_Based_Design_An_experimental_interface_for_conceptual_design?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_77212671", "summary": "In this paper, we present a method that allows designers to interactively create partially self-similar manifold surfaces without relying on shape grammars or fractal methods.

The aim of this study is to develop a low-cost mobile mapping system (MMS) with the integration of vehicle-based navigation data and stereo images acquired along vehicle paths. The system consists of a dual frequency GNSS board combined with a low-cost INS unit and two machine vision cameras that collect colour image data for road and roadside objects. The navigation data and the image acquisition are properly synchronized to associate position and attitude to each digital frame captured. In this way, upon pixel location of objects appearing on the video frames, their absolute geographical coordinates can be extracted by employing standard photogrammetric methods. Several calibration steps are implemented before survey operation: camera calibration, relative orientation between cameras and determination of rotation angles and offsets between vehicle and cameras reference frames. A software tool has been developed to facilitate and speed up the calibration procedures.

It is intended for use in academic environment where students normally come for clearance before collection of their statement of result and subsequently for certificate collection. The findings revealed that students normally come for result clearance through their various departments, and their results are usually checked from the hard copy before issuers of clearance form, the same thing applicable on issuers of IT letter. Also, some of the students are given repeat, while some are withdrawn from the institutions because of poor academic performance. Mistakes occurred at time by the adm. Officers in the process of checking these result manually, to rectify this problem led to this research. The variables under consideration here are the students and of course the result sheet. Data were collected using document examination, interviews and through separate oral interview from different departments of the school using the simple random sampling technique.  For design, top down design approach under agile software development of Software Development Life Circle were used. For the programming, Visual Basic 6.0 programming language was used and Microsoft Access for the result database management system. A computer system with basic system configurations is used for testing of the software. The student results of various departments were used for test-running the system to ascertain the efficiency and effectiveness of this research work. In conclusion, this software will help admin officers, the secretaries, the SIWES office, and even the school authorities to easily search for particular student information from the database during clearance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53042513, "asset_id": 32904377, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47381605, "first_name": "Julius", "last_name": "Fasema", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JuliusFasema", "display_name": "Julius Fasema", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JuliusFasema?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47381605/12868248/26098398/s65_julius.fasema.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37536843, "title": "Hardening CISCO Devices based on Cryptography and Security Protocols - Part II: Implementation and Evaluation", "created_at": "2018-10-05T10:34:09.298-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37536843/Hardening_CISCO_Devices_based_on_Cryptography_and_Security_Protocols_Part_II_Implementation_and_Evaluation?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_37536843", "summary": "This second part covers the implementation, testing, critical evaluation, conclusion and further study.

It investigates the commands used to enable cryptography and network protocols based on encryption, in order to meet the need for essential security requirements. Substantial work is devoted to the command line details and testing of a router based on Cryptography and Security Protocols in the border router. A step-by-step hardening approach is detailed using the commands used to secure the proposed network framework's border router.

He tries, in this collection of Writings, to separate what belongs to Revelation from what is the product of error or human interpretation. \n\n His study sheds new light on the Holy Scriptures. At the end of a gripping account, he places the Believer before a point of cardinal importance: the continuity of a Revelation emanating from the same God, with modes of expression that differ in the course of time. It leads us to meditate upon those factors which, in our day, should spiritually unite rather than divide-Jews, Christians and Muslims.\n\nAs a surgeon, Maurice Bucaille has often been in a situation where he was able to examine not only people's bodies, but their souls. This is how he was struck by the existence of Muslim piety and by aspects of Islam which remain unknown to the vast majority of non-Muslims. In his search for explanations which are otherwise difficult to obtain, he learnt Arabic and studied the Quran. In it, he was surprised to find statements on natural phenomena whose meaning can only be understood through modern scientific knowledge.\n\nHe then turned to the question of the authenticity of the writings that constitute the Holy Scriptures of the monotheistic religions. Finally, in the case of the Bible, he proceeded to a confrontation between these writings and scientific data.\n\nThe results of his research into the Judeo-Christian Revelation and the Quran are set out in this book.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56943079, "asset_id": 36994097, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24830359, "first_name":

is a fascinating technology that is starting to be used for evaluation of and for interacting in virtual environments. Especially digital games can benefit from an integrated (i.e., evaluation and interaction) approach, harnessing eye tracking technology for analysis and interaction. Such benefits include faster development of innovative games which can be automatically evaluated in an iterative fashion. For this purpose, we present a framework that enables rapid game development and gameplay analysis within an experimental research environment. The framework presented here is extensible for different kinds of logging (e.g., psychophysiological and in-game behavioral data) and facilitates studies using eye-tracking technology in digital entertainment environments. An experimental study using gaze-only interaction in a digital game is also presented and highlights the framework's capacity to create and evaluate novel entertainment interfaces.",

"Considerable research effort has been devoted to the study of Policy in the domain of Information Security Management (ISM). However, our review of ISM literature identified four key deficiencies that reduce the utility of the guidance to organisations implementing policy management practices. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the management practices of information security policy and develops a practice-based model that addresses the four aforementioned deficiencies. The model provides comprehensive guidance to practitioners on the activities security managers must undertake for security policy development and allows practitioners to benchmark their current practice with the models suggested best practice. The model contributes to theory by mapping existing information security policy research in terms of the defined management practices.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82075739, "asset_id":

known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres (French: Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Chartres), is a Roman Catholic church in Chartres, France, about 80 km (50 miles) southwest of Paris and is the seat of the Bishop of Chartres. Mostly constructed between 1194 and 1220, it stands at the site of at least five cathedrals that have occupied the site since the Diocese of Chartres was formed as an episcopal see in the 4th century. It is in the High Gothic and Romanesque styles.\n\n800 years later in 2020 we have Schumann Resonators which are little boxes you plug into the wall that produce electromagnetic radiation tuned to 7.83 Hz. \nThis is the frequency that the earth/atmosphere system \u201crings\u201d at when the Earth is struck by lightning. It is also a common frequency your brain \u201cticks\u201d at. \nIf we are out of sync with Earth's Frequency (Schumann Resonance) we begin to exhibit signs of discomfort that can range from anxiety, insomnia, illness, suppressed immune etc\u2026 Conversely we have discovered that when we humans are in sync with 7.83hz the body is able to heal and increase its vitality. I use PEMF (pulsed electro magnetic field) therapy devices by Swiss Bionics with Schumann resonators.  \n\nIt seems the ancients knew about this too.\n\nThe cathedral is known as \"the high point of French Gothic art\" and a \"masterpiece\" and is well-preserved for its age: the majority of the original stained glass windows survive intact, while the architecture has seen only minor changes since the early 13th century. \nThe building's exterior is dominated by heavy flying buttresses which allowed the architects to increase the window size significantly, while the west end is dominated by two contrasting spires \u2013 a 105-metre (349 ft) plain pyramid completed around 1160 and a 113-metre (377 ft) early 16th-century Flamboyant spire on top of an older tower. Equally notable are the three great fa\u00e7ades, each adorned with hundreds of sculpted figures illustrating key theological themes and narratives.\n\n\nAt least five cathedrals have stood on this site, each replacing an earlier building damaged by war or fire. The first church dated from no later than the 4th century and was located at the base of a Gallo-Roman wall; this was put to the torch in 743 on the orders of the Duke of Aquitaine. The second church on the site was set on fire by Danish pirates in 858. This was then reconstructed and enlarged by Bishop Gislebert, but was itself destroyed by fire in 1020. A vestige of this church, now known as Saint Lubin Chapel, remains, underneath the apse of the present cathedral. \nIt took its name from Lubinus, the mid-6th-century Bishop of Chartres. It is lower than the rest of the crypt and may have been the shrine of a local saint, prior to the church's rededication to the Virgin Mary.\n\nIn 962 the church was damaged by another fire and was reconstructed yet again. A more serious fire broke out on 7 September 1020, after which Bishop Fulbert (bishop from 1006 to 1028) decided to build a new cathedral. He appealed to the royal houses of Europe, and received generous donations for the rebuilding, including a gift from Cnut the Great, King of Norway, Denmark and much of England. The new cathedral was constructed atop and around the remains of the 9th-century church. It consisted of an ambulatory around the earlier chapel, surrounded by three large chapels with Romanesque barrel vault and groin vault ceilings, which still exist. On top of this structure he built the upper church, 108 meters long and 34 meters wide. \nThe rebuilding proceeded in phases over the next century, culminating in 1145 in a display of public enthusiasm dubbed the \"Cult of the Carts\" \u2013 one of several such incidents recorded during the period. It was claimed that during this religious outburst, a crowd of more than a thousand penitents dragged carts filled with building supplies and provisions including stones, wood, grain, etc. to the site.\n\nIn 1134, another fire in the town damaged the facade and the bell tower of the cathedral. \nConstruction was begun immediately on a new tower, the north tower, which was finished in about 1150. It was just two stories high and had a lead roof. The south tower, begun in 1144, was much more ambitious; it had a spire atop the tower, and, when finished in about 1160, it reached a height of 105 metres or 345 feet, one of the highest in Europe. The two towers were joined on the first level by a chapel devoted to Saint Michael. Traces of the vaults and the shafts which supported them are still visible in the western two bays. \nThe stained glass in the three lancet windows over the portals dates from some time between 1145 and 1155, while the south spire, some 103 metres high, was also completed by 1155 or later. The Royal Portal on the west facade, between the towers, the primary entrance to the cathedral, was probably finished between 1145 and 1245.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65062527, "asset_id": 44600544, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16005828, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Vanderper", "domain_name": "ulg", "page_name": "DavidVanderper", "display_name": "David Vanderper", "profile_url": "https://ulg.academia.edu/DavidVanderper?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16005828/4341433/19170987/s65_david.vanderper.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1446, "name": "Medieval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_History?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6538, "name": "Labyrinths", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labyrinths?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 8354, "name": "Gothic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gothic_Studies?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 31583, "name": "Cathedrals (Medieval Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cathedrals_Medieval_Studies_?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 39462, "name": "Medieval Magic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Magic?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 57326, "name": "Gothic architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gothic_architecture?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 79622, "name": "Sacred Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sacred_Architecture?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 89056, "name": "Printed Circuit Board", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Printed_Circuit_Board?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 93359, "name": "Computer technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_technology?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 108296, "name": "Micro Processors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Micro_Processors?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 108777, "name": "Gothic Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gothic_Art?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 110246, "name": "Gothic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gothic?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 117648, "name": "Cathedral chapters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cathedral_chapters?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 142338, "name": "Chartres", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chartres?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 319931, "name": "Computer Science and Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science_and_Information_Technology-1?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 599334, "name": "Architecture and Public Spaces", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Public_Spaces?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1224548, "name": "Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electrical_and_Computer_Engineering_ECE_?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 65939862, "title": "Quality of 8K Ultra-High-Definition Television Viewing Experience in Practical Viewing Conditions", "created_at": "2021-12-25T06:41:38.401-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/65939862/Quality_of_8K_Ultra_High_Definition_Television_Viewing_Experience_in_Practical_Viewing_Conditions?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_65939862", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77322049, "asset_id": 65939862, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33085236, "first_name": "Yoshiaki", "last_name": "Shishikui", "domain_name": "meiji", "page_name": "YoshiakiShishikui", "display_name": "Yoshiaki Shishikui", "profile_url": "https://meiji.academia.edu/YoshiakiShishikui?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237788, "name": "Electrical And Electronic Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electrical_And_Electronic_Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36684617, "title": "Solution Manual for Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering 7th Edition by Mc Cabe", "created_at": "2018-05-21T15:35:26.286-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36684617/Solution_Manual_for_Unit_Operations_of_Chemical_Engineering_7th_Edition_by_Mc_Cabe?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_36684617", "summary": "Solution Manual for Unit Operations of Chemical Engineering 7th Edition by Mc Cabe.

Asset exchanges (digital or real-world) seem to be one area that can benefit from blockchain technology. This means blockchain can be used to facilitate asset exchanges between parties without the need for an intermediary. In this research we look at how tokens issued on a platform (blockchain) can be used to represent and transfer ownership of an asset. This paper also look into the important aspects to consider when tokenizing assets that may lead to the adoption of the process (i.e. parties choose blockchain as the primary option to exchange/ transfer ownership of assets). Thematic analysis is instrumental in allowing us to code the data that was found \u2013 related to asset tokenization. Thus, relevant themes (aspects) are derived to give a high-level view of the process of asset tokenization. We have created a model to give a bird\u2019s eye view of tokenization as a whole; from this, we derived the critical success factors for the adoption of asset tokenization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62924153, "asset_id": 42710583, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5247, "first_name": "Edward", "last_name": "de la Rey", "domain_name": "rhodes-za", "page_name": "EdwarddelaRey", "display_name": "Edward de la Rey", "profile_url": "https://rhodes-za.academia.edu/EdwarddelaRey?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5247/15738646/16279191/s65_edward.de_la_rey.png"}, {"id": 154798093, "first_name": "Chabana", "last_name": "Chabana", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChabanaChabana", "display_name": "Chabana Chabana", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChabanaChabana?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/154798093/81484936/70077983/s65_chabana.chabana.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 740091, "name": "Cryptocurrency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cryptocurrency?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9200963, "title": "ONLINE HELP DESK", "created_at": "2014-11-09T00:55:49.210-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9200963/ONLINE_HELP_DESK?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_9200963", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35481295, "asset_id": 9200963, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21071103, "first_name": "Aditya", "last_name": "Prakash", "domain_name": "apiitmalaysia", "page_name": "AdityaPrakash", "display_name": "Aditya Prakash", "profile_url": "https://apiitmalaysia.academia.edu/AdityaPrakash?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34772621, "title": "The Anger Manual to Help Reduce Anger in Society (social change download)", "created_at": "2017-10-05T07:36:07.398-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34772621/The_Anger_Manual_to_Help_Reduce_Anger_in_Society_social_change_download_?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_34772621", "summary": "People abused by angry discipline as children, may tend to abuse or overly punish other people or themselves for perceived wrongs in their adult life.

is an era of technology; we are surrounded with the technology. Now a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people become smarter they want to operate each and everything\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with his smart phone/laptop/pc without going anywhere, it happens due to IOT devices. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why in this paper we have design a smart home with enhance security. In smart home we can operate the household things(fan, light, ac, any applications, door, windows, etc. )with the mobile. We design a IOT based smart and secure home model in latest released cisco packet tracer. Cisco packet is basically a simulator to teach the student about the network. But in newly released cisco packet tracer 7.2.1 it have more sensors, board, Programming languages, IOE devices. In this we can design, test, see the actual working of the network/model in real time.

It is not only an information system for the agent but involves the customer in an active role (through the implementation of sales talks, the conscious visualisation of facts, the generation of natural language explanations etc.). Thus, the customer is not faced with a fait accompli but is actively involved in solving the problem. To meet these requirements, several AI techniques are used, as described further below.

I am a software engineer. And as such, I know what it's like to be asked to whip up brilliant algorithms on the spot and then write flawless code on a whiteboard. I know because I've been asked to do the same thing-in interviews at Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, among other companies.\n\nI also know because I've been on the other side of the table, asking candidates to do this. I've combed through stacks of resumes to find the engineers who I thought might be able to actually pass these interviews.\nI've evaluated them as they solved-or tried to solve-challenging questions. And I've debated in Google's Hiring Committee whether a candidate did well enough to merit an offer. I understand the full\nhiring circle because I've been through it all, repeatedly. And you, reader, are probably preparing for an interview, perhaps tomorrow, next week, or next year. I am here to help you solidify your understanding of computer science fundamentals and then learn how to apply those fundamentals to crack the coding interview.\n\nThe 6th edition of Cracking the Coding Interview updates the 5th edition with 70% more content: additional questions, revised solutions, new chapter introductions, more algorithm strategies, hints for all problems,\nand other content. Be sure to check out our website, CrackingTheCodinglnterview.com, to connect with other candidates and discover new resources. I'm excited for you and for the skills you are going to develop. Thorough preparation will give you a wide range of technical and communication skills. It will be well worth it, no matter where the effort takes you!\n\nI encourage you to read these introductory chapters carefully. They contain important insight that just might make the difference between a \"hire\" and a \"no hire:' And remember-interviews are hard! In my years of interviewing at Google, I saw some interviewers ask \"easy\" questions while others ask harder questions. But you know what? Getting the easy questions doesn't make it any easier to get the offer. Receiving an offer is not about solving questions flawlessly (very few candidates do!). Rather, it is about answering questions better than other candidates. So don't stress out when you get a tricky question-everyone else probably thought it was hard too. It's okay to not be flawless.

Most data transmitted in the form of multimedia. The data transmission must be less complex and user friendly at the same time with more security. Message authentication and integrity is one of the major issues in security data Transmission. There are plenty of methods used to ensure the integrity of data when it is send from the receiver and before it reaches the corresponding receiver. If these messages are tampered in the midst, it should be intimated to the receiver and discarded. Hash algorithms are supposed to provide the integrity but almost all the algorithms have confirmed breakable or less secure. In this review, the performances of various hash functions are studied with an analysis from the point of view of various researchers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65280039, "asset_id": 44786307, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 109571315, "first_name": "IJERT", "last_name": "Journal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IJERTORG", "display_name": "IJERT Journal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IJERTORG?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/109571315/46811946/36059547/s65_ijert.journal.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 66546026, "title": "A Review Paper on Non-Fungible Token (NFT): Overview, Evaluation, Opportunities and Challenges", "created_at": "2021-12-30T04:39:35.009-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66546026/A_Review_Paper_on_Non_Fungible_Token_NFT_Overview_Evaluation_Opportunities_and_Challenges?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_66546026", "summary": "Non-Fungible Token or \u2018Non-Replaceable Token\u2019 is the contemporary trend in the digital industry as of 2021 [1]. Introduced first in 2017 from a game called Crypto Punks, the NFT system shows promising breakthroughs since then [2]. The concept is that every NFT has unique properties making it original and distinguishable from everyone[3]. By being unique, these made them tradable and sold digitally just like a real-life auction. The only difference is that cryptocurrency is used to purchase it and blockchain or the series of restricted \u2018a ledger\u2019 of interconnected computers validate the purchase instead of a middle man or the bank [3].\n\tAs of May 2021, many NFT systems emerge ranging from the fields of gaming, music, media, decentralized finance (Defi), and more [4]. Many people testify that NFT is one of their sources of income during the pandemic. Similarly, celebrities and companies declare their involvement in the field. In a recent study, 23 percent of NFTs give a return rate of 1000 percent [4].On top of that, a single picture was sold for 69.3 million dollars in a digital auction [5]. To participate, one must first understand the fundamentals, involved risks, opportunities,  and challenges present in the NFT system.

The performance of the system in real-time for the proposed method as well as for the conventional method (which involves assuming V\u00a0=\u00a0F, where F is the force acting on the cart, V is the voltage across the motor) is measured in terms of settling time of the system, maximum pendulum angle offset after settling, and cart position displacement.

Individuals suffering from stroke and other neurological disorders often experience inadequate dorsiflexion during swing phase of the gait cycle due to dorsiflexor muscle weakness. This type of pathological gait, mostly known as drop-foot gait, has two major complications, foot-slap during loading response and toe-drag during swing. Ankle foot orthotic (AFO) devices are mostly prescribed to resolve these complications. Existing AFOs are designed with or without articulated joint with various motion control elements like springs, dampers, four-bar mechanism, series elastic actuator, and so forth. This paper examines various AFO designs for drop-foot, discusses the mechanism, and identifies limitations and remaining design challenges. Along with two commercially available AFOs some designs possess promising prospective to be used as daily-wear device.

Subsequent work (McIver et\u00a0al., Proceedings of the 37th international colloquium conference on Automata, languages and programming: Part II, 2010 ) presents a similar but more general quantitative model that treats probabilistic information flow. Whilst the latter provides a framework to reason about quantitative security risks, that extra detail entails a significant overhead in the verification effort needed to achieve it. Our first contribution in this paper is to study the relationship between those two models (qualitative and quantitative) in order to understand when qualitative Shadow proofs can be \u201cpromoted\u201d to quantitative versions, i.e. in a probabilistic context. In particular we identify a subset of the Shadow\u2019s refinement theorems that, when interpreted in the quantitative ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87805850, "asset_id": 81936277, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 222876762, "first_name": "Hoang thai son", "last_name": "Hoang", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HoangthaisonHoang", "display_name": "Hoang thai son Hoang", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HoangthaisonHoang?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64561, "name": "Computer Software", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Software?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 81921687, "title": "Solving Timetabling Problem Using Genetic and Heuristic Algorithms", "created_at": "2022-06-20T11:09:29.690-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81921687/Solving_Timetabling_Problem_Using_Genetic_and_Heuristic_Algorithms?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_81921687", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87796053, "asset_id": 81921687, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 156478003, "first_name": "Duc Thanh", "last_name": "Nguyen", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "DucThanhNguyen", "display_name": "Duc Thanh Nguyen", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/DucThanhNguyen?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 156, "name": "Genetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genetics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3701, "name": "RNA", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/RNA?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5026, "name": "Genetic Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genetic_Algorithms?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 9048, "name": "Scheduling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scheduling?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 10182, "name": "Fuzzy Sets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fuzzy_Sets?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 16103, "name": "Fuzzy Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fuzzy_Systems?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 212832, "name": "Cooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cooling?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 222387, "name": "Heuristic Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heuristic_Algorithms?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 244567, "name": "Educational Institutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Institutions?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 323690, "name": "Hybrid Algorithm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Algorithm?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 892227, "name": "Software algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_algorithms?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1950746, "name": "Heuristic algorithm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heuristic_algorithm?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 3458078, "name": "Cities and towns", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cities_and_towns?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 81864727, "title": "Heerfordt-Waldenstrom Syndrome Uveoparotid Fever: Review of the Literature and a Case Presentation", "created_at": "2022-06-19T22:27:11.552-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81864727/Heerfordt_Waldenstrom_Syndrome_Uveoparotid_Fever_Review_of_the_Literature_and_a_Case_Presentation?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_81864727", "summary": "Heerfordt-Waldenstr\u00f6m syndrome is also referred to as uveoparotid fever.

Functional fabrics were evaluated by trained panels employing subjective evaluation scenarios. Firstly, the FLM was applied to predict the HV from finishing parameters; then, the FLM and ANN model were applied to predict the THV from the HV. The estimation of the FLM on the HV was efficient, as demonstrated by the root mean square error (RMSE) and relative mean percentage error (RMPE); low values were recorded, except those bipolar descriptors whose values are within the lowermost extreme values on the fuzzy model. However, the prediction performance of the FLM and ANN model on THV was effective, where RMSE values of \u223c0.21 and \u223c0.13 were obtained, respectively; both values were within the variations of the experiment. The RMPE values for both models were less than 10%, indicating that both models are ro...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87445986, "asset_id": 81385389, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 160006142, "first_name": "Emil", "last_name": "Loghin", "domain_name": "tuasi", "page_name": "EmilLoghin", "display_name": "Emil Loghin", "profile_url": "https://tuasi.academia.edu/EmilLoghin?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/160006142/45227442/35338630/s65_emil.loghin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 56, "name": "Materials Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materials_Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4165, "name": "Fuzzy Logic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fuzzy_Logic?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96825, "name": "Manufacturing Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manufacturing_Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111180, "name": "Textile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textile?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1211304, "name": "Artificial Neural Network", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Neural_Network?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 81127158, "title": "Applying Deep Learning to Basketball Trajectories", "created_at": "2022-06-09T18:07:28.318-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81127158/Applying_Deep_Learning_to_Basketball_Trajectories?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_81127158", "summary": "One of the emerging trends for sports analytics is the growing use of player and ball tracking data. A parallel development is deep learning predictive approaches that use vast quantities of data with less reliance on feature engineering.

The models are capable of learning the trajectory of a basketball without any knowledge of physics. For comparison, a baseline static machine learning model with a full set of features, such as angle and velocity, in addition to the positional data is also tested. Using a dataset of over 20,000 three pointers from NBA SportVu data, the models based simply on sequential positional data outperform a static feature rich machine learning model in predicting whether a three-point shot is successful.

The traffic congestion created by these vehicles causes many problems. Increased environment pollution is one of the most serious negative effects of traffic congestion. Noxious gases and fine particles emitted by vehicles affect people in different ways depending on their age and present health conditions.

Given $N$ variables, there are $O(N^2)$ possible pairwise interactions, $O(N^3)$ possible 3-way interactions, etc. We show that Dropout implicitly sets a learning rate for interaction effects that decays exponentially with the size of the interaction, corresponding to a regularizer that balances against the hypothesis space which grows exponentially with number of variables in the interaction. This understanding of Dropout has implications for the optimal Dropout rate: higher Dropout rates should be used when we need stronger regularization against spurious high-order interactions. This perspective also issues caution against using Dropout to measure term saliency because Dropout regularizes against terms for high-order interactions. Finally, this view of Dropout as a regularizer of interaction effects provides insight into the varying effectiveness of Dropout for diffe...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86615263,

"IntroductionPublic health professionals engage in complex cognitive tasks, often using evidence-based decision support tools to bolster their decision-making. Human factors methods take a user-centred approach to improve the design of systems, processes, and interfaces to better support planning and decision-making. While human factors methods have been applied to the design of clinical health tools, these methods are limited in the design of tools for population health. The objective of this scoping review is to develop a comprehensive understanding of how human factors techniques have been applied in the design of population health decision support tools.Methods and analysisThe scoping review will follow the methodology and framework proposed by Arksey and O\u2019Malley. We include English-language documents between January 1990 and August 2021 describing the development, validation or application of human factors principles to decision support tools in population health.

There is an apparent difference among them for the voltage regulation capability, because the GFM controls IBR to act as a voltage source and GFL controls it to act as a current source. The difference affects the performance of the VI control function, because stable voltage conditions help the inertial response to contribute to system stability. However, GFL can provide the voltage control function with reactive power controllability, and it can be activated simultaneously with the VI control function.

Unsupervised clustering of SC transcriptomes, which is the default technique for defining cell types, is prone to group cells by technical, rather than biological, variation. Compared to de-novo (unsupervised) clustering, we demonstrate using multiple benchmarks that supervised clustering, which uses reference transcriptomes as a guide, is robust to batch effects and data quality artifacts. Here, we present RCA2, the first algorithm to combine reference projection (batch effect robustness) with graph-based clustering (scalability). In addition, RCA2 provides a user-friendly framework incorporating multiple commonly used downstream analysis modules. RCA2 also provides new reference panels for human and mouse and supports generation of custom panels.

Structural resilience is often neglected in the design of UDSs. The current literature supports structural decentralization as a way to introduce structural resilience into UDSs. Although there are promising methods in the literature for generating and optimizing decentralized separate stormwater collection systems, incorporating hydraulic simulations in unsteady flow, these approaches sometimes require high computational effort, especially for flat areas. This may hamper their integration into ordinary commercially designed UDS software due to their predominantly scientific purposes. As a response, this paper introduces simplified cost and structural resilience indices that can be used as heuristic parameters for optimizing the UDS layout.

Our analysis focuses on two complementary aspects: the capabilities of the physical platform and the logic of the deployment. The former analysis shows regularities in hardware configurations and functionalities, leading to the definition of a set of six application-level capabilities (exploration, identification, remote control, communication, manipulation, and digital situatedness). The latter focuses on the impact of robots on the daily life of users and categorises the deployment of robots for healthcare interventions using three types of services: support, mitigation, and response.

Conducting two empirical surveys with highly representative samples, we have developed and validated a twelve-item public value scale. Additionally, we applied the scale to empirically test what distinguishes public value from adjacent constructs, such as CSR or reputation, and to examine its explanatory power regarding important client/customer outcomes. The scale will allow future research to test extant public value hypotheses more thoroughly than before by using survey or experimental research designs. Practitioners can use the scale to gain a deeper understanding of public evaluation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84802499, "asset_id": 77471708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 183335656, "first_name": "Timo", "last_name": "Meynhardt", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TMeynhardt", "display_name": "Timo Meynhardt", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TMeynhardt?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/183335656/51346035/39414367/s65_timo.meynhardt.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1073, "name": "Public Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Management?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 104434, "name": "Construct Validity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Construct_Validity?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 77470840, "title": "Comparison of Various RCNN techniques for Classification of Object from Image", "created_at": "2022-04-24T10:22:28.550-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77470840/Comparison_of_Various_RCNN_techniques_for_Classification_of_Object_from_Image?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_77470840", "summary": "Object recognition is a very well known problem domain in the field of computer vision and robot vision.

inference problem, when the presumed underlying distribution is adversarially perturbed? To provide a concrete answer to this question, this paper unifies two major learning frameworks: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Distributionally Robust Learning (DRL). We develop a generalization theory for our framework based on a number of novel complexity measures, such as an adversarial extension of Rademacher complexity and its semi-supervised analogue. Moreover, our analysis is able to quantify the role of unlabeled data in the generalization under a more general condition compared to the existing theoretical works in SSL. Based on our framework, we also present a hybrid of DRL and EM algorithms that has a guaranteed convergence rate. When implemented with deep neural networks, our method shows a comparable performance to those of the state-of-the-art on a number of real-world benchmark datasets.", "downloadable_attachments":

"Localization within a Wireless Sensor Network consists of defining the position of a given set of sensors by satisfying some non-functional requirements such as (1) efficient energy consumption, (2) low communication or computation overhead, (3) no, or limited, use of particular hardware components, (4) fast localization, (5) robustness, and (6) low localization error. Although there are several algorithms and techniques available in literature, localization is viewed as an open issue because none of the current solutions are able to jointly satisfy all the previous requirements. An algorithm called ROCRSSI appears to be a suitable solution; however, it is affected by several inefficiencies that limit its effectiveness in real case scenarios. This paper proposes a refined version of this algorithm, called ROCRSSI++, which resolves such inefficiencies using and storing information gathered by the sensors in a more efficient manner.

However, Ethereum is also considered a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerable smart contracts will eventually be exploited. Recently, Ethereum&#39;s pool of pending transaction has become a far more aggressive environment. In the hope of making some profit, attackers continuously monitor the transaction pool and try to frontrun their victims&#39; transactions by either displacing or suppressing them, or strategically inserting their transactions. This paper aims to shed some light into what is known as a dark forest and uncover these predators&#39; actions. We present a methodology to efficiently measure the three types of frontrunning: displacement, insertion, and suppression.

This vast amount of trading shows the necessity of understanding the hidden insights in the data sets. In this study, a data mining technique, clustering based outlier analysis is applied to detect suspicious insider transactions. 1,244,815 transactions of 61,780 insiders are analysed, which are acquired from Thomson Financial, covering a period of January 2010\u2013April 2017. In order to detect outliers, similar transactions are grouped into the same clusters by using a two\u2010step clustering based outlier detection technique, which is an integration of k\u2010means and hierarchical clustering. Then, it is shown that outlying transactions earn higher abnormal returns than non\u2010outlying transactions by using event study methodology.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 117394589, "first_name": "Emrah", "last_name": "Bilgic", "domain_name": "iste-tr", "page_name": "EmrahBilgic", "display_name": "Emrah Bilgic", "profile_url": "https://iste-tr.academia.edu/EmrahBilgic?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/117394589/28719538/26826642/s65_emrah.bilgic.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 237, "name": "Cognitive Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2009, "name": "Data Mining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Mining?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 84990, "name": "Clustering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clustering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 121094, "name": "Insider Trading", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insider_Trading?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 131096, "name": "Outlier detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Outlier_detection?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 809587, "name": "Financial Fraud", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Financial_Fraud?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 76659149, "title": "Analysis and design of multiagent systems using MAS-CommonKADS", "created_at": "2022-04-16T18:12:59.401-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76659149/Analysis_and_design_of_multiagent_systems_using_MAS_CommonKADS?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_76659149", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84294195, "asset_id": 76659149, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 221008909, "first_name": "Carlos alberto", "last_name": "Iglesias", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CarlosalbertoIglesias1", "display_name": "Carlos alberto Iglesias", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CarlosalbertoIglesias1?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/221008909/78854490/67412059/s65_carlos_alberto.iglesias.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33230, "name": "Pavement design and analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pavement_design_and_analysis?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45873, "name": "Multi Agent System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multi_Agent_System?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49007, "name": "Communication model", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication_model?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96047, "name": "Case Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Case_Study?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 97345, "name": "Knowledge Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_Engineering?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 238198, "name": "Seismic analysis and design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seismic_analysis_and_design?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 249843, "name": "Agent Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agent_Modeling?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 290495, "name": "Software Agent", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software_Agent?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 293442, "name": "Agent Coordination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agent_Coordination?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1121048, "name": "Object Oriented", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Object_Oriented?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1935769, "name": "Design Model", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Design_Model?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2290393, "name": "Multiagent System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiagent_System?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 76642886, "title": "Style and Function of Graphic Tools", "created_at": "2022-04-16T12:59:24.137-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76642886/Style_and_Function_of_Graphic_Tools?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_76642886", "summary": "Shouldn&#39;t the future be a place where our graphical interfaces disencumber computer use?

Test case design as well as execution consume a lot of time. Hence, automated generation of test cases is highly required. Here a novel testing methodology is being presented to test object-oriented software based on UML state chart diagrams. In this approach, function minimization technique is being applied and generate test cases automatically from UML state chart diagrams. Software testing forms an integral part of the software development life cycle. Since the objective of testing is to ensure the conformity of an application to its specification, a test \u201coracle\u201d is needed to determine whether a given test case exposes a fault or not. An automated oracle to support the activities of human testers can reduce the actual cost of the testing process and the related maintenance costs.

We draw attention to an additional limitation than has been underappreciated, namely, structural model error (SME). A model has SME if the model dynamics differ from the dynamics in the target system. If a nonlinear model has only the slightest SME, then its ability to generate decision-relevant predictions is compromised. Given a perfect model, we can take the effects of SDIC into account by substituting probabilistic predictions for point predictions. This route is foreclosed in the case of SME, which puts us in a worse epistemic situation than SDIC.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83672719, "asset_id": 75985261, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33159825, "first_name": "Roman", "last_name": "Frigg", "domain_name": "lse", "page_name": "RomanFrigg", "display_name": "Roman Frigg", "profile_url": "https://lse.academia.edu/RomanFrigg?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33159825/9834123/10959863/s65_roman.frigg.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 821, "name": "Philosophy of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 825039, "name": "Philosophy Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Science-1?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 75974139, "title": "Development of an Expert System for Landfilling Applications in sri Lanka", "created_at": "2022-04-10T01:40:32.186-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75974139/Development_of_an_Expert_System_for_Landfilling_Applications_in_sri_Lanka?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_75974139", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83662083, "asset_id": 75974139, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 180735259, "first_name": "Sumith", "last_name": "Pilapitiya", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PilapitiyaSumith", "display_name": "Sumith Pilapitiya", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PilapitiyaSumith?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 110903, "name": "Solid waste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Solid_waste?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 121337, "name": "expert System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/expert_System?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246163, "name": "Knowledge base", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Knowledge_base?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1121048, "name": "Object Oriented", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Object_Oriented?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 75946284, "title": "Tap Arduino: An Arduino microcontroller for low-latency auditory feedback in sensorimotor synchronization experiments", "created_at": "2022-04-09T15:54:39.314-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75946284/Tap_Arduino_An_Arduino_microcontroller_for_low_latency_auditory_feedback_in_sensorimotor_synchronization_experiments?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_75946284", "summary": "Timing abilities are often measured by having participants tap their finger along with a metronome and presenting tap-triggered auditory feedback. These experiments predominantly use electronic percussion pads combined with software (e.g., FTAP or Max/MSP) that records responses and delivers auditory feedback. However, these setups involve unknown latencies between tap onset and auditory feedback and can sometimes miss responses or record multiple, superfluous responses for a single tap. These issues may distort measurements of tapping performance or affect the performance of the individual. We present an alternative setup using an Arduino microcontroller that addresses these issues and delivers low-latency auditory feedback. We validated our setup by having participants (N = 6) tap on a force-sensitive resistor pad connected to the Arduino and on an electronic percussion pad with various levels of force and tempi.

The system extracts relevant information from the available data. Fundamental design objectives of sensor networks include reliability, accuracy, flexibility, cost effectiveness, and ease of deployment. Each node has at least a sensor with an embedded processor, and low power radius. It acts as information source, sensing and collecting data samples from the environment. Node can also act as information sink, receiving dynamic configuration information from other nodes or external entities. The end portion of a node can be an antenna.

One of the factors which may affect how nurses use technology such as CDSS may be their clinical experience. This paper uses data from a wider study examining how nurses use CDSS to examine the role of experience in nurses&#39; use of CDSS. Data was drawn from two sources; a secondary analysis of interviews from a study examining nurses&#39; use of CDSS in telephone triage and the analysis of observations and interviews of nurses using CDSS in two case sites. Two themes arose from the analysis of the data; the integration of knowledge from CDSS and how experience affects CDSS use.

We successfully developed and demonstrated a deconvolution algorithm to retrieve both spatially multiplexed discrete data and continuous volumetric data from 2D light-field images. Showing that the method is practical for data transmission and storage, we obtained a faithful reconstruction of the 3D volumetric information from a digital copy of the encrypted light-field image.

recommendations and the extent to which users are willing to release information about their preferences. In this paper, we explore a two-tiered notion of privacy where there is a small set of &quot;public&quot; users who are willing to share their preferences openly, and a large set of &quot;private&quot; users who require privacy guarantees. We show theoretically and demonstrate empirically that a moderate number of public users with no access to private user information already suffices for reasonable accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a new privacy concept for gleaning relational information from private users while maintaining a first order deniability.

Data exchange in many underwater applications such as oceanographic data collection, scientific ocean sampling, pollution and environmental monitoring, disaster prevention, underwater system maintenance, recreational scuba diving, is an exciting task. Due to the reduced visibility (for optical) or high attenuations (for radio) link, in most of the cases the communication between different locations cannot take place. When possible, this limitations are alleviated employing data transmission via cables, a solution that can be employed for both dynamic (e.g. on the scuba divers) or static (e.g. sensor nodes) systems. However, its use assumes that the movement among the different communicating objects is clearly strongly limited. On the other hand, the total lack of the possible communication among the divers substantially reduces the possibility of preventing dangers, avoiding the considered activity to be conducted in safe way.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 67263839, "first_name": "Matteo", "last_name": "Marascio", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MatteoMarascio", "display_name": "Matteo Marascio", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MatteoMarascio?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/67263839/24539898/23431367/s65_matteo.marascio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2215, "name": "Water", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33460, "name": "Electromagnetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electromagnetics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 153168, "name": "Data Collection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Collection?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 159978, "name": "Visibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visibility?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 301555, "name": "Data Exchange", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Data_Exchange?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 788373, "name": "Disaster Prevention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disaster_Prevention?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 951108, "name": "Attenuation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Attenuation?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1946222, "name": "Underwater Acoustic Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Underwater_Acoustic_Communication?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 73496635, "title": "Context awareness architecture for ambient-assisted living applications: Case study of nighttime wandering", "created_at": "2022-03-10T14:09:40.596-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73496635/Context_awareness_architecture_for_ambient_assisted_living_applications_Case_study_of_nighttime_wandering?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_73496635", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81997084, "asset_id": 73496635, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35652633, "first_name": "Sylvain", "last_name": "Giroux", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SylvainGiroux", "display_name": "Sylvain  Giroux", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SylvainGiroux?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 73445464, "title": "A Secure Authentication Scheme for Bluetooth Connection", "created_at": "2022-03-09T22:58:40.321-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73445464/A_Secure_Authentication_Scheme_for_Bluetooth_Connection?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_73445464", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81965156, "asset_id": 73445464, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 142941325, "first_name": "Assoc.

While the current narrative emphasises how to design products fit for circular (re-)production flows, or how to design circular business models, it often fails to address how such solutions can be designed to be attractive to people. As long as products and services are designed in a way that makes people prefer linear options over circular ones, the transition will not gain momentum. To further the understanding of how a user perspective can be valuable for circular design, this paper introduces the Use2Use Design Toolkit and presents initial experiences from using its five tools in design work. The tools were developed between 2016 and 2019 and subsequently applied in 30 workshops with professionals and students. Insights from the workshops suggest that the participants generally found the tools fun, instructive and inspirational.

In this paper we introduce the concept of statistical deformation mod-els (SDM) which allow the construction of average models of the anatomy and their variability. SDMs are built by performing a statistical analysis of the defor-mations required to map anatomical features in one subject into the corresponding features in another subject. The concept of SDMs is similar to active shape mod-els (ASM) which capture statistical information about shapes across a population but offers several new advantages over ASMs: Firstly, SDMs can be constructed directly from images such as MR or CT without the need for segmentation which is usually a prerequisite for the construction of active shape models. Instead a non-rigid registration algorithm is used to compute the deformations required to establish correspondences between the reference subject and the subjects in the population class under investigation. Secondly, SDMs allow the construction of an atlas of the average anatomy as we...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81106388, "asset_id": 71994269, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 54314150, "first_name": "Alejandro", "last_name": "Frangi", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "AlejandroFrangi", "display_name": "Alejandro F Frangi", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/AlejandroFrangi?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/54314150/16776348/17038613/s65_alejandro.frangi.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48, "name": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 428, "name": "Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Algorithms?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3227, "name": "Schizophrenia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Schizophrenia?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5187, "name": "Statistical Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Statistical_Analysis?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 6200, "name": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 29731, "name": "Image Registration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Image_Registration?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 61474, "name": "Brain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brain?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 119259, "name": "Magnetic Resonance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magnetic_Resonance?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 202137, "name": "Shape Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shape_Analysis?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 240378, "name": "Active Shape Model", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Active_Shape_Model?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 549280, "name": "Reproducibility of Results", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reproducibility_of_Results?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 901876, "name": "Sensitivity and Specificity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensitivity_and_Specificity?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1122411, "name": "Mr Imaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mr_Imaging?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1325691, "name": "Nonrigid Registration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nonrigid_Registration?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1639124, "name": "Statistical Shape Model", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Statistical_Shape_Model?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1765974, "name": "Medical Image Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Image_Computing?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1837493, "name": "Normalized mutual information", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Normalized_mutual_information?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2485317, "name": "Free Form Deformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_Form_Deformation?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 71931339, "title": "Incorporating Network Connectivity Analysis in Maintenance Planning", "created_at": "2022-02-20T02:11:24.584-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/71931339/Incorporating_Network_Connectivity_Analysis_in_Maintenance_Planning?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_71931339", "summary": "This study is motivated by the unexpected failure of a network-based system during the performance of corrective maintenance.

University Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637 USA Abstract Metaphoric iconicity in gestures Since Saussure, the idea that the forms of words are arbitrarily related to their meanings has been widely accepted. Yet, implicit metaphorical mappings may provide opportunities for iconicity throughout the lexicon. We hypothesized that vertical spatial metaphors for emotional valence are manifested in language through space in signed languages and through the spatialized dimension of pitch in spoken languages. In Experiment 1, we analyzed the directions of the hand motions constituting words in three signed languages, and related them to the valence of their English translation equivalents. The vertical direction of signs predicted their valences.

Instead, it delays the character segmentation to the recognition stage by generating a segmentation graph that describes all possible ways to segment a word into letters. To recognize a word, the NN computes the observation probabilities for each segmentation candidates (SCs) in the segmentation graph. Then, using concatenated letter-HMMs, a likelihood is computed for each word in the lexicon by multiplying the probabilities over the best paths through the graph.

This type of parameter strongly contributes to the mechanism of frequency attenuation above 10 GHz. Consequently, in the last twenty years, there has been a significant boost to this research topic. Researchers all around the world have worked thoroughly on the issue of estimating rain with the use of earth-to-earth microwave signal attenuation.

"Weeds are unwanted plants that grow among crops. These weeds can significantly reduce the yield and quality of the farm output. Unfortunately, site-specific weed management is not followed in most of the cases. That is, instead of treating a field with a specific type of herbicide, the field is treated with a broadcast herbicide application. This broadcast application of the herbicide has resulted in herbicide-resistant weeds and has many ill effects on the natural environment. This has prompted many research studies to seek the most effective weed management techniques. One such technique is computer vision-based automatic weed detection and identification. Using this technique, weeds can be detected and identified and a suitable herbicide can be recommended to the farmers. Therefore, it is important for the computer vision technique to successfully identify and classify the crops and weeds from the digital images.

Hence, intelligent processing of the huge amount of data received by hundreds of earth receiving stations, with specific satellite image oriented approaches, presents itself as a pressing need. One of the most important steps in earlier stages of satellite image processing is cloud detection. Satellite images having a large percentage of cloud cannot be used in further analysis. While there are many approaches that deal with different semantic meaning, there are rarely approaches that deal specifically with cloud detection and retrieval. In this paper we introduce a novel approach that spatially detect and retrieve clouds in satellite images using their unique properties.Our approach is developed as spatial cloud detection and retrieval system (SCDRS) that introduce a complete framework for specific semantic retrieval system.

question answering (QA) benchmarks, pretrained models have reached human parity through fine-tuning on an order of 100,000 annotated questions and answers. We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred training examples are available. We show that standard span selection models perform poorly, highlighting the fact that current pretraining objective are far removed from question answering. To address this, we propose a new pretraining scheme that is more suitable for extractive question answering. Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set all recurring spans but one, and ask the model to select the correct span in the passage for each masked span. Masked spans are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select the answer span.

With this method we can correctly localize 80 \u00c2\u00b1 9 % of the percussive gestures. The user can assign determined pitches to specific positions and change the pitch palette in real time. The tactile feedback characteristic of every surface opens a set of new playing strategies and possibilities specific to any chosen object.

Conventional electroencephalography systems typically suffer from motion artefacts, extensive preparation time and bulky equipment, while existing electroencephalography classification methods require training on a per-subject or per-session basis. Here, we introduce a fully portable, wireless, flexible scalp electronic system, incorporating a set of dry electrodes and a flexible membrane circuit. Time-domain analysis using convolutional neural networks allows for accurate, real-time classification of steady-state visually evoked potentials in the occipital lobe. Compared to commercial systems, the flexible electronics show the improved performance in detection of evoked potentials due to significant reduction of noise and electromagnetic interference.

We need passwords to secure personal information regardless of the platform. People need passwords for almost every system they use. Secured passwords are hard to generate. It is harder to remember and manage them. Password managers claim immense importance in this circumstance, but not all the password managers available to use can always provide the proper security for the passwords and other information given to them. Those are vulnerable when it comes to protecting the information from hackers. This paper presents a proposition of a new and improved approach for password management systems.

The rise of multicore and cloud computing is drastically changing the tradeoffs in operating system design.

Efforts to parallelize monolithic kernels have been difficult and only marginally successful, and new approaches are needed. This paper presents fleets, a novel way of constructing scalable OS services. With fleets, traditional OS services are factored out of the kernel and moved into user space, where they are further parallelized into a distributed set of concurrent, message-passing servers.

The first traffic controller based on fuzzy logic was introduced in 1977. It was designed for two simple one-way streets and on the principle of simply extending the green hour without vehicles being able to alternate. Thereafter, the traffic controllers are advanced and take into account complexity such as movement in all directions, the connection of several sections, phase sequences, congestion and network. The main reason for better development in the field of blur-based traffic controller is due to its constantly improved performance compared to the conventional approach. The fuzzy method has fueled new adaptive traffic control systems as well as the decision-making process for transport management systems. The method has good potential to overcome many traffic-related problems in countries like India, which has many overcrowded metropolitan citi...", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 163489390, "first_name": "Rahul", "last_name": "Vaghela", "domain_name": "gtu-in", "page_name": "RahulVaghela", "display_name": "Rahul Vaghela", "profile_url": "https://gtu-in.academia.edu/RahulVaghela?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 63906552, "title": "Mobile Intelligence Architecture", "created_at": "2021-12-12T06:54:15.711-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63906552/Mobile_Intelligence_Architecture?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_63906552", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76174347, "asset_id": 63906552, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 200733779, "first_name": "Hi", "last_name": "Tech", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HiTech41", "display_name": "Hi Tech", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HiTech41?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/200733779/62192382/50480329/s65_hi.tech.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 308710, "name": "Computer Applications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Applications?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 63825320, "title": "Predictive search distributions", "created_at": "2021-12-10T22:32:25.619-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63825320/Predictive_search_distributions?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_63825320", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76119635, "asset_id": 63825320, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9584079, "first_name": "Felix", "last_name": "Agakov", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FelixAgakov", "display_name": "Felix Agakov", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FelixAgakov?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46254, "name": "Optimization Problem", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Optimization_Problem?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 71546, "name": "Approaches to Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Approaches_to_Learning?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 203338, "name": "Compiler Optimization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Compiler_Optimization?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2814568, "name": "Probability Distribution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Probability_Distribution?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 63645533, "title": "Applied Machine Learning: Reconstruction of Spectral Data for the Classification of Oil-Quality Levels", "created_at": "2021-12-09T05:05:04.638-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63645533/Applied_Machine_Learning_Reconstruction_of_Spectral_Data_for_the_Classification_of_Oil_Quality_Levels?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_63645533", "summary": "In modern complex systems and machines - e.g., automobiles or construction vehicles - different versions of a &quot;Condition Based Service&quot; (CBS) are deployed for maintenance and supervision.

It denies the strong belief that the soft lens wearing will cause no performance degradation. Therefore, it is a necessity for an iris recognition system to be able to detect the presence of soft lens prior to iris recognition. As a first step towards soft lens detection, this study proposed a method for segmenting the soft lens boundary in iris images. However, segmenting the soft lens boundary is a very challenging task due to its marginal contrast. Besides, the flash lighting effect during the iris image enrolment has caused the image to suffer from inconsistent illumination. In addition, the visibility condition of the soft lens boundary may be discerned as a bright or dark ridge as a result of the flash lighting. Three image enhancement techniques were therefore proposed in order to enhance the contrast of the soft lens boundary and to provide an even distribution of intensities across the image. A method called summed-histogram has been incorporated as a solution to classify the visibility condition of the soft lens boundary automatically. The visibility condition of the ridge is used to determine the directional directive magnitude by the ridge detection algorithm. The proposed method was evaluated with Notre Dame Contact Lens Detection 2013 database. Results showed that the proposed method has successfully segment the soft lens boundary with an accuracy of over 92%.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65735992, "asset_id": 45158912, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2688209, "first_name": "WARSE", "last_name": "The World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SenthilKumar32", "display_name": "WARSE The World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SenthilKumar32?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2688209/3880619/4538530/s65_senthil.kumar.gif"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43674906, "title": "Classifying Chest Pathology Images Using Deep Learning Techniques", "created_at": "2020-07-20T20:35:15.982-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43674906/Classifying_Chest_Pathology_Images_Using_Deep_Learning_Techniques?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_43674906", "summary": "In this review, the application of in-depth learning for medical diagnosis will be corrected.

"summary": "The Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment is currently  repared at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR ) in Darmstadt. Its purpose is the exploration of the QCD phase diagram in\nthe region of high baryon densities during highenergy nucleusnucleus\ncollisions. CBM will utilize various particle detectors: Micro Vertex Detector (MVD), Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector (RICH), Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), Time of Flight Detector (TOF), Projectile Spectator Detector (PSD), Silicon Tracking System (STS), Muon hamber (MUCH). In the first version of the CBM readout chain the Data Processing Boards (DPB) were important components responsible for communication between the Front End Electronics (FEE) boards, the Timing and Fast Control (TFC) system, the Experiment Control System (ECS) and the first stage of the data acquisition system First\nLevel Event Selector (FLES). To achieve required level of flexibility, it was necessary to implement it in a parametrized highlevel VHDL code. For even greater flexibility (e.g., for automatic generation of registers with associated IPbus address tables), it was necessary to create new solutions based on automatic generation of the VHDL, XML and Python code from the common description of the system. The system may be a good example of the flexible and parametrized control and data processing firmware. The firmware is currently used in development of readout chain for mCBM and CBM.

Currently, there is a great interest in securing VoIP calls especially after many recent leaks and eavesdropping cases. The most common security enforcer applied to achieve confidentiality is encryption. Applying encryption techniques to VoIP traffic should take into consideration strict delay requirement for real-time traffic. Also, the type of speech coder has also implications as different speech coders have different accumulation and algorithmic delays. Encryption techniques could be used before or after speech coding. In this paper, several experiments have been conducted to assess the effect of encryption, speech coding and packet loss on speech quality. Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) as a speech-specific quality evaluation technique is used in this paper, then it will be mapped to the most common metric in opinion rating; Mean Opinion Score (MOS) values to test the quality of the received voice stream.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51123216, "asset_id": 30682177, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2328357, "first_name": "Journal of Computer Science", "last_name": "IJCSIS", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JournalofComputerScienceIJCSIS", "display_name": "Journal of Computer Science IJCSIS", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JournalofComputerScienceIJCSIS?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2328357/8085511/9052483/s65_journal_of_computer_science.ijcsis.jpg"}, {"id": 58524231, "first_name": "Iman", "last_name": "Almomani", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ImanAlmomani", "display_name": "Iman Almomani", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ImanAlmomani?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30366568, "title": "Simple seed architectures for reciprocal and square root reciprocal", "created_at": "2016-12-10T07:11:16.205-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30366568/Simple_seed_architectures_for_reciprocal_and_square_root_reciprocal?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_30366568", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50817418, "asset_id": 30366568, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34265899, "first_name": "Milos", "last_name": "Ercegovac", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MilosErcegovac", "display_name": "Milos Ercegovac", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MilosErcegovac?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 38866786, "first_name": "Arnaud", "last_name": "Tisserand", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "ArnaudTisserand", "display_name": "Arnaud  Tisserand", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/ArnaudTisserand?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 433, "name": "Computer Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Architecture?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5057, "name": "Iterative Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iterative_Methods?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7973, "name": "Approximation Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Approximation_Algorithms?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13640, "name": "Computer Arithmetic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Arithmetic?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 91936, "name": "Hardware", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hardware?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 207903, "name": "Polynomial Approximation Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Polynomial_Approximation_Theory?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 551418, "name": "Newton-Raphson algorithm", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Newton-Raphson_algorithm?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 907206, "name": "Floating Point", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Floating_Point?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 969030, "name": "Polynomials", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Polynomials?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1809959, "name": "Hardware architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hardware_architecture?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2450622, "name": "Read Only Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Read_Only_Memory?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 5623309, "title": "SWEB: Towards a Scalable World Wide Web Server on Multicomputers", "created_at": "2014-01-06T14:13:57.636-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5623309/SWEB_Towards_a_Scalable_World_Wide_Web_Server_on_Multicomputers?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_5623309", "summary": "We investigate the issues involved in developing a scalable World Wide Web (WWW) server on a cluster of workstations and parallel machines.

This study aimed to develop an adaptive driving cycle for a known route to optimize the energy consumption of an electric vehicle and improve the driving range. A novel distance-based adaptive driving cycle method was developed. The proposed algorithm uses the segmentation and iterative synthesis procedures of Markov chains.

In this study, we have analyzed the improvement achieved by successively addressing these problems in order to determine their severity for sentiment analysis of tweets. Firstly, we prepared a comprehensive data set consisting of Urdu Tweets for sentiment analysis-based hate speech detection. To improve the performance of the sentiment classifier, we employed dynamic stop words filtering, Variable Global Feature Selection Scheme (VGFSS) and Synthetic Minority Optimization Technique (SMOTE) to handle the sparsity, dimensionality and class imbalance problems respectively. We used two machine learning algorithms i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multinomial Na\u00efve Bayes\u2019 (MNB) for investigating performance in our experiments. Our results show that addressing class skew along with alleviating the high dimensionality problem brings about the maximum improvement in the overall performance of the sentiment analysis-based hate

Chinese studies, both applied and theoretical, from the 1920s to the present. It will be shown that, while corpus-based Chinese studies have been gaining momentum for only the last couple of decades, the roots of Chinese corpus linguistics go all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century. Today the bulk of corpus-based Chinese studies is oriented toward applied linguistics, with the compilation of frequency character/word lists and interlanguage Chinese studies being the most popular types of research. In addition to applied linguistic studies, this overview also highlights some innovative corpus studies on lexical and grammatical aspects of both classical and modern Chinese, as well as studies of sociolinguistic variation and discourse pragmatics. Overall, important groundwork in Chinese corpus linguistics is acknowledged and future directions are discussed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87758403, "asset_id": 81861890, "asset_type":

The mission of the NOAA CoastWatch Program is to make ocean satellite data easier to access and to apply to operational uses. As part of this mission, the West Coast Node of CoastWatch developed the NOAA Ocean Satellite Course, which introduces scientists and resource managers to ocean satellite products, and provides them tools to facilitate data access when using common analysis software.

However, their accuracy comes at the cost of intelligibility: it is usually unclear how they make their decisions. This hinders their applicability to high stakes decision-making domains such as healthcare. We propose Neural Additive Models (NAMs) which combine some of the expressivity of DNNs with the inherent intelligibility of generalized additive models. NAMs learn a linear combination of neural networks that each attend to a single input feature. These networks are trained jointly and can learn arbitrarily complex relationships between their input feature and the output. Our experiments on regression and classification datasets show that NAMs are more accurate than widely used intelligible models such as logistic regression and shallow decision trees.

Then, clustering is applied to explore relations between entity pairs. The results of a preliminary experiment, performed on the text extracted from 57 medical records containing more than 20,000 potential relations, show how the clustering should be based on the cosine similarity distance rather than the City Block or Hamming ones.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86436786, "asset_id": 79865465, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

For the past decades, novel methods have been developed for safety and efficacy testing, as well as for improving early development stages. screening methods for drug-receptor binding are considered to be good alternatives for decreasing costs in the identification of drug candidates. However, these methods require lengthy and troublesome labeling steps. Biosensors hold great promise due to the fact that label-free detection schemes can be designed in an easy and low-cost manner. In this paper, for the first time in the literature, we aimed to compare the potential of label-free optical and impedimetric electrochemical biosensors for the screening of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) based on their binding properties to dopamine receptors. Particularly, we have chosen a currently-used atypical antipsychotic drug (Buspirone) for investigating its dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) binding properties using ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85941295, "asset_id": 79105228, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 112898025, "first_name": "Nafiseh", "last_name": "Fahimi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NafisehFahimi", "display_name": "Nafiseh Fahimi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NafisehFahimi?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/112898025/28806344/26896535/s65_nafiseh.fahimi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4331, "name": "Biosensors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biosensors?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10640, "name": "Drug Discovery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drug_Discovery?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64568, "name": "Humans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humans?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 627110, "name": "BioSensors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/BioSensors-1?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1412233, "name": "Biosensing Techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biosensing_Techniques?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2795557, "name": "Antipsychotic agents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antipsychotic_agents?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 3733367, "name": "buspirone ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/buspirone?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 79029531, "title": "AADS - An Automated Active Site Identification, Docking, and Scoring Protocol for Protein Targets Based on Physicochemical Descriptors", "created_at": "2022-05-12T10:33:23.917-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79029531/AADS_An_Automated_Active_Site_Identification_Docking_and_Scoring_Protocol_for_Protein_Targets_Based_on_Physicochemical_Descriptors?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_79029531", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85888261, "asset_id": 79029531, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 144208722, "first_name": "Tanya", "last_name": "Singh", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TanyaSingh210", "display_name": "Tanya Singh", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TanyaSingh210?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/144208722/80813732/69398184/s65_tanya.singh.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 428, "name": "Algorithms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Algorithms?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 522, "name": "Thermodynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thermodynamics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 523, "name": "Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemistry?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 53293, "name": "Software", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Software?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 66379, "name": "Automation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Automation?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 181569, "name": "Proteins", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Proteins?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 645605, "name": "THEORETICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/THEORETICAL_AND_COMPUTATIONAL_CHEMISTRY?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1191356, "name": "Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1222191, "name": "Ligands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ligands?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 78829553, "title": "THE EFFECTS OF WEAK AUTHENTICATION TOWARDS DATA PRIVACY IN NOSQL DATABASES", "created_at": "2022-05-09T02:04:30.782-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78829553/THE_EFFECTS_OF_WEAK_AUTHENTICATION_TOWARDS_DATA_PRIVACY_IN_NOSQL_DATABASES?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_78829553", "summary": "NoSQL databases have become more popular and preferable in modern data architecture. It has become a powerful way to store data in a specialized format that yields fast performance for a large amount of data. NoSQL databases are designed for modern web-scale databases. Although, nowadays, it is used to handle big data and many real-time web applications. They can handle enormous amount of unstructured data and structured data. As a result, developers will be able to be more nimble. NoSQL database developers, for example, may deploy code updates more quickly than relational database developers. However, security remains a very difficult issue even with NoSQL databases, as the security concerns inherent in previous databases have not been resolved in NoSQL. The most common example is that their password storage mechanism is weak, meaning it can be decrypted easily. This means that NoSQL databases have weaknesses and one of them is authentication weakness. This paper evaluates how strong the authentication aspect towards different kinds of attacks on a NoSQL database.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85735192, "asset_id": 78829553, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6514308, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Purnama", "domain_name": "sgu-id", "page_name": "JamesPurnama", "display_name": "James Purnama", "profile_url": "https://sgu-id.academia.edu/JamesPurnama?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6514308/55950793/44140820/s65_james.purnama.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1283, "name": "Information Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Security?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2482, "name": "Database Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Database_Systems?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4252, "name": "Computer Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Networks?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13923, "name": "Computer Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Security?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 27360, "name": "Databases", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Databases?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 78728386, "title": "Design of single axis solar tracking system at photovoltaic panel using fuzzy logic controller", "created_at": "2022-05-08T00:14:12.945-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78728386/Design_of_single_axis_solar_tracking_system_at_photovoltaic_panel_using_fuzzy_logic_controller?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_78728386", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85675200, "asset_id": 78728386, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45235283, "first_name": "ali", "last_name": "musyafa", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "alimusyafa5", "display_name": "ali musyafa", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/alimusyafa5?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45235283/12207272/13594564/s65_ali.musyafa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48, "name": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 637696, "name": "Solar Tracker", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Solar_Tracker?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 742352, "name": "Photovoltaic system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photovoltaic_system?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 78592770, "title": "Signals in Communication Engineering History", "created_at": "2022-05-06T04:18:38.849-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78592770/Signals_in_Communication_Engineering_History?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_78592770", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85587196, "asset_id": 78592770, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28495802, "first_name": "Denise", "last_name": "Consonni", "domain_name": "ufabc", "page_name": "DeniseConsonni", "display_name": "Denise Consonni", "profile_url": "https://ufabc.academia.edu/DeniseConsonni?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28495802/45856594/35622428/s65_denise.consonni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48, "name": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42555, "name": "Communication System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication_System?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55190, "name": "Communication Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication_Technology?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1411313, "name": "Continuous Wave", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Continuous_Wave?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1625072, "name": "Frequency Domain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Frequency_Domain?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 78489980, "title": "Detection and Monitoring of Real -

This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly problematized phenomenon of &quot;echo chambers&quot;, but the causal nature of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an &quot;echo chamber effect&quot;: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion.

Through data augmentation, one can train models with better generalization capabilities and thus achieve greater results in their field of interest. In this work, we explore how to augment a varied set of image datasets through relighting so as to improve the ability of existing models to be invariant to illumination changes, namely for learned descriptors. We develop a tool, based on an encoder-decoder network, that is able to quickly generate multiple variations of the illumination of various input scenes whilst also allowing the user to define parameters such as the angle of incidence and intensity. We demonstrate that by training models on datasets that have been augmented with our pipeline, it is possible to achieve higher performance on localization benchmarks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84870590, "asset_id": 77595793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 161592870, "first_name": "Marc", "last_name": "Pollefeys", "domain_name": "msfinance", "page_name": "MarcPollefeys", "display_name": "Marc Pollefeys", "profile_url": "https://msfinance.academia.edu/MarcPollefeys?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 77593289, "title": "Visual Insights into High-Resolution Earthquake Simulations", "created_at": "2022-04-25T11:17:56.026-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77593289/Visual_Insights_into_High_Resolution_Earthquake_Simulations?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_77593289", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84917037, "asset_id": 77593289, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31557523, "first_name": "J.", "last_name": "Minster", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JMinster", "display_name": "J.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a low-cost, open source SCADA system based on the Internet of Things SCADA architecture. The proposed SCADA system consists of current and voltage sensors for data collection, an ESP32 micro-controller (Remote Terminal Unit) for receiving and processing the sensor data, and ThingsBoard IoT Server (Master Terminal Unit) for historic data storage and human machine interactions. The ThingsBoard IoT Server is locally installed on a Raspberry Pi single-board computer. Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol is implemented for data transfer over a local Wi-Fi connection.

decades, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) has transformed into a widely popular imaging technology which is used in many research and clinical applications. Despite such fast growth in the field, the technology has not been readily accessible to many research laboratories either due to the cost or inflexibility of the commercially available systems or due to the lack of essential knowledge in the field of optics to develop custom-made scanners that suit specific applications. This paper aims to provide a detailed discussion on the design and development process of a typical SD-OCT scanner. The effects of multiple design parameters, for the main optical and optomechanical components, on the overall performance of the imaging system are analyzed and discussions are provided to serve as a guideline for the development of a custom SD-OCT system. While this article can be generalized for different applications, we will demonstrate the design of a SD-OCT s...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84761929, "asset_id": 77403020, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 144123118, "first_name": "Israel", "last_name": "de la Rosa", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IsraeldelaRosa7", "display_name": "Israel de la Rosa", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IsraeldelaRosa7?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/144123118/102556959/91724462/s65_israel.de_la_rosa.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 516, "name": "Optics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Optics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 77351841, "title": "Detection of malicious and non-malicious website visitors using unsupervised neural network learning", "created_at": "2022-04-23T05:18:40.599-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77351841/Detection_of_malicious_and_non_malicious_website_visitors_using_unsupervised_neural_network_learning?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_77351841", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84766998, "asset_id": 77351841, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6057380, "first_name": "Aijun", "last_name": "An", "domain_name": "yorku", "page_name": "AijunAn", "display_name": "Aijun An", "profile_url": "https://yorku.academia.edu/AijunAn?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 37, "name": "Information Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Systems?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 305, "name": "Applied Mathematics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Mathematics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11598, "name": "Neural Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neural_Networks?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 84990, "name": "Clustering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clustering?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 527131, "name": "Denial of Service", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Denial_of_Service?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 77333703, "title": "Crime Prediction using K-means Algorithm", "created_at": "2022-04-23T01:32:54.273-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77333703/Crime_Prediction_using_K_means_Algorithm?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_77333703", "summary": "Crime analysis and prevention is a systematic approach for identifying and analyzing patterns and trends in crime. Our system can predict regions which have high probability for crime occurrence and can visualize crime prone areas. With the increasing advent of computerized systems, crime data analysts can help the Law enforcement officers to speed up the process of solving crimes. About 10% of the criminals commit about 50% of the crimes. Even though we cannot predict who all may be the victims of crime but can predict the place that has probability for its occurrence. K-means algorithm is done by partitioning data into groups based on their means. K-means algorithm has an extension called expectation maximization algorithm where we partition the data based on their parameters. This easy to implement data mining framework works with the geospatial plot of crime and helps to improve the productivity of the detectives and other law enforcement officers.

an input image has hidden data or not, without any prior known information ( i.e., blind) on the applied steganography technique. Recent BIS approaches typically suffer from limited detection accuracy and higher computational cost due to, e.g., pre-processing. In this paper, the proposed BIS approach discards the pre-processing step, so that the computational cost is reduced. As well, significant modifications on a recent convolution neural network (CNN)-model are considered in order to enhance the detection accuracy. First, an efficient parameters initialization is considered. Second, a cyclic learning rate and the LReLU activation function are used, during the learning phase, for faster convergence with noticeably higher detection accuracy. Finally, a hybrid technique of model and data parallelism techniques is performed in both convolution and fully connected layers, respectively, thus significantly reducing the c...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84409514, "asset_id": 76852872, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 142350944, "first_name": "Eslam", "last_name": "Magdy", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "EslamMagdy29", "display_name": "Eslam Magdy", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/EslamMagdy29?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 404233, "name": "Steganalysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Steganalysis?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1568111, "name": "Convolutional Neural Network", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convolutional_Neural_Network?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 76797754, "title": "An Online System for Synchronized Processing of Video and Audio Signals", "created_at": "2022-04-18T02:20:08.741-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76797754/An_Online_System_for_Synchronized_Processing_of_Video_and_Audio_Signals?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_76797754", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84385060, "asset_id": 76797754, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26298877, "first_name": "Mohamed", "last_name": "Elhelaly", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MElhelaly", "display_name": "Mohamed Elhelaly", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MElhelaly?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26298877/7256755/8166673/s65_mohamed.elhelaly.jpg_oh_1a77cd21d7ede1eaf45019867f9c2a90_oe_558c9a15___gda___1431005888_ab9203af54931367187beb54e5878a0c"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2141, "name": "Signal Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Signal_Processing?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4148, "name": "Audio Signal Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audio_Signal_Processing?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5564, "name": "Signal Integrity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Signal_Integrity?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11984, "name": "Speech Recognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Speech_Recognition?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 15250, "name": "Synchronization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Synchronization?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 15661, "name": "Audio Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audio_Processing?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 15665, "name": "Video Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Processing?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 155836, "name": "Audio Visual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audio_Visual?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 167397, "name": "Image recognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Image_recognition?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 313046, "name": "Encoding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Encoding?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 721276, "name": "Active Objects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Active_Objects?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 762830, "name": "Object Detection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Object_Detection?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1931321, "name": "Application Software", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Application_Software?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 2484037, "name": "Synchronisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Synchronisation?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 76768085, "title": "Using Playability Heuristics to Evaluate Player Experience in Educational Video Games", "created_at": "2022-04-17T20:52:30.777-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76768085/Using_Playability_Heuristics_to_Evaluate_Player_Experience_in_Educational_Video_Games?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_76768085", "summary": "Educational video games (EVG) provide a rich platform to improve the Player Experience (PX), and constitute some of the main edutainment applications currently in the market. However, the evaluation of video games as educational tools is very difficult due to their dual nature (fun and education). In some cases, PX (as an usability measure) is a very important aspect of the EVGs and is a good measure of the level of fun and education presented to players. Educational Playability (playability in EVG) attributes are a suitable and effective tool to analyze and measure the experience obtained by a player during a game. To this end, it is necessary to evaluate the playability to determine the degree of improvement in PX. Playability evaluation through different methods is one of the major topics of PX in video games. In this paper, we present a new approach to evaluate the PX by using the educational playability.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84361818, "asset_id": 76768085, "asset_type": "Work",

areas in artificial intelligence. Because, completely different grammatical rules (on which the languages are based on) make the task more complicated. The same problems are found in conversion of Bangla text to English text. Bangla grammar maintains so many rules which make the task harder. Although, a number of researches are done in different area such as Bangla keyboard layout design, English to Bangla translator etc., very few researches are done to translate Bangla text to English. In this paper, we developed a system to do the conversion using OpenNLP tool that performs both statistical and rule based conversion. We have found that using this conversion method it is possible to translate about 40% of text from Bangla to English correctly.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84102434, "asset_id": 76374494, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 220781738, "first_name": "borhan", "last_name": "uddin", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "borhanuddin176", "display_name": "borhan uddin", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/borhanuddin176?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116870, "name": "Bengali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bengali?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 76346127, "title": "Disfluent Oral Reading and Spelling Development", "created_at": "2022-04-13T09:56:08.677-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76346127/Disfluent_Oral_Reading_and_Spelling_Development?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_76346127", "summary": "ED280015 - Disfluent Oral Reading and Spelling Development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84082123, "asset_id": 76346127, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57831225, "first_name": "Donald", "last_name": "Bear", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DonaldBear1", "display_name": "Donald Bear", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DonaldBear1?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88382, "name": "Primary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primary_Education?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 145223, "name": "Developmental Stages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Developmental_Stages?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922114, "name": "Remedial Instruction In English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remedial_Instruction_In_English?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 76269533, "title": "Approximate Range Queries for Clustering", "created_at": "2022-04-12T17:48:43.239-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76269533/Approximate_Range_Queries_for_Clustering?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_76269533", "summary": "We study the approximate range searching for three variants of the clustering problem with a set $P$ of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and axis-parallel rectangular range queries: the $k$-median, $k$-means, and $k$-center range-clustering query problems.

Text-based strong password scheme can provide security to a certain degree. However, the fact that strong passwords being difficult to memorize often leads their owners to write them down on papers or even save them in a computer file. Graphical authentication has been proposed as a possible alternative solution to text-based authentication, motivated particularly by the fact that humans can remember images better than text. Recently, many networks, computer system and Internet-based environments try using graphical authentication techniques as their user\u2019s authentication.

It also has a wide variety of applications, most notably in anatomical research and activity detection. Several mathematical algorithmic approaches have been developed to solve this problem, and some of them have been proven quite robust. However, a lesser amount of attention has been invested into deep learning solutions for it. In this paper, we use a 2-stage variant of the famous U-Net architecture to split the problem space into two sub-problems: shape minimization and corrective skeleton thinning. Our model produces results that are visually much better than the baseline SkelNetOn model.

process is driven by the manipulation of training variables that elicit specific adaptations in order to meet established goals. Periodization is an overall concept of training that deals with the division of the training process into specific phases. Programming is the manipulation of the variables within these phases (sets, repetitions, load) that are needed to bring about the specific adaptations desired within that particular period. The current body of literature is very limited when it comes to how these variables are best combined in an injured population since most of the periodization research has been done in a healthy population.

To date, the blockchain technology has been used for recording transactions and tracking objects in which multiple participants reach a consensus on whether a transaction is valid or not. This paper introduces the novel paradigm of probabilistic blockchains, an extension of the current blockchains that allows building efficient and distributed risk assessment and decision-making applications in which multiple untrusting parties collaborate but may not completely agree on the outcome. The paradigm is particularly useful for risk assessment, where a group of decision-makers needs to decide or analyze an event based on imperfect information.

The use of a wireless network enables enterprises to avoid the costly process of introducing cables into buildings or as a connection between different equipment locations. The basis of wireless systems are radio waves, an implementation that takes place at the physical level of network structure. Wireless network is installations a method by which homes, telecommunications networks and enterprise (business) avoid the costly process of introducing cables into a building, or as a connection between various equipment locations. Delay tolerant networks (DTNs), such as sensor networks with scheduled intermittent connectivity, vehicular DTNs that disseminate location-dependent information, and pocket-switched networks that allow humans to communicate without network infrastructure, are highly partitioned networks that may suffer from frequent disconnectivity. In DTNs, the in-transit messages, also named bundles, can be sent over an existing link and buffered at the next hop until the next link in the path appears. This message propagation process is usually referred to as the \u201cstore-carry-and-forward\u201d strategy, and the routing is decided in an \u201copportunistic\u201d fashion. We aim to evaluate the added effect of the presence of malicious nodes on ad hoc network performance, and determine appropriate measures to detect malicious nodes. A malicious node advertising itself as having a valid route to the destination. With this intension the attacker consumes or intercepts the packet without any forwarding. An attacker can completely modify the packet and generate fake information, this cause the network traffic diverted or dropped. Let H be a malicious node. When H receives a Route Request, it sends back a Route Reply immediately, which constructs the data and can be transmitted by itself with the shortest path. So S receives Route Reply and it is replaced by H->S. then H receives all the data from S. In this research we propose a new assesment based scheme for detection of Malicious Nodes in DTN. And examine different strategies for prevention to malicious nodes as well as Compare out come proposed scheme with the earliest established schemes.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82048135, "asset_id": 73581606, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 64525554, "first_name": "International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology", "last_name": "IJSRCSEIT", "domain_name": "technoscienceacademy", "page_name": "IJSRCSEIT", "display_name": "International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology IJSRCSEIT", "profile_url": "https://technoscienceacademy.academia.edu/IJSRCSEIT?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/64525554/16772444/38453502/s65_international_journal_of_scientific_research_in_computer_science_engineering_and_information_technology.ijsrcseit.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1128, "name": "Computer Science Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science_Education?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1380, "name": "Computer Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Engineering?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7454, "name": "Information Communication Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Communication_Technology?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 470389, "name": "COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COMPUTER_SCIENCE_and_ENGINEERING-3?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1224548, "name": "Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Electrical_and_Computer_Engineering_ECE_?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1226904, "name": "Computer Science and Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science_and_Engineering-1?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 73575806, "title": "A Generative Process for Contractive Auto-Encoders", "created_at": "2022-03-11T20:55:40.559-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73575806/A_Generative_Process_for_Contractive_Auto_Encoders?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_73575806", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82044479, "asset_id": 73575806, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 129728768, "first_name": "Salah", "last_name": "Rifai", "domain_name": "umontreal", "page_name": "SalahRifai", "display_name": "Salah Rifai", "profile_url": "https://umontreal.academia.edu/SalahRifai?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 300, "name": "Mathematics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mathematics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 73561093, "title": "Dense Disparity Map Estimation Respecting Image Discontinuities: A PDE and Scale-Space Based Approach", "created_at": "2022-03-11T12:56:03.726-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73561093/Dense_Disparity_Map_Estimation_Respecting_Image_Discontinuities_A_PDE_and_Scale_Space_Based_Approach?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_73561093", "summary": "We present an energy based approach to estimate a dense disparity map between two images while preserving its discontinuities resulting from image boundaries. We first derive a simpli#ed expression for the disparity that allows us to easily estimate it from a stereo pair of images using an energy minimization approach. We assume that the epipolar geometry is known, and we include this information in the energy model. Discontinuities are preserved by means of a regularization term based on the Nagel-Enkelmann operator. We investigate the associated Euler-Lagrange equation of the energy functional, and we approach the solution of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) using a gradient descent method.

While particular solutions are adopted assuming that only qualified people may implement a weblab, the control of the physical space and the power consumption are often forgotten. Since controlling these two previous aspects may increase the quality of the weblab hosting the remote experiments, this paper proposes the useof a new layer implemented by a domotic system bus with several devices (e.g. lights, power sockets, temperature sensors, and others) able to be controlled through the Internet.

"The para-linguistic information in a speech signal includes clues to the geographical and social background of the speaker. This paper is concerned with recognition of the 14 regional accents of British English. For Accent Identification (AID), acoustic methods exploit differences between the distributions of sounds, while phonotactic approaches exploit the sequences in which these sounds occur. We demonstrate these methods are good complements for each other and use their confusion matrices for further analysis. Our relatively simple i-vector and phonotactic fused system with recognition accuracy of 84.87% outperforms the i-vector fused results reported in literature, by 4.7%. Further analysis on distribution of British English accents has been carried out by analyzing the low dimensional representation of i-vector AID feature space.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

In this field are used the sensitivity analysis as well as simulation and the Design of Experiments (DoE) too. This is necessary to fast prevent failures and solve problems early.

We consider the problem of finding near-optimal solutions for a variety of A/I)-hard scheduling problems for which the objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time. Recent work has led to the development of several techniques that yield constant worst-case bounds in a number of settings. We continue this line of research by providing improved performance guarantees for several of the most basic scheduling models, and by giving the first constant performance guarantee for a number of more realistically constrained scheduling problems. For example, we give an improved performance guarantee for minimizing the total weighted completion time subject to release dates on a single machine, and subject to release dates and/or precedence constraints on identical parallel machines. We also give improved bounds on the power of preemption in scheduling jobs with release dates on parallel machines.

The artificial neural network is trained in a unique way to ensemble the multiple model predictions. The proposed n-semble method is composed of four parts: (1) protein sequences are used to construct feature vectors using physicochemical properties of amino acid; (2) dimensionality reduction is achieved using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) method, (3) the Jaccard method is applied to find likely negative samples from unknown (candidate) genes, and (4) gene prediction is performed with n-semble method.

Based on 3D AAA models, high quality volume meshes were created using an optimal tetrahedral aspect ratio for the whole domain. In order to quantify the WSS and the recirculation inside the AAA, a 3D CFD using finite elements analysis was used. The CFD computation was performed assuming that the arterial wall is rigid and the blood is considered a homogeneous Newtonian fluid with a density of 1050\u2009kg/m3and a kinematic viscosity of4\u00d710-3Pa\u00b7s.

The Goal Question Metric (GQM) ap- proach has proven itself useful in a variety of industrial settings to support quanti- tative software project management. However, it does not address linking software measurement goals to higher-level goals of the organization in which the software is being developed. This linkage is important, as it helps to justify software meas- urement efforts and allows measurement data to contribute to higher-level deci- sions.

We show that, unlike in the other branches of human inquiry where mathematics is merely utilized or applied, computer science also returns additional value to mathematics by introducing certain new computational paradigms and methodologies and also by posing new foundational questions. We emphasize the strong interplay and interactions by looking at some exciting contemporary results from number theory and combinatorial mathematics and algorithms of computer science.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80386454, "asset_id": 70781318, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21476012, "first_name": "Veni Madhavan", "last_name": "C.

A wide variety of systems requires reliable personal recognition schemes to either confirm or determine the identity of an individual requesting their services. The purpose of such schemes is to ensure that the rendered services are accessed only by a legitimate user and no one else. Examples of such applications include secure access to buildings, computer systems, laptops, cellular phones, and ATMs. In the absence of robust personal recognition schemes, these systems are vulnerable to the wiles of an impostor.

The overall properties of FMG are unique and different from any of the individual material that forms it. There is a wide range of applications for FGM and it is expected to increase as the cost of material processing and fabrication processes are reduced by improving these processes. In this study, an overview of fabrication processes, area of application, some recent research studies and the need to focus more research effort on improving the most promising FGM fabrication method (solid freeform SFF) is presented. Improving the performance of SFF processes and extensive studies on material characterization on components produced will go a long way in bringing down the manufacturing cost of FGM and increase productivity in this regard.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80266069, "asset_id": 70567720, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 169498908, "first_name": "Esther", "last_name": "Akinlabi", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AkinlabiEsther", "display_name": "Esther Akinlabi", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AkinlabiEsther?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 130639, "name": "Lecture notes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lecture_notes?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 70543146, "title": "Hybrid Approach to Automation, RPA and Machine Learning: a Method for the Human-centered Design of Software Robots", "created_at": "2022-02-05T05:36:11.432-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70543146/Hybrid_Approach_to_Automation_RPA_and_Machine_Learning_a_Method_for_the_Human_centered_Design_of_Software_Robots?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_70543146", "summary": "One of the more prominent trends within Industry 4.0 is the drive to employ Robotic Process Automation (RPA), especially as one of the elements of the Lean approach.

To successfully address these points there is a need to develop a solution that would adjust to the existing business operations and at the same time lower the negative social impact of the automation process. To achieve these goals we propose a hybrid, human-centered approach to the development of software robots.

The result of the study allows automatic tracking of user\u2019s behavior based on a limited set of observations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80113554, "asset_id": 70305015, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20127042, "first_name": "Veaceslav", "last_name": "Albu", "domain_name": "lamp", "page_name": "VeaceslavAlbu", "display_name": "Veaceslav Albu", "profile_url": "https://lamp.academia.edu/VeaceslavAlbu?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20127042/5807354/6599237/s65_veaceslav.albu.jpg_oh_0172e1b8f6d80336c80d7be1ef2f497a_oe_54e8b94e___gda___1424818150_f9f51f9d30068a6e8b9e759123dd1f9d"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 854, "name": "Computer Vision", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Vision?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158969, "name": "Music Emotion Classification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_Emotion_Classification?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 890015, "name": "Deep Neural Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Neural_Networks?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 70302539, "title": "Applications of Computer Aided Design (CAD) in Medical Image Technology", "created_at": "2022-02-02T23:59:08.851-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70302539/Applications_of_Computer_Aided_Design_CAD_in_Medical_Image_Technology?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_70302539", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80112175, "asset_id": 70302539, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55187527, "first_name": "Khatim", "last_name": "Hasan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KhatimHasan", "display_name": "Khatim Hasan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KhatimHasan?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6160, "name": "Computer Aided Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Aided_Design?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10654, "name": "X-ray imaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/X-ray_imaging?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 226774, "name": "VECTOR", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/VECTOR?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 329268, "name": "Medical Image", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Image?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 70244608, "title": "Fostering Knowledge Mode Conversion in New Product Development Environment", "created_at": "2022-02-01T20:18:39.724-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70244608/Fostering_Knowledge_Mode_Conversion_in_New_Product_Development_Environment?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_70244608", "summary": "The creation of new knowledge that comes from Knowledge Mode Conversion (KMC) activities improves New Product Development (NPD) activities.

Inaccurate death reporting may result in potential misdirection of public health policies. Determining the causes of death is, nevertheless, challenging even for experienced physicians. To facilitate physicians in accurately reporting causes of death, we present an advanced AI approach to determine a chronically ordered sequence of clinical conditions that lead to death, based on decedent&#39;s last hospital admission discharge record.

By learning a more distributed representation of the input space, clustering can be a powerful source of information for boosting the performance of predictive models. While such semi-supervised methods based on clustering have been applied to increase the accuracy of predictions of external tests, they have not yet been applied to improve within-tutor prediction of student responses. We use a widely adopted model for student prediction called knowledge tracing as our predictor and demonstrate how clustering students can improve model accuracy. The intuition behind this application of clustering is that different groups of students can be better fit with separate models. High performing students, for example, might be better modeled with a higher knowledge tracing learning rate parameter than lower performing students. We use a bagging method that exploits clusterings at different values for K in order to capture a variety of different categorizations of students.

"Organizations experience frequent cyber-attacks, and recovery comes at a high cost. Of especially high concern are those breaches involving inter-organizational networks, since repercussions can quickly spread across organizations. We report on a case study of such a security incident. Inter-organizational cooperation was required to detect the scope of the breach and to recover from its effects. Drawing on the resource based view (RBV), we propose that effective response to security incidents relies on bundles of complementary resources (assets and capabilities) available to the cooperating parties. We identify institutional, technical, and organizational resources used during incident response, and analyze to what extent each was complementary to or non-compatible with other resources. Our findings suggest that resources can be complementary in some situations and not complementary in other situations.

First, lacking space, many engineering curricula include few or no statistics courses, and these are often packed and highly theoretical.

One consists in building or modifying systems. The second is measuring/assessing system performances, which are nothing but random variables. Therefore, there can be no engineering work without statistical analyses. In this paper we discuss and assess ways to enhance the insufficient statistical education that many engineers receive once they have left college.

Here, we use magnetoencephalography to study the dynamics of prediction within serially presented adjective\u2013noun phrases, beginning at the point at which the pre-dictive information is first available to the reader. Using corpus transitional probability to estimate the predictability of a noun, we found an increase in activity in the left middle temporal gyrus in response to the presentation of highly predictive adjectives (i.e., adjectives that license a strong noun prediction). Moreover, we found that adjective predictivity and expected noun frequency interacted, such that the response to the highly predictive adjec-tives (e.g., stainless) was ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79650896, "asset_id": 69628934, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33442100, "first_name": "Alec", "last_name": "Marantz", "domain_name": "nyu", "page_name": "AlecMarantz", "display_name": "Alec  Marantz", "profile_url": "https://nyu.academia.edu/AlecMarantz?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 237, "name": "Cognitive Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4972, "name": "Psycholinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psycholinguistics?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5356, "name": "Magnetoencephalography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magnetoencephalography?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 9471, "name": "Reading", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reading?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 21548, "name": "Cognitive Neuroscience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Neuroscience?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 28576, "name": "Prefrontal Cortex", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prefrontal_Cortex?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 57557, "name": "Temporal Lobe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporal_Lobe?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 64568, "name": "Humans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humans?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 98925, "name": "Female", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Female?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 111545, "name": "Male", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Male?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 133057, "name": "Young Adult", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_Adult?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 295155, "name": "Middle Aged", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_Aged?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 382075, "name": "Adult", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adult?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1239755, "name": "Neurosciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neurosciences?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 69625707, "title": "The Development of E-Module Biomolecules for Enzyme Integration of Project Based Learning Models in Accordance With the KKNI Curriculum", "created_at": "2022-01-27T05:14:05.764-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69625707/The_Development_of_E_Module_Biomolecules_for_Enzyme_Integration_of_Project_Based_Learning_Models_in_Accordance_With_the_KKNI_Curriculum?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_69625707", "summary": "The Development of electronic learning media needs to be done in accordance with technological developments.

First, the atmospheric light is estimated at an interval of 6000 frames using the least filtering technique with a dynamic patch.

Data-centric synchronization groups fields of objects into atomic sets to indicate they must be updated atomically.

We present a type system for data-centric synchronization that enables separate compilation and supports atomic sets that span multiple objects, thus allowing recursive data structures to be updated atomically. The type system supports full encapsulation for more efficient code generation. We evaluate our proposal using AJ, which extends the Java programming language with data-centric synchronization. We report on the implementation of a compiler and on refactoring classes from standard libraries and a multi-threaded benchmark to use atomic sets.

One of the main appeals of mobile sensors is the variety of environments in which they can operate as an autonomous network. Different environments, however, present different challenges, especially in terms of inter-sensor communication. In sparse environments, it may not be possible to maintain full connectivity at all times, setting off the need for agents to communicate opportunistically when they are close to each other. This, in turn, suggests that communication needs be taken into account in the design of agents \u2019 trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a notion of tour and meeting point as an abstraction of trajectories designed for both sensing and communication, and we study the tradeoffs involved between motion to sense and sample and motion to communicate and interact.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79477344, "asset_id": 69344736, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30400502, "first_name": "Swapnil", "last_name": "Bhatia", "domain_name": "bu", "page_name": "SwapnilBhatia", "display_name": "Swapnil Bhatia", "profile_url": "https://bu.academia.edu/SwapnilBhatia?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30400502/8820511/9847963/s65_swapnil.bhatia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 440, "name": "Distributed Computing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distributed_Computing?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1036266, "name": "Mobile Sensor Network", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Sensor_Network?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1520657, "name": "Mobile Sensors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobile_Sensors?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 69340426, "title": "5G-Hander: A network service for handover detection in 5G networks", "created_at": "2022-01-24T03:25:11.248-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69340426/5G_Hander_A_network_service_for_handover_detection_in_5G_networks?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_69340426", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79474299, "asset_id": 69340426, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66529230, "first_name": "Christian", "last_name": "Grasso", "domain_name": "unict", "page_name": "ChristianGrasso", "display_name": "Christian Grasso", "profile_url": "https://unict.academia.edu/ChristianGrasso?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 69266556, "title": "Dynamic Selection of Symmetric Key Cryptographic Algorithms for Securing Data Based on Various Parameters", "created_at": "2022-01-23T10:07:45.054-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69266556/Dynamic_Selection_of_Symmetric_Key_Cryptographic_Algorithms_for_Securing_Data_Based_on_Various_Parameters?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_69266556", "summary": "Most of the information is in the form of electronic data.

Data quality is crucial for the success of these systems, and one of the main issues to be solved by businesses in general and by hospitality businesses in particular in this setting is the identification of duplicated customers, which has not received much attention in recent literature, probably and partly because it is not an easy-to-state problem in statistical terms. In the present work, we address the problem statement of duplicated customer identification as a large-scale data analysis, and we propose and benchmark a general-purpose solution for it.

To date, measuring the traffic directly in high load networks is difficult due to high computational costs. On the other hand, accurate estimation of network traffic by means of link load measurements and routing information is currently a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimate end-to-end traffic, inspired by graph embedding. In the proposed approach, we consider a computer network as a time-varying graph. Our model provides explicit routing information to a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) estimator via link load measurements and network topological structure. When explicit routing information is provided, the learning model is only expected to embed the relations between link loads into a traffic estimation vector, instead of figuring out the routing paths. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach outperforms similar estimators in terms of lower estimation error and better tracking the fluctuations.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 212677677, "first_name": "Mohsen", "last_name": "Emami", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MohsenEmami12", "display_name": "Mohsen Emami", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MohsenEmami12?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 26320177, "first_name": "Ali", "last_name": "Zamani", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AliZamani8", "display_name": "Ali Zamani", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AliZamani8?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2008, "name": "Machine Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Machine_Learning?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81182, "name": "Deep Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_Learning?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 301936, "name": "Traffic Matrix", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traffic_Matrix?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 543701, "name": "Network Traffic Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Network_Traffic_Analysis?f_ri=422"}, {"id": 1433808, "name": "Convolutional Neural Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convolutional_Neural_Networks?f_ri=422"}]}, {"id": 67581574, "title": "Applications of digital video : Bandwidth requirements on shared media servers and networks", "created_at": "2022-01-07T22:50:18.023-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67581574/Applications_of_digital_video_Bandwidth_requirements_on_shared_media_servers_and_networks?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_67581574", "summary": "Video servers and high-bandwidth local area networks are rapidly being adopted in broadcast and professional video applications.

We have applied this model to a few sample systems, ranging in complexity from simple disk server architectures to networks with complex topology.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors":

High correlations were found between 2D and 3D systems in all the measured variables. The 2D system was sensitive as the 3D to detect small changes in saddle height. In conclusion, the 2D motion capture system is valid and sensitive for angular kinematic analysis in the sagittal plane.

We attain interpretability by converting the intricate position-dependent textual semantics into binary form, mapping all the features into bag-of-words (BOWs). The binary-form BOWs are encoded so that the information on the aspect and context words are retained for sentiment classification. We further adopt the BOWs as input to the TM, enabling learning of aspect-based sentiment patterns in propositional logic. To evaluate interpretability and accuracy, we conducted experiments on two widely used ABSA datasets from SemEval 2014: Restaurant 14 and Laptop 14. The experiments show how each relevant feature takes part in conjunctive clauses that contain the context information for the corresponding aspect word, demonstrating human-level interpretability. At the same time, the obtained accuracy is on par with existing neural ne...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78080710, "asset_id": 67157040, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

To make this process more direct, intuitive, and efficient, a streamlined interaction design called &quot;User-Generated Variables (UGV)&quot; is proposed. First, the users can declare parameters that they want to tweak in existing programs without reading or understanding the source code.

As the computational workloads grow in quantity, it is becoming more crucial to apply efficient resource management and workload scheduling to use resources efficiently while keeping the computational performance reasonably good. The problem of efficiently scheduling workloads on resources while meeting performance standards is hard. Additionally, non-clairvoyance of job dimen- sions makes resource management even harder in real-world scenarios. Our research methodology investigates the scheduling problem compliant for HPC and researches the challenges for deploying the scheduling in real world-scenarios using state of the art machine learning and data science techniques.To this end, this Ph.D. dissertation makes the following ...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77519017, "asset_id": 66255585, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 133683336, "first_name": "Mina", "last_name": "Naghshnejad", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MinaNaghshnejad", "display_name": "Mina Naghshnejad", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MinaNaghshnejad?f_ri=422", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 66152540, "title": "Fully Immersed, Fully Present: Examining the User Experience Through the Multimodal Presence Scale and Virtual Reality Gaming Variables", "created_at": "2021-12-27T19:00:12.864-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66152540/Fully_Immersed_Fully_Present_Examining_the_User_Experience_Through_the_Multimodal_Presence_Scale_and_Virtual_Reality_Gaming_Variables?f_ri=422", "dom_id": "work_66152540", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77457433, "asset_id": 66152540, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 195842716, "first_name": "Andre", "last_name": "Adame", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AdameAndre", "display_name": "Andre Adame", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AdameAndre?f_ri=422", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/571adad0fc879ffd79c7d10a3d612aea?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=422", "nofollow": false}]}]
