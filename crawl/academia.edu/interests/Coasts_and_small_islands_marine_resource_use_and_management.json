Due to the closure of the Parliament in the UK early for the snap elections, the text is still unfinished and will be resumed for the new Parliament session with no end date set yet. The document is best viewed by a download to Microsoft Word as web browsers tend to muddle the layout. Please note that the ice sheet mass balance changes occur mainly in nearby Iceland, Jan Mayen and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge rather than Greenland itself. (High viscous, low nucleation events pushing very cool, effusive, almost 'solid' lava incursions vertically up like the Mascarene volcanism of Mauritius are rare anomalies from a misaligned hotspot influencing further afield - and therefore far less likely.)", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53115228, "asset_id": 33000316, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

I focus on human-environmental relations in the Torres through the lens of seasonal practices, with special attention to islanders' experiences of mid and long term environmental fluctuations - including predominant winds, changing rainfall patterns, ENSO periodicity and frequent changes to coastal sea levels as a result of seismic shifts. I organize these themes through the framework of food production, namely agroforestry and nearshore tenure, because they represent the most important forms of stewardship over forest and marine resources in the Torres. The purpose of this text is to highlight how key cultural acts and values coexist in complex relations with environmental variability by foregrounding the adaptive capacity of Torres islanders to their anthropogenic land and seascapes. I thereby problematise the notion that islander epistemologies and contexts can be readily translated and integrated into climate adaptation strategies, and suggest ways in which the concern with locally-sensitive policy design may be further refined.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57946202, "asset_id": 2291106, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 182623, "first_name": "Carlos", "last_name": "Mondragon", "domain_name": "colmex", "page_name": "CarlosMondragon", "display_name": "Carlos Mondragon", "profile_url": "https://colmex.academia.edu/CarlosMondragon?f_ri=269731", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/182623/89304/18176414/s65_carlos.mondragon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3255, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16723, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation And Mitigation Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation_And_Mitigation_Strategies?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41201, "name": "Vanuatu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vanuatu?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43828, "name": "Small Island Developing States", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Small_Island_Developing_States?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 45405, "name": "Global Warming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Warming?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 200246, "name": "ENSO", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ENSO?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 269731, "name": "Coasts and small islands, marine resource use and management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coasts_and_small_islands_marine_resource_use_and_management?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 596058, "name": "Small island ecology development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Small_island_ecology_development?f_ri=269731"}]}, {"id": 45009349, "title": "Spatiotemporal determinants of seasonal gleaning", "created_at": "2021-01-29T21:48:44.530-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45009349/Spatiotemporal_determinants_of_seasonal_gleaning?f_ri=269731", "dom_id": "work_45009349", "summary": "1. Many coastal communities depend on ecosystems for goods and services that contribute to human well-being. As long-standing interactions between people and nature are modified by global environmental change, dynamic and diversified livelihood strategies that enable seasonal adaptation will be critical for vulnerable coastal communities. However, the success of such strategies depends on a range of poorly understood influences.\n\n2. Gleaning, the hand-based collection of marine organisms from littoral habitats, provides an interesting case study of dynamic change in social-ecological interactions. It is an important coastal livelihood strategy, yet seasonal gleaning dynamics have not been empirically explored in contemporary communities. We examined seasonal gleaning in eight coastal communities on Atauro Island, Timor-Leste, using household surveys and satellite-derived maps of shallow-water benthic habitats. Our analysis explored the factors affecting household decisions to glean in each season, the relationship between gleaning and seafood consumption, and seasonal gleaning pressure on near-shore coastal resources.\n\n3. Dynamic marine harvesting strategies differed among households and gleaning activity was seasonally heterogeneous. Not all gleaning households gleaned during the season characterised by rough sea conditions despite rough season gleaning being associated with greater seafood consumption stability among seasons. Households also gleaned less regularly, and catches were smaller, in the rough season.\n\n4. Differences in seasonal participation in gleaning were explained mostly by type and extent of shallow habitat proximate to a community. In the calm season, household gleaning was positively related to the total area of shallow habitat, and in the rough season the percentage of hard-bottom shallow habitat was also an important predictor of gleaning activity.\n\n5. Our findings illustrate how changes in the biophysical environment mediate human\u2013nature interactions at fine scales through time and space. Consequently, this research highlights the importance of context\u2010specific perspectives for understanding drivers and dynamics in fishing pressure on littoral ecosystems, access to ecosystem benefits and limits to adaptation. Factors influencing when livelihood activities are feasible and desirable are important for evaluating the social impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of rural communities in the Global South.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65554679, "asset_id": 45009349, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 185163301, "first_name": "Ruby", "last_name": "Grantham", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RubyGrantham1", "display_name": "Ruby Grantham", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RubyGrantham1?f_ri=269731", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 8570474, "first_name": "Jorge", "last_name": "\u00c1lvarez-Romero", "domain_name": "jamescook", "page_name": "jorge_alvarez_romero", "display_name": "Jorge G \u00c1lvarez-Romero", "profile_url": "https://jamescook.academia.edu/jorge_alvarez_romero?f_ri=269731", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8570474/4386860/12525952/s65_jorge._lvarez-romero.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3255, "name": "Climate Change Adaptation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Adaptation?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3708, "name": "Social-Ecological Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social-Ecological_Systems?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10001, "name": "Fisheries Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries_Management?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28157, "name": "Environmental Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Change?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34743, "name": "Small scale fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Small_scale_fisheries?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 35703, "name": "Marine Resource Management/fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_Resource_Management_fisheries?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 36725, "name": "Wellbeing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wellbeing?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 41407, "name": "Marine and Fisheries Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marine_and_Fisheries_Policy?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 42489, "name": "East Timor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Timor?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 67731, "name": "Sustainable Livelihoods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Livelihoods?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 70592, "name": "Timor-Leste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Timor-Leste?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 79742, "name": "Fishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fishing?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 163754, "name": "Littoral", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Littoral?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 184951, "name": "Gleaning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gleaning?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 221331, "name": "Atauro Island", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Atauro_Island?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 269731, "name": "Coasts and small islands, marine resource use and management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coasts_and_small_islands_marine_resource_use_and_management?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 408177, "name": "Climate variability and household livelihoods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_variability_and_household_livelihoods?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 499222, "name": "Rural Livelihood Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Livelihood_Strategies?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 507705, "name": "Traditional Fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Fisheries?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 985490, "name": "Gender and Livelihoods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Livelihoods?f_ri=269731"}]}, {"id": 3678365, "title": "Testing the Efficacy and Reliability of Common Zooarchaeological Sampling Strategies: A Case Study from the Caribbean", "created_at": "2013-06-09T07:47:40.794-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3678365/Testing_the_Efficacy_and_Reliability_of_Common_Zooarchaeological_Sampling_Strategies_A_Case_Study_from_the_Caribbean?f_ri=269731", "dom_id": "work_3678365", "summary": "Zooarchaeological analysis typically involves implementing a suitable sampling strategy that provides meaningful information representative of a site under investigation. To test the efficacy of how various sampling procedures can influence interpretation of a faunal assemblage, we analyzed in full, a large assemblage of mollusks (minimum number of individuals [MNI] = 58,000+) from the late Ceramic Age (ca. AD 850-1440) site of Coconut Walk on the island of Nevis (northern Lesser Antilles, Caribbean). These remains were recovered from 25 discrete 1 \u0002x 1 m units within a larger 5 x \u0002 5 m trench that overlaid a dense midden deposit. Using statistical procedures, we compared the results of the number of identified specimens (NISP), MNI, and weight (g) of each mollusk taxon between both units and plana to determine how different sampling strategies would have affected the interpretation of mollusk composition across space and time had different sampling procedures been used. The results reveal that sampling less than 16% (4 out of 25 squares for this study) of a midden is likely to produce results outside of a 95% confidence interval for the population composition, with samples of connected squares having a higher likelihood to lie outside the interval. Discerning change between plana (or layers) may require a larger sample (i.e., 16%+). In addition, samples selected randomly or judgmentally will produce similar results, provided that proper spacing is given between units. The data in this case suggest that the midden was efficiently sampled for midden composition and key species at a rate of 16% of the surface area.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31367296, "asset_id": 3678365, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 172698, "first_name": "Scott", "last_name": "Fitzpatrick", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "ScottFitzpatrick", "display_name": "Scott Fitzpatrick", "profile_url": "https://uoregon.academia.edu/ScottFitzpatrick?f_ri=269731", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/172698/355830/69836199/s65_scott.fitzpatrick.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3135, "name": "Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Studies?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6873, "name": "Caribbean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_History?f_ri=269731", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7945, "name": "Caribbean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Studies?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 14492, "name": "Coastal and Island Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_and_Island_Archaeology?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 24552, "name": "Caribbean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Archaeology?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 47094, "name": "Faunal Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Faunal_Analysis?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 165119, "name": "Archaeological Faunal Analysis, Shell Artifacts, Fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Faunal_Analysis_Shell_Artifacts_Fisheries?f_ri=269731"}, {"id": 269731, "name": "Coasts and small islands, marine resource use and management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coasts_and_small_islands_marine_resource_use_and_management?f_ri=269731"}]}]
