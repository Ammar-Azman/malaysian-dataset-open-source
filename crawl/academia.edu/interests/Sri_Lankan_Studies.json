Kamalasabeyson PC Memorial Oration delivered Justice Saleem Marsoof PC, Judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka on Friday, 22nd August 2008 at the HNB Towers amidst a distinguished gathering comprising judges, legal luminaries, civil servants and the public. The event was organised by the Kamalasabeyson Foundation. The title of the Oration was \u201cSome Thoughts on the Sovereignty of the People and the Rule of Law.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis oration was delivered to honour one of Sri Lanka's most distinguished Attorneys General who passed away while holding office. Delivered at a time when the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka had become a dead letter, and many of its salutary provisions had gone into disuse due to non-implementation by the Executive, robbing the nation of good governance and democratic rights, the oration traversed some historical events that took place in England and the United States which shaped the concept of Sovereignty of Parliament in both countries, eventually influencing affairs of government in Sri Lanka and the current state of the Rule of Law.  The oration also traversed Sri Lanka history, in particular, the establishment of the Republic of Sri Lanka through an autochthonous constitution in 1972 which broke away from the heritage of British rule in Sri Lanka and the intricacies of the Constitution of 1978 and the state of democracy in Sri Lanka. The oration was well received.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Sarath N. Silva PC and Attorney General C. R. de Silva PC were among the invitees who addressed the gathering on personal notes, prior to the delivery of the oration. The huge and lasting contribution of former Attorney General K. C. Kamalasabeyson PC to the legal jurisprudence of the country, his exceptional court skills, the high level of integrity he upheld throughout his illustrious career and his hallmark gentlemanly ways, were highlighted by the speakers who addressed the gathering.\r\n\r\nThe inaugural K. C. Kamalasabeyson PC award in recognition of Critical Scholarship in the Field of Public Law presented by the K. C. Kamalasabeyson PC Foundation and administered by the Sri Lanka Law College was won by State Counsel Althaf Marsoof.\r\nState Counsel Althaf Marsoof had won several awards in the past including the H.N.G. Fernando Memorial Prize for Legal Research and the Walter Ladduwahetti Gold medal for Excellence. Althaf Marsoof\u2019s critical essay on \u201cThe Doctrine of Separation of Powers and the Independence of the Judiciary in the Modern Constitutional setting in Sri Lanka\u201d was adjudged the best out of a large number of entries by a distinguished panel of judges.The Gold medal, certificate and cash award of Rs. 25,000 was presented to winner Althaf Marsoof by Mrs. Ramani Kamalasabeyson on behalf of the Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe Daughter of the late Attorney General K.C. Kamalasabeyson, Vidhya said the Foundation has the objective to promote charitable and legal education development related causes, including the promotion of critical legal scholarship all over the country.\r\n\r\nA collection of Legal Essays in Honour of Kamalasabeyson edited by Justice Saleem Marsoof and State Counsel N. Wigneswaran was also released with the first copy of the book being presented to Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva PC.\r\n\r\n(This abstract was based on a news report that appeared in the Ceylon Daily News of 25th August 2008.\r\nLink: http://archives.dailynews.lk/2008/08/25/news21.asp)\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54468316, "asset_id": 34602295, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3818971, "first_name": "Saleem", "last_name": "Marsoof", "domain_name": "universityofcolombo", "page_name": "SaleemMarsoof", "display_name": "Saleem Marsoof", "profile_url": "https://universityofcolombo.academia.edu/SaleemMarsoof?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3818971/1391686/17798824/s65_saleem.marsoof.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 546, "name": "Comparative Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Law?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 547, "name": "Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Law?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7554, "name": "Comparative Constitutional Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Constitutional_Law?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21527, "name": "Constitutional Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutional_Theory?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 30471, "name": "Constitutionalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Constitutionalism?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 127081, "name": "Sri Lankan Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Law?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 259733, "name": "Sri Lankan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_history?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 924301, "name": "History of Ceylon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Ceylon?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 59265823, "title": "Impact of Covid-19 and business revival strategies of  event industry in Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2021-10-21T02:55:54.570-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/59265823/Impact_of_Covid_19_and_business_revival_strategies_of_event_industry_in_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_59265823", "summary": "Event industry can be considered as one of the hardly hit industries by the Covid-19 pandemic throughout the world since, main prevention methods of social distancing and banning of getting together  reflect the contrast situation to an essential characteristic of events which is assemble of people to one place. This chapter intends to discuss impact of Covid-19 on event industry of Sri Lanka and business revival strategies. The event industry in Sri Lanka has two main categories as tourism related event industry and local event industry which may interconnected with each other at some occasions. MICE events, destination weddings and heritage festivals are main components of the first category while the second segment is comprising from weddings, parties, musical concerts, other social and entrainment events mainly. Easter bomb attacks on April 2019 caused to the decline of the event tourism and local event industry. Covid-19 pandemic started to spread in March 2020 in Sri Lanka, made a disastrous impact on the recovering event industry from the previous crisis.  Due to prolonged quarantine curfew and national and international travel restrictions, lockdowns, banning of human gatherings, large number of international and local events were cancelled and postponed. Event entrepreneurs lost their income and lot of employees were out from their jobs.  Events were restarted to stage in periods of time between different \u2018waves\u2019 of Covid-19 with released restrictions. Criticisms were made on some events due to violation of health guidelines and making risky environment for further spread of the pandemic. Covid-19 event industry strategies should be developed considering changing markets, direct marketing and product development, flexibility and adaptability, usage of technology and innovative solutions, safety and health within a holistic approach. Virtual and hybrid events, training on virtual technologies and risk management, innovative solutions with immersed experience, collaborative industry approach, adaptation of international best practices, continuous marketing and providing flexible packages can be recognized as potential strategies. \nKey words: Event industry, Covid-19, Business revival, MICE tourism, Event tourism, Sri Lanka\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73276943, "asset_id": 59265823, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 193028567, "first_name": "M.K.

In this 838,600 square mile area, security threats to numerous countries, including the United States, range from disputes over exclusive economic zones to terrorism, piracy, poaching, overfishing, and trafficking of humans, arms, and narcotics. A review of the full spectrum of threats in the Bay of Bengal reveals two dominant security challenges: nascent China-India competition and the likelihood of a natural disaster. This report explores these issues in order to assess U.S. policy options for addressing each of them. It concludes by recommending ways to manage the potential for China-India strategic rivalry and to mitigate the damage of an environmental catastrophe.\r\n\r\nCNA is concluding a yearlong study which explores the greater Asian littoral that runs from the Sea of Japan in the east to the Arabian Sea in the west. The Long Littoral Project examines the five great maritime basins of the Indo-Pacific\u2014the Sea of Japan, the East China and Yellow seas, the South China Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea\u2014in order to provide a different perspective, namely a maritime viewpoint, on the security issues that the United States must confront as it \u201crebalances\u201d to a stronger maritime orientation focused on the Indo-Pacific littoral.

Even as there is much talk about the Canadian Tamil diaspora, the largest population of Sri Lankan Tamils outside of Sri Lanka itself, there is, maybe quite surprisingly, very little actually written about organisational dynamics in the community. In attempting to fill this gap in the research, this paper makes several inter-related arguments: first, far from being monolithic or homogenous, Tamil diaspora politics in Canada is constantly in flux. Second, with respect to issues of reconciliation among ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, as well as economic and social development, the diaspora\u2019s role is ambiguous at best. What is clear, however, is that in the post-war period, the \u201corganisational field\u201d has become quite diverse, and the diaspora\u2019s role in reconciliation and economic development is being openly and actively debated and criticized. I begin by providing a brief overview of scholarly debates surrounding the definition of \u201cdiaspora\u201d as well as a snapshot of the Canadian Tamil community, before examining the pre and post 2009 organisational dynamics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32577909, "asset_id": 5458036, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 219785,

"summary": "A strand of Sri Lankan Buddhist revivalism that emerged in 2008 offers an unconventional rejoinder to evangelical efforts to intensify conversions. Pentecostals assert that Christ offers instantaneous salvation whereas Theravada Buddhism demands slow passage through many lifetimes of suffering. In contrast to concomitant political efforts to curb conversions, one maverick Buddhist monk implicitly responded to such competitive theological provocations by enlisting devotees to engage in ritual and moral cultivation to foreshorten the far-future arrival of the messianic Bodhisatva Maitreya. Neither derivative, nor 'syncretic', the maverick's efforts to fortify Buddhism are nevertheless dialogically responsive to multiple sources of religious competition.

Seven youth sub-cultures in which war trauma is a predominant factor are identified.

The Indian nuclear program continues to develop improved weapons technologies and economic development with the potential to proliferate nuclear material. India since 1947, in order to develop a comprehensive strategy that utilizes all the instruments of national power that will encourage India to become a responsible stakeholder among the nuclearized countries and demonstrate the responsibility that goes along with nuclear technology. India\u2019s nuclear policy was also influenced by India\u2019s international security condition as well as by domestic variables such as the vagaries of political change and the in\ufb02uence of bureaucratic elites.

This question is supplemented by a discussion of the aesthetic modes of two Sinhala novels: Martin Wickramasinghe\u2019s Gampera\u1e37iya (1944) and Vir\u0101gaya (1956). The method of historicizing that is proposed involves two interpretative levels that follow the contours of Dipesh Chakrabarty\u2019s categories of History 1, or history posited by capital, and History 2, or histories outside the life processes of capital. While History 1 enables a totalizing interpretation which allows Gampera\u1e37iya and Vir\u0101gaya to be thought of as embodying a narrative/realist aesthetic and affective/modernist aesthetic respectively, History 2 enables a close scrutiny of specific aspects of aesthetic mediation and play which complicate History 1\u2019s totalizing and often Eurocentric thrust.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68250652, "asset_id": 50159946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44037607, "first_name": "Praveen", "last_name": "Tilakaratne", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "PraveenTilakaratne", "display_name": "Praveen Tilakaratne", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/PraveenTilakaratne?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44037607/29066446/49221833/s65_praveen.tilakaratne.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7888, "name": "Literary Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Theory?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10806, "name": "Marxist theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxist_theory?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12304, "name": "Sinhala", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinhala?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 17365, "name": "South Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Literature?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 63862090, "title": "\"New patriotism\" in post-war Sri Lanka and the revival of the Walauva as a site of power in contemporary Sri Lankan English fiction", "created_at": "2021-12-11T12:39:21.588-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63862090/_New_patriotism_in_post_war_Sri_Lanka_and_the_revival_of_the_Walauva_as_a_site_of_power_in_contemporary_Sri_Lankan_English_fiction?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_63862090", "summary": "An emerging body of fiction by contemporary English novelists in Sri Lanka during the immediate post-civil war decade (2010-2020) indicates a renewed interest in the feudal grand house (the walauva) as a site of power. Often described in romantic terms and presented from positions of entitlement, in its renewed form, the walauva is constructed as a benevolent patriarchal system in which class superiors and servants share cordial and meaningful relationships. With primary reference to Nayomi Munaweera's \"What Lies Between Us\", Madhubhashini Ratnayake's \"There is Something I Have to Tell You\" and Charulatha Thewarathanthri's \"Stories\", I place this emergent romanticized impression of the feudal grand house within the centralist power agenda of majoritarian populism prevalent in post-civil war Sri Lanka: a mass consciousness engineered by Sinhalese nationalist political fronts postwar, which historian Nira Wickramasinghe terms Sri Lanka's 'new patriotism'. While appreciating the contemporary writer's imagination as being shaped by demands of 'new patriotism' the article identifies a deviation of her reading from the representations of the walauva as a site of power by Sri Lanka's English literary canon from the 1950s to the mid-1990s.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76144912, "asset_id": 63862090, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 155551265, "first_name": "Vihanga", "last_name": "Perera", "domain_name": "pera", "page_name": "VihangaPerera", "display_name": "Vihanga Perera", "profile_url": "https://pera.academia.edu/VihangaPerera?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/155551265/45682613/37051741/s65_vihanga.perera.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17365, "name": "South Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Literature?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24457, "name": "Sri Lankan Literature in English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Literature_in_English?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 132900, "name": "Commonwealth and Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commonwealth_and_Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27066087, "title": "The Black Prince\u2019s Chapel: An architectural record of the Church of Our Lady of the Gate of Heaven, Telheiras, Lisbon", "created_at": "2016-07-18T03:50:59.855-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27066087/The_Black_Prince_s_Chapel_An_architectural_record_of_the_Church_of_Our_Lady_of_the_Gate_of_Heaven_Telheiras_Lisbon?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_27066087", "summary": "The church of Our Lady of the Gate of Heaven, Telheiras, Lisbon is historically unique in relation to the political and religio-cultural affairs of Sri Lanka and Portugal during the Portuguese overseas expansions of the 16th and 17th centuries.

Focusing on research about Buddhist nuns from Sri Lanka and including conversations with Theravada and Tibetan Buddhist nuns from around the world, the book raises important theoretical questions about the applicability of modern liberal ideas of \u201cempowerment,\u201d \u201cagency,\u201d \u201cautonomy,\u201d \u201cfreedom,\u201d and \u201cresistance\u201d in the translation of the lives of Buddhist nuns. It engages canonical Buddhist texts and contemporary religious practices as it considers the construction of the female renunciant as a modern \u201cthird-world\u201d subject and questions the idea that the higher ordination of Sri Lankan nuns has been the outcome of a feminist \u201cmovement.\u201d By reflecting on colonialist readings of nuns\u2019 lives and on debates about their higher ordination, this book not only asks new questions about the politics of representation regarding the lives of female renunciants but also makes a case for a more nuanced and sensitive reading of their practices. On the basis of extensive long-term research, the book breaks new ground by proposing that key Buddhist concepts such as dukkha and sams\u0101ra, the everyday renunciant practices of nuns, and the upasampad\u0101 (higher ordination) itself cannot be subsumed under liberal feminist paradigms, and it argues that the idea of an \u201cauthentic\u201d Theravada upasampad\u0101 for bhikkhun\u012bs is inseparable from claims about specific ideas of monastic seniority and power.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37948212, "asset_id": 13111273, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

This has likely been conditioned by the Catholic religion of the Negombo Fishermen\u2019s Tamil\u2013 speaking community within a predominantly Buddhist and Hindu society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35334935, "asset_id": 8691204, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18189255, "first_name": "Steven", "last_name": "Bonta", "domain_name": "altoona-psu", "page_name": "StevenBonta", "display_name": "Steven C Bonta", "profile_url": "https://altoona-psu.academia.edu/StevenBonta?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18189255/5797796/6588614/s65_steven.bonta.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12271, "name": "Sinhala and Dravidian languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinhala_and_Dravidian_languages?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12302, "name": "Tamil", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tamil?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 19827, "name": "Indo-Aryan Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Aryan_Linguistics?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 50450, "name": "Dravidian Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dravidian_Linguistics?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 96940, "name": "Tamil Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tamil_Studies?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 416434, "name": "Indo-Aryan Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Aryan_Languages?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 1593777, "title": "ADJOURNMENT MOTION: FACILITIES FOR DISABLED PEOPLE AT PUBLIC PLACES, PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES (HANSARD),Wednesday, 07th December, 2011, Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2012-05-26T16:31:08.780-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1593777/ADJOURNMENT_MOTION_FACILITIES_FOR_DISABLED_PEOPLE_AT_PUBLIC_PLACES_PARLIAMENTARY_DEBATES_HANSARD_Wednesday_07th_December_2011_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_1593777", "summary": "205 \u0dc0\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dab\u0dca\u0da9\u0dba - 6 \u0dc0\u0db1 \u0d9a\u0dbd\u0dcf\u0db4\u0dba\n\u0bc6\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbf 205 - \u0b87\u0bb2. 6\nVolume 205 - No. 6\n2011 \u0dd9\u0daf\u0dc3\u0dd0\u0db8\u0dca\u0db6\u0dbb\u0dca 07 \u0dc0\u0db1 \u0db6\u0daf\u0dcf\u0daf\u0dcf\n2011 \udbc7\udf8a\u0b9a\u0bae\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0bcd 07, \udbc7\udf97\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bc8\u0bae\nWednesday, 07th December, 2011", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 15038936, "asset_id": 1593777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17076, "first_name": "Fiona Kumari", "last_name": "Campbell", "domain_name": "dundee", "page_name": "FionaKumariCampbell", "display_name": "Fiona Kumari Campbell", "profile_url": "https://dundee.academia.edu/FionaKumariCampbell?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17076/5720/69695952/s65_fiona_kumari.campbell.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5321, "name": "International Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17808, "name": "International Refugee Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Refugee_Law?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30160, "name": "Minority Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Rights?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 127079, "name": "Disability Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Law?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 159181, "name": "Equality and Non Discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equality_and_Non_Discrimination?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 485619, "name": "Sri Lanka Disability Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka_Disability_Law?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 995404, "name": "The Rights of Persons With Disabilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Rights_of_Persons_With_Disabilities?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 45253421, "title": "Pro Rata Calculations For Machine Learning in Construction economics", "created_at": "2021-02-28T07:25:16.934-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45253421/Pro_Rata_Calculations_For_Machine_Learning_in_Construction_economics?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_45253421", "summary": "This guide is to provide scientific analysis for contacting works (asphalt works) paver and roller prices derivatives discussed.

A related claim, dependent on the first of the two, is that the irrealis interpretation conveyed by jang(an) makes it a semantically plausible bridge from a Malay grammar with clausal symmetry to the grammar of Sri Lankan Malay. In Sri Lankan Malay, embedded clauses are frequently non-finite, with infinitives similarly conveying irrealis meaning.

Today, Sri Lanka is a former war zone where the Government\u2019s troops defeated the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE or Tamil Tigers) and ended 26 years of violent conflict in May 2009. \r\n\r\nThe end of the war came at a huge cost to civilian life in the northern part of the country; the UN estimates that over 40,000 people were killed,most of whom were Tamils who form the majority in Northern Sri Lanka. Despite the end of military conflict, war continues by other means, and its representation encapsulates a nationalist politics of victory that at once vilifies the defeated LTTE \u201cterrorists\u201d and excludes Northern Tamils from the Sri Lankan polis. The LTTE\u2019s former hideouts, training facilities, weapons, and vehicles are now tourist sites on display for public viewing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34376724, "asset_id": 7890390,

Scholars who belong to the youthful discipline of 'critical' heritage studies now view cultural conservation, preservation and heritage place-making as activities with far-reaching national and global repercussions. In East Asia, for the last thirty-plus years, heritage 'wars' have been fought between Japan on the one side, and South Korea and China on the other, over the public remembrance of these nations' violent twentieth century histories. UNESCO, and other international organizations dedicated to the universalizing and peace-making potential of cultural heritage, have become battle grounds in such contests. Alternatively, some experts argue that heritage-making has equally become the basis for international diplomacy and cooperation aimed at longer-term regional peace-making. UNESCO, it could be argued, still has the potential to bring together states yet to forgive one another for the atrocities of the past, around the same negotiating table.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56659050, "asset_id": 36718165, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5633584, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Frost", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "MarkFrost", "display_name": "Mark R Frost", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/MarkFrost?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5633584/4100847/86738221/s65_mark.frost.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4723, "name": "Imperial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperial_History?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 18970, "name": "British Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperialism?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 545153, "name": "Critical Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 40133197, "title": "Non English Speaking Families, Their Children and English Medium Education: A Socio-Educational Analysis", "created_at": "2019-08-20T17:24:05.666-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40133197/Non_English_Speaking_Families_Their_Children_and_English_Medium_Education_A_Socio_Educational_Analysis?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_40133197", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60348553, "asset_id": 40133197, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36262085, "first_name": "Kanishka", "last_name": "Biyanwila", "domain_name": "urbaniana", "page_name": "KanishkaBiyanwila", "display_name": "Kanishka Biyanwila", "profile_url": "https://urbaniana.academia.edu/KanishkaBiyanwila?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36262085/10441523/95738897/s65_kanishka.biyanwila.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22198, "name": "Secondary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secondary_Education?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44765, "name": "International Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Schools?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 15431128, "title": "Ethnic Conflict, War Crimes and Human Rights:  Revisiting U.S Sponsored UNHRC Resolution  against Sri Lanka in 2013", "created_at": "2015-09-05T18:12:07.764-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15431128/Ethnic_Conflict_War_Crimes_and_Human_Rights_Revisiting_U_S_Sponsored_UNHRC_Resolution_against_Sri_Lanka_in_2013?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_15431128", "summary": "The civil war ended in 2009 but four years later the country has yet to find its path of reconciliation and to heal the wounds of war. At the present time it also appears that Sri Lanka is moving backwards, and not forwards, in terms of securing the rule of law and reconciliation. This has impacted negatively on the rule of law and by extension the protection of human rights and political accountability. There is also the rise of inter-religious tensions fanned by government allies. A new dimension of inter-communal unrest is the rise of Buddhist extremism in some quarters; it has targeted the Muslim community and taken on an open and frontal confrontational approach.  One of the main elements of external intervention in the internal affairs of post-war Sri Lanka is the continuing pressure being brought to bear on the government to adopt a system of provincebased devolution as one of the instrumentalities of ethnic reconciliation. It is, indeed, unfortunate that the LLRC itself has made a similar prescription. There is no evidence in the voluminous report produced by the Commission that it made any attempt to draw \u2018lessons\u2019 relevant to the subject of territorial devolution and sub-national inter-group conflict from our own experiences, leave alone the abundance of international experiences. Its recommendation, however, has had the effect of legitimizing the demand made by the global west which, in earlier times, was so obviously based on a nakedly superficial, local NGO-nurtured, understanding of Sri Lankan affairs.

I am in the final stages of drafting a longer and more detailed account. In the meantime given little has been written on the subject, I will keep this paper online.\n\nIn terms of religious proclivities hegemonic discourses present Sri Lanka as an Island populated by the four main world religions:  Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Judaism and the Jew is absent from official discourses to the extent that it is a commonly held belief that \u201cthere have never been any Jews in Sri Lanka\u201d. Although somewhat erroneous and imprecise, the view articulated is that unlike India, there have not been any Jewish communities in Sri Lanka. This paper challenges that view by providing a preliminary historical foray into Jewish life in Sri Lanka. First is a discussion about the methods of research and climatic difficulties. The discussion moves onto consider the relationship between Jewish pogroms in the 1500s \u2013 1700s and the conquest of the Ceylon by the Portuguese (1505 \u2013 1656), Dutch (1656 \u2013 1796) and finally the British (1796 \u2013 1948). There is a brief consideration of the Jewish presence in Sri Lanka before the Portuguese conquest, shifting to a more nuanced articulation of Jewish relations under Portuguese and Dutch occupation.  The later part of the paper is concerned with identifying Jewish communal life under the British until Ceylonese independence in 1948.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 15011672, "asset_id": 1592629, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17076, "first_name": "Fiona Kumari", "last_name": "Campbell", "domain_name": "dundee", "page_name": "FionaKumariCampbell", "display_name": "Fiona Kumari Campbell", "profile_url": "https://dundee.academia.edu/FionaKumariCampbell?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17076/5720/69695952/s65_fiona_kumari.campbell.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6627, "name": "Jewish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_History?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 259733, "name": "Sri Lankan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_history?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 493266, "name": "Asian Jews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Jews?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 5184464, "title": "Teacher\u2019s Satisfaction of Assessment Process of Competency  based Curriculum in Primary School Education in Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2013-11-22T01:15:32.825-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5184464/Teacher_s_Satisfaction_of_Assessment_Process_of_Competency_based_Curriculum_in_Primary_School_Education_in_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_5184464", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32373991, "asset_id": 5184464, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6338519, "first_name": "Thevarasa", "last_name": "Mukunthan", "domain_name": "ousl", "page_name": "ThevarasaMukunthan", "display_name": "Thevarasa Mukunthan", "profile_url": "https://ousl.academia.edu/ThevarasaMukunthan?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6338519/2585738/31897564/s65_thevarasa.mukunthan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1750, "name": "Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88382, "name": "Primary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primary_Education?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2607907, "title": "Pain, Pride, and Politics: Social Movement Activism and the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora in Canada", "created_at": "2013-02-19T04:43:48.719-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2607907/Pain_Pride_and_Politics_Social_Movement_Activism_and_the_Sri_Lankan_Tamil_Diaspora_in_Canada?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_2607907", "summary": "This book provides an in depth examination of the ways in which a separatist socio-political movement beginning in Sri Lanka is carried forward, altered, and adapted by the diaspora, and the struggles that are involved in this process.

"work_33998007", "summary": "One of the most popular teacher training programmes of study conducted by The Faculty of Education of the Open University of Sri Lanka is the Post Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) Programme. One of the aims of this programme is to upgrade student teachers\u2019 theoretical knowledge and practical skills with regard to the Teaching \u2013 Learning process. Teaching practice is the most important component of the PGDE programme which is conducted in two stages. The first stage is conducted in the student teachers\u2019 schools itself, which has a duration of 10 weeks. During this period, the student teacher has to write 100 lesson plans and teach 100 periods. A Master Teacher (MT) appointed and trained by the department, visits the student teachers\u2019 school five times during this period to supervise and evaluate five lessons. The department always strives to improve the quality of teaching practice, through various strategies. The analysis of master teachers\u2019 evaluation reports on student teachers\u2019 progress is one of them. The stage II of the teaching practice component is the final evaluation and is conducted at a school selected by the University and is evaluated by a different examiner. The main aim of this study is to investigate student teachers\u2019 performance during teaching practice stage I, according to the perceptions of master teachers. This paper deals specifically with the progress of lesson plan writing and classroom management. The sample of the study consisted of 400 student teachers. The data collection instruments were the two evaluation reports completed by the MTs. The findings of the study revealed that the student teachers\u2019 writing of lesson plans and classroom management have improved according to the MTs\u2019 perception.

It uses Aleksei Fyodorovich Losev\u2019s theory of myth as the framework for the analysis of the Culladhanuggaha J\u0101taka as myth and the changes that the story undergoes when it enters the realm of art.  The paper argues that while the transference of the story from myth to art strips the story of much of its mythical character, the story even in its new context remains tied to the notion of myth in an important manner.  The paper concludes with the argument that the theatrical pieces in question embody a broader consciousness defined by both the mythical consciousness and the poetic consciousness in the Losevian

As so often, good scientific dates obtained from specimens must be tempered by their context: brick may be replaced or recycled during repair and embellishment.

Revenue for government spending is generally raised from taxes, levies, service fees, \nand licenses. Local governments differ in the extent to which they can raise sufficient funding \nwithin the local government area for the services for which they are responsible. Therefore, \nlocal governments receive a smaller or larger part of their funding from revenue raised at their \nterritory level. Furthermore, the ways in which revenue is raised have implications for equity \nand economic stimulation. For a number of reasons, local governments have responsibilities for \nthe development of certain sectors of the economy by providing a limited range of social \nservices and public amenities. In the recent years, administering revenue generation has \ntranscended all known considerations in importance because the extent to which local \ngovernment executed its development projects depends, largely, on the amount of revenue \ngenerated. Each local government body of any state has a number of ways through which it \ndenied revenue required to meet up its public expenditure needs.  It is in view of this that the \nchallenge is taken to examine the sources of revenue as well as problems encountered in \nrevenue generation in the Municipal Council of Sri Lanka. This study focuses on the revenue \ncollections and related issues in Akkaraipattu Municipal Council in Sri Lanka. The prime \nobjective of this study is to evaluate the revenue collections of the Municipal Council from the \nlast two years. The fundamental questions of this research are:  how does the local body \ngenerate the income, what are the problems faced by the council during revenue collection, and \nhow can they improve their revenue collection at the local level.  \nKey Words: Local Government, Revenue & Local Government, Income, Expenditure, Sri Lanka ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37861565, "asset_id": 12877640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26237915, "first_name": "Seeni Mohamed", "last_name": "Aliff", "domain_name": "seu-lk", "page_name": "aliffseenimohamed", "display_name": "Seeni Mohamed  Aliff", "profile_url": "https://seu-lk.academia.edu/aliffseenimohamed?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26237915/9538924/10626412/s65_aliff.seeni_mohamed.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5938, "name": "Local Government", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_Government?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12978, "name": "Muslim Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Minorities?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 2186853, "title": "Are Sri Lanka's Relations with China Deepening?

Such high-profile moves have unnerved analysts fearing the rise of Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean region. A first-time, systematic analysis of the trends in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic, military, and diplomatic relations with China reveals that ties have indeed been strengthening. However, Sri Lanka is neither bandwagoning with nor balancing China, as structural realism predicts.

This exploratory and pure type research was conducted under the deductive thinking mode and qualitative research approach. With the independence of the Kandyan Kingdom in 1593 AD, Kandyans have tactically allowed the Portuguese invaders to conquer Senkadagala. But the Portuguese couldn't stay there as the Senkadagala city was already burnt down by Kandyans. On the way back to Colombo, the Portuguese army was ambushed and destroyed by the well planned surprise attack of Kandyans in the mountains of Danture. When the Portuguese invaded the Kandyan Kingdom for the second time in 1603 AD, about 94% of them were comprised of local lowland Lascar soldiers. The Portuguese had been defeated by a surprise attack which was planned by the Kandyan king to separate the Lascar Leaders from the Portuguese. At the next Portuguese invasion in 1630 AD, Kandyans demonstrated that they were fleeing in to the Kandyan land and let Portuguese to pursue them. Suddenly, Kandyans launched a surprise attack on the Portuguese army and the retreating Portuguese army was ambushed and destroyed in Randeniwela. Again the Senkadagala city had been allowed to be conquered in the last Portuguese invasion in 1638 AD. Portuguese were trying to escape form Senkadagala because Portuguese did not receive the support of King Vijayapala of Matale as they planned earlier. In Gannoruwa, near the Mahaweli River, the armies of King Wijayapala and King Rajasingha II have launched a surprise attack and Portuguese were massacred. The research reveals that the Kandyan Army has used surprise, which is combined with its geographic features, as their foremost military tactic to defeat the highly advanced western military knowledge.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65269961, "asset_id": 44778138, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 115648841, "first_name": "Thushara", "last_name": "Witharana", "domain_name": "sab", "page_name": "thusharawitharana", "display_name": "Thushara Witharana", "profile_url": "https://sab.academia.edu/thusharawitharana?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/115648841/33874876/32258784/s65_thushara.witharana.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 580, "name": "Tactics (Military Science)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tactics_Military_Science_?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29327, "name": "Ancient Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Military_History?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32446, "name": "History of War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_War?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 67861, "name": "Medieval Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Military_History?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 259733, "name": "Sri Lankan history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_history?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 336184, "name": "Medieval Battle Tactics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Battle_Tactics?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 389228, "name": "Ancient Military Tactics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Military_Tactics?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 724025, "name": "Military Strategy and Tactics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_Strategy_and_Tactics?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 798021, "name": "Ancient battle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_battle?f_ri=52371"}]}, {"id": 14945565, "title": "Views from India\u2019s Smaller Maritime Neighbors", "created_at": "2015-08-15T13:16:34.363-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14945565/Views_from_India_s_Smaller_Maritime_Neighbors?f_ri=52371", "dom_id": "work_14945565", "summary": "India\u2019s smaller maritime neighbors are paying close attention as New Delhi consolidates the country\u2019s ambitions in the Indian Ocean.

This differentiation causes serious environmental impacts in rural as well as urban areas due to unplanned growth strategies adapted in settlement development work. This devastating environmental impacts are not considered currently even in global contest. Generally, cities are the places where opportunities popping up and dynamic in nature. Rural areas are the places with lifelong stagnation in every form of livelihood improvement and land is always exploited for primary production. Most of the villagers become laborers in their own fields where they cannot get fair price for their own products due to lack of appropriate marketing channels. Hence, people are trying to find better pastures in cities while providing cheap labor to run service oriented city economies. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67377969, "asset_id": 48988982,

He articulates that he crafted these instruments not for earning money or to become popular as a good craftsman or musician but for his own personal satisfaction. The extended discussion with him implied that It is not that \"he just makes instruments for his own satisfaction\" but there are other reasons tied together with his background, crafting skills and musical interests, opinions about the society and his world view. In this research, his views on music, musical instrument playing, crafting and commoditization of musical instruments are explored. previous literature on organology, musical instrument making, and some socio-musicological studies are investigated in this regard as well as personal interviews with the craftsman were conducted in order to gather information that will be finally discussed.

In urban areas, it has become increasingly common over the last (approximately) forty years for many younger native speakers to be less fluent and less expressive in SLM than in other languages that they may have acquired as second languages in childhood or simultaneously with SLM, including Sinhala, English, and in a number of areas, Tamil/Shonam. This intergenerational decline in fluency is less evident in several smaller up-country (highland) communities. By contrast, the Malay residents of the southeastern coastal village of Kirinda, consisting of four hundred families, have thus far experienced no intergenerational decline whatsoever, and are effectively SLM-dominant from earliest childhood. There is strong dialect differentiation between (1) the western coastal area including Colombo, (2) the up-country area including Kandy, and (3) the southeastern area including Kirinda and Hambantota. Most of the data I have used in this APiCS contribution, with the exception of a small number of references to Colombo Malay, come from the variety of SLM spoken daily by all generations in Kirinda. This variety is ordinarily referred to by its speakers as Java (\"Javanese\"). It is the default lect in APiCS. While speakers of the Kirinda variety understand SLM varieties spoken elsewhere on the island, speakers from outside the southeastern region will find some of its vocabulary, functional morphology, and constructions to be unfamiliar or opaque, although rarely to the point of communicative breakdown.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4097631, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Slomanson", "domain_name": "uta-fi", "page_name": "PeterSlomanson", "display_name": "Peter Slomanson", "profile_url": "https://uta-fi.academia.edu/PeterSlomanson?f_ri=52371", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4097631/1580242/1912802/s65_peter.slomanson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1205, "name": "Contact Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contact_Linguistics?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9850, "name": "Sri Lanka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52371, "name": "Sri Lankan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Studies?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 98213, "name": "Language Description", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Description?f_ri=52371", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 234902, "name": "Languages in Contact", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_in_Contact?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 282419, "name": "Sri Lanka Malay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lanka_Malay?f_ri=52371"}, {"id": 2098944, "name": "Sri Lankan Malay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sri_Lankan_Malay?f_ri=52371"}]}]
