Like the rest of Thai/Malay peninsula, although the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Thailand\u2019s far-south are conservative traditionalists, the size and influence reformist Islam continues to increase. This is particularly the case among urban Malays. While the roots of reformism were sown in the 19th century by luminaries such as Syeikh Daud al-Fatani (1769-1847), and Syeikh Ahmed al-Fatani (1856-1908), the most important reformist personality in the early 20th centuries was Haji Sulong (1895-1945). Since his return from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, Dr Ismail Lutfi Japakiya, the founding of rector of Yala Islamic University (Thailand\u2019s first Islamic university) has emerged as the leader of Saudi style salafism. I conclude by considering the impact of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at, a South Asian revival movement, on Islamic diversity in South Thailand since its arrival in the 1980s. A important point infrequently made in analysis of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at is that both reformists and traditionalists are involved in this important revivalist movement.",

The study examines the literature consisting of a variety of primary and secondary sources to show that the Malay students in Cairo were involved in various social and political activities,\nwhere they developed a spirit of patriotism after the Second World War. Apart from establishing a good relationship with the Egyptian government, the Malay students in Cairo also forged relationships with student organisations in the\nMiddle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. In fact, they also established collaborations with the leaders of Malaya and the Malay rulers to protect the welfare of Malay students in Cairo. High patriotism was also shown by the Malay students in Cairo\nby way of organising a celebration of the Independence Day of Malaya in 1957, as well as by advising the Malay Congress on matters concerning the future of Malay rulers, Malay states and the Malays.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38721792, "asset_id": 15563538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1239775, "first_name": "Abu Hanifah", "last_name": "Haris", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "AbuHanifahHaris", "display_name": "Abu Hanifah  Haris", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/AbuHanifahHaris?f_ri=961753", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1239775/451315/48398091/s65_abu_hanifah.haris.jpg"}, {"id": 34851632, "first_name": "Redzuan", "last_name": "Othman", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OthmanRedzuan", "display_name": "Redzuan Othman", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OthmanRedzuan?f_ri=961753", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12537, "name": "Egypt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Egypt?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 961753, "name": "Malay World Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World_Studies?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7014095, "title": "Indic, Islamic and Thai Influences [Extract of Chapter 2 from Muslim Merit-making in Thailand's Far-south]", "created_at": "2014-05-11T12:59:20.529-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7014095/Indic_Islamic_and_Thai_Influences_Extract_of_Chapter_2_from_Muslim_Merit_making_in_Thailands_Far_south_?f_ri=961753", "dom_id": "work_7014095", "summary": "This chapter describes Patani\u2019s Indic, Islamic and Thai pasts. The argu- ment is that the Malay kerajaan of Patani was similar to\u2014rather than distinct from\u2014other port city-states on the peninsula and islands of Southeast Asia where a Sanskrit cosmopolis existed for a millennium before the earliest chapters of Islam\u2019s Southeast Asian expansion. Islam also circulated east and west of Patani through trade between the Middle East and China via the Indian Ocean. This created a range of Indian/Arab/Malay creole communities whose members played key roles in the adoption of, or adhesion to, Islam in Southeast Asian port city-states like Patani. India\u2019s importance to the arrival of Islam to the Thai/Malay peninsula relates to what Islam came to, where Islam initially came from, and who Islam came through. Rather than refer to conversion, I refer to an adhesion to, or adoption of, Islam. The impact of Thai and Islamic influences in Patani/Pattani following its defeat in 1785 is described. The details of the process through which the Malay Kingdom (SM. kerajaan) of   became the Thai Province of Pattani, including Bangkok\u2019s legislative and administrative initiatives are also provided. A central con- cern of this chapter is to highlight the fact that these developments coincided with a period of revolution and reform in the Hijaz. I describe how these developments impacted local religious life and thought through local luminaries such as Shaykh Daud Al-Fatani, Shaykh Ahmad Al-Fatani and Haji Sulong. The methodologies and contributions of present-day reformist revivalist movements are also described.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33674643, "asset_id": 7014095, "asset_type": "Work",

These histories are not merely connected by the movement of ideas, practices and people, but have also been absorbed and made indigenous to institutions and societies of the Malay polities. A textual analysis of the Hikayat Syah Mardan is one of the means to explore the complex social formations that have occurred in the Malay world as it was written during the crucial transition period from its Hindu-Buddhist past to Muslim present (Abdullah, 2002:ix). This article will attempt to show the cross-cultural interactions of the Malay world through the hikayat by examining three thematic points: (a) the equivocal origins of the text and its entrance into an Islamizing Malay world, (b) the consolidation of authority in Malay text and (c) the perception of women\u2019s role in traditional Malay society as seen in Raja Syah Mardan\u2019s wives.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64086580, "asset_id": 42856923, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39778089, "first_name": "Netusha", "last_name": "Naidu", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "NetushaNaidu", "display_name": "Netusha Naidu", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/NetushaNaidu?f_ri=961753", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39778089/14199536/31461385/s65_netusha.naidu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158040, "name": "Malay-Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay-Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 961753, "name": "Malay World Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World_Studies?f_ri=961753"}, {"id": 994163, "name": "Buddhism & Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_and_Hinduism?f_ri=961753"}, {"id": 1115209, "name": "Jawi Manuscripts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jawi_Manuscripts?f_ri=961753"}]}, {"id": 36845091, "title": "(2018) Language Policy, Linguistic Discrimination, and Thailand's Southern Impasse", "created_at": "2018-06-14T12:45:08.100-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36845091/_2018_Language_Policy_Linguistic_Discrimination_and_Thailands_Southern_Impasse?f_ri=961753", "dom_id": "work_36845091", "summary": "o credible claims can be made that the role of Malay has been entirely\r\noverlooked by those studying conflict dynamics in South Thailand.\r\nNevertheless, those concerned with religious factors dwarf the number of studies\r\ninterrogating issues related to language.

My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

"Abstract\nShaykh Abdussamad al-Falimbani was an important figure in the intellectual tradition of Islam in the Malay world in the 18th century. This article shows that al-Falimbani played an important role in conveying and developing Islamic sciences, not only in the Malay World even in Arab lands, including in Makkah and in Zabid, Yemen. Al-Falimbani was also one of the superior scholars who not only received recognition from fellow scholars and students from among the Malays, even from his colleagues and students who were Arab. Al-Falimbani's important contribution to the intellectual tradition of Islam in Malay World was: the first, the spread of al-Falimbani's various religious works to various regions of the Islamic world, both in Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Second, the development of intellectual networks of teachers and students in the region of Malay and Middle East in the 18th century. Third, the maintenance of the continuity of Islamic scientific treasures from the classical Islamic scholars to the Muslims in the 18th century even to the modern era today. Fourth, harmonize tasawuf teachings with Islamic law, so that the traditions and rituals of Sufism remain practiced in the corridors of the valid Shari'a.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60802569, "asset_id": 40528333, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4724774, "first_name": "Dr Mohammed Hussain", "last_name": "Ahmad", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DrMohammedHussainAhmad", "display_name": "Dr Mohammed Hussain Ahmad", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DrMohammedHussainAhmad?f_ri=961753", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4724774/1997933/33405762/s65_dr_mohammed_hussain.ahmad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158040, "name": "Malay-Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay-Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 961753, "name": "Malay World Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World_Studies?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 961759, "name": "Indonesia and the Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia_and_the_Malay_World?f_ri=961753", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=961753"}, {"id": 1916515, "name": "Malay and Indonesian literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_and_Indonesian_literature?f_ri=961753"}, {"id": 2498780, "name": "Malay scholars", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_scholars?f_ri=961753"}, {"id": 2907767, "name": "Malay Scholarship ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Scholarship?f_ri=961753"}]}, {"id": 7060454, "title": "The Malacca Sultanate", "created_at": "2014-05-15T18:41:03.149-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7060454/The_Malacca_Sultanate?f_ri=961753", "dom_id": "work_7060454", "summary": "The Melaka Sultanate refers to a polity on the Malay peninsula that was founded around the year 1400, reached its apex in the mid-15th century and declined rapidly with the onset of the 16th century.
