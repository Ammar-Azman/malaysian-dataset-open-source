One such rite is the ziyarat (visits to sacred sites). This essay highlights the rituals conducted and performed by Malaysian Shi\u2019ites during their seasonal pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq. Their rituals and behaviors during these pilgrimages to holy shrines in Iran and Iraq were documented from the standpoint of a cultural anthropologist. Rites from two sites, Mashad and Karbala, are presented in this study. Applying Herbert Blumer\u2019s symbolic interactionism as a conceptual framework, and Charles Brooks\u2019s methodology through social interaction and participant-observation, this essay aims to analyze and understand their rites, and the values and significance of these rites. By doing so, the axiological aspects of the rites were observed and clari-fied, thus enabling non Shi\u2019ite Muslims to perceive greyest area of Shia rites, as per-formed by Shi\u2019ites from Malaysia in their pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31581954, "asset_id": 3849049, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1607754, "first_name": "Mohd Faizal", "last_name": "Musa", "domain_name": "ukm", "page_name": "MohdFaizalMusa", "display_name": "Mohd Faizal Musa", "profile_url": "https://ukm.academia.edu/MohdFaizalMusa?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1607754/561822/2253130/s65_mohd_faizal.musa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7846, "name": "Symbolic Interaction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Symbolic_Interaction?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37193, "name": "Islam in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Indonesia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 118361, "name": "Iranology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iranology?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 143447, "name": "Shiism, Shiite Islam, Shii Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shiism_Shiite_Islam_Shii_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 151110, "name": "History of Shia Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Shia_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 36662927, "title": "Islamisme dan Bahananya: Cabaran Besar Politik Malaysia Abad Ke-21 (Islamism and its Discontents: A Major Challenge to Twenty-first Century Malaysian Politics), Siri Syarahan Umum Pelantikan Profesor (Penang: Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2018).", "created_at": "2018-05-18T03:28:55.207-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36662927/Islamisme_dan_Bahananya_Cabaran_Besar_Politik_Malaysia_Abad_Ke_21_Islamism_and_its_Discontents_A_Major_Challenge_to_Twenty_first_Century_Malaysian_Politics_Siri_Syarahan_Umum_Pelantikan_Profesor_Penang_Penerbit_Universiti_Sains_Malaysia_2018_?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_36662927", "summary": "Syarahan ini menyelusuri perkembangan perbahasan dan wacana tentang Islam dan kedinamikan politiknya dalam masa enam puluh tahun (1957-2017), yakni semenjak Malaysia mencapai kemerdekaan sebagai sebuah entiti berdaulat dengan cita-cita untuk mendirikan sebuah negara bangsa. Elemen yang sangat penting dalam wacana ini ialah kedudukan rasmi Islam sebagai \u2018agama persekutuan\u2019 dalam Perlembagaan Persekutuan Malaysia dan pada masa yang sama memberi jaminan kebebasan beragama kepda agama-agama lain yang dianuti oleh hampir empat puluh peratus daripada jumlah penduduk Malaysia. Wajah demografi Malaysia menjadi semakin rencam dari sudut etnik dan agama dengan kemasukan Sabah, Sarawak, Singapura bersama Malaya ke dalam Persekutuan Malaysia pada 16 September 1963. Berkait rapat dengan wacana \u2018Islam politik\u2019 atau \u2018Islamisme\u2019 di Malaysia ialah konsep-konsep \u2018agama\u2019 dan \u2018sekularisme\u2019 yang saling berinteraksi dan mengalami evolusi makna sebagai lanjutan daripada perbahasan umum yang melibatkan pelbagai pihak seperti para sarjana, ahli politik, birokrat, ulama, aktivis sosial, pengamal media dan pengkomentar media sosial. Hujahan yang dikemukakan di sini ialah makna \u2018Islam\u2019 yang difahami oleh pemegang-pemegang taruh (stakeholders) telah mengalami perubahan pesat hasil daripada interaksi aktif semua pihak berkepentingan termasuk organ-organ negara dan masyarakat sivil dengan Islam. \u2018Islam\u2019 dalam Artikel 3 (1) Perlembagaan Persekutuan pada 31 Ogos 1957 tidak lagi sama kefahamannya dengan \u2018Islam\u2019 dalam dokumen yang sama pada tahun 2017. \u2018Islam\u2019 dan \u2018Islamisme\u2019 berhadapan dengan konflik atau percampuran maksud. Pergolakan politik yang dialami Malaysia semenjak tiga dekad kebelakangan ini, iaitu sejak kesan kebangkitan Islam menampakkan impaknya dalam landskap politik, ekonomi dan sosial. Situasi ini boleh dikesan susur galurnya kepada kefahaman keagamaan yang lebih tegar yang menggariskan sempadan ketat tentang apa yang disifatkan sebagai \u2018Islamik\u2019 berbanding apa yang \u2018tidak Islamik.\u2019 Kemasukan elemen tegar dalam wacana Islamisme ini diarus perdanakan di bawah projek-projek Islamisasi pemerintah, dengan reaksi-reaksi berbeza daripada pelbagai kelompok masyarakat. Penularan elemen tegar dalam dasar Islamisasi yang diabsahkan melalui kerangka politik rasmi membawa implikasi mendalam kepda politik Malaysia dalam arena hubungan Muslim dengan bukan Muslim, malahan antara sesama Muslim yang berbeza corak pemikiran dari aliran arus perdana.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56596577, "asset_id": 36662927, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 540, "name": "Islamic Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Law?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 5674, "name": "Islamic Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Philosophy?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 6544, "name": "Islamic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Education?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 16171, "name": "Islamic Political Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Political_Thought?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 25399, "name": "Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 45019, "name": "Islamic Movements and Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Movements_and_Political_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 403575, "name": "Pendidikan Agama Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pendidikan_Agama_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 469642, "name": "Jihadism and Radical Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jihadism_and_Radical_Islamism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 638772, "name": "Islamist Political Parties", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_Political_Parties?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 734186, "name": "Islamism & Post-Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism_and_Post-Islamism?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 34956348, "title": "Aliran al-Ashairah di Nusantara.pdf", "created_at": "2017-10-25T08:48:32.108-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34956348/Aliran_al_Ashairah_di_Nusantara_pdf?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_34956348", "summary": "Islam  telah  datang  ke  Nusantara  sejak  abad  terawal perluasan  wilayah  Islam  dimulakan.

While Islam has always been a pivotal factor in Malaysian politics, interpretations of Islam, concerning both doctrine and practice, have arisen among successive generations of Malaysian Muslims. Since the beginning of Najib Razak premiership, however, the initiative in defining the Islamic framework of the nation has, with ghastly consequences, been effectively delegated to the official Islamic bureaucracy, whose horizons are coloured by visions of Islamist uniformity rather than a religiously acceptable Muslim plurality.  At the same time, the emergence of a range of civil-society actors has complicated the Islamist terrain. Najib faces a predicament in continuing Malaysia\u2019s practice of pluralist politics whilst at the same time accommodating inclusive notions of Islam in his management of the body politic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38924897, "asset_id": 16285733, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}, {"id": 498879, "first_name": "Che Hamdan", "last_name": "Che Mohd Razali", "domain_name": "uitm", "page_name": "HamdanMohdRazali", "display_name": "Che Hamdan Che Mohd Razali", "profile_url": "https://uitm.academia.edu/HamdanMohdRazali?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/498879/171642/31103929/s65_che_hamdan.che_mohd_razali.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5323, "name": "Islam and Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Human_Rights?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13094, "name": "Contemporary Movements and Trends in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Movements_and_Trends_in_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 25399, "name": "Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 65061, "name": "\u0130slamist Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_Movement?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 201769, "name": "Islamist politics and national identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_politics_and_national_identity?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 251282, "name": "Malaysian legal system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_legal_system?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 301193, "name": "Malaysian Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Law?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 397817, "name": "Islamist movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_movements?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 469642, "name": "Jihadism and Radical Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jihadism_and_Radical_Islamism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 865888, "name": "Radical Islamist Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_Islamist_Movements?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 11740103, "title": "Islamist Conservatism and the Demise of Islam Hadhari in Malaysia", "created_at": "2015-03-31T07:41:03.384-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11740103/Islamist_Conservatism_and_the_Demise_of_Islam_Hadhari_in_Malaysia?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_11740103", "summary": "This article argues that Islam Hadhari, as a model for development officially inaugurated during the administration of Malaysia\u2019s fifth prime minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi (2003\u20139), encountered failure.

While on the one hand it promoted an Islam that cherishes the values of inclusivity, moderation and inter-religious tolerance, on the other hand Islam Hadhari unfortunately triggered defensive responses from Islamist conservatives. This ad hoc conservative alliance comprised religious leaders associated with the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), state religious functionaries, scholars affiliated to the opposition Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS: Parti Islam SeMalaysia) and Islamist non-governmental organizations. The rise of this Islamist conservatism aggravated ethno-religious relations during Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\u2019s premiership, leading to the setbacks experienced by his government in the general elections of 2008.

The internalization since the 1970s of the Wahhabi brand of Salafism among Southeast Asian Muslims is the major factor behind this apparent shift towards a more radical worldview. The relatively low level of concern over rising Islamist extremism among Indonesian and Malaysian Muslims indicates a worrying institutionalization of radical interpretations of Islam in the general Islamic landscape of both countries.

Since then, political stakeholders have not shied away from making the most of Islamic symbols, practices and institutions towards achieving national economic development or regime maintenance. Driven by hegemonic considerations, they largely ignored intra-Muslim religious variations. The religious uniformity of Malays, all of whom were Muslims by law, were literally taken for granted and served as a politically expedient vehicle for Islamic-based political mobilization by the Malay-dominated regime. Pluralist conceptions of Malaysian society were accepted only insofar as they pertain to Muslim-non-Muslim distinctions. At the core of the government's efforts to infuse the Malaysian polity with Islamic alternatives for socio-political arrangements is a gradual process of syariahization. However, owing to arbitrary interpretations of the syariah (Islamic law) by Malaysia's official Islamic gatekeepers, syariahization resulted in state-manufactured denial of freedom of religious expression to non-conformist Malay-Muslims. Until today, Muslim non-conformists are not allowed to adopt, let alone to propagate, different forms of Islam that run afoul of the version upheld by an officially sanctioned version of the syariah. As reflected by the case of the Sufi-inspired Darul Arqam movement, government-imposed syariahization has resulted in the violation of fundamental human rights of Malay-Muslims, regardless of the fact that the syariah itself may not have been clear-cut in determining the boundaries between religious orthodoxy and unorthodoxy in prescribing punishments for dissent.", "downloadable_attachments":

different languages across the region. The only scholarly conjecture about its origin is based on the copy of a Malay manuscript held in Leiden which has been deliberately blackened and struck through by a reader who stated in the margin that the story is written by a R\u0101fi\u1e0d\u012b and should not be believed. Although earlier scholars mentioned the title or the synopsis of this story in their works and bibliographical catalogues, the question \"what is the origin of this story?\" remained unanswered. In order to follow up on previous studies and to find an answer, this essay examines numerous original manuscripts and texts in various languages and provides a comparison between the Malay versions and their prototype. Also, to the best of my knowledge, the first edition and English translation of the prototype are presented.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 91644590, "asset_id": 56215908, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73663894, "first_name": "Majid", "last_name": "Daneshgar", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "MajidDaneshgar", "display_name": "Majid Daneshgar", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/MajidDaneshgar?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/73663894/18743138/25984891/s65_majid.daneshgar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5408, "name": "Magic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magic?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6049, "name": "Persian Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Language?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7322, "name": "Mysticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mysticism?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 14584, "name": "Persianate Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persianate_Sufism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 15805, "name": "Safavids (Islamic History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Safavids_Islamic_History_?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 19990, "name": "Magic and the Occult (Anthropology Of Religion)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magic_and_the_Occult_Anthropology_Of_Religion_?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 36310, "name": "Safavid Persia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Safavid_Persia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 223993, "name": "Occult Sciences in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Occult_Sciences_in_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 246533, "name": "Islam and Indonesian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Indonesian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 250021, "name": "Biography of the Prophet Muhammad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography_of_the_Prophet_Muhammad?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 407393, "name": "Persian Language and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_Language_and_Literature?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 418844, "name": "Bahasa Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bahasa_Indonesia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 1223710, "name": "Muslim philosophy and thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_philosophy_and_thought?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 1813305, "name": "Qalandariyya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qalandariyya?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 2899817, "name": "Persian and Ottoman Turkish historical writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persian_and_Ottoman_Turkish_historical_writing?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 70030121, "title": "Islamic education in Malaysia: Between neoliberalism and political priorities in light of the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013-2015, in Cynthia Joseph (ed.), Policies and Politics in Malaysian Education: Education Reforms, Nationalism and Neoliberalism (London & NY: Routledge, 2018), pp. 31-53.", "created_at": "2022-01-30T04:43:28.041-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70030121/Islamic_education_in_Malaysia_Between_neoliberalism_and_political_priorities_in_light_of_the_Malaysia_Education_Blueprint_2013_2015_in_Cynthia_Joseph_ed_Policies_and_Politics_in_Malaysian_Education_Education_Reforms_Nationalism_and_Neoliberalism_London_and_NY_Routledge_2018_pp_31_53?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_70030121", "summary": "The most significant reform that the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2013\u20132025 (MEB) proposes is its curriculum expansion so as to enable Muslim students to better understand the core values and underlying philosophies of not only Islam but also other main religions of Malaysia.

The transfer of power from the Islamic-educated Abdullah Badawi to the Western-educated Najib Razak in April 2009 raised the instrumentalization of Islamic education as a political tool. The Malaysian government has undermined the civilizational qualities of a strand of moderate Islam, even as the government claims to uphold it under the tagline of wasatiyyah in many international meetings.

Having been in power since the country\u2019s independence, the United Malays Nationalist Organisation (UMNO) of the Barisan Nasional (National Front) has attempted, through use of several national ideologies and discourses, to propagate a Malay Muslim hegemony within a multiethnic framework. The most obvious result of this is the categorization of the Malaysian population by ethnicity in all facets of their lives. Another consequence is the precarious position of young adults in Malaysia: the government expects much of Malaysian youth, especially Muslim youth, yet ironically, their inadequate representation and vulnerability to authoritative depictions has left them a marginalized group. This article looks at the discourses concerning young-adult Malaysian Muslims, and, through indepth interviews with a small sample of urban youth, attempts to uncover what discourses young-adult Malaysian Muslims are actually using in their everyday lives. My findings point to a transcendence of religion over race amongst most young Muslims, with there being much discomfort over assuming the ethnic identity marker of \u2018Malay\u2019.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7022531, "asset_id": 1144293, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 652821, "first_name": "Dahlia", "last_name": "Martin", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "DahliaMartin", "display_name": "Dahlia Martin", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/DahliaMartin?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/652821/226109/752320/s65_dahlia.martin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 154352, "name": "Muslim Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Youth?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 23507938, "title": "The Hudud Controversy in Malaysia: Religious Probity or Political Expediency?, in Daljit Singh (ed.), Southeast Asian Affairs 2015 (Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, 2015), pp. 205\u2013219.", "created_at": "2016-03-21T02:36:05.544-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23507938/The_Hudud_Controversy_in_Malaysia_Religious_Probity_or_Political_Expediency_in_Daljit_Singh_ed_Southeast_Asian_Affairs_2015_Singapore_Institute_of_Southeast_Asian_Studies_2015_pp_205_219?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_23507938", "summary": "In the aftermath of Malaysia\u2019s 13th General Elections (GE13), the possibility of imposition of the Islamic penal code of hudud, which had been on the agenda of the Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS: Parti Islam SeMalaysia) since capturing power in the state of Kelantan in 1990, resurfaced. Circumstances in 2014 however are markedly different. PAS is now a major partner of the People\u2019s Pact (PR: Pakatan Rakyat) opposition coalition, whose roots can be traced back to the Reformasi discontent ensuing from the dismissal of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim from the ruling  United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and the government in 1998. The cooperation between PAS, Anwar\u2019s People\u2019s Justice Party (PKR: Parti Keadilan Rakyat) and the Democratic Action Party (DAP) within the PR framework has eroded support for the UMNO-led National Front (BN: Barisan Nasional), although it maintains bastions of influence among rural Malay constituencies. Long known for its espousal of a modernist version of Islam which emphasises the substance rather than the form of the religion, UMNO\u2019s conditional backing of PAS\u2019s intention to table two Private Member\u2019s bills for the application of hudud in Kelantan comes as a surprise, but the apparent turnabout may be explained by recourse to pragmatic political considerations.",

"summary": "This article proposes a new etymon for the Malay word lebai (minor religious official/scholar), namely the Sino-Muslim term libai (\u79ae\u62dc, worship or religious service conducted in a mosque). Scholars have traditionally argued that lebai, a loanword introduced during the early stages of Islamization, derives from the Tamil leppai (or lebbai), likewise signifying (amongst other things) a minor religious official/scholar. On this basis, it has been argued that Tamil Muslims acted as Southeast Asia\u2019s earliest Islamic officials. This article critically re-assesses the evidence underlying this attribution. By tracing the earliest known Malay usage of lebai to Java - where it emerged alongside Sino-Muslim influences associated with Cirebon, Gresik and Demak - the etymon libai is proposed: since the Song dynasty (960-1279), Sino-Muslims have used the noun libai as a designate for religious affairs (particularly prayers) conducted in a mosque. We suggest that lebai originates with this term, making it indicative of Sino-Muslim influence during Java\u2019s Islamization.

Banned in 1994, Arqam members survived state repression by reconfiguring themselves as successful businessmen operating under the banner of Global Ikhwan, whose steady expansion outlived the demise of its controversial chairman, Ashaari Muhammad, in May 2010. Spreading its wings transnationally even to Haramayn\u2014the hub of Islamic worship in Saudi Arabia\u2014Global Ikhwan was distinctively helmed by a woman, Khadijah Aam, one of Ashaari's widows. An analysis of the business experience of Global Ikhwan adds a fresh perspective to understanding Muslim economic norms. Global Ikhwan has carved out a philosophy for its members that is spiritual and traditional, yet at the same time enterprising and innovative. Global Ikhwan attributes its phenomenal success directly to its endeavour to apply Sufi doctrines to the economic realm, despite a common taxonomy of knowledge in Islam which discusses spirituality and business as if they were separate worlds. While Islam does outline moral guidelines for regulating business, whether intra-Muslim or between Muslims and non-Muslims, it has been unusual for the ulama or Muslim religious scholars and Muslim entrepreneurs to ascribe Muslim success in business to Islamic precepts, let alone Sufi principles. Global Ikhwan is an instructive exception.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53338150, "asset_id": 33269480, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

This chapter proposes a God-centric model of managing human to human horizontal problems, applying sufi-based ideals, such as love and compassion, as reflected in His Ninety-Nine Asma\u2019 ul-Husna (Beautiful Names), to real-world happenings in Malaysian politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65412597, "asset_id": 44894372, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13094, "name": "Contemporary Movements and Trends in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Movements_and_Trends_in_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 2020329, "name": "Asmaul Husna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asmaul_Husna?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 8018461, "title": "Cairo and the printing press as the modes in the dissemination of Muhammad 'Abduh's reformism to Malaya", "created_at": "2014-08-18T22:58:16.335-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8018461/Cairo_and_the_printing_press_as_the_modes_in_the_dissemination_of_Muhammad_Abduhs_reformism_to_Malaya?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_8018461", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34480174, "asset_id": 8018461, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 240825, "first_name": "Hafiz", "last_name": "Zakariya", "domain_name": "iium", "page_name": "HafizZakariya", "display_name": "Hafiz Zakariya", "profile_url": "https://iium.academia.edu/HafizZakariya?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/240825/786353/92673599/s65_hafiz.zakariya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15800, "name": "Islamic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_History?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35081, "name": "Islamic Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Intellectual_History?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 3371534, "title": "Hafiz Zakariya and M.

It emphasizes that the traditional Malay laws, should be accepted as they are, instead of comparing them with the modern concept and definition of laws. Indeed, the Malay traditional laws functioned as the constitution of the Malay sultanates, which are workable and able to institute a modicum of social stability in a pluralistic and hierarchical society. Moreover, this set of laws served as a guidance for the rulers and state officials to fullfil their responsibilities towards the sultanate and to the people.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67873004, "asset_id": 49544553, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 240825, "first_name": "Hafiz", "last_name": "Zakariya", "domain_name": "iium", "page_name": "HafizZakariya", "display_name": "Hafiz Zakariya", "profile_url": "https://iium.academia.edu/HafizZakariya?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/240825/786353/92673599/s65_hafiz.zakariya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 696695, "title": "The Religio-Political Activism of Ulama in Singapore,", "created_at": "2011-06-26T11:08:12.434-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/696695/The_Religio_Political_Activism_of_Ulama_in_Singapore_?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_696695", "summary": "The paper is an attempt to examine the religio-political role of ulama in Singapore.

This will done through a comparison of their role and contribution they made in the enactment of two acts pertaining to Muslim Personal Law in 1966 and 1998. An analysis of the process that led to the enactment of these laws will show the waning influence of the ulama. The paper will also examine various factors that have led to the waning ulama\u2019s influence. This assessment will itself highlight larger socio-political changes occurring within the Muslim community in Singapore as well as changes in the relationship between the Singaporean government and

For the many Sayyids who excelled as torchbearers of Islam in the Malay world, propagating Islam was a lifetime vocation that passed without the stress that we find in the modern world. Their da'wah efforts encompassed such diverse undertakings as employing business acumen in confronting the challenges of colonialism and Malay court culture, immersing themselves in native communities via intermarriages and adoption of local customs, and carving a niche for themselves in local and international politics as advisors and emissaries. At grassroots level, da'wah for them was inseparable from daily chores and mundane affairs. That Western colonialism hardly made any impact in directly desacralizing the Malays is a tribute to the success of the Sayyids' da'wah efforts, which served as a buffer against the religious implications of colonial encroachment into autochthonous institutions and lifestyle. By looking at some examples of how the Sayyids interacted with local communities in selected regions of the Malay world, this article traces part of this glittering history of da'wah in the easternmost parts of the Islamic commonwealth. Most importantly, the Malay world's Islamization was distinguished by lack of violence and emphasis on educational progress more than anything else.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68203426, "asset_id": 50086734, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148395383, "first_name": "Jurnal", "last_name": "Teosofi", "domain_name": "uinsby", "page_name": "JurnalTeosofi", "display_name": "Jurnal Teosofi", "profile_url": "https://uinsby.academia.edu/JurnalTeosofi?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148395383/40879174/36880245/s65_jurnal.teosofi.jpg"}, {"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21211, "name": "Islam in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_South_Asia?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007845, "name": "Hadrami Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hadrami_Studies?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 49544540, "title": "SYED SHEIKH AL-HADI'S VIEWS ON THE EDUCATIONAL REFORMS IN MALAYA", "created_at": "2021-07-04T20:22:29.603-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49544540/SYED_SHEIKH_AL_HADIS_VIEWS_ON_THE_EDUCATIONAL_REFORMS_IN_MALAYA?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_49544540", "summary": "Though there is a growing body of literature on Syed Sheikh al-Hadi, few focuses on his contributions to the educational reform. Thus, this study analyzes Syed Sheikh al-Hadi's views on the educational reforms. Al-Hadi was discontent with the traditional Islamic education in Malaya because of its inadequacy to prepare the future generation to meet the challenges of modernity. For this purpose, al-Hadi emphasized the reform of Islamic education system through the madrasah, which would offer both the religious and secular subjects. Further, al-Hadi proposed the Malay-Anglo school: integrating the positive elements of the Malay school with the English school for the benefits of the Malay students. In order to revitalize the society, al-Hadi emphasized that women's education needed to be addressed urgently. Besides contributing to theoretical discussion, al-Hadi was also involved in various capacities in the establishment and management of several madrasahs: Madrasah Iqbal Islamiah, Madrasah al-Hadi dan Madrasah al-Masyhur.

In doing so, it facilitates the movement of academic discussions out from under the shadow of polemical sectarian discourses on 'Shi'ism' in Southeast Asia.

Therefore, it is no wonder that in the Land of Malay according to the records of historical reviewers in general the spread of Islam in this region took place peacefully without any bloodshed. The study of the arrival of Islam in the Land of Malay is often debated among western and local historians. The focus of their discussion is focused on the exact date of the entry of Islam in this region and which nation was the earliest preacher who spread Islam in this land. Through this paper will be discussed briefly the theory and evidence of the spread of Islam in the Land of Malay before the 15th century through research and studies obtained by historians and historical relics and will review the continuity of this effort to spread Islam in the lives of local and international communities.

made immense contributions to the ummah in myriad aspects: economic development, educational advancement, healthy scholarly discourse, a political leadership prioritising the needs of its majority

One such rite is the ziyarat (visits to sacred sites). This essay highlights the rituals conducted and performed by Malaysian Shi\u2019ites during their seasonal pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq. Their rituals and behaviors during these pilgrimages to holy shrines in Iran and Iraq were documented from the standpoint of a cultural anthropologist. Rites from two sites, Mashad and Karbala, are presented in this study. Applying Herbert Blumer\u2019s symbolic interactionism as a conceptual framework, and Charles Brooks\u2019s methodology through social interaction and participant-observation, this essay aims to analyze and understand their rites, and the values and significance of these rites. By doing so, the axiological aspects of the rites were observed and clari-fied, thus enabling non Shi\u2019ite Muslims to perceive greyest area of Shia rites, as per-formed by Shi\u2019ites from Malaysia in their pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58051231, "first_name": "Mohd Faizal", "last_name": "Musa", "domain_name": "independent",

While Islam has always been a pivotal factor in Malaysian politics, interpretations of Islam, concerning both doctrine and practice, have arisen among successive generations of Malaysian Muslims. Since the beginning of Najib Razak premiership, however, the initiative in defining the Islamic framework of the nation has, with ghastly consequences, been effectively delegated to the official Islamic bureaucracy, whose horizons are coloured by visions of Islamist uniformity rather than a religiously acceptable Muslim plurality. At the same time, the emergence of a range of civil-society actors has complicated the Islamist terrain. Najib faces a predicament in continuing Malaysia\u2019s practice of pluralist politics whilst at the same time accommodating inclusive notions of Islam in his management of the body politic.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 498879, "first_name": "Che Hamdan", "last_name": "Che Mohd Razali", "domain_name": "uitm", "page_name": "HamdanMohdRazali", "display_name": "Che Hamdan Che Mohd Razali", "profile_url": "https://uitm.academia.edu/HamdanMohdRazali?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/498879/171642/31103929/s65_che_hamdan.che_mohd_razali.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5323, "name": "Islam and Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Human_Rights?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13094, "name": "Contemporary Movements and Trends in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Movements_and_Trends_in_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 25399, "name": "Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 28235, "name": "Multidisciplinary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multidisciplinary?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 33180, "name": "Political Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 47768, "name": "Malaysian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 201769, "name": "Islamist politics and national identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_politics_and_national_identity?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 251282, "name": "Malaysian legal system", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_legal_system?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 301193, "name": "Malaysian Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Law?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 397817, "name": "Islamist movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamist_movements?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 469642, "name": "Jihadism and Radical Islamism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jihadism_and_Radical_Islamism?f_ri=47766"}, {"id": 865888, "name": "Radical Islamist Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_Islamist_Movements?f_ri=47766"}]}, {"id": 49544860, "title": "Islam from within a preliminary evaluation of Malaysian scholars contributions", "created_at": "2021-07-04T21:19:58.661-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49544860/Islam_from_within_a_preliminary_evaluation_of_Malaysian_scholars_contributions?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_49544860", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67873268, "asset_id": 49544860, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 240825, "first_name": "Hafiz", "last_name": "Zakariya", "domain_name": "iium", "page_name": "HafizZakariya", "display_name": "Hafiz Zakariya", "profile_url": "https://iium.academia.edu/HafizZakariya?f_ri=47766", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/240825/786353/92673599/s65_hafiz.zakariya.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 47766, "name": "Islam in Malay Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Malay_Society?f_ri=47766", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44145070, "title": "'Islam in Malay Peninsula'", "created_at": "2020-09-22T23:50:46.223-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44145070/Islam_in_Malay_Peninsula?f_ri=47766", "dom_id": "work_44145070", "summary": "National Webinar on \n'Islam in Malay Peninsula'\nDepartment of Arabic & Islamic History, MES Kalladi College, Mannarkkad\n15/6/2020", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 399768, "first_name": "Saifudheen", "last_name": "Kunju.
