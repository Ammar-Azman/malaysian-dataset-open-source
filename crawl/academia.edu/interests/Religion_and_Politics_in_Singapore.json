Firstly, megachurches have been very successful in attracting emergent middle-class Singaporeans. Their appeal to upwardly mobile people from working and lower-middle-class backgrounds makes them a converging point for class-transcending individuals who have a strong sense of agency. Second, megachurches are shown to be more likely to combine\nspirituality with market logic, and their \u201cseeker church\u201d mentality slightly but significantly modifies their attitudes towards homosexuals. These attitudes enable them to better engage with the contemporary marketplace as well as\nto appeal to young economically mobile Singaporeans generally. Third, it is argued that as part of the broader international evangelical movements, Singapore megachurches have learned to minister to the needy and disadvantaged in ways that avoid conflict with the state. Their integration\nof trans-nationalizing networks and local indigenizing cells also enables them to combine global connectivity with local relevance amongst distinct groups of Singapore society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39310745, "asset_id": 17020435, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 518375, "first_name": "Terence", "last_name": "Chong", "domain_name": "iseas", "page_name": "TerenceChong", "display_name": "Terence Chong", "profile_url": "https://iseas.academia.edu/TerenceChong?f_ri=266224", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/25b62c366bde3bbe49037915646750f8?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 19721, "name": "Pentecostalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pentecostalism?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44953, "name": "Megachurches", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Megachurches?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 720124, "name": "Asian Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Christianity?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31857080, "title": "AMOS YEE, FREE SPEECH, AND MAINTAINING RELIGIOUS HARMONY IN SINGAPORE", "created_at": "2017-03-14T03:53:34.227-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31857080/AMOS_YEE_FREE_SPEECH_AND_MAINTAINING_RELIGIOUS_HARMONY_IN_SINGAPORE?f_ri=266224", "dom_id": "work_31857080", "summary": "This Article examines the tension between freedom of speech and laws restricting the defamation of religion, using the case study of Singapore and the Amos Yee case. In 2015, four days after the death of revered former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Amos Yee, a sixteen-year-old blogger, posted a video called \u201cLee Kuan Yew is finally dead!\u201d and, one day later, an image on his blog entitled \u201cLee Kuan Yew buttfucking Margaret Thatcher.\u201d As part of Yee\u2019s eight-minute-long video, Yee spent forty seconds criticizing Lee by drawing an unfavorable analogy between Lee and Jesus. As a result, Yee was charged under section 298 of the Penal Code, the law prohibiting the \u201cuttering of words with the deliberate intent to wound the religious or racial feelings.\u201d While international news highlighted Yee\u2019s prosecution as a blatant attempt to silence criticism of the former Prime Minister, the courts held steadfast in their belief that Yee\u2019s words were hurtful towards Christians, and that offending the religious sentiments of any community would not be tolerated in Singapore. This Article will review the facts of the case, the history of the law, and its application. It will also attempt to situate the law in the larger Defamation of Religions resolution debate in the United Nations from 1999\u20132010 and review legal restrictions on free speech in the United States and Europe.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52304439, "asset_id": 31857080, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10418322, "first_name": "George", "last_name": "Radics", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "GeorgeRadics", "display_name": "George Radics", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/GeorgeRadics?f_ri=266224", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10418322/4222083/18099332/s65_george.radics.jpg"}, {"id": 61693450, "first_name": "Yee Suan", "last_name": "Poon", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "YeeSuanPoon", "display_name": "Yee Suan Poon", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/YeeSuanPoon?f_ri=266224", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7489, "name": "Freedom of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Freedom_of_Religion?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 47767, "name": "Singapore Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Politics?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 231268, "name": "Freedom of Speech and Expression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Freedom_of_Speech_and_Expression?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 635324, "name": "Defamation of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Defamation_of_Religion?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 2009312, "name": "Amos Yee", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amos_Yee?f_ri=266224"}]}, {"id": 44387774, "title": "Compliant Singaporean Christians?

The COVID-19 pandemic supplies us with a unique window of opportunity to understand how Singaporean Christian groups have been compliant actors to the state's policies, even during this health crisis. By evaluating the differing responses of various churches and organisations, I argue that in spite of inadequacies in the state's public health and social measures, Christian leaders and groups crafted state-centred responses, and engaged in crisis-driven social action and the construction of state-affirming narratives within government-promoted boundaries. This also meant that Christians have projected an image of themselves as being socially-responsible Singaporeans who are willing to adhere to the government's crisis-mandated standards, while sacrificing their regular faith-based practices and physical gatherings for the greater good of the nation. The willingness to adhere to the single-party state's measures and boundaries has, nevertheless, disclosed the Christian community's inability to provide a critical voice about public health gaps and socio-economic injustices during this crisis. Secular civil-society groups and academics have filled this gap by highlighting these problems and criticising the government's failures. In sum, the COVID-19 episode reveals the lack of a \u2018prophetic\u2019 capacity in the responses of contemporary Christian groups and leaders because of their predilection to firstly acquiesce with the state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64994105, "asset_id": 44387774, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35491773, "first_name": "Joshua Dao Wei", "last_name": "SIM", "domain_name": "hkbu", "page_name": "JoshuaDaoWeiSIM", "display_name": "Joshua Dao Wei SIM", "profile_url": "https://hkbu.academia.edu/JoshuaDaoWeiSIM?f_ri=266224", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35491773/10314819/32240974/s65_joshua_dao_wei.sim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68163, "name": "World Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Christianity?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68168, "name": "Christianity in Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity_in_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 3589916, "name": "religion and COVID-19", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/religion_and_COVID-19?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 3794440, "name": "Christianity in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}]}, {"id": 44196704, "title": "Dissertation -

My father passed away in 2007. During the Buddhist funeral, tensions and conflicts emerged as certain family members had converted to Christianity. Beyond my family, similar narratives have been circulating in Singapore regarding the actions or inactions of Christians in the management of death. Commonly cited, concurring with my experience and interviews, are the unwillingness of Christians to participate in Chinese religious rituals. For example, the reluctance to hold joss sticks, eat offerings, burn joss papers, chant, and setup altar or ancestor tablets. The difference in religious beliefs not only seeds tension within the family, but results in incomplete rituals in the eyes of others as well. The compromised ritual, often seem as a loss of \u201cface\u201d (Lee, 2003; Tong, 2004), further fuels dissatisfaction among family members. \n\nViewing family as a microcosm of social institutions and relationships, we should investigate the reasons behind and the processes involved in reconciling the differences. A comprehension of the choices people make and the way they resolve tensions may serve to provide insights into the relationship between the individual and collective. Instead of seeing religious tension as conflict, it is better perceived as a process of negotiation that continuously shapes the Chinese culture of death management and ancestor worship. Culture is dialectically a coherent system of symbols and meanings, and a set of practice, that changes over time (Sewell, 1999). What we need to examine are the conditions that precipitate these changes. In this paper, I argue that beyond individual religious beliefs, other factors like structure, power, modernity and identity are more important. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36027324, "asset_id": 9864129, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9376474, "first_name": "Boon Seng", "last_name": "Cheow", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "BoonSengCheow", "display_name": "Boon Seng Cheow", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/BoonSengCheow?f_ri=266224", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2837, "name": "Chinese Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Religions?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12538, "name": "Funeral Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funeral_Practices?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 232113, "name": "Religious Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Conflict?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}]}, {"id": 42793741, "title": "The Secular Realm as Interfaith Space: Discourse and Practice in Contemporary Multicultural Nation-States", "created_at": "2020-04-20T01:36:35.215-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42793741/The_Secular_Realm_as_Interfaith_Space_Discourse_and_Practice_in_Contemporary_Multicultural_Nation_States?f_ri=266224", "dom_id": "work_42793741", "summary": "While classically posited as the separation of religion from public life, it is suggested that the contemporary secular public sphere in multicultural contexts has become a habitat for interfaith dialogue. Looking at dynamics in classical secular theory as well as some recent theorists of secularism and multiculturalism, most particularly J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Charles Taylor, Tariq Modood, and Rajeev Bhargava, it is shown that far from being hostile to religion much of the practice of secularism is often entwined with particular discourses of religious norms. Using spatial theory, especially that of Lefebvre, four cameos from the UK, USA, Singapore, and India are used as indicative of the way that interfaith discourse is embedded in various aspects of the secular public sphere from governmental, through official Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), to grassroots levels such that as forum externum religion is accepted in this space as interfaith dialogue. It is argued that a conceptual linkage of interfaith motifs is, if not inherent, then at least embedded in the secular realm in the contemporary multicultural context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63020293, "asset_id": 42793741, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 69600, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Hedges", "domain_name": "rsis", "page_name": "PaulHedges", "display_name": "Paul  Hedges", "profile_url": "https://rsis.academia.edu/PaulHedges?f_ri=266224", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/69600/19491/15881201/s65_paul.hedges.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5340, "name": "Jurgen Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jurgen_Habermas?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9833, "name": "Interfaith Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Discourse?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 13412, "name": "Politics and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_and_Religion?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 14971, "name": "Politics of Secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Secularism?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 14972, "name": "Comparative Secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Secularism?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 19283, "name": "Secularisms and Secularities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secularisms_and_Secularities?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 29547, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 38097, "name": "Interfaith Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Dialogue?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 70603, "name": "Secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secularism?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 97414, "name": "Interfaith Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Studies?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 98376, "name": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 115230, "name": "Multiculturalism, Religion, Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism_Religion_Diversity?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 158595, "name": "Indian Philosophy and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Philosophy_and_Religion?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 406156, "name": "Religion and secularism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_secularism?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 467528, "name": "Interreligious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Studies?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 1405609, "name": "Tariq Modood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariq_Modood?f_ri=266224"}]}, {"id": 44014881, "title": "Conceptualising Social Cohesion in Relation to Religious Diversity: Sketching a Pathway in a Globalised World", "created_at": "2020-09-03T23:16:44.813-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44014881/Conceptualising_Social_Cohesion_in_Relation_to_Religious_Diversity_Sketching_a_Pathway_in_a_Globalised_World?f_ri=266224", "dom_id": "work_44014881", "summary": "This paper offers an overview of current literature and best practice in terms of promoting social cohesion with a focus on how this relates to religious diversity.

It sets out some issues concerning how diversity is related to and experienced, before considering how we can conceptualise social cohesion in terms of religious diversity, offering three aspects as part of a contextual and down-to-earth descriptor. Tensions and issues which arise and counter social cohesion in contemporary societies are then noted, before postcolonial and decolonial theory is addressed as it may affect thinking through these issues. Finally, four themes that may be seen as key in promoting social cohesion are discussed: narratives, youth, dialogue, and leadership. The paper does not propose, within the limits of the space available, to offer a definitional survey of all issues; rather, it seeks to promote a contextualised debate and discussion of social cohesion in relation to religious diversity in the Southeast Asian context and to suggest a pathway towards thinking this.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64349699, "asset_id": 44014881, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 69600, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Hedges", "domain_name": "rsis", "page_name": "PaulHedges", "display_name": "Paul  Hedges", "profile_url": "https://rsis.academia.edu/PaulHedges?f_ri=266224", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/69600/19491/15881201/s65_paul.hedges.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47736, "name": "Decolonial Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonial_Thought?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 60827, "name": "Social cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_cohesion?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 97414, "name": "Interfaith Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Studies?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 177378, "name": "Minority Religions & Sects in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Religions_and_Sects_in_Indonesia?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 223442, "name": "Cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cohesion?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 467528, "name": "Interreligious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Studies?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 1125509, "name": "Postcolonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonialism?f_ri=266224"}]}, {"id": 43812170, "title": "Navigating Spatial Constraints in the Religious Landscape of Singapore: A Glimpse into the Religious Real Estate Management of the Catholic Church", "created_at": "2020-08-08T18:43:22.277-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43812170/Navigating_Spatial_Constraints_in_the_Religious_Landscape_of_Singapore_A_Glimpse_into_the_Religious_Real_Estate_Management_of_the_Catholic_Church?f_ri=266224", "dom_id": "work_43812170", "summary": "The state of Singapore is characterized by a persistent concern over land scarcity and efficient use of space.

Examining how the authorities of the Church adapt its widely dispersed built infrastructure to the changing regulations for land distribution imposed by the state, this article reflects on how Catholicism has prioritized a policy of adaptation over one of resistance. We argue that the Catholic Church acts in pragmatic ways to retain an extensive network of institutions across the island as an effort to reflect the health and vibrancy of Catholicism in Singapore.",

Dialogue is and may be used in the public sphere. The two countries are chosen as representing differently located but broadly secular nations where, nevertheless, religious and interreligious activities have prominence. The differences and similarities of the notion of secular as well as the way that religion and interreligious activity relate to the state are noted. While both countries have promoted Interreligious Dialogue primarily as a tool for social cohesion it is noted that this activity does not tie easily or neatly into conceptions of Deliberative Democracy. Employing ideas from J\u00fcrgen Habermas and other theorists of deliberation some central aspects of what deliberation may be in the context of Deliberative Democracy are explored. It is suggested that Interreligious Dialogue is far from a simple solution to promote harmonious relations within such a context, but nevertheless it is noted that what is often termed the Dialogue of Action has the potential to improve social cohesion. It is noted that much Interreligious Dialogue may actually go against some of the principles often sought within Deliberative Democracy but this is not seen as invalidating the practise within the public sphere.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56486052, "asset_id": 36560543, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 69600, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Hedges", "domain_name": "rsis", "page_name": "PaulHedges", "display_name": "Paul  Hedges", "profile_url": "https://rsis.academia.edu/PaulHedges?f_ri=266224", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/69600/19491/15881201/s65_paul.hedges.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3059, "name": "Religion and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5340, "name": "Jurgen Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jurgen_Habermas?f_ri=266224", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 7743, "name": "Religion & the Public Sphere", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_the_Public_Sphere?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 8875, "name": "Civil Society and the Public Sphere", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Society_and_the_Public_Sphere?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 9868, "name": "Deliberative Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deliberative_Democracy?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 10467, "name": "Public Sphere", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Sphere?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 13412, "name": "Politics and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_and_Religion?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 26995, "name": "Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Habermas?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 29547, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 38097, "name": "Interfaith Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Dialogue?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 68505, "name": "Religion and State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_State?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 97414, "name": "Interfaith Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Studies?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 98376, "name": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 266224, "name": "Religion and Politics in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Politics_in_Singapore?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 467528, "name": "Interreligious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Studies?f_ri=266224"}, {"id": 494880, "name": "Interreligious Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Relations?f_ri=266224"}]}, {"id": 44991747, "title": "An analysis of Singapore's AWARE case", "created_at": "2021-01-27T10:21:48.644-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44991747/An_analysis_of_Singapores_AWARE_case?f_ri=266224", "dom_id": "work_44991747", "summary": "Our case involves the women\u2019s group Association of Women for\nAction and Research (AWARE), founded on 25 November 1985, which\nhas proven itself to be a tireless long-term campaigner for women\u2019s\nrights in Singapore.
