A growing number of sites excavated over the past two decades in particular show occupation from c. the fourth to fifth century onwards while others provide a continual sequence stretching back well into the Iron Age. I argue that evidence from these sites makes a strong case for postulating a proto-Dvaravati period spanning c. the fourth to fifth centuries.

Each year thousands of visitors make the pilgrimage to Angkor Wat to witness the equinox sunrise over the temple\u2019s lotus-shaped towers. In addition to the equinox alignment, however, there are other alignments at Angkor Wat and many of the surrounding temples. In this article multiple solstice alignments are identified for Angkor Wat and eleven nearby temples to include: Bakong, Phnom Bakheng, Phnom Bok, Phnom Krom, East Mebon, Pre Rup, Banteay Srei, Ta Keo, Baphuon, Preah Khan, and Bayon. \nSubsequent to ground and aerial reconnaissance of the above sites, archaeoastronomic assessments were made using Google Earth, with solstice azimuths calculated using standard protocols. More than seventy solstice alignments were thus identified.\nThe multiplicity of solstice alignments combined with other data suggest that it was important for Angkor temples to be connected to the sun. If, as endorsed here, Angkor temples were microcosmic models of the cosmos, then arguably, solstice alignments connected the temples to the cyclic movement of the cosmos as manifested by the solar cycle. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60132982, "asset_id": 38378498, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2534628, "first_name": "William", "last_name": "Romain", "domain_name": "indiana", "page_name": "WilliamRomain", "display_name": "William F Romain", "profile_url": "https://indiana.academia.edu/WilliamRomain?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2534628/10051223/52937834/s65_william.romain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4081, "name": "Khmer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13731, "name": "Archaeoastronomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeoastronomy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 32297302, "title": "Gemstones in the First Millennium AD.

The main objective of SEANDA is to be an ever-evolving authoritative curated database of coinage produced in Southeast Asia from the fifth century CE to the beginning of the modern era. Initially, the project will focus on pre-Islamic coin series from mainland and island Southeast Asia, with Islamic and post-1400 CE material added as organizational resources become available.\n \nSEANDA will include full descriptions of all coin series, types, and varieties produced in the region together with high-quality digital images of the best examples available to researchers. Entries will be based upon the study of institutional holdings, private collections, previous research, dealer catalogues, auction offerings, and archaeological excavation reports among other resources. A full bibliographic apparatus will be supplied, together with links to additional online resources. To assist in their detection, modern forgeries, fakes, and fantasy pieces will be included as well.\n \nAnalysis of representative coin specimens and associated artifacts will assist in understanding design choices and symbolism, weight standards and denominations, mint practice, metallurgical content, as well as their function within Southeast Asian prestige, tribute, and trading networks. The inclusion of hoards and individual coin finds will be used to determine the numismatic geography for each series, type, and variety. Seals, sealings, seal impressions, renderings of coin motifs found in various media, copper-plate and stone inscriptions, as well as other related  historical documents, will be included in the database as well.\n\nThe objectives of SEANDA are three-fold. First, to provide a standard for describing and identifying Southeast Asia's numismatic heritage by archaeologists, researchers, museum professionals and collectors. Second, to bring together in a single location all reliable information regarding coin finds in the region. And third, to present that information in a readily accessible format. For more information, see USING THIS SITE.\n\nSEANDA is dedicated to honoring the numismatic contributions of Jan Wisseman Christie (1947-2021), Pamela Gutman (1944-2015), Vasilijs Mihailovs (1978-2015), B.N. Mukherjee (1932-2013), M. Harunur Rashid (1925-2010) and Nicholas Rhodes (1946-2011).\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to this effort, please contact me:\nRobert S.

Our investigation covers a range of scales, from the experiences of individual weavers ('micro') to the broad-scale patterns of loom technologies across the region ('macro'). Using published sources, we build an empirical model of cultural transmission (encompassing individual weavers, the household and the community), focussing on where cultural information resides and how it is replicated and how transmission errors are detected and eliminated. We compare this model with macro-level outcomes in the form of a new dataset of weaving loom technologies across a broad area of East and Southeast Asia.

Eric Boudot and Chris Buckley, Oxbow Books, Oxford, 2015.\n\nThis ground-breaking book documents the weaving traditions and textiles of one of Asia\u2019s most ethnically diverse areas, placing them in a regional context. It represents a novel approach to anthropological and ethnographic studies, based on detailed field reports and an explicitly comparative approach, integrating both statistical (Bayesian phylogenetic, Neighbornet) and classical methods to present a unified picture.\n\nThe first three chapters describe the ethnographic and linguistic and historical background to the region, focussing on the diversity of ethnicities, and their (sometimes turbulent) relations with the dominant Han Chinese polity. The authors review historical and archaeological remains of textiles and looms from the region, and present a revisionist account of the development of loom technologies.\n\nThe core of the book consists of detailed fieldwork, based on more than a decade of first-hand study. The authors record the traditions of Miao, Yao, Buyi, Dong, Zhuang, Maonan, Dai and Li weavers from Guizhou to Hainan Island. Their investigation focuses on decorated textiles made on the loom (as opposed to embroidery or appliqu\u00e9), since these are the most complex and most conservative part of the weaver\u2019s repertoire. They describe the looms and techniques of these groups, including diagrams, descriptions and photographs of the weaving processes and woven structures. Interviews with active weavers reveal the social dimensions of weaving and the items that are made from woven cloth, including marriage and burial related customs. Each tradition is illustrated with precisely provenanced examples of textiles from each sub-region, drawn from the He Haiyan collection in Beijing, including many nineteenth century examples. The research was carried out with a sense of urgency, since many traditions are disappearing, and in some cases are limited to a small number of elderly weavers. These accounts form a primary ethnographic source for weaving cultures in the region, many of which have never been documented before.\n\nIn the final chapter the authors present a comparative analysis of loom technology across the Asian mainland, using techniques derived from linguistics and biology (Bayesian analysis and Neighbornet plots). They use these to chart the evolutionary history of looms in Asia, demonstrating that all the major traditions in East Asia, Southeast Asia and Island Southeast Asia are structurally and functionally related, in spite of their apparent diversity, and have their origins on the Asian mainland in the same region that includes the apparent homlands of many of the major linguistic groups. The results have far-reaching implications for the understanding of how complex culture develops and spreads. The findings also shed light on widely-discussed topics such as the development of the Chinese Drawloom, showing how key features of the complex patterning device on this loom were derived from Tai-Kadai looms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39311832, "asset_id": 16855383, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 511354, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Buckley", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "ChrisBuckley", "display_name": "Christopher D Buckley", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/ChrisBuckley?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/511354/178087/75121118/s65_christopher.buckley.jpg"}, {"id": 16089636, "first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Boudot", "domain_name": "ephe", "page_name": "EricBoudot", "display_name": "Eric Boudot", "profile_url": "https://ephe.academia.edu/EricBoudot?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16089636/18480713/18443393/s65_eric.boudot.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2190, "name": "Chinese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2320, "name": "Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textiles?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3313, "name": "Cultural Transmission (Evolutionary Biology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Transmission_Evolutionary_Biology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 5256, "name": "History of Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Textiles?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6039, "name": "Textile Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textile_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 11096, "name": "Cultural Evolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Evolution?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26850, "name": "Chinese history (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_history_History_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 85947, "name": "Archaeological textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_textiles?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 88351, "name": "Weaving", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Weaving?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 118681, "name": "Archaeological textiles and clothing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_textiles_and_clothing?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 267436, "name": "Weaving/looms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Weaving_looms?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 353161, "name": "Prehistoric Textiles, Dyeing, Weaving", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Textiles_Dyeing_Weaving?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 462496, "name": "Pacific and Island Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_and_Island_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 795960, "name": "PRIMITIVE LOOMS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PRIMITIVE_LOOMS?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 965418, "name": "Evolutionary Cultural Archaeology  documenting/modeling/simulating the Evolutionary Pasts/futures of Known Systems (Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evolutionary_Cultural_Archaeology_documenting_modeling_simulating_the_Evolutionary_Pasts_futures_of?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 9974664, "title": "Looms, Weaving and the Austronesian Expansion", "created_at": "2015-01-01T19:44:31.105-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9974664/Looms_Weaving_and_the_Austronesian_Expansion?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_9974664", "summary": "Buckley C (2017) Looms, Weaving and the Austronesian Expansion.

In this paper I trace the weaving technologies of Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) to their origins on the Asian mainland. A distinctive suite of technologies, including the body-tensioned loom, warp ikat and the tubular sarong, is found across a wide area. In ISEA it is associated with Austronesian speakers, and remnants of it are found on the mainland amongst Daic and Austroasiatic speakers. Significantly, it is absent on Taiwan, which (together with Hainan and parts of Laos and Vietnam) preserve an older form of the loom. I conclude that the weaving traditions of ISEA came directly from the mainland, rather than via Taiwan.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54847256, "asset_id": 9974664, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 511354, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Buckley", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "ChrisBuckley", "display_name": "Christopher D Buckley", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/ChrisBuckley?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/511354/178087/75121118/s65_christopher.buckley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2320, "name": "Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Textiles?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 5256, "name": "History of Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Textiles?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 5602, "name": "Austronesian Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Languages?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 27026, "name": "Ancient Textiles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Textiles?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53227, "name": "Archaeology, Historical Archaeology.

A testable model is proposed applying \"Ricardo's Law of Comparative Advantage\" that focuses on \"regional exchange systems.\" Exchange networks existed in the middle Mekong and Chao Phraya basins from the pre-metal period through the metal age and underpinned heterarchical political and economic systems whereby goods and valuables were exchanged among decentralized networks of communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68088316, "asset_id": 49904647, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2639030, "first_name": "Joyce", "last_name": "White", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "JoyceWhite", "display_name": "Joyce White", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/JoyceWhite?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3155, "name": "Complexity Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Complexity_Theory?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6208, "name": "Economic Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Theory?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7275, "name": "South East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 18821, "name": "Archaeological Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Theory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24522, "name": "Archaeometallurgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeometallurgy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29543, "name": "Archaeological Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Methodology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 54252, "name": "Archaeological Method and Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory-2?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 222738, "name": "History of the middle Mekong lands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_middle_Mekong_lands?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 244992, "name": "Southeast Asian prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 408818, "name": "Thailand archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 423974, "name": "Northeast Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Northeast_Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 519512, "name": "Ban Chiang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ban_Chiang?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 653502, "name": "Southeast Asian Political Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Political_Economy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 798911, "name": "David Ricardo's Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/David_Ricardos_Theory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1624694, "name": "Prehistoric Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1778472, "name": "Archaeological methods and theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_methods_and_theory-1?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3601232, "name": "Prehistoric Northeast Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Northeast_Thailand?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 9839656, "title": "Late Quaternary Sea-Level Changes and the Palaeohistory of Palawan Island, Philippines", "created_at": "2014-12-19T07:56:17.732-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9839656/Late_Quaternary_Sea_Level_Changes_and_the_Palaeohistory_of_Palawan_Island_Philippines?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_9839656", "summary": "Palaeogeographic reconstructions of Palawan Island using Geographic Information Systems based on present-day bathymetry show extensive changes in land area with respect to sea-level fluctuations during the Late Quaternary. Our analysis shows that a lowering of at least 135 meters from present-day levels is needed in order to expose a narrow land connection between Palawan and Sundaland. This most likely last occurred during OIS 12 (ca. 440 Ka) and probably OIS 16 (ca. 630 Ka), facilitating overland colonization between the two islands. The reconstructions further illustrate the extent of land exposed, which was likely covered by open savannah vegetation during the LGP and inhabited by several large mammal species now extinct on the island. Sea-level rise at the end of the Pleistocene caused the inundation of shallow shelves of Palawan, and this, accompanied by a conversion to closed rainforest environments, was probably responsible for the disappearance of most of the large mammal fauna of Palawan. Coastline reconstructions demonstrate that the appearance of mid-Holocene shell middens in the Philippine archaeological record is due to the formation and proximity of mangrove forests during sea-level high-stand, rather than a consequence of changes in human subsistence strategies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36005564, "asset_id": 9839656, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12932, "first_name": "Helen", "last_name": "Lewis", "domain_name": "ucd", "page_name": "HelenLewis", "display_name": "Helen Lewis", "profile_url": "https://ucd.academia.edu/HelenLewis?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12932/79967/87805/s65_helen.lewis.jpg"}, {"id": 8066760, "first_name": "Emil", "last_name": "Robles", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "EmilRobles", "display_name": "Emil Robles", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/EmilRobles?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8066760/2902601/3391032/s65_emil.robles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 289, "name": "Palaeogeography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palaeogeography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2109, "name": "Environmental Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 14492, "name": "Coastal and Island Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_and_Island_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 18625, "name": "Sea Level", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Level?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 32163, "name": "Holocene sea level change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocene_sea_level_change?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 34817, "name": "Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 126498, "name": "Philippine Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 147365, "name": "Palawan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palawan?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 337642, "name": "Philippine Biodiversity as Explained by Island Biogeography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Biodiversity_as_Explained_by_Island_Biogeography?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 973681, "name": "Ille Cave", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ille_Cave?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 34196811, "title": "Rediscovering Heritage through Artefacts, Sites, and Landscapes: Translating a 3500-year Record at Ritidian, Guam", "created_at": "2017-08-10T18:29:07.426-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34196811/Rediscovering_Heritage_through_Artefacts_Sites_and_Landscapes_Translating_a_3500_year_Record_at_Ritidian_Guam?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_34196811", "summary": "The Ritidian Site in Guam contains multiple layers and components that together reveal the full scope of traditional cultural heritage in the Mariana Islands in the northwest tropical Pacific since 1500 B.C., dating from the beginning of human settlement of the Remote Pacific Islands.

This is especially the case for maritime heritage sites located in the low-lying coastal and delta regions of Asia. Maritime heritage can reflect both highly localized cultural products based on the coupling of people and maritime environments and the historic footprints of complex maritime networks that connect people, ideas, and material over vast distances, creating unique cultural spheres. Furthermore, maritime heritage sites potentially serve as or contain records of how past societies have been impacted by and adapted to past environmental stress. Therefore, their degradation threatens local/regional/global cultural patrimony as well as evidence of human resilience and fragility in the face of environmental change. This makes a strong case for urgent preservation. However, the possible damage caused by climate change and the scale of vulnerable maritime heritage pose seemingly insurmountable challenges. In this paper, we present the ways in which maritime heritage sites across Asia are vulnerable to environmental stresses, such as changing sea levels, coastal erosion, flooding, and storm surges. Our objective is to draw upon our experience documenting endangered cultural heritage across South and Southeast Asia to illustrate that there are unique conceptual and practical characteristics of maritime heritage that complicate effective management and conservation efforts on the scale required to prevent massive loss by climate change. We conclude by stressing the need to reconceptualize debates about the custody and stewardship of maritime heritage and the urgency of employing a wide range of innovative preservation solutions to ensure maritime patrimony is not lost to the rising tides.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86506403, "asset_id": 79968597, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4543014, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Daly", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "PatrickDaly", "display_name": "Patrick Daly", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/PatrickDaly?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4543014/1880097/11998414/s65_patrick.daly.jpg"}, {"id": 695135, "first_name": "Krisztina", "last_name": "Baranyai", "domain_name": "kyoto-u", "page_name": "KrisztinaBaranyai", "display_name": "Krisztina A Baranyai", "profile_url": "https://kyoto-u.academia.edu/KrisztinaBaranyai?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/695135/6603172/7464332/s65_krisztina_anna.baranyai.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6803, "name": "Digital heritage in architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_heritage_in_architecture?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 17517, "name": "Digital preservation (Cultural Heritage)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_preservation_Cultural_Heritage_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 18690, "name": "Digital Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Heritage?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19405, "name": "Cultural Heritage Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_Management?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24234, "name": "Heritage Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Management?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30980, "name": "Digital Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 128654, "name": "Heritage Conservation and Documentation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Conservation_and_Documentation?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 166004, "name": "Maritime Cultural Heritage Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Cultural_Heritage_Management?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 167848, "name": "Maldives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maldives?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 24883624, "title": "La poterie au Cambodge", "created_at": "2016-04-29T09:47:24.002-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24883624/La_poterie_au_Cambodge?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_24883624", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45203811, "asset_id": 24883624, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46707849, "first_name": "Roland", "last_name": "Mourer", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RolandMourer", "display_name": "Roland  Mourer", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RolandMourer?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/46707849/34307927/30208088/s65_roland.mourer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29518204, "title": "The Archaeology of Seafaring in Ancient South Asia", "created_at": "2016-10-29T02:53:01.681-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29518204/The_Archaeology_of_Seafaring_in_Ancient_South_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_29518204", "summary": "Himanshu Prabha Ray looks at the maritime orientation of communities of the Indian subcontinent prior to European expansion.

Contributors draw on the seminal work of Donald E. Brown whose major monograph on the sultanate was published in 1970 and marked the beginnings of advanced sociological, anthropological and historical research on Brunei. Among the key issues addressed are status systems, titles and social stratification, Chinese sources for the study of Brunei, Malay oral and written histories and traditions, the symbolism, meanings and origins of coronation rituals, previously unknown sources for the study of Brunei history and the processes of incorporation of minority populations into the sultanate. Contributions by leading scholars of Brunei, Borneo and the wider Indonesian-Malay world, both from within Brunei Darussalam and beyond, address some central preoccupations which Brown raised and which have been the subject of continued debate in Austronesian and Southeast Asian studies. A novel contribution to the study of the history of Brunei Darussalam, this book will be of interest to scholars of Southeast Asian history, Asian history, Colonial and Imperial history and anthropology.

discoveries and research in the archaeology of the region, presenting the evolution of complex societies in Southeast Asia from the protohistoric period, beginning around 500BC, to the arrival of British and Dutch colonists in 1600. Well-illustrated throughout, this comprehensive account explores the factors which established Southeast Asia as an area of unique cultural fusion. Miksic and Goh explore how the local population exploited the abundant resources available, developing maritime transport routes which resulted in economic and cultural wealth, including some of the most elaborate art styles and monumental complexes ever constructed.\n\nThe book\u2019s broad geographical and temporal coverage, including a chapter on the natural environment, provides readers with the context needed to understand this staggeringly diverse region. It utilizes French, Dutch, Chinese, Malay-Indonesian and Burmese sources and synthesizes interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives and data from archaeology, history and art history. Offering key opportunities for comparative research with other centres of early socio-economic complexity, Ancient Southeast Asia establishes the area\u2019s importance in world history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48845769, "asset_id": 28497667, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2176885, "first_name": "Geok Yian", "last_name": "Goh", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "GeokYianGoh", "display_name": "Geok Yian Goh", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/GeokYianGoh?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2176885/700363/869895/s65_geok_yian.goh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2529231, "name": "interaction spheres", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/interaction_spheres?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2529232, "name": "southeast asia's place in world archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/southeast_asias_place_in_world_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 2084758, "title": "Royal Geographic Magazine - The Mystery of the Jars", "created_at": "2012-11-03T12:00:06.271-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2084758/Royal_Geographic_Magazine_The_Mystery_of_the_Jars?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2084758", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29935712, "asset_id": 2084758, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 768, "name": "Biological Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2364, "name": "Paleopathology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleopathology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 6798739, "title": "Five Monumental Bhadrasana Buddhas from Nakhon Pathom", "created_at": "2014-04-18T08:17:59.537-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6798739/Five_Monumental_Bhadrasana_Buddhas_from_Nakhon_Pathom?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_6798739", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33500332, "asset_id": 6798739, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 684828, "first_name": "Nicolas", "last_name": "Revire", "domain_name": "artic", "page_name": "NicolasRevire", "display_name": "Nicolas Revire", "profile_url": "https://artic.academia.edu/NicolasRevire?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/684828/2836318/83102129/s65_nicolas.revire.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6733, "name": "Buddhist Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Art?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1209502, "name": "Dvaravati Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati_Period?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2168588, "title": "The peculiar history of the ethnonym \"Temiar\"", "created_at": "2012-11-20T12:39:20.531-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2168588/The_peculiar_history_of_the_ethnonym_Temiar_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2168588", "summary": "The names for the various Orang Asli populations of Peninsular Malaysia did not begin to achieve any recognisable similarity to current usage until the 1920s. Versions of the ethnonym \u2018Temiar\u2019, which identifies one of the largest of these populations, were first tentatively reported in the 1880s. At that time the people themselves were barely known to the outside world and were mostly referred to, if at all, by other names. The current spelling and pronunciation of the word \u2018Temiar\u2019 were not fully established until the 1950s, replacing a surprising variety of earlier written forms and pronunciations. A close examination of the latter throws light on the pre-modern relations holding between the Temiars and other populations. Etymological analysis, involving both Mon-Khmer and Austronesian sources, provides evidence that the earlier linguistic situation in the Peninsula was more complex than currently recognised. The Temiar language belongs to the Mon-Khmer (Austroasiatic) stock, but it has long been in contact with one or more Austronesian languages. Investigation suggests two likely etymological sources for the word \u2018Temiar\u2019, both meaning \u2018edge\u2019 or \u2018side\u2019, and having forms similar to the Malayo-Polynesian (but non-Malay) *tambir or to Mon-Khmer *tbiar.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56831952, "asset_id": 2168588, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403289, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Benjamin", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "GeoffreyBenjamin", "display_name": "Geoffrey Benjamin", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/GeoffreyBenjamin?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403289/357126/13699011/s65_geoffrey.benjamin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64117, "name": "Orang Asli", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orang_Asli?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 95891, "name": "Mon-Khmer linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon-Khmer_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 301841, "name": "Temiar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temiar?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 419213, "name": "Etnik Orang Asli Di Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etnik_Orang_Asli_Di_Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 471548, "name": "Ethnonyms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnonyms?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 50126891, "title": "Sea nomads of Southeast Asia: from the past to the present", "created_at": "2021-07-21T05:11:27.663-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50126891/Sea_nomads_of_Southeast_Asia_from_the_past_to_the_present?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_50126891", "summary": "Sea nomads have been part of the economic and political landscape of Southeast Asia for millennia. They have played many roles over the longue-dur\u00e9e: in certain periods proving central to the ability of land-based polities to generate wealth, by providing valuable maritime commodities, facilitating trade, forming a naval force to secure and protect vital sea lanes and providing crucial connectivity. They have existed in complex, codified relations with different sedentary populations, as pirates, guardians of the sea-lanes, merchants and explorers. Paradoxically, as modern states emerged, the sea nomads became progressively marginalized and impoverished. For many years, the sea nomads were assumed to be without history, and even without archaeology. This has proven far from the case, and recent archaeological findings allow us to more closely describe sea nomadism from the Pleistocene through the early Holocene up to the present. Integrating these findings with the latest in historical research, linguistics, ethnography and historical genetics allows us to better understand sea-nomad ways of life over a scale of millennia and to appreciate the diversity and flexibility of this sea-nomad world. This in turn enriches our understanding of nomadism and mobility as a way of life, and the sea not only as a landscape of resources, but as a home and spiritual landscape as well. \"An ambitious and provocative book.\u2026 It forces scholars to reexamine the role of sea nomads, particularly in the history of Southeast Asia.\"-Leonard Y.

Only the trading settlement of Lamri, perched on a headland above the reach of the tsunami, survived into and through the subsequent 15th century. It is of historical and political interest that by the 16th century, however, Lamri was abandoned, while low-lying coastal sites destroyed by the 1394 tsunami were resettled as the population center of the new economically and politically ascen-dant Aceh Sultanate.

This methodology has greatly increased our ability to determine the nature and origins of organic remains and, in turn, bolster our understanding of prehistoric lifeways. As a subfield of biomolecular archaeology, organic residue analysis has advanced considerably, with improvements in spectroscopic and chromatographic instrumentation, along with associated methods of sample preparation. New developments in metabolomics complement these advances and increase the power of analysis and identification of organic compounds preserved due to past human activities. We at the Departments of Anthropology and Geological Sciences as well as Florida Museum of Natural History are seeking to further expand the efficacy of organic residue analyses by combining metabolomic approaches available at the Southeast Center for Integrated Metabolomics with other techniques of residue analysis of organic extracts derived from archaeological materials conventionally being done at the University of Florida. Hence, this poster presents the results of the metabolomic analysis using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry of organic residues on archaeological pottery from four different geographic areas, namely, Central America, South America, Southeastern United States, and Southeast Asia.  These results demonstrate how metabolomics can be useful for the chemical analysis of organic residues on archaeological materials.

In pursuing this programme I will make use of a broad range of sources including chronicles and histories, letters and treaties, navigational instructions and travel literature, as well as (European) cartography of the 16th to 18th centuries. In order to gain deeper appreciation of the multi-faceted roles and understandings of the Singapore Straits across the longue dur\u00e9e, I  not only adduce and evaluate materials of European colonial origin, but importantly also heed special attention to sources of Asian origin in general, and specifically to materials that have originally been written in Arabic, Malay, Chinese and have been made accessible to the wider reading public in various contemporary translations. The modes of enquiry and the insights brought to paper here differ both in terms of scope and objectives from my earlier findings expounded in The Singapore and Melaka Straits published in 2010.",

A newly discovered coin of ancient Cambodia, issued by king \u012a\u015banavarman (Ishanavarman) I, c. AD 611\u2013635, reveals many insights into the history of ancient Cambodia and its international connections. The coin copies its designs from a gold coin originating from the kingdom of Samatata in south eastern Bangladesh, issued by a contemporary king \u015aa\u015b\u0101nka, c. AD 590\u2013637. The new coin shows the Khmer king to be a worshipper of the Indian god \u015aiva, sharing his religious beliefs with kings across northern India. The new coin also contributes to the debate on the chronology of the introduction of coinage in South East Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35441866, "asset_id": 9156090, "asset_type":

today to enshrine 8 hair relics of the Buddha, owes its origins to a single passage in the Mahavagga (Vinayapitaka) in which two traveling merchant-brothers offered the Buddha food at Bodh Gaya. The Buddha did not present relics to the brothers, but by the time of the great Commentaries, Buddhaghosa and Dhammapala had expanded the story to include 8 living hair relics that the Buddha gifted to the brothers. Accretions never stopped and by the time that the myth assumed importance in Burma (late 15th-century Mon, Burmese and Pali inscriptions at the Shwedagon), even a medieval Sri Lanka episode about a nagaraja was added,  from the Naladhatuvamsa. The later Burmese conquest of Lower Burma saw the myth expand yet into new directions, incorporating local nats, who assisted a search for the relics of past Buddhas who had visited Lower Burma. The most prominent nat was located at Sule Pagoda, a shrine elevated to prominence only because the pagoda was made the hub in the newly adopted city plan of British Rangoon. This chapter is merely a brief summary of the various myths and the monument's patronage.

It attempts to interpret historically and economically the presence of local minting that imitated or reinterpreted the models and symbols that prevailed in the rest of Indian-influenced Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nHow can the presence of Hellenized and Roman coins, originating from the Mediterranean Basin of from Indo-Greek kingdoms, be explained? How can the many medallions and coins belonging to the vast family of coins from the Indian-influenced kingdoms of Southeast Asia, particularly Pyu and Mon that thrived in what is now Myanmar and Thailand, be explained? And finally, how can the presence of coins that copy and imitate, but also reinterpret and combine in a novel way the monetary symbols cataloged to data be explained?\r\n\r\nDigging deeper into a history that remains obscure in many respects, this work will foster or rekindle a lively debate and be of passionate interest to Cambodians wanting to become familiar with and understand their

2021.\n\nAbstract\nBased on the two inscriptions dated Wednesday 8 September 1546 and Sunday 27 February 1564 on the walls of the North Gallery-East Wing and the East Gallery-North Wing of the 12th century Angkor Wat, George Coedes has dated the completion of the bas reliefs on these wings to the 16th century. This dating underscores that the bas reliefs on the walls of the galleries of the third enclosure of Angkor Wat were not all carved during the reign of a single Khmer monarch.  More significantly is the presence of bossed gongs solely in the north gallery \u2013 east wing, where, in other galleries gongs are not illustrated.  Two types of bossed gongs are carved \u2013 suspended bossed gongs, single or in pairs, and circle gongs with eight to nine bossed gongs.  It was during the reign of Ang Chan (1528\u20131566) that the bas-reliefs of the North-East gallery and the East-North gallery were carved in the 16th century.. However, it remains unresolved why gongs were not carved on the two wings that have direct references to Khmer monarchs --- the west-south gallery, with the narrative of the battle of Kurukshetra and the south-west gallery depicts the war exploits of King Suryavarman II, presumably carved the earliest by the 12th century.  Such grand narratives are usually accompanied by gongs.  By the 12th-13th century also, bossed gongs had been circulating along the Gulf of Thailand, Sumatra, Java and Mindanao.\n\n\u1793\u17c3\u179c\u17b7\u1785\u17b7\u178f\u17d2\u179a\u179f\u17b6\u179b\u1781\u17b6\u1784\u1787\u17be\u1784-\u1781\u17b6\u1784\u1780\u17be\u178f\u179f\u17d2\u179b\u17b6\u1794

Heritage Preservation\u00ab of the RGZM and the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology, hosted in December 2008 in Mainz. \r\nSince Antiquity the routes of the so-called Silk Road formed an important network for commercial, cultural and technological exchange. Far-reaching and criss-crossing the Asian continent they connected eastern and south-eastern parts of Asia to the Mediterranean world via both maritime and overland routes. Named after the lucrative silk trade, which developed during Han Dynasty, one tends to think of the Silk Road as a one-way road starting in China and ending at the Mediterranean. However, goods, technologies and ideas were travelling in both directions, and glass is an excellent example for a trade-good that arrived in the East from the West. The key developments of glass, which had its origins in the Middle and Near East, mainly took place in the Mediterranean and in the Arab World during Antiquity and Islamic times. Although known in the Far East since at least the Han Dynasty and treated as equivalent to precious stones, glass never played a significant role in Far Eastern cultures. Therefore glass finds from Far Eastern sites provide evidence for far-reaching trade relationships and imply cross-fertilization with other cultures. \r\nThus the contributions to this conference dealt with a geographical area between Western Europe, the Balkans, the Near East, Central Asia, as well as Eastern and Southeastern Asia and covered a chronological range from 200 BC to AD 1000. The conference focused on the one hand on recent results of scientific analyses of glass and on the other hand on archaeological questions. The possibility of interdisciplinary research was one of the focal points of the conference and hence this volume, as well as questions on workshops, raw material, technology and trade. \r\nThe international conference was considered to provide the participants with an insight beyond their own immediate concerns. By means of presenting studies of regionally specific glass forms and techniques as well as current methods and discoveries, even when not directly connected to the Silk Road, a broader perspective is offered.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34420931, "asset_id": 325324, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 235216, "first_name": "Alexandra", "last_name": "Hilgner", "domain_name": "uni-mainz", "page_name": "AlexandraHilgner", "display_name": "Alexandra Hilgner", "profile_url": "https://uni-mainz.academia.edu/AlexandraHilgner?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/235216/51715/17395713/s65_alexandra.hilgner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3316, "name": "Archaeological Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Science?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7172, "name": "Early Medieval Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Medieval_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7231, "name": "Silk Road", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7240, "name": "Silk Road Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7742, "name": "Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7870, "name": "Medieval Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8228, "name": "Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8916, "name": "Islamic Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12807, "name": "Archaeometry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeometry?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 31043, "name": "Medieval Glasses (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_Glasses_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 33694, "name": "Archaeology of Mediterranean Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Mediterranean_Trade?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 324361, "name": "Byzantine glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Byzantine_glass?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 352383, "name": "Celtic glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celtic_glass?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 360877, "name": "Roman Finds in Begram and Taxila", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_Finds_in_Begram_and_Taxila?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 516719, "name": "Inner Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inner_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 653910, "name": "Antique Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antique_Glass?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 21592969, "title": "The 'birth' of Brunei: Early polities of the northwest coast of Borneo and the origins of Brunei, tenth to mid-fourteenth centuries", "created_at": "2016-02-05T07:16:58.814-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21592969/The_birth_of_Brunei_Early_polities_of_the_northwest_coast_of_Borneo_and_the_origins_of_Brunei_tenth_to_mid_fourteenth_centuries?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_21592969", "summary": "This chapter explores the appearance of early polities and development of complex societies between the tenth and mid-fourteenth centuries along the northwest coast of Borneo, a region encompassing present-day Sarawak, Brunei and Sabah.

These breakthroughs cast the archaeological record of complexity in Sunda, Sahul, and Wallacea in an entirely different light to that of several decades ago, placing it on an equal footingto that of Africa, Asia, and Europe. The archaeological record of these regions now points to rich and diverse early modern human (Homo sapien) societies engaged in complex symbolic and technological behaviours demonstrating capacities for innovation and self-expression found in all modern human groups now around the globe. Here we provide a comprehensive review of all Pleistocene symbolic evidence reported for Sahul, Sunda, and Wallacea to date. We explore how recent findings have changed our perceptions of the first modern human colonists and our understanding of the origins and development of the rich and diverse cultures that arose in each region through time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63279007, "asset_id": 43014395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 309984, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Clarkson", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "ChristopherClarkson", "display_name": "Christopher Clarkson", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/ChristopherClarkson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/309984/62495/20350330/s65_christopher.clarkson.jpeg"}, {"id": 2290582, "first_name": "Sean", "last_name": "Ulm", "domain_name": "jamescook", "page_name": "SeanUlm", "display_name": "Sean Ulm", "profile_url": "https://jamescook.academia.edu/SeanUlm?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2290582/727444/1062207/s65_sean.ulm.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5439, "name": "Australian Indigenous Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1520297, "name": "Origins of Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Origins_of_Modernity?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44268558, "title": "2020_The Routledge Handbook of the Bioarchaeology of Climate and Environmental Change (download from link)", "created_at": "2020-10-10T08:53:10.346-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44268558/2020_The_Routledge_Handbook_of_the_Bioarchaeology_of_Climate_and_Environmental_Change_download_from_link_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_44268558", "summary": "This handbook examines human responses to climatic and environmental changes in the past,and their impacts on disease patterns, nutritional status, migration, and interpersonal violence. Bioarchaeology\u2014the study of archaeological human skeletons\u2014provides direct evidence of the human experience of past climate and environmental changes and serves as an important complement to paleoclimate, historical, and archaeological approaches to changes we may expect with global warming.\n\nComprising 27 chapters from experts across a broad range of time periods and geographical regions, this book addresses hypotheses about how climate and environmental changes impact human health and well-being, factors that promote resilience, and circumstances that make migration or interpersonal violence a more likely outcome. The volume highlights the potential relevance of bioarchaeological analysis to contemporary challenges by organizing the chapters into a framework outlined by the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Planning for a warmer world requires knowledge about humans as biological organisms with a deep connection to Earth's ecosystems balanced by an appreciation of how historical and socio-cultural circumstances, socioeconomic inequality, degrees of urbanization, community mobility, and social institutions play a role in shaping long-term outcomes for human communities.\u3000\n\nContaining a wealth of nuanced perspectives about human-environmental relations, book is key reading for students of environmental archaeology, bioarchaeology, and the history of disease. By providing a longer view of contemporary challenges, it may also interest readers in public health, public policy, and planning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64695603, "asset_id": 44268558,

The terrestrial vertebrate record provides for a more robust Palawan biostratigraphy and chronicles Late Quaternary changes in mammalian composition and human responses to the changing abundance of large mammal communities. Well-stratified shell layers and middens contain a wide variety of taxa derived from freshwater, estuarine and marine environments that also provide insights on varying subsistence strategies and the local ecology.

This chapter examines competing arguments for how and why cities first appeared in Southeast Asia, their timing, scale, and form. Despite heterogeneity in urban pattern, early Southeast Asian cities shared key \r\nstructural features in configuration and social construction that reflect pan-regional ideological systems. Fewer urban forms arose in insular Southeast Asia compared with the mainland, and they emerged later in time; selected examples are also included for comparison. Early Southeast Asian urban systems were participants in the process Sanskrit cosmopolitanism (sensu Pollock), but a growing body of archaeological research identifies regionalization in urban form that distinguished\r\neven the earliest Southeast Asian cities them from their South Asian counterparts.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38601845, "asset_id": 15256478, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 277, "name": "Urban Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3290, "name": "Urbanism (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20436, "name": "Urban And Regional Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_And_Regional_Planning?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 58763, "name": "Early Urbanization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Urbanization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 270341, "name": "Architecture and Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Urban_Planning?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 420501, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 462496, "name": "Pacific and Island Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_and_Island_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 508108, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 541823, "name": "Southeast Asian Art and Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_and_Architecture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1803741, "name": "Angkorian socio-economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkorian_socio-economics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2012519, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology and History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology_and_History?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 28401760, "title": "A Case Report on the Function(s) of the \u2018Mercury Jar\u2019: Fort Canning, Singapore, in the 14th Century, Archaeological Research in Asia, 2016, 7:10-17.", "created_at": "2016-09-10T20:51:35.767-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28401760/A_Case_Report_on_the_Function_s_of_the_Mercury_Jar_Fort_Canning_Singapore_in_the_14th_Century_Archaeological_Research_in_Asia_2016_7_10_17?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_28401760", "summary": "The 'mercury jar' is a distinctive type of Chinese ceramics unearthed from the Fort Canning site in Singapore, dating to the 14th century.

hanno inviato a prestito opere della loro biblioteca o fornito utili indicazioni per poterle consultare.\nMi sembra, oltre a ci\u00f2, che in lavori simili non esista un corredo bibliografico cos\u00ec ricco e, credo, anzi, che molte opere qui citate siano state talvolta del tutto trascurate, forse perch\u00e9 ritenute superate dal tempo, mentre a parer mio, sono da ritenersi basilari per uno studio documentato.\nPerci\u00f2 mi auguro che il seguente \u201ccontributo ad una bibliografia generale sulla Birmania\u201d sia accolto come il coronamento di tutto il lavoro, addirittura la base di esso.\n\nRenzo Carmignani,  1971 \u201cBirmania storia arte civilt\u00e0\u201d: 303", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51847258, "asset_id": 31499122, "asset_type": "Work",

of an ancient settlement in Singapore, but knowledge of this pre-colonial polity has not advanced much with time. Despite the archaeological recovery of material cultural remains of this settlement in recent years, historical discourse on the subject remains largely confined to either the epistemological significance of this settlement in the colonial and post-colonial histories of the Malay-speaking people in the Malay Archipelago, or the general importance of this landmark within the context of maritime trade in Southeast Asia. More often than not, artefacts are used only to highlight these narratives but are themselves seldom addressed.\n\nThis thesis is hence dedicated to the study of these artefacts as primary sources of 14th century Singapore. It seeks to address a fundamental question which underlies all narratives of the settlement but has hitherto been inadequately addressed by conjunctures and hypotheses: How complex was this pre-colonial Singapore society? In doing so, this thesis will first address the historiographical issues underlying this question by reviewing existing literature and primary sources concerning this pre-colonial entity. Deductions from the analysis of material cultural remains sampled from the archaeological site at the churchyard of the Saint Andrew\u2019s Cathedral (STA) will next be made. Finally, statistically-measured variations in their site distribution will reflect the nature of the settlement\u2019s spatial organization from which the degree of social complexity in pre-colonial Singapore can eventually be discerned.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54248617, "asset_id": 34357699, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 371409, "first_name": "Tse Siang", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "TseSiangLim", "display_name": "Tse Siang Lim", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/TseSiangLim?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/371409/99250/34186667/s65_tse_siang.lim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2773369, "name": "Singapore Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36534796, "title": "A Group of Clay Artefacts inscribed in Pali and Old Mon", "created_at": "2018-04-30T01:02:02.038-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36534796/A_Group_of_Clay_Artefacts_inscribed_in_Pali_and_Old_Mon?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_36534796", "summary": "This article will present a group of baked clay artefacts which are today scattered across various locations in Thailand, and which can be argued as all originating from the archaeological site at Tap Chumphon in Nakhon Sawan Province. Of the sixteen artefacts identified, eight bear similar, bilingual inscriptions written in Pali and Old Mon. These inscriptions are written in the commonly laballed \"Post-Pallava\" script, and based on palaeographic evidence have been dated roughly to the 8th-9th centuries CE. The Pali portion is the Ye Dhamm\u0101 verse, which is often inscribed on artefacts in Southeast Asia. The Mon portion states that merit was accrued by a donor for the supposed construction of a temple building, probably a pavilion or resthouse. This article will provide readings and translations for these inscriptions and will discuss the implications of this find, which show Tap Chumpon to be a unique settlement and indicate for contact with other communities in northeastern Thailand and with the Khmer culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56454157, "asset_id": 36534796, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7321973, "first_name": "Hunter", "last_name": "Watson", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "HunterWatson", "display_name": "Hunter I Watson", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/HunterWatson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7321973/2707430/17854941/s65_hunter.watson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4347, "name": "Pali literature & language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pali_literature_and_language?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 91218, "name": "Epigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epigraphy?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 95891, "name": "Mon-Khmer linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon-Khmer_linguistics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 67488513, "title": "Temple occupation and the tempo of collapse at Angkor Wat, Cambodia", "created_at": "2022-01-07T00:53:41.335-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67488513/Temple_occupation_and_the_tempo_of_collapse_at_Angkor_Wat_Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_67488513", "summary": "The 9th\u201315th century Angkorian state was Southeast Asia\u2019s greatest premodern empire and Angkor Wat in the World Heritage site of Angkor is one of its largest religious monuments. Here we use excavation and chronometric data from three field seasons at Angkor Wat to understand the decline and reorganization of the Angkorian Empire, which was a more protracted and complex process than historians imagined. Excavation data and Bayesian modeling on a corpus of 16 radiocarbon dates in particular demand a revised chronology for the Angkor Wat landscape. It was initially in use from the 11th century CE with subsequent habitation until the 13th century CE. Following this period, there is a gap in our dates, which we hypothesize signifies a change in the use of the occupation mounds during this period. However, Angkor Wat was never completely abandoned, as the dates suggest that the mounds were in use again in the late 14th\u2013early 15th centuries until the 17th or 18th centuries CE.

Finds of polished stone and\r\nbronze artifacts suggest the existence of early metal-using cultures in the Chindwin and Samon River Valleys, and along parts of the Ayeyarwady plain. Increasing technological and settlement\r\ncomplexity in the Samon Valley suggests that a distinctive culture whose agricultural and trade success can be read in the archaeological record of the Late Prehistoric period developed there.\r\nThe appearance of the early urban \u201cPyu\u201d system of walled central places during the early first millennium AD seems to have involved a spread of agricultural and management skills and population from the Samon. The leaders of the urban centres adopted Indic symbols and Sanskrit modes of kingship to enhance and extend their authority. The early urban system was subject over time to a range of stresses including siltation of water systems, external disruption and social changes as Buddhist notions of leadership eclipsed Brahmanical ones. The archaeological evidence indicates that a settlement was forming at Bagan during the last centuries of the first millennium AD. By the mid 11th century Bagan began to dominate Upper Burma, and the region began a transition from a system of largely autonomous city states to a centralised kingdom. Inscriptions of the 11th to 13th centuries indicate that as the Bagan Empire expanded it subsumed the agricultural lands that had been developed by the Pyu.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30441192, "asset_id": 2411556, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29898, "first_name": "Bob", "last_name": "Hudson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "BobHudson", "display_name": "Bob Hudson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/BobHudson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29898/9726/16646622/s65_bob.hudson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7279, "name": "Bagan period (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bagan_period_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56852, "name": "The Myanmar/Burma Pyu period, First Millennium CE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Myanmar_Burma_Pyu_period_First_Millennium_CE?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 394945, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies/ Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies_Myanmar?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 50449018, "title": "Was the Early History of Camp\u0101 Really Revised?

The first is to regard Linyi and Camp\u0101 as the same polity. He argues that these were two different kingdoms, and that the Linyi that appears in Chinese sources was located north of H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n pass and thus quite separate from the Thu B\u1ed3n valley which was the heartland of early Camp\u0101. The second tendency is to see Camp\u0101 as just \"a set of kingdoms of the same name\". Arguing against this point, he presents 6th-8th-century epigraphical evidence relating to the kingdom's territorial divisions and the contexts of the name Camp\u0101. He also examines the extent of Camp\u0101's territory from the Thu B\u1ed3n to \u0110\u00e0 R\u1eb1ng valleys under the Ga\u1e45g\u0101r\u0101ja, and its later expansion southwards into Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a. According to his interpretation of the military and territorial arrangements described in the epigraphical sources, early Camp\u0101 was a unitary state whose borders changed over time.\nZakharov, Anton O.

In prior decades, the region\u2019s pottery-bearing Neolithic sites were thought to reflect rice farming societies (which were identified as an \u201cEarly Neolithic Culture\u201d) linked to ancient Austronesian language groups. However, these beliefs may need to be revised now that archaeological findings have revealed an ongoing reliance on coastal and maritime resources, rather than rice agriculture, in this region since about 5000 BC, or even much earlier. More specifically, the evidence suggests that mixed-origin complex foragers successfully occupied the coastal zones of Fujian (\u798f\u5efa), Guangdong (\u5e7f\u4e1c), Guangxi (\u5e7f\u897f), Hainan (\u6d77\u5357), and perhaps Taiwan (\u53f0\u6e7e) around 5000 to 3000 BC. Only later did these groups experience variable degrees of cultural transformation and move towards rice agriculture as a result of their contact with migrating farmers from the middle and lower Yangtze Valley.

Researches by archaeologists in the last one century have led to the documentation of twenty-five archaeological sites in Loralai District.\nPrevious archaeological surveys in the Loralai District and Balochistan Province were based upon village-to-village methodologies. The present survey was carried in Tehsil Bori of District Loralai. Through the survey of ten transects, a total of twenty-six archaeological sites were discovered.  These archaeological sites were classified into 8 single-period and 13 multi-period sites, which included 6 Kot Dijian and 5 Harappan/Indus Civilization sites. Previous research suggested the presence of 10 Kot Dijian sites, including Dabar Kot, in District Loralai. The Discovery of large number of Kot Dijian and Harappan sites in a limited survey region suggests that District Loralai was not marginal when Kot Dijians and/or Pre-Harappans were laying the foundations of the Indus Civilization.  \n\nKey words: Tehsil Bori; Loralai District; Balochistan; Transect Survey; Systematic Survey; Settlement History; Landscape Choices; Kot Dijian culture; Harappans; Indus Civilization;\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68792019, "asset_id": 44100277, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 311210, "first_name": "Muhammad", "last_name": "Zahir", "domain_name": "educationlahore", "page_name": "Zahir", "display_name": "Muhammad Zahir", "profile_url": "https://educationlahore.academia.edu/Zahir?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/311210/76831/83668/s65_muhammad.zahir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 32448, "name": "History of Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Pakistan?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48150, "name": "Pakistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53106, "name": "South Asian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 63830, "name": "Indus Valley (Pakistan) Prehistory and Protohistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indus_Valley_Pakistan_Prehistory_and_Protohistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 147105, "name": "archaeology of costal areas of Balochistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/archaeology_of_costal_areas_of_Balochistan?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 158306, "name": "Balochistan History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balochistan_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 335570, "name": "Balochistan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balochistan_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1208944, "name": "Archaeology of Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Pakistan?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2149679, "name": "Balochistan protohistoric archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Balochistan_protohistoric_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 39530218, "title": "Data from Multiple Disciplines Connecting Vietic with the Dong Son Culture", "created_at": "2019-06-12T04:30:50.624-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39530218/Data_from_Multiple_Disciplines_Connecting_Vietic_with_the_Dong_Son_Culture?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_39530218", "summary": "This presentation provides linguistic, archaeological (material culture, genetic, and dental/cranial), and ethnonym data to explore possible language scenarios of the Dong Son culture (600 BCE to 200 CE) in the Red River Delta.

Despite some excellent studies in recent years (not yet widely known to the general public), these languages remain insufficiently researched. The author proposes reasons for encouraging further study of these languages -- for their own sake, for what they can add to general linguistics, and for what they can tell us about the people who speak them in relation to their broader Southeast Asian situation. A survey of the current sociolinguistic situation of the Aslian languages is followed by accounts of their more significant phonological, morphological and semantic features. A full bibliography is provided, listing both published and unpublished writings on the languages.\r\n[If you are especially interested in how at least one Aslian language works, see my papers

Relatively unknown in the West, the outer islands include all of Indonesia's islands except Java (including nearby Madura) and Bali, the better-known inner islands that border the Java sea. \r\n\r\nThrough the chapters of this book, the reader will travel from Nias in the far west to Irian Jaya in the east, encountering artworks that are exemplars of indigenous Indonesian aesthetics as well as masterpieces as defined by a Western collector's aesthetic. These works and the accompanying discussions will also introduce the peoples who produce them. Throughout this region, art links village life with the supernatural; it honors ancestors, cements alliances, affirms political power, social rank and kin relationships, and, of course, it simultaneously surrounds with beauty the peoples who create it. Yet each regional style presents topics and problems peculiar to it. The format of this presentation will allow readers to understand the similarity as well as the diversity, finding in the art of each region recurring themes and styles that reflect the closely related histories of the peoples and the similar purposes for which all Indonesians create art.\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\nNote:  Book is out of print; available from used-book dealers, e.g.: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&cm_sp=SearchF-_-home-_-Results&an=taylor&tn=beyond+the+java+sea&kn=&isbn=\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57080326, "asset_id": 36715193, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1386, "name": "Art Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Theory?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 55426, "name": "Maluku", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maluku?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 181544, "name": "Papua", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 188347, "name": "Sulawesi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sulawesi?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 220936, "name": "Nusa Tenggara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nusa_Tenggara?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 221325, "name": "Sumatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumatra?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 231304, "name": "Melanesian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melanesian_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 604747, "name": "West Papua - Irian Jaya - Indigenous and Nationalistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Papua_-_Irian_Jaya_-_Indigenous_and_Nationalistic_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 862905, "name": "Modern Indonesian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Indonesian_art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1522903, "name": "Dongson Bronze Drum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dongson_Bronze_Drum?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 36442437, "title": "Revisiting the Bujang Valley: A Southeast Asian entrep\u00f4t complex on the maritime trade route", "created_at": "2018-04-19T03:02:27.610-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36442437/Revisiting_the_Bujang_Valley_A_Southeast_Asian_entrep%C3%B4t_complex_on_the_maritime_trade_route?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_36442437", "summary": "In the early 1830s and 1840s, a British colonial official by the name of Colonel James Low uncovered evidence for an early culture with Indic traits in a river system known as the Bujang Valley. On the west coast of the Thai-Malay peninsula, the Bujang Valley is today located in the Malaysian state of Kedah. However, it wasn't until just before World War II that excavations took place, conducted by H. G. Quaritch Wales and his wife Dorothy. Their discoveries and subsequent publications led to the first real attempts to explain the origins and extent of this civilisation and its place within the larger South and Southeast Asian world. In the intervening years between Quaritch Wales's excavations and the present day, considerably more research has taken place within the Bujang Valley, though this has not been without controversy. Recently claims and counter-claims regarding the antiquity of Hinduism and Buddhism at the site have arisen in some quarters within Malaysia. It therefore seems pertinent that this material be re-evaluated in light of new scholarship and discoveries as well as the prevailing paradigms of interactions between South and Southeast Asia. This paper presents an updated reading of this material and argues that the Bujang Valley should be seen as a cosmopolitan trading port with substantive evidence for the presence of Hinduism and Buddhism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56356839, "asset_id": 36442437, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 770848, "name": "Malaysian archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37565183, "title": "Chinese Ceramics in Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2018-10-10T18:36:38.344-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37565183/Chinese_Ceramics_in_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37565183", "summary": "An archaeological and historical overview of the trade and exchange of Chinese ceramics into Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57542286, "asset_id": 37565183, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 371409, "first_name": "Tse Siang", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "TseSiangLim", "display_name": "Tse Siang Lim", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/TseSiangLim?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/371409/99250/34186667/s65_tse_siang.lim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 356975, "name": "Chinese Ceramics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Ceramics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9316772, "title": "EXCEL RESOURCE DATABASE/GUIDE (sortable/searchable; Sept. 30, 2022): 5,980 book/journal titles and documentaries regarding Ancient Egypt, Near East, Nubia, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabia, Anatolia, Aegean, Europe, India, SE Asia, Vikings, etc., from Prehistory to Roman period, plus.", "created_at": "2014-11-14T23:15:02.961-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9316772/EXCEL_RESOURCE_DATABASE_GUIDE_sortable_searchable_Sept_30_2022_5_980_book_journal_titles_and_documentaries_regarding_Ancient_Egypt_Near_East_Nubia_sub_Saharan_Africa_Arabia_Anatolia_Aegean_Europe_India_SE_Asia_Vikings_etc_from_Prehistory_to_Roman_period_plus?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_9316772", "summary": "DETAILS: This searchable Excel database reflects the collection of key Egyptological, Near Eastern, Nubian, Arabian, Anatolian, and Aegean, plus some selected European, Viking/Norse (new), Newfoundland archaeology (new), Beothuk/Amerindian (new), and other regions' book titles, journal issues, Great Courses lectures, and dvd documentary resources, spanning mainly Prehistory to the Roman period (but also later periods [for selected areas]), to aid in research, teaching courses, and related ventures.

the Dv\u0101ravat\u012b culture of central and northeast Thailand. Commonalities of decorative detail in architecture, sculpture and, in particular, sema stones are taken as evidence of direct contact between these two regions of the Southeast Asian mainland. Care is made to distinguish between shared motifs resulting from the common iconographic vocabulary originating from India, and patterns stemming from intra-regional links. In this respect, the rare quality of the artwork produced at sites in Camp\u0101 and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b indicates that the work was done by a single school of artists that travelled between them in search of patronage and employment. Routes of travel are identified on this basis, particularly those that cross the Lao B\u1ea3o pass and go through Muang Fa Daed (Kalasin province, northeast Thailand). Indeed, it is argued that Muang Fa Daed was the centre of an important intermediate territory located between Camp\u0101 and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b that had multiple and complex interactions with both, as well as the key regional centre of Champassak.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64961683, "asset_id": 44519091, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 429888, "name": "Champa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Champa?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 43093477, "title": "Kinship and Procreation in a Pyu Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin Stone Relief from \u015ar\u012bk\u1e63etra", "created_at": "2020-05-18T03:40:40.187-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43093477/Kinship_and_Procreation_in_a_Pyu_Vi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87u_Ananta%C5%9B%C4%81yin_Stone_Relief_from_%C5%9Ar%C4%ABk%E1%B9%A3etra?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_43093477", "summary": "This paper examines closely a stone relief carving found in 1919 at the Pyu city of \u015ar\u012bk\u1e63etra in Myanmar, which appears to be an unusual variant of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin iconographic type-the lotus stem germinating from the reclining Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's navel sprouts not one, but three lotus seats, with a recursion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u now flanked by Brahm\u0101 on the right and \u015aiva on the left.

Abstract: This paper examines closely a stone relief carving found in 1919 at the Pyu city of \u015ar\u012bk\u1e63etra in Myanmar, which appears to be an unusual variant of the Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin iconographic type-the lotus stem germinating from the reclining Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's navel sprouts not one, but three lotus seats, with a recursion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u now flanked by Brahm\u0101 on the right and \u015aiva on the left. Only six images depicting this iconographic variant of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Ananta\u015b\u0101yin have been found in Myanmar. Taking to heart Elizabeth Moore's calls to complicate the \"ethnic and linguistic homogeneity of 'Pyu culture' [which] has become entrenched in Burmese archaeology,\" this paper seeks to suggest alternative ways of thinking about such Pyu art.

The archaeological record shows a complex inventory of contacts and exchanges of goods and ideas from China and India intersecting in Southeast Asia. While globally-based trade and religion were formative, the region\u2019s indigenous resources and cultures not only provided attractive destinations and way-stations, but also molded non-native inputs to the dynamics of already extant socio-cultural systems. The arrival of Buddhism and Brahmanism on Southeast Asian shores is framed within this context and four regions are selected to highlight these processes: the Pyu in Myanmar, Dvaravati in Thailand, the Thai-Malay peninsula, and Pre-Angkorian Cambodia from the mid-first millennium CE onwards. Southeast Asians successfully managed the twin processes of globalization and localism, adapting Buddhist and Brahmanical practices to suit their situations. These fusions facilitated transformations of Southeast Asian societies, setting them on trajectories leading to the formation of fully fledged, unique Buddhist and Brahmanical states such as Angkor in Cambodia, Bagan in Myanmar, and Sukhothai in Thailand.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56356803, "asset_id": 36442410, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}, {"id": 719996, "first_name": "Leedom", "last_name": "Lefferts", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LeedomLefferts", "display_name": "Leedom Lefferts", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LeedomLefferts?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 508108, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 14578590, "title": "Buddhist Art of Myanmar (Asia Society, New York, exhibition catalogue)", "created_at": "2015-08-02T08:57:33.048-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14578590/Buddhist_Art_of_Myanmar_Asia_Society_New_York_exhibition_catalogue_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_14578590", "summary": "Contributors: Robert Brown, Tun Aung Chain, Sylvia Fraser-Lu, Jacques Leider, Patrick Pranke, Adriana Proser, Donald Stadtner and Heidi Tan.

"work_38239175", "summary": "Two themes provide unity to Buddhism across Asia: one is the image of the Buddha that has been venerated by communities in all regions through time; and the other is the worship of the relics. Both these practices brought the monastics and the laity together in celebration of the eightfold path shown by the Buddha in the middle of the first millennium BCE, which was founded on wisdom, morality and concentration. The challenge is to trace the historical trajectory for the expansion of Buddhism across Asia, as donations were made and patronage provided both by the laity and the monastics in the building of stupas and relic shrines. Huge images of the Buddha were transported across South Asia and installed as evident from inscriptions recording details of the patron and the date of installation. This underscores the active participation and mobility of learned monks and nuns in the stupa and relic cults across Asia as new monastic complexes developed and the histories of these complexes came to be recorded. \nThe introduction of archaeology in Asia from the eighteenth century onward, which was then under colonial rule and the search by European powers for the ancient civilizations of their colonized territories accelerated the search for sites associated with the \u2018historical\u2019 Buddha and the religion that he introduced, which was termed \u2018Buddhism\u2019. Several factors need to be considered, such as the role of European missionaries who first wrote about this new religion of Asia, academics who studied manuscript collections from the colonies in libraries in Europe, and archaeologists who sought answers to new discoveries in ancient texts. A good example of this is the work of Alexander Cunningham the newly appointed Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1861 who used the Sri Lankan Chronicle the Mahavamsa dated to the 4th century CE as the basis for understanding the archaeology of monastic complexes that he discovered in north India in a period that predates the Mahavamsa by at least six hundred years. Cunningham\u2019s reliance on texts far removed from the region under study and his faith in the veracity of accounts by Chinese pilgrims who visited India in the 5th to 7th centuries led to several controversial results, which have been rectified by more recent archaeological research, as discussed in this paper.     \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58280772, "asset_id": 38239175, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19093, "name": "Indian Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Buddhism?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 80206669, "title": "Chapter One-", "created_at": "2022-05-29T12:50:20.330-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80206669/Chapter_One_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_80206669", "summary": "\n\n\tThe Atlas of Maritime Silk Road Buddhism by Prof Lewis Lancaster contains a series of lectures he presented at the Department of Religious Studies for the University of the West in California.

The recent discovery of the Callao 3rd metatarsal in northern Luzon, which has been provisionally identified as a small bodied Homo sapiens and dated to 67 ka, suggests an earlier colonization of Island Southeast Asia by our species than previously considered. Landscape reconstructions are aiding in building a better understanding of how people adapted to the new and varied environments they encountered across the region, and recent lithic use wear analyses are demonstrating that tool technologies and hence human behaviour was more complex than had been previously envisaged. Wear traces and residues on unretouched and morphologically less characteristic flaked artefacts provided evidence for hafting and the use of adhesives showing that they could have served as hafted armatures of multicomponent tools.\n\nChapter 11, in: R.

In addition to the lectures, there are many images in the volume from the large museum exhibits that opened at the City University of Hong Kong and the Buddha Museum at Fo Guang Shan in Taiwan.  As part of the data collecting process, Prof Sarah Kenderdine from Lausanne, Switzerland secured a grant from the Australian Research Council to take 3-D and surround images from Buddhist sites tied to the maritime route from India to East Asia. More than three months of filming with camera crews in India, Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Cambodia, and China resulting in a major collection of high density photographs, videos, and sound recordings.  These images were taken by Prof Jeffrey Shaw of Hong Kong and installed as museum exhibitions using 3-D and Virtual Reality that allow visitors to experience the art, architecture, and cultural features on the journey from the shores of India to China. This volume has now been produced by the Institute for the Study of Humanistic Buddhism at Fo Guang Shan to accompany the museum exhibits providing a description of the data used in filming and the research that helped create the story that is told about Maritime Buddhism. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86792042, "asset_id": 80396649, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12119733, "first_name": "Lewis", "last_name": "Lancaster", "domain_name": "berkeley", "page_name": "LewisLancaster", "display_name": "Lewis Lancaster", "profile_url": "https://berkeley.academia.edu/LewisLancaster?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12119733/3533863/4148912/s65_lewis.lancaster.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2882, "name": "Chinese Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7240, "name": "Silk Road Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8356, "name": "Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8539, "name": "Eurasia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eurasia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12381, "name": "Indian ancient history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_ancient_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19093, "name": "Indian Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Buddhism?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25768, "name": "Buddhist Economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Economics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 43802, "name": "Buddhist art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 157160, "name": "Maritime and Underwater Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_and_Underwater_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 186159, "name": "early Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/early_Buddhism?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 300565, "name": "Archaeology and Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_and_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 507591, "name": "Buddhist monasticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_monasticism?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 959279, "name": "Religious Studies /Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies_Indology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 35717310, "title": "From Gandhara to Java?

Often, this asana is combined with the teaching \u201cGesture of Turning the Wheel of the Law\u201d (dharmacakramudra). This iconographic type is commonly found in some of the oldest Buddhist and artistic cultural centers of both South and Southeast Asia during the mid-to-late first millennium CE. It must be distinguished from another common group of Buddhas in bhadrasana also found in Southeast Asia \u2013 but rarely in South Asia \u2013 showing the teaching gesture with only the right hand raised (vitarkamudra). \nSouth Asian antecedents are well known for Buddhas in bhadrasana and dharmacakramudra; they are found in Gandhara and Sarnath as early as the fourth-fifth century CE. This iconographic type became a hallmark of the rock-cut caves of Ajanta, Ellora, Kanheri, and many other western Deccan sites in Maharashtra from the turn of the sixth century onwards; it was also adopted later in Nalanda and other Pala sites of Bihar and Bengal. On many occasions, these Buddhas are arranged as the central figure in triads and are surrounded by two standing Bodhisattvas. Several images from central Java, dateable to approximately the late eighth through ninth century, share the same iconography. The most famous Javanese example is no doubt the Buddha carved in stone enshrined at Candi Mendut, near Borobudur.\nThe paper traces the origins and significance of this particular iconographic type in South Asia as well as its chronological development and spread in Southeast Asia through the maritime trade routes. An explanation of the triadic arrangements that can be observed in situ in most western Deccan caves with their central shrine Buddha images in bhadrasana and dharmacakramudra will be proposed. Several iconographic parallels and stylistic similarities with Maharashtra cave sites lead me to suggest that this triadic arrangement, probably based on certain Buddhist texts, was exported to central Java from this specific region.

The monumental palimpsest of temples, tanks, and channels that now comprises Greater Angkor belies the fragile web of patronage and factionalism that supported most Angkorian rulers.  Successful kings integrated agrarian provinces into the broader Sanskrit cosmopolis through alliance-building and negotiation. They depended on religious institutions and the priestly elite who managed them. Angkor\u2019s state temples required a continuous flow of capital and labor from communities throughout the Angkorian world. So did the administrative apparatus whose residents populated its urban capital.

There is still a trend to visualize a kind of globalized commercial activity between the Imperium and communities on the eastern edge of the Silk Road(s). However the facts provide us a more comprehensive picture. Due to the meticulous work of international joint research projects working in East and Southeast Asia followed by a raised interest in collecting ancient objects among local people, increasing number of Roman objects have been discovered in the region. These finds prove the significance of mediator cultures in transferring Roman artifacts beyond India \u2013 with their own imprints on forming evaluation/acceptance of these non-local goods by the receiving culture. \nAt the same time, one must keep in mind that Roman objects discovered in East and Southeast Asia have different backgrounds, and most cases \u2013 due to extensive looting \u2013 are lacking archaeologically secure context. Therefore, a careful approach towards these finds is essential along with re-evaluation of earlier discoveries. Detailed and objective report of Roman artifacts newly discovered in East and Southeast Asia \u2013 whatever their background may be \u2013 is a first step towards a more elaborative study.\nIn the following pages, fourteen Roman and Byzantine coins along with eleven Chinese coins found in different locations in East Java will be studied. \n\nERRATA: \nPage 485 ; Appendix 2:\nKhlong Thom (Krabi, Thailand): proved to be non-Roman;\nBang Kluay Nok (Ranong Province, Thailand): Roman", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58841569, "asset_id": 38753453, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2522962, "first_name": "Krisztina", "last_name": "Hopp\u00e1l", "domain_name": "elte", "page_name": "KHopp\u00e1l", "display_name": "Krisztina Hopp\u00e1l", "profile_url": "https://elte.academia.edu/KHopp%C3%A1l?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2522962/788061/979475/s65_krisztina.hopp_l.jpg"}, {"id": 51821663, "first_name": "Ya Hui", "last_name": "Lu", "domain_name": "cass", "page_name": "YaHuiLu", "display_name": "Ya Hui  Lu", "profile_url": "https://cass.academia.edu/YaHuiLu?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51821663/13790850/14892233/s65__._.jpg"}, {"id": 6663170, "first_name": "Istvan", "last_name": "Vida", "domain_name": "hnm", "page_name": "IstvanVida", "display_name": "Istvan Vida", "profile_url": "https://hnm.academia.edu/IstvanVida?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28478, "name": "Roman numismatics and archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_numismatics_and_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29392, "name": "Ancient Roman Numismatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Roman_Numismatics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 92448, "name": "Indo-Roman Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Roman_Trade?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 247154, "name": "Silk Road Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 247155, "name": "Archaeology of the Silk Road", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_the_Silk_Road?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 518936, "name": "The Silk Road and other ancient trade routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Silk_Road_and_other_ancient_trade_routes?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 634974, "name": "Roman Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1339373, "name": "Ancient Javanese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Javanese_History?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 36442500, "title": "Ports of call in ninth-century Southeast Asia: The route of the Tang Shipwreck", "created_at": "2018-04-19T03:11:40.437-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36442500/Ports_of_call_in_ninth_century_Southeast_Asia_The_route_of_the_Tang_Shipwreck?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_36442500", "summary": "The Southeast Asia that the Tang Shipwreck encountered\nalong its voyage to and from China was a patchwork of vibrant,\ndiverse cultures.

River Valley is a key region for the early development of rice farming and the emergence of wet rice paddy field systems. Subsistence evidence from Neolithic sites in this area highlights the importance of freshwater wetlands for both plant and animal food resources. Early Neolithic rice cultivators looked inland, especially to wetlands and nearby woodlands, for their main protein sources. Links to the sea among these Neolithic populations are notably scarce. Due to the high yields of wet rice, compared with other staple crops as well as dryland rice, the wetland rice focused subsistence strategy of the Lower Yangtze would have supported high, and increasing, local population densities. Paddy agriculture demands labor input and water management on a large scale, which would have stimulated and reinforced trends towards more complex societies , such as that represented by Liangzhu in the lower Yangtze region. Population growth could have been largely absorbed locally, suggesting that population packing, not migration, was the dominant trend. Other case studies of agricultural dispersal, for the Korean Peninsula and Japan further illustrate the lack of correlation between the spread of rice agriculture and wet rice cultivation. Although wet rice cultivation was a pull factor that drew local populations towards increased density and increased social complexity, it did not apparently push groups to migrate outwards. Instead, the transition from wetland to rain fed rice cultivation systems and/or the integration of rice with rain fed millet crops are much more likely to have driven the demographic dynamics that underpin early farmer migrations and crop dispersal.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61815235, "asset_id": 41661027, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28295, "first_name": "Dorian", "last_name": "Fuller", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "DorianFuller", "display_name": "Dorian Fuller", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/DorianFuller?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28295/9222/222915/s65_dorian.fuller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1742, "name": "Archaeobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeobotany?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10285, "name": "China (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11199, "name": "Neolithic Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neolithic_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 22146727, "title": "A study of mid-first millennium CE Southeast Asian specialized glass beadmaking traditions (Lankton et al 2008, ISEA)", "created_at": "2016-02-18T10:01:51.957-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22146727/A_study_of_mid_first_millennium_CE_Southeast_Asian_specialized_glass_beadmaking_traditions_Lankton_et_al_2008_ISEA_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_22146727", "summary": "Beads are important and often culturally diagnostic artifacts, although their full archaeological, chronological, and ethno-historical information potential may be dif\ufb01cult to unlock, at least in part because of spread through long-distance trade, possible longevity in use, and the visual similarity of many beads, particularly to the non-specialist. In contrast to the relatively extensive research on small Indo-Paci\ufb01c beads, there has been little academic attention to other types of South and Southeast Asian glass beads from the \ufb01rst millennium CE. We report here on four such groups: Bird Star, dark blue or black drawn beads with a trailed design in white glass of a bird on one side and a star on the other; hexagonal bicone, usually translucent beads from two to \ufb01ve centimeters long; opaque monochrome beads, ranging from one to three centimeters in diameter; and Jatim, large and small polychrome beads named for their close association with east Java, or Jawa Timur. Although there is little archaeological or textual data for these beads, we \ufb01nd that compositional analyses, derived from LA-ICP-MS, SEM-EDS and EPMA measurements, can help answer such questions as what types of glass were used for their manufacture, and was it imported or locally produced; was the glass colored locally; who made the Jatim mille\ufb01ori mosaic canes; and do the four types of glass beads represent four separate traditions? The answers to these questions help us to characterize potential beadmaking sites, and give us some insight into the technological choices made by the beadmakers themselves.",

This essay presents the results of a regional study conducted since 2005 in the Isthmus of Kra in the Thai-Malay Peninsula, a narrow piece of land located between the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. It argues that in this region, Maritime Silk Road incipient trading states' emergence went along economic specialisation, cultural differentiation and cooperation between different groups participating in local and long-distance networks. Amongst these so-called \"marginal\" groups emerge \"sea nomads\". Like those described in historical and ethnographic sources some of which are referred to here, these early sea nomads appeared to have already played a crucial economic and political role as part of these maritime trading polities hinterland. Along with an archaeology of sea nomadism, this study opens perspectives on reconstructing a more complete narrative of Southeast Asia and beyond of the Maritime Silk Road, a narrative that integrates marginal groups.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58621989, "asset_id": 38550594, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}, {"id": 4855180, "first_name": "Aude", "last_name": "Favereau", "domain_name": "ncku", "page_name": "AudeFavereau", "display_name": "Aude Favereau", "profile_url": "https://ncku.academia.edu/AudeFavereau?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4855180/2080332/23745833/s65_aude.favereau.jpg"}, {"id": 6788952, "first_name": "Laure", "last_name": "Dussubieux", "domain_name": "fieldmuseum", "page_name": "LaureDussubieux", "display_name": "Laure Dussubieux", "profile_url": "https://fieldmuseum.academia.edu/LaureDussubieux?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12402, "name": "Ethnic minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_minorities?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65038, "name": "Tribal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tribal_studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 82703, "name": "South China Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_China_Sea?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 332241, "name": "Hinterlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinterlands?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 410205, "name": "Port cities and port systems history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Port_cities_and_port_systems_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 648379, "name": "Ancient City-States", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_City-States?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 880051, "name": "Sea Gypsies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Gypsies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 917562, "name": "Sea Nomads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Nomads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 2588398, "title": "\u2022\tArch\u00e9ologie(s) en situation coloniale : paradigmes et situations compar\u00e9es (vol. 1), in Nouvelles de l\u2019arch\u00e9ologie, n\u00b0 126, Dec. 2011 (co-edited with Alexandra Galitzine-Loumpet  and Claude Rapin)", "created_at": "2013-02-17T07:55:08.710-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2588398/_Arch%C3%A9ologie_s_en_situation_coloniale_paradigmes_et_situations_compar%C3%A9es_vol_1_in_Nouvelles_de_l_arch%C3%A9ologie_n_126_Dec_2011_co_edited_with_Alexandra_Galitzine_Loumpet_and_Claude_Rapin_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2588398", "summary": "Cette publication voudraient esquisser une r\u00e9flexion comparative sur les formes d\u2019arch\u00e9ologies coloniales et interroger, au travers de cas pr\u00e9cis, ses implications id\u00e9ologiques et \u00e9pist\u00e9mologiques. \u00c0 terme, l\u2019objectif de ces r\u00e9flexions est de proposer un paradigme qui puisse rendre compte d\u2019une perception du pass\u00e9 Autre, \u00e0 l\u2019articulation de l\u2019arch\u00e9ologie et de l\u2019ethnologie, et d\u2019en reconsid\u00e9rer les \u00e9ventuels usages au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode concern\u00e9e.

observations on Austroasiatic and Vietic etyma in Vietnamese. Lexical data from two dozen Vietic lects were assembled, half from the Mon-Khmer Etymological Database (MKED hereafter) and half from various other published and unpublished sources. Based on Ferlus\u2019s preliminary reconstructions of Proto-Vietic (by Ferlus 2007 in the MKED), and data from Austroasiatic, Proto-Tai, and Old and Middle Chinese, approximately 800 items have been evaluated as viable reconstructions. However, of these, nearly 100 are Chinese loanwords of differing periods, and several are early Tai loanwords. The remaining nearly 700 items are native, including about 200 Proto-Austroasiatic etyma, with a few dozen local Austroasiatic words, and over 460 items specific to Vietic. Statistics have been gathered for cultural domains of the reconstructed vocabulary. A combination of etymological sources, semantic domains, and ethnohistorical data (i.e. archaeology, historical texts, and ethnographic information) allow for hypotheses about the ethnolinguistic circumstances of the early Vietic speech community and language contact situations. Many of the cultural domains are readily identified as part of a Neolithic lifestyle (i.e. words related to the natural environment, generic actions, etc.). Some, on the other hand, demonstrate social stratification (e.g. words related to economic practices) and developed agricultural practices (e.g. a large set of terms related to rice production). Others shed light on regional spread of cultural practices (e.g. betel-nut chewing and tooth-blackening) and intergroup contact (e.g. with Sinitic and Tai).

Although hundreds of individuals from dense cemeteries are found in several hunter-gatherer sites in Guangxi, Southern China, and Northern Vietnam, dating from the early to middle Holocene (ca. 9,000-4,500 years BP), so far, little has been known about food sources in these prefarming contexts. In particular, plant food resources have been unclear, although they likely were crucial to supporting rather large populations of hunter-gatherers in this region. To investigate this issue, micro plant remains, including starches and phytoliths, were recovered from stone tools excavated at the Cai Beo site in Ha Long Bay of coastal Northeastern Vietnam, and those findings revealed new understanding of the ancient diet. Examinations of those residues indicated that the hunter-gatherers at Cai Beo as early as 7,000-6,000 years BP exploited a broad spectrum of plants, such as taros, yams, acorns, palms, and more. This study exemplifies how maritime hunter-gatherers interfaced with the local plants and generated population growth from about 7,000 to 4,500 years BP. The results help us to conceptualize the early exploitation, management, and potential cultivation of subtropical and tropical plants over the broad geography of Asia and the Pacific before the arrival of rice and millet farming. In particular, the result validates the significance of roots and tubers in the ancient subsistence economy of Southeast Asia. Moreover, from the archaeological context of 4,500 to 4,000 years BP, the rice discovered in this study represents one of the earliest known in Mainland Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88180878, "asset_id": 82479635, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5396570, "first_name": "Hsiao-chun", "last_name": "Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "HsiaochunHung", "display_name": "Hsiao-chun Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/HsiaochunHung?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5396570/2368493/93661660/s65_hsiao-chun.hung_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10158, "name": "East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11199, "name": "Neolithic Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neolithic_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41578, "name": "Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunter-Gatherer_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1205503, "name": "Vietnamese Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 49073552, "title": "Two Traditions: A Comparison of Roof Tile Manufacture and Usage in Angkor and China, Asian Perspectives: The Journal of Archaeology for Asia and the Pacific, vol.60, no.1, 2021, pp.128-156.", "created_at": "2021-05-30T07:35:19.372-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49073552/Two_Traditions_A_Comparison_of_Roof_Tile_Manufacture_and_Usage_in_Angkor_and_China_Asian_Perspectives_The_Journal_of_Archaeology_for_Asia_and_the_Pacific_vol_60_no_1_2021_pp_128_156?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_49073552", "summary": "The production of Khmer roof tiles underwent dramatic technical and stylistic changes during the pre-Angkorian (ca. C.E. 500-802) and Angkorian (C.E. 802-1431) periods. It has long been assumed that the regional expansion of Khmer political power and its intensive interregional trade and interactions with China during the Angkorian period were crucial factors in this transformation. This article presents the first integrated study on the production sequence and usage of Khmer roof tiles in Angkor (Cambodia) and its provincial centers in Northeast Thailand. Furthermore, it evaluates the extent to which the Khmer people made technological and social choices as they embraced new ceramic manufacturing technologies. Combining archaeological excavation findings with comparative analyses of two regions, this study argues that the contact the Khmer had with China motivated Khmer to begin roof tile production for elite residences and temples. The subsequent Khmer local architectural tradition is defined by distinctive production techniques of Khmer roof tiles and ancient ranking systems for roof tile usage in the greater Angkorian region. This article makes important observations about the specific choices that were made in the process of emulating the roof tile tradition. Roof tile manufacture and usage were ways for Khmer rulers to establish the legitimacy of their polities in mainland Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67466488, "asset_id": 49073552, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18949695, "first_name": "Sharon Wai-yee", "last_name": "Wong", "domain_name": "cuhk", "page_name": "SharonWongWaiyee", "display_name": "Sharon Wai-yee Wong", "profile_url": "https://cuhk.academia.edu/SharonWongWaiyee?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18949695/9712254/10817968/s65_sharon_wai-yee.wong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2213, "name": "Pottery (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557, "name": "History of Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Technology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6735, "name": "Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 10158, "name": "East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 16903, "name": "Traditional Crafts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Crafts?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19755, "name": "World Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24516, "name": "Chinese archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29426, "name": "Cultural Exchange", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Exchange?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30723, "name": "Maritime Trade Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Trade_Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 33106, "name": "Ancient Craftmanship (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Craftmanship_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 184543, "name": "Cha\u00eene Op\u00e9ratoire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cha%C3%AEne_Op%C3%A9ratoire?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 356975, "name": "Chinese Ceramics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Ceramics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 64903951, "title": "Champa: Territories and Networks of a Southeast Asian Kingdom", "created_at": "2021-12-17T14:15:04.653-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/64903951/Champa_Territories_and_Networks_of_a_Southeast_Asian_Kingdom?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_64903951", "summary": "In the past quarter century, Champa scholarship has been seeking ways out of the interpretative framework inherited from Georges Maspero\u2019s Le royaume de Champa, which portrayed Champa as a unitary kingdom of provinces ruled by \u201cabsolute\u201d kings. Scholars have since been working to revise this portrait, to develop new thinking about the way the kingdom and its territories were structured, and also to critique Maspero\u2019s decision to end his history of Champa with the 1471 capture of the Cha Ban citadel and fall of Vijaya. Much new data has been produced in recent decades, thanks especially to the access to Champa field sites enjoyed since the 1990s by international scholars under Vietnam\u2019s open door policy, and to the resources for research and discussion now available to Vietnamese scholars.

Although these gold objects are personal ornaments testifying to an innovative local craft tradition that was partly inspired by foreign technologies and styles, their role in the interregional and long-distance exchange network of the early Southeast Asian communities has been rarely considered. This study of early gold ornaments brings together important gold discoveries on sites in Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, and southern China, and discusses similarities in production, consumption, and exchange. It further attempts to offer some new insights into sociopolitical and economic changes on a regional scale, and hopes to contribute to a longue-duree examination of trading connections across Asia. It is proposed that the first arrival of gold ornaments was closely related to the blossoming of trade activities on the terrestrial and maritime silk routes, and the political, religious, and artistic ideas that reached Southeast Asia from far-away regions such as the Greco-Buddhist and Hindu-Buddhist regions. Furthermore it is argued that gold ornaments were prestige goods and an essential part of dressing strategies through which changing elite identities were expressed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53268692, "asset_id": 27883037, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7060366, "first_name": "michele", "last_name": "demandt", "domain_name": "jinan", "page_name": "micheledemandt", "display_name": "michele demandt", "profile_url": "https://jinan.academia.edu/micheledemandt?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7060366/14814522/15608595/s65_michele.demandt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 265311, "name": "Ancient Goldsmith Techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Goldsmith_Techniques?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32406370, "title": "BiblioNewsChiangMai-01-v8-PDF.pdf", "created_at": "2017-04-13T02:05:16.305-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32406370/BiblioNewsChiangMai_01_v8_PDF_pdf?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_32406370", "summary": "BiblioNewsChiangMai is a monthly newsletter produced as a hobby by Louis Gabaude in partnership with the \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient library in Chiang Mai.

The roots of 9th-14th century Angkorian civilization appeared in the Mekong delta more than a millennium before Jayavarman II declared himself the universal Khmer monarch in 802 CE. At the start and to the south was the early polity that 3rd century Chinese emissaries called Funan, and that contained urban centers, walled palaces, libraries, and rulers. The earliest Khmer writing appears in the 7th century in this region, or nearly four centuries after the Han Chinese reports of Funan. By the 7th century, Khmer elite inscribed their legitimacy onto brick shrines and temples they commissioned to honor Indic gods across the delta\u2019s landscape. Elite sponsorship of the construction and maintenance of ritual spaces required wealth; so did their support for ritual practices at these places, which materialized order that structured pre-Angkorian society. The rise of the pre-Angkorian Khmer state occurred during a period of fluctuating international trade in goods and ideas, and previous models have emphasized international trade as the catalyst for early state formation. This chapter studies early state formation instead through the development of the Mekong Delta\u2019s 6th-8th century monumental art and architecture. Brick constructions, their dedicatory inscriptions, and the statuary they housed created symbols of cultural commonality that linked formerly autonomous communities into coherent regional systems. The Lower Mekong Archaeological Project survey area includes the early urban center of Angkor Borei. Research described here emphasizes archaeological patterning in social power to offer Southeast Asian perspectives on the articulation between ideology and social order in early states.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86994198, "asset_id": 77125512, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25518, "name": "Ancient Civilization (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Civilization_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1028132, "name": "Pre Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pre_Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1532335, "name": "Early States and Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_States_and_Cities?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 13335906, "title": "Integrating the Phong Tuek Visnu: The Archaeology and Art History of a Forgotten Image", "created_at": "2015-06-26T19:49:57.001-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13335906/Integrating_the_Phong_Tuek_Visnu_The_Archaeology_and_Art_History_of_a_Forgotten_Image?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_13335906", "summary": "This paper situates the Phong Tuek Visnu, a lesser-known Dv\u0101ravat\u012b sculpture from western Thailand, in its archaeological and art historical context in order to demonstrate 7th to 8th century artistic and political connections across mainland Southeast Asia. The circumstances of the Visnu\u2019s rediscovery in the early 1950s, as well as its subsequent \u201crestoration\u201d and preservation at Wat Dong Sak, are examined through reappraisal of documentary evidence, new field reconnaissance, interviews of local residents, and systematic examination of the sculpture itself. Detailed stylistic analysis and conjectural reconstruction of the sculpture\u2019s original appearance place the image within the broader development of the mitred Visnu iconographic type known from sites throughout Southeast Asia. With particular emphasis on the details of the headdress and garment, specific comparisons are made to related sculpture from Thailand, Arakan (Myanmar), Preangkorian Cambodia, and the Cham civilization of Vietnam. The Phong Tuek Visnu\u2019s idiosyncratic features and geographically dispersed stylistic relationships suggest a probable early 8th century date following the mid-to-late 7th century expansion of Khmer elites out of the Kampong Thom area of Cambodia. The Phong Tuek Visnu, therefore, provides valuable testimony of a particularly intense period of interactions spanning mainland Southeast Asia from Arakan in the west to central Vietnam in the east.",

The historical sources inform us that the Chinese were clearly impressed by the quantities of gold present, and there is evidence to suggest that the gold deposits were one of the stimulating factors in the development of early contacts with India and China. Gold  first appears in the archaeological record in 400 BPE, at about the same time as iron, semiprecious stone polishing and glass working, suggesting that the techniques of gold extraction and working were quite plausibly introduced to Southeast Asia via Indian and/or Chinese merchants seeking gold ores.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47346980, "asset_id": 27094210, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51030162, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "birkbeck", "page_name": "AnnaBennett", "display_name": "Anna  Bennett", "profile_url": "https://birkbeck.academia.edu/AnnaBennett?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51030162/13537030/14713672/s65_anna.bennett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 265311, "name": "Ancient Goldsmith Techniques", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Goldsmith_Techniques?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1342775, "name": "Ancient Gold", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Gold?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 12759029, "title": "The Archaeology of Early Modern Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2015-06-02T13:42:50.709-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12759029/The_Archaeology_of_Early_Modern_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_12759029", "summary": "South East Asians in the early modern period (c.1450\u20131800) embraced technological innovations and novel ideas\r\nthat crossed their paths.

This paper will sketch a framework that coherently integrates the evidence from these burgeoning fields. This framework implies a reticulate framework in the phylogeny of early cultivated rice, with multiple starts of cultivation (two is perhaps not enough) but with the key consolidations of adaptations that must have been spread through hybridisation and therefore long-distance cultural contacts. Archaeobotanical evidence allows us to document the gradual evolutionary process of domestication through rice spikelet bases and grain size change. Separate trends in grain size change can be identified in India and China. The earliest centre of rice domestication was in the Yangtze basin of China, but a largely separate trajectory into rice cultivation can be traced in the Ganges plains of India. Intriguingly, contact-induced hybridisation is indicated for the early development of indica in northern India, ca. 2000 BC. An updated synthesis of the interwoven patterns of the spread of various rice varieties throughout Asia and to Madagascar can be suggested in which rice reached most of its historical range of important cultivation by the Iron Age.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53178863, "asset_id": 255774, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 53178879, "asset_id": 255774,

quarter century, Champa scholarship has been seeking ways out of the interpretative framework inherited from Georges Maspero\u2019s Le royaume de Champa, which portrayed Champa as a unitary kingdom of provinces ruled by \u201cabsolute\u201d kings. Scholars have since been working to revise this portrait, to develop new thinking about the way the kingdom and its territories were structured, and also to critique Maspero\u2019s decision to end his history of Champa with the 1471 capture of the Ch\u00e0 B\u00e0n citadel and fall of Vijaya.\r\n\r\nMuch new data has been produced in recent decades, thanks especially to the access to Champa field sites enjoyed since the 1990s by international scholars under Vietnam\u2019s open door policy, and to the resources for research and discussion now available to Vietnamese scholars. Several long-term joint projects have, moreover, brought Vietnamese and overseas expertise to bear on archaeological sites or collections of documents related to Champa.\r\n\r\nThe production of knowledge about Champa is thus thriving. The result is an incremental, multidisciplinary mosaic of information on Champa\u2019s past. Some of this scholarship was published in two recent volumes: Champa and the Archaeology of M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n (Hardy et al. 2009) and The Cham of Vietnam (Tr\u1ea7n K\u1ef3 Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng & Lockhart 2011). The present volume stands in the same tradition, as a book of new ground-breaking data that contributes to the renewal of Champa studies. \r\n\r\nAs these data are gradually sorted, new patterns that transform our understanding of Champa are becoming discernible. One of the most striking pertains to maps. This book offers a new framework for general discussion of Champa\u2019s space, and several new maps that amount to a template for cartographical representations of the kingdom and its territories at specifi c historical moments. Another contribution of this volume is the publication of new data that yield ground-breaking insights into the nature of Champa\u2019s presence in the highlands.\r\n\r\nPart I of the book focuses on the territories that constituted Champa, making use of data from recent excavations, archaeological and ethnographic surveys, inscriptions, and Cham-language manuscripts from the post-1471 period. \r\n\r\nIn Part II, we turn to Champa as a kingdom, using data from epigraphy and Vietnamese chronicles, but also from architectural-archaeological study of a royal temple foundation at M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n. Three authors present new data and analysis of the Champa kingdom in the 15th century, grappling with the issue of the kingdom\u2019s tendency toward fragmentation and eventual decline.\r\n\r\nPart III focusses on the regional connectedness of Champa. These include diplomatic and cultural exchanges with China and India, artistic and trading relations with mainland Southeast Asian countries, and language links with the Malay World.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60589085, "asset_id": 40343525, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2370524, "first_name": "Arlo", "last_name": "Griffiths", "domain_name": "efeo", "page_name": "ArloGriffiths", "display_name": "Arlo Griffiths", "profile_url": "https://efeo.academia.edu/ArloGriffiths?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2370524/2645766/3078588/s65_arlo.griffiths.jpg"}, {"id": 15562057, "first_name": "Geoff", "last_name": "Wade", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GeoffWade", "display_name": "Geoff Wade", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GeoffWade?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15562057/90418557/79157751/s65_geoff.wade.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7396, "name": "Vietnamese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17401, "name": "Southeast Asian Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Linguistics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 86664, "name": "Austronesian linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 158455, "name": "Vietnamese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 429888, "name": "Champa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Champa?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 500453, "name": "Cham Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cham_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1205503, "name": "Vietnamese Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 14143879, "title": "Re-exploring the Buddhist \u201cFoundation Deposits\u201d at Chedi Chula Prathon, Nakhon Pathom", "created_at": "2015-07-17T03:03:39.077-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14143879/Re_exploring_the_Buddhist_Foundation_Deposits_at_Chedi_Chula_Prathon_Nakhon_Pathom?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_14143879", "summary": "This contribution comprises a detailed consideration of \u201critual deposits\u201d dating to the eighth-ninth centuries CE excavated at the site of Chedi Chula Prathon in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. Focusing in particular on the intriguing presence of a khakkhara (\u201crattle-staff\u201d), the only material example of which that has been found in mainland Southeast Asia, I argue that these deposits functioned in rituals associated with the consecration or reconsecration of the site. Through a broad survey of textual and iconographic sources from across the Buddhist world, as well as especially suggestive proximate Burmese and Javanese parallels, I show how the presence of the khakkhara connects Chedi Chula Prathon to a regional Buddhist ritual geography during the late first millennium CE. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38214796, "asset_id": 14143879, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 684828, "first_name": "Nicolas", "last_name": "Revire", "domain_name": "artic", "page_name": "NicolasRevire", "display_name": "Nicolas Revire", "profile_url": "https://artic.academia.edu/NicolasRevire?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/684828/2836318/83102129/s65_nicolas.revire.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25416, "name": "Archaeology of Ritual and Magic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Ritual_and_Magic?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43802, "name": "Buddhist art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2232983, "title": "Issues and Problems of Previous Studies in The Bujang Valley and The Discovery of Sungai Batu", "created_at": "2012-12-02T18:38:02.692-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2232983/Issues_and_Problems_of_Previous_Studies_in_The_Bujang_Valley_and_The_Discovery_of_Sungai_Batu?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2232983", "summary": "The discovery of the Sungai Batu complex by the Centre for Global Archaeological Research, Universiti Sains Malaysia in 2007 is of great significant in understanding the early civilisations in Malaysia. The complex was found during a scientific palaeoenvironmental reconstruction sutdy. A total pf 97 mounds were mapped and identified in 3km2 area that has great archaeological potential. To date, excavations at 16 mounds revealed ritual monuments, a riverside jetty built in the 2nd century CE, and iron smelting sites that were used from the 1st century CE. The discovery of the iron smelting industry in this complex showed that the Sungai Batu civilisation had an economic base. These new findings give a more holistoc and complete picture of the Bujang Valley civilisation and should lead to a significant re-evaluation of the evidence that has been accumulated since the 1840s. Based on the early research results, the Bujang Valley civilisation was thought to date as early as the end of the 4th century CE and to be primarily a Hindu-Buddhist site (Coedes, 1968). These new finds with chronometric dating (radiocarbon and OSL) allow us to re-write not onl the history of Malaysian civilisation but also that of the region. To date, the important discovery of a 110 CE monument meant Sungai Batu provides the earliest evidence of a monument (with chronometric dates) in Southeast Asia.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments":

The Buddha is seated in bhadr\u0101sana, the posture with two legs pendant, and with the hands in dharmacakramudr\u0101, an iconographic type frequently found in South and maritime Southeast Asia during the second half of the first millennium. This bronze is most remarkable for the Sanskrit inscription written on its back in a northeastern Indian script. The inscription cites the common ye dharm\u0101\u1e25 formula in unique combination with the heart mantra jinajik. Our study deals first with the art style and iconography of the bronze image. We then discuss the inscription and its paleographic features, and review the textual sources in which this special mantra occurs. Overall, we are concerned with the questions of provenance, dating, and the controversial issue of the identification of the Buddha who is represented. We cautiously propose to see the inscribed bronze sculpture as embedding a universal and imperial form of Buddhahood, highlighting its significance for our understanding of early tantric Buddhist iconography and concepts in ancient Indonesia and beyond.

A later \u201csecond layer\u201d shared strong cranial affinities with Siberians, implying a Northeast Asian source, evidenced by 9 kya in central China and then followed by expansions of descendant groups into Southeast Asia after 4 kya. These two populations shared limited initial exchange, and the second layer grew at a faster rate and in greater numbers, linked with contexts of farming that may have supported increased population densities. Clear dichotomization between the two layers implies a temporally deep divergence of distinct migration routes for AMH through both southern and northern Eurasia.

Because of this, they have become important artifacts for scholars wishing to better understand trade networks and sociopolitical development during this period. Using compositional analysis scholars can identify the recipes used to make these glass beads and in some cases this can be tied back to specific places or time periods. Current research indicates there were multiple glass bead production centers across South and Southeast Asia during this period. However there has not yet been a comprehensive examination of glass beads from Iron Age sites in Cambodia. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting the results from a compositional analysis of glass beads from six Iron Age sites in Cambodia. Using a virtually non-destructive compositional technique (LA-ICP-MS), I was able to determine the presence of at least two glass bead-trading networks in Cambodia during the Iron Age.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 24790066, "asset_id": 1801206, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17869, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "AlisonCarter", "display_name": "Alison K Carter", "profile_url": "https://uoregon.academia.edu/AlisonCarter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17869/5981/19917901/s65_alison.carter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41438, "name": "Ancient Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50307, "name": "Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beads?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50744, "name": "LA-ICP-MS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LA-ICP-MS?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1259545, "title": "Biface distributions and the Movius Line: A Southeast Asian perspective", "created_at": "2012-06-26T09:21:35.070-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1259545/Biface_distributions_and_the_Movius_Line_A_Southeast_Asian_perspective?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_1259545", "summary": "The \u2018Movius Line\u2019 is the putative technological demarcation\nline mapping the easternmost geographical distribution\nof Acheulean bifacial tools.

A review of the literature shows that\nbifaces are relatively common as surface finds in Southeast\nAsia and on this basis we argue that the Movius Line is in\nneed of reassessment.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 20902231, "asset_id": 1259545, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140099, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Moore", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "MarkMoore", "display_name": "Mark W Moore", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/MarkMoore?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140099/92422/2811606/s65_mark.moore.jpg"}, {"id": 305140, "first_name": "Adam", "last_name": "Brumm", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "AdamBrumm", "display_name": "Adam Brumm", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/AdamBrumm?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/305140/61490/860851/s65_adam.brumm.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4548, "name": "Palaeolithic Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palaeolithic_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11037, "name": "Behaviour (Human Evolution)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Behaviour_Human_Evolution_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19728, "name": "Lithic Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithic_Technology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 32259, "name": "Stone artefacts (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_artefacts_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 38032, "name": "Lithic Technology (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithic_Technology_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 50809, "name": "Archaeology, Lithic analysis and organization of technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_Lithic_analysis_and_organization_of_technology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 70979, "name": "Acheulean (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acheulean_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 81953, "name": "Neanderthals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neanderthals?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 91632, "name": "Stone tools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_tools?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 99317, "name": "Lithic Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithic_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 154342, "name": "Indian Palaeolithic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Palaeolithic?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 232440, "name": "Australian prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 584738, "name": "Modern human dispersal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_human_dispersal?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 981655, "name": "3D Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/3D_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 43420113, "title": "Buddhist Monuments Across the Bay of Bengal: Cultural Routes and Maritime Networks", "created_at": "2020-06-23T17:34:51.281-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43420113/Buddhist_Monuments_Across_the_Bay_of_Bengal_Cultural_Routes_and_Maritime_Networks?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_43420113", "summary": "Religious architecture, often called 'monuments' within the current understanding of ancient shrines, are prominent features of the landscape in South and Southeast Asia. Many of these sites are admired for their artistic and aesthetic appeal and are centres of tourism and travel. This paper traces the historical trajectory of three contemporary monuments of Buddhist affiliation across the Bay of Bengal, namely Nalanda in north India, Borobudur in Central Java, and Nakhon Pathom in Central Thailand to address both their distinctiveness and their interconnectedness. The paper also focuses on the extent to which these shrines reflect the religious theories that prevailed between the sixth and the thirteenth centuries AD and are currently known to us through religious texts. It is not often appreciated that 'collections' of religious texts, as well as the 'discovery' of monuments were mediated through the priorities and practices of European and Western scholars from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The history of the study of Buddhism shows that it centred on religious texts and philosophical doctrines produced by a small group of monastic elites, with little attention paid to the more difficult questions of the contexts underlying textual production and circulation. This paper suggests that it is important to factor in the colonization of South and Southeast Asia into any discussion on the understanding of religions and monuments, as well as current interest in these monuments , which are also World Heritage Sites and associated with present interests in maritime heritage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63721966, "asset_id": 43420113, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37001599, "title": "2018 The prehistoric peopling of Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2018-07-07T21:43:32.837-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37001599/2018_The_prehistoric_peopling_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37001599", "summary": "The human occupation history of Southeast Asia (SEA) remains heavily debated. Current evidence suggests that SEA was occupied by H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian hunter-gatherers until ~4000 years ago, when farming economies developed and expanded, restricting foraging groups to remote habitats. Some argue that agricultural development was indigenous; others favor the \" two-layer \" hypothesis that posits a southward expansion of farmers giving rise to present-day Southeast Asian genetic diversity. By sequencing 26 ancient human genomes (25 from SEA, 1 Japanese J\u014dmon), we show that neither interpretation fits the complexity of Southeast Asian history: Both H\u00f2ab\u00ecnhian hunter-gatherers and East Asian farmers contributed to current Southeast Asian diversity, with further migrations affecting island SEA and Vietnam.

Especially important for human migration models, this decorated pottery is linked to a system of cultural origin, so the spread as a diagnostic tradition can be related to the spread of a cultural group. Even more important, this decorated pottery appeared with the \ufb01rst peopling of the remote Paci\ufb01c Islands, thus providing a clear and datable chronicle of where and when people spread from one location to another. The pottery trail points to a homeland in the Philippine Neolithic about 2000\u20131800 BC, followed by expansion into the remote Mariana Islands 1500 BC, and then slightly later into the Lapita world of Melanesia and Polynesia.

The next closest forms, phonologically, are to be found in near Oceania and western Polynesia such as Lakona mwat, in locations coinciding with the Lapita cultural complex. The two groups of cognates, Mainland Southeast Asia and Oceania, are closer to each other than either is to the languages of the northern Philippines, the Batanes or Taiwan from whence the Lapita culture is said to have originated. Hence a puzzle exists which this paper examines, taking into consideration evide nce from historical linguistics, archaeology, the anthropology of hunter-gatherers, and human genetics. One conclusion is that Austro-Tai or Pre-Austro-Tai groups on the East and Southeast Asian mainland ranged much further inland and southward than has been previously recognized and may have been primarily non-Negrito hunter-gatherers, predating the so-called Neolithic farmers who later, it is believed, populated Mainland and Insular Southeast Asia and Oceania.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65509787, "asset_id": 42011133, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6739046, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Chamberlain", "domain_name": "nuol", "page_name": "JamesChamberlain", "display_name": "James R Chamberlain", "profile_url": "https://nuol.academia.edu/JamesChamberlain?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6739046/9363532/10435835/s65_james_r..chamberlain.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5571, "name": "Oceanic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oceanic_languages?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17975, "name": "Cognitive Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41578, "name": "Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunter-Gatherer_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86664, "name": "Austronesian linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 238443, "name": "Austronesian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 785138, "name": "Lapita studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lapita_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1510617, "name": "Austroasiatic linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2480281, "name": "Hlai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hlai?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3558623, "name": "Kra-Dai Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kra-Dai_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3559429, "name": "Austroasiatic Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3559430, "name": "Ethnozoology of East Asia and the Pacific", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnozoology_of_East_Asia_and_the_Pacific?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3559431, "name": "Biological Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_Linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3559433, "name": "Austro-Tai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austro-Tai?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3559557, "name": "Jiamao", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jiamao?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3559558, "name": "Kri-Mol (Vietic)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kri-Mol_Vietic_?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 33657183, "title": "Khao Sam Kaeo.

The\r\nleaders encountered a Southeast Asian kingdom, with an established\r\ngovernment, laws, cities and fl ourishing trade with India and Rome.\r\nThe expedition report survives in the Chinese dynastic archives, and\r\nposes a fascinating challenge to archaeologists: what was the nature\r\nof this maritime Silk Road, when did it begin, what manner of people\r\nran it, and how did it affect their lives?\r\nAnswers to these key questions are now emerging from fi ve years\r\nof excavations and a decade of intense analyses that centre on the Kra\r\nIsthmus, the narrow neck of land that provides the easiest passage\r\nbetween the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. Here, the trade\r\nroute is dominated by the urban centre of Khao Sam Kaeo, a sprawling\r\nsettlement atop four hills, next to the Tha Tapao River.\r\nFor the fi rst time in Southeast Asia, a multidisciplinary project\r\ninvolving geoarchaeology, botany and metallurgy, combined\r\nwith geographical information systems, has been deployed\r\nto unravel the timing of the emergence of the maritime\r\nSilk Road and its social impact. We have found that its\r\norigins are far earlier than suspected, stretching back\r\ninto the 4th century BC. Over the centuries, Khao Sam\r\nKaeo became a cosmopolitan hub that drew merchants\r\nand artisans from India and other Asian horizons. Gold\r\nand silver, carnelian and glass jewellery came from\r\nnew workshops. In the fi elds beyond the city walls,\r\nnew crops of Indian origin were grown alongside the\r\ntraditional rice fi elds. Chinese ceramics, Vietnamese\r\nbronzes, even Roman tradewares made their way to\r\nthe markets of Southeast Asia.\r\nThe vital importance of Khao Sam Kaeo in\r\ndocumenting and illuminating the early maritime\r\ntrade is seen in the later rise of states like Pasai,\r\nBanten, Melaka and Ayutthaya.

The rise of these kingdoms was stimulated and economically supported by trade in prestige goods with other parts of island Southeast Asia, yet the development of these kingdoms was determined by indigenous, rather than imported, political and cultural precepts. Starting in the thirteenth century, the region experienced a transition from swidden cultivation to wet-rice agriculture; rice was the major product that the lowland kingdoms of South Sulawesi exchanged with archipelagic traders.\r\n\r\nStephen Druce demonstrates this progression to political complexity by combining a range of sources and methods, including oral, textual, archaeological, linguistic and geographical information and analysis as he explores the rise and development of five South Sulawesi kingdoms, known collectively as Ajattappareng (the Lands West of the Lakes).\r\n\r\nThe author also presents an inquiry into oral traditions of a historical nature in South Sulawesi. He examines their functions, their processes of transmission and transformation, their uses in writing history and their relationship to written texts. He shows that any distinction between oral and written traditions of a historical nature is largely irrelevant, and that the South Sulawesi chronicles, which can be found only for a small number of kingdoms, are not characteristic (as historians have argued) but exceptional in the corpus of indigenous South Sulawesi historical sources.\r\n\r\nThe book will be of primary interest to scholars of pre-European-contact Southeast Asia, including historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists and geographers, and scholars with a broader interest in oral tradition and the relationship between the oral and written registers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7009337, "asset_id": 993829, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780,

Transcending the artificial boundaries of macro-regions and nation-states, and trying to bridge the arbitrary divide between (inherently cosmopolitan) high cultures (e.g. Sanskritic, Sinitic, or Islamicate) and local or indigenous cultures, this multidisciplinary volume explores the metaphor of Monsoon Asia as a vast geo-environmental area inhabited by speakers of numerous language phyla, which for millennia has formed an integrated system of littorals where crops, goods, ideas, cosmologies, and ritual practices circulated on the sea-routes governed by the seasonal monsoon winds. The collective body of work presented in the volume describes Monsoon Asia as an ideal theatre for circulatory dynamics of cultural transfer, interaction, acceptance, selection, and avoidance, and argues that, despite the rich ethnic, linguistic and sociocultural diversity, a shared pattern of values, norms, and cultural models is discernible throughout the region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52217415, "asset_id": 31939267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 806528, "first_name": "Andrea", "last_name": "Acri", "domain_name": "ephe", "page_name": "AndreaAcri", "display_name": "Andrea Acri", "profile_url": "https://ephe.academia.edu/AndreaAcri?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/806528/277218/13279924/s65_andrea.acri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 378, "name": "Area Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Area_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5602, "name": "Austronesian Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Languages?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6713, "name": "Tantric Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tantric_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 48814, "name": "Indian Ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53106, "name": "South Asian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 86664, "name": "Austronesian linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 238443, "name": "Austronesian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 243982, "name": "Javanese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Javanese_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 244992, "name": "Southeast Asian prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 974836, "name": "Ancient Indian Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Indian_Religion?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 17470104, "title": "Etyma for \u2018Chicken\u2019, \u2018Duck\u2019, and \u2018Goose\u2019 among Language Phyla in China and Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2015-10-29T07:51:52.711-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17470104/Etyma_for_Chicken_Duck_and_Goose_among_Language_Phyla_in_China_and_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_17470104", "summary": "This paper considers the history of words for domesticated poultry, including \u2018chicken\u2019, \u2018goose\u2019, and \u2018duck\u2019, in China and mainland Southeast Asia to try to relate associated domestication events with specific language groups.

In addition to speakers of Austronesian-derived Malayic languages in the Peninsula, Sumatra and coastal Borneo, there are some fifteen ethnolinguistic groups who speak Mon-Khmer languages. Historically, these indigenous populations have followed a variety of appropriative modes, including nomadic foraging (forest, strand and maritime), farming (swidden, swamp and irrigated), lake and maritime fishing, the collecting of forest and maritime products for trade, and long-distance inter-regional trading. Their socio-political circumstances have ranged from tribal, through peasants and hereditary state-linked elites linked to long-distance trade, to citizens of modern nation-states. The influence of the various centres of civilization that were present in the region in pre-modern times was also of key importance: coastal trading states, colonial-response states, inland sacred-city (or \u2018middle kingdom\u2019) states and cultural suppletion (or mainland migration) states. While some of these were nested into mandala-like or \u2018galactic\u2019 polities, the others had quite different consequences. Egalitarianism and ranking in the region both derive in large measure from the emergence of certain structural features \u2013 concerning relative-age, unifiliative bias, preferential marriage patterns, and so on \u2013 all serving to maintain mutually distinctive societal regimes within the broader regional framework. Earlier theories explained this array as resulting from distinct migratory \u2018waves\u2019, but current evidence (from archaeology, linguistics, kinship and social organization, religion, genetics, and other disciplines) suggests that it emerged mostly indigenously through a series of deliberate mutual adjustments, both assimilatory and dissimilatory, between populations that were each seeking mutual advantages vis-\u00e0-vis each other. The paper reviews previous work on the topic, and discusses the mechanisms by which the distinctive Melayu form of social organization emerged out of a more generally Malayic one.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68151028, "asset_id": 1651003, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403289, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Benjamin", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "GeoffreyBenjamin", "display_name": "Geoffrey Benjamin", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/GeoffreyBenjamin?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403289/357126/13699011/s65_geoffrey.benjamin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15406, "name": "Social Organisation (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Organisation_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15875, "name": "Anthropology of Kinship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Kinship?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 58285, "name": "Social organization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_organization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 64117, "name": "Orang Asli", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orang_Asli?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 158452, "name": "Malay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 221325, "name": "Sumatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumatra?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 419213, "name": "Etnik Orang Asli Di Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etnik_Orang_Asli_Di_Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 41501237, "title": "The impact of Ming and Qing dynasty maritime bans on trade ceramics recovered from coastal settlements in northern Sumatra, Indonesia", "created_at": "2020-01-03T08:13:32.713-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41501237/The_impact_of_Ming_and_Qing_dynasty_maritime_bans_on_trade_ceramics_recovered_from_coastal_settlements_in_northern_Sumatra_Indonesia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_41501237", "summary": "We review published literature and historical texts to propose that three periods of official Chinese maritime bans impacted the composition and circulation of trade ceramics along Asian trade routes: Ming Ban 1 (1371-1509), Ming Ban 2 (1521-1529), and Qing Ban (1654-1684). We use ceramics collected during a landscape archaeology survey along 40km of coast in Aceh, Indonesia to show how the three ban periods manifest in the ceramic record of settlements along an important stretch of the maritime silkroad. All three ban periods overlap with reductions in the quantity of Chinese ceramics. Within several decades of the start of Ming Ban 1, people in Aceh began importing ceramics from production centers in Burma and Thailand as a substitute for Chinese ceramics. Following Ming Ban 2, there is an increase in imports from Chinese production centers, albeit from new kilns sites. While brief, the Qing ban resulted in an almost immediate influx of ceramics from Japan and Vietnam, which maintained some market share until the mid-17th century, after which Chinese ceramics dominate the record until the end of the Qing dynasty.

While it seems clear that the remote ancestors of Aus-tronesian speakers originated in Southern China, and migrated to Taiwan with the development of rice farming by c. 5500 BP and onto the northern Philippines by c. 4000 BP (the Austronesian Dispersal Hypothesis or ADH), we know very little about the origins and emergence of Austronesian speakers in the Indonesian Archipelago. Using a combination of cra-nial morphometric and ancient mtDNA analyses on a new dataset from Gua Hairmau, that spans the pre-Neolithic through to Metal Period (5712\u20145591cal BP to 1864\u20141719 cal BP), we rigorously test the validity of the ADH in ISEA. A morphometric analysis of 23 adult male crania, using 16 of Martin's standard measurements, was carried out with results compared to an East and Southeast Asian dataset of 30 sample populations spanning the Late Pleisto-cene through to Metal Period, in addition to 39 modern samples from East and Southeast Asia, near Oceania and Australia. Further, 20 samples were analyzed for ancient mtDNA and assigned to identified haplogroups. We demonstrate that the archaeological human remains from Gua Harimau cave, Sumatra, Indonesia provide clear evidence for at least two (cranio-morphometrically defined) and perhaps even three (in the context of the ancient mtDNA results) distinct populations from two separate time periods.

Cultural Transfer in Early Historical Maritime Asia \nA number of recent articles have rekindled the debate on agency in the production of Southeast Asia's Indic religious monuments by suggesting, on the basis of specific readings of architecture, that an initial period of Indian involvement must have occurred.  Roy E. Jordaan (2006) argues for a  dichotomous periodization: that a \"foreign, Indian\" Central Javanese Mahayana Buddhist period preceded a  more indigenous East Javanese period. To bolster this claim that Indian agency and tutelage was necessary in eighth-century south Central Java,  Jordaan quotes the opinions of Willem F. Stutterheim (1925) and Horace G. Quaritch Wales (1961) that Central and East Javanese art represents, respectively, \"Hindu art in Java\" and \"Hindu-Javanese art\". \nMichel Jacq-Hergoualc'h (2002, p.  229) has meanwhile opined that the temples of Kedah were the work of \"foreign merchants\" who were allowed to build there-a surmise based on an overview of extant masonry remains. Like Jordaan, Jacq-Hergoualc'h's claim rests on a reading of masomy remains that has excluded their larger physical setting and the epigraphic evidence connected with their construction or sociocultural milieu. \nThis chapter re-evaluates the architectural and art historical evidence from early extant monuments in Central Java, Sumatra and Kedah and their architectural innovation and literary references with a focus on highlighting two aspects. First, architectural or iconographic innovations in the early lndic monuments whose significance can be connected to original syntheses expressed in epigraphic or literary sources have been overlooked in the above claims. Second, the syntheses between Indic and Austronesian form typology occurred not only in masonry structures but in aspects of built form that extend well beyond these and involved not just architectural form but conceptual and literary integration and innovation. In some cases, the sources make it clear that literate Westem Malayo-Polynesian (WMP) cultures were consciously refashioning Indic ideas, sometimes through their synthesis with autochthonous conceptions; where concepts of Indian origin were expressed in architectural or iconographic schema these translations into form often bad no precedence in India and even occurred earlier than the \u015b\u0101stric canonization of the Indic ideas concerned. In this re-evaluation, F.D.K. Bosch's \u015b\u0101stric thesis-that Indic classical features on Javanese candi and religious art were the outcome of the periodic renewal of \u015b\u0101stric references by the Javanese-and Hermann Kulke's (1990, 2014) concept of \"cultural convergence\"-which emphasizes the contemporaneity of developments in South India and Southeast Asia, and their \"social nearness\" in terms of similarities or parallels in their social and political developments and needs-are extended to take into account Java's position within not only the Indic religious-literary world, but also, simultaneously, in an Austronesian architectural typological continuum.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55598818, "asset_id": 35724163, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Yet, the settlement of Polynesia has received far more attention than the settlement of the Marianas. There is uncertainty over both the origin of the first colonizers of the Marianas (with different lines of evidence suggesting variously the Philippines, Indonesia, New\nGuinea, or the Bismarck Archipelago) as well as what, if any, relationship they might have had with the first colonizers of Polynesia. To address these questions, we obtained ancient DNA data from two skeletons from the Ritidian Beach Cave Site in northern Guam, dating to \u223c2,200 y ago. Analyses of complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequences and genome-wide SNP data strongly support ancestry from the Philippines, in agreement with some interpretations of the linguistic and archaeological evidence, but in contradiction to results based on computer simulations of sea voyaging.

This article presents the results of excavations and materials analysis from a centre of sandstone production for the classic period Angkorian city of Harihar\u0101laya and appraises the procurement of raw materials, manufacturing methods, and sites of production for the makers of temples and sculptures. A production site associated with the temple of Bakong was identified by surface remains of sandstone debitage and unfinished sculptures. Excavation revealed a 9th-century building associated with large-scale sandstone waste deposits and another phase of sculpture production in the 12th and 13th centuries. A study of sandstone characterisation was applied to in situ production waste, unfinished sculptures from the workshop, and on completed works. Comparison of samples from the workshop and associated temples with sculptures from Cambodian and international collections suggest the site was likely used as a dump for construction of nearby temples and later to produce images of the gods destined for veneration. Moreover, the workshop was part of a network of craft specialists who sourced many thousands of tons of specific sandstone across the Angkorian landscape.\n\nPolkinghorne, M., Douglas, J..and Car\u00f2, F., 2015. \u201cCarving at the Capital: A stone workshop at Harihar\u0101laya, Angkor\", in Bulletin l\u2019\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Extr\u00eame-Orient (BEFEO), vol. 101: 55 - 90.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55013143, "asset_id": 28519501, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2604512, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Polkinghorne", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MartinPolkinghorne", "display_name": "Martin Polkinghorne", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/MartinPolkinghorne?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2604512/821657/17093036/s65_martin.polkinghorne.jpg"}, {"id": 6301216, "first_name": "Federico", "last_name": "Car\u00f2", "domain_name": "metmuseum", "page_name": "federicocaro", "display_name": "Federico  Car\u00f2", "profile_url": "https://metmuseum.academia.edu/federicocaro?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6301216/6986720/13008740/s65_federico.caro.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 20173624, "title": "Inscribing Legitimacy and Building Power in the Mekong Delta", "created_at": "2016-01-11T12:27:58.420-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20173624/Inscribing_Legitimacy_and_Building_Power_in_the_Mekong_Delta?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_20173624", "summary": "At its apex, the Khmer empire was Southeast Asia\u2019s largest and most influential civilization: its civilizational reach stretched across several of today\u2019s nation-states, and its core contained one of the world\u2019s largest pre-industrial urban complexes. The roots of 9th-14th century Angkorian civilization appeared in the Mekong delta more than a millennium before Jayavarman II declared himself the universal Khmer monarch in 802 CE.  At the start and to the south was the early polity that 3rd century Chinese emissaries called Funan, and that contained urban centers, walled palaces, libraries, and rulers.  The earliest Khmer writing appears in the 7th century in this region, or nearly four centuries after the Han Chinese reports of Funan. By the 7th century, Khmer elite inscribed their legitimacy onto brick shrines and temples they commissioned to honor Indic gods across the delta\u2019s landscape.  Elite sponsorship of the construction and maintenance of ritual spaces required wealth; so did their support for ritual practices at these places, which materialized order that structured pre-Angkorian society.  The rise of the pre-Angkorian Khmer state occurred during a period of fluctuating international trade in goods and ideas, and previous models have emphasized international trade as the catalyst for early state formation.\n\nThis chapter studies early state formation instead through the development of the Mekong Delta\u2019s 6th-8th century monumental art and architecture. Brick constructions, their dedicatory inscriptions, and the statuary they housed created symbols of cultural commonality that linked formerly autonomous communities into coherent regional systems.  The Lower Mekong Archaeological Project survey area includes the early urban center of Angkor Borei. Research described here emphasizes archaeological patterning in social power to offer Southeast Asian perspectives on the articulation between ideology and social order in early states.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41356193, "asset_id": 20173624, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25518, "name": "Ancient Civilization (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Civilization_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1028132, "name": "Pre Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pre_Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1532335, "name": "Early States and Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_States_and_Cities?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1807538, "name": "Preangkorian Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Preangkorian_Period?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 5125777, "title": "Griffiths, Revire & Sanyal 2013 Buddha in bhadr\u0101sana at Museum Ranggawarsita", "created_at": "2013-11-16T22:48:26.594-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5125777/Griffiths_Revire_and_Sanyal_2013_Buddha_in_bhadr%C4%81sana_at_Museum_Ranggawarsita?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_5125777", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32331562, "asset_id": 5125777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2370524, "first_name": "Arlo", "last_name": "Griffiths", "domain_name": "efeo", "page_name": "ArloGriffiths", "display_name": "Arlo Griffiths", "profile_url": "https://efeo.academia.edu/ArloGriffiths?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2370524/2645766/3078588/s65_arlo.griffiths.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43802, "name": "Buddhist art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 27093968, "title": "The High-Tin Bronzes of Thailand", "created_at": "2016-07-19T03:39:04.476-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27093968/The_High_Tin_Bronzes_of_Thailand?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_27093968", "summary": "The local people used brass that is cast, not the kind that is forged with the strange result that when they fall to the ground they break to pieces like pottery. 1 abstract The term high tin, in the case of the objects we discuss and illustrate, is conventionally used for a binary copper alloy containing between about 20 and 28 wt.% tin. High-tin bronzes are rather few in number but found over an extensive region across West, South, Southeast and East Asia. The metal is brittle when cast, impossible to shape when cold, and can only be worked when hot. When freshly cast it has a yellowish color resembling gold, which is one reason that has been suggested for why this difficult alloy was used for special, perhaps ritual and ornamental, purposes. In this paper, we discuss excavations at Ban Don Ta Phet in Thailand, focusing on the high-tin bronze vessels found during these excavations. We also mention bronze vessels found elsewhere in Thailand and in Southeast and South Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47346840, "asset_id": 27093968, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51030162, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "birkbeck", "page_name": "AnnaBennett", "display_name": "Anna  Bennett", "profile_url": "https://birkbeck.academia.edu/AnnaBennett?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51030162/13537030/14713672/s65_anna.bennett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 480695, "name": "High Tin Bronze Production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/High_Tin_Bronze_Production?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33692692, "title": "Bioarchaeology in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Newsletter, 2017, Issue 13", "created_at": "2017-06-28T20:06:31.358-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33692692/Bioarchaeology_in_Southeast_Asia_and_the_Pacific_Newsletter_2017_Issue_13?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_33692692", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53695194, "asset_id": 33692692, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}, {"id": 1380301, "first_name": "Stacey", "last_name": "Ward", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "StaceyWard", "display_name": "Stacey M .

In an attempt to so, it is consequently multidisciplinary in its conception, being primarily archaeological while also drawing on areas of anthropology, art history, demographics and Buddhist studies. In doing so, it attempts to move beyond the sole analysis of archaeological\r\nand art historic objects in order to investigate the social, demographic and geographical factors that lie behind the production of these artefacts. It proposes to do so by a number of quantitative means: first, by giving hypothetical population estimates of urban centres/moated sites during the Dvaravati period and consequently the number of monks these settlements could have supported. These estimates are then used to consider how many monks may have been sustained according to these figures. Second, by carrying out a quantitative analysis of sema stone numbers and their distribution throughout the Khorat Plateau this also provides a method to calculate the number of possible consecrated spaces (viz., s\u012bma) in the region and their geographic extent. The analysis shows that institutional, monastic Buddhism primarily spread and settled along the major river systems throughout the region. Third, by plotting the distribution, quantity\r\nand quality of Buddhist narrative artwork on sema to pinpoint the locations of possible workshops and centres. This also allows for a number of conclusions to be drawn in terms of the socio-economic support needed to develop and maintain workshops and craftsmen and relates directly to population densities. It should, however, be stated at the outset that this paper proposes nothing more than a possible scenario to aid in explaining and understanding the extent and spread of Buddhism during this period.  Therefore, I adopt the term \u201cscenario\u201d over \u201cmodel\u201d to emphasize the fact that what is being proposed here is an interpretive framework as opposed to a testable hypothesis in the strictly scientific sense.

Some of you may have even been through Singapore your way to somewhere else. For those who come to the city as tourists, they are likely to check out the famous Raffles Hotel. Here at one of Asia\u2019s finest addresses you will learn that the hotel has been named after Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, an agent of the East India Company in London, who founded the British trading post and settlement in 1819. Before Raffles arrived, it is said, there was nothing much on the island except a handful of fishermen and pirates. Singapore was a place forgotten by time.\r\nMy paper seriously challenges this view. If you attend my lecture, I want you to walk away knowing that Singapore has a longer and deeper history that predates 1819. Raffles did not discover either the location Singapore or its potential as a trading emporium: that had been recognized long before. As a second takeaway I want viewers to appreciate that Singapore was everything but a forgotten place before 1819 and that it fulfilled different functions at different times.

Here we use excavation and chronometric data from three field seasons at Ang-kor Wat to understand the decline and reorganization of the Ang-korian Empire, which was a more protracted and complex process than historians imagined. Excavation data and Bayesian modeling on a corpus of 16 radiocarbon dates in particular demand a revised chronology for the Angkor Wat landscape. It was initially in use from the 11th century CE with subsequent habitation until the 13th century CE. Following this period, there is a gap in our dates, which we hypothesize signifies a change in the use of the occupation mounds during this period. However, Angkor Wat was never completely abandoned, as the dates suggest that the mounds were in use again in the late 14th-early 15th centuries until the 17th or 18th centuries CE. This break in dates points toward a reorganization of Angkor Wat's enclosure space, but not during the historically recorded 15th century collapse. Our excavation data are consistent with multiple lines of evidence demonstrating the region's continued ideological importance and residential use, even after the collapse and shift southward of the polity's capital. We argue that fine-grained chronological analysis is critical to building local historical sequences and illustrate how such granularity adds nuance to how we interpret the tempo of organizational change before, during, and after the decline of Angkor. archaeology | collapse | Angkor | Cambodia | Angkor Wat", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59501425, "asset_id": 39359394, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 393, "name": "Classical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37303846, "title": "2017 Nephrite and Mica Industries: A Link towards the Austronesian World", "created_at": "2018-08-28T04:44:58.216-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37303846/2017_Nephrite_and_Mica_Industries_A_Link_towards_the_Austronesian_World?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37303846", "summary": "Regarding the jade and jade-like artefacts unearthed from Khao Sam Kaeo, new research has explored the use of different raw materials and relations with inter-regional trade networks. Geochemical analysis offers a way to identify the geological sources of the stone materials, potentially involving long-distance movements. In conjunction with those findings, studies of workshop debris provide information about how the artefacts were produced and how the evident crafting styles may have been linked across the regions of Mainland and Island Southeast Asia. \r\n\r\nLocal craft production is evident in workshop debris at the site. The unearthed artefacts include complete objects and related worked fragments such as drilled-out cores, cut square blanks, and small cut fragments. Most of these materials were used for manufacturing ornaments such as the lingling-o penannular earrings, the double animal-headed ear pendants, bracelets, and pendants. In order to learn the geological sources of the green stones used to make these ornaments at Khao Sam Kaeo, 28 artefacts were examined through a series of non-invasive analyses by a low-vacuum scanning electron microscope (LVSEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectrometer. The results show those objects and worked fragments can be grouped into three major categories of nephrite jade (17 samples), green mica (8 samples), and quartzite (2 samples). The geological sources included nephrite from Taiwan, mica from the Philippines, and quartzite from an unknown source. Among 17 specimens of nephrite, 12 of them are comparable to the Fengtian nephrite source in Eastern Taiwan. However, another 5 nephrite specimens were too weathered to analyze for making a final conclusion of their geological source. In addition to the nephrite from Taiwan, some of the artefacts were made of mica similar in chemistry to that from Mindoro Island in the Philippines. Khao Sam Keo became the first prehistoric jewellery workshop in Southeast Asia with a significant amount of mica-ornament production. Moreover, quartzite was used to produce a bracelet here. \r\n\r\nThis study indicates that the stone jewellery production at Khao Sam Kaeo can be situated in a larger regional network or perhaps a number of such networks. Multiple overseas sources are evident in the raw materials. Additionally, the similar production method and ornament style of jade and mica link these findings to the contemporaneous traditions as documented at production sites distributed all around the South China Sea, such as in Southern Taiwan, the Philippines, and Southern Vietnam.\r\n\r\nBased on the new \ufb01ndings, two hypotheses are developed about the origins of the responsible craftsmen and production techniques. The \ufb01rst hypothesis proposes di\ufb00erent backgrounds in origin or training for the craftsmen of jade versus the craftsmen of mica objects. Each group owned the raw materials or could access the raw material. For nephrite, perhaps a group of specialised craftsmen from Eastern Taiwan, Southern Vietnam, or the Philippines migrated into Khao Sam  Kaeo. The second hypothesis proposes that local craftsmen at Khao Sam Kaeo knew the necessary  skills for nephrite and mica production from other regions, but several points remain uncertain,  such as how the skills were learned and how people obtained the raw materials from overseas. According to the archaeological \ufb01ndings at Khao Sam Kaeo, the site was strongly connected in extensive maritime trade networks, linking with Taiwan, the Philippines, Borneo, coastal Southern Vietnam, Cambodia, and beyond at approximately 400 through 100 BC. Future  studies will be needed to understand how those overseas raw materials, techniques, and perhaps craftsmen reached to Khao Sam Kaeo.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57259575, "asset_id": 37303846, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5396570, "first_name": "Hsiao-chun", "last_name": "Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "HsiaochunHung", "display_name": "Hsiao-chun Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/HsiaochunHung?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5396570/2368493/93661660/s65_hsiao-chun.hung_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42197, "name": "Iron Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iron_Age?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82703, "name": "South China Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_China_Sea?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90415, "name": "Taiwan Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126498, "name": "Philippine Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 151232, "name": "Vietnam Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 238443, "name": "Austronesian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 316834, "name": "Lithics Nephrite Jadeitite Neolithic Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithics_Nephrite_Jadeitite_Neolithic_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 408818, "name": "Thailand archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 34051058, "title": "High-tin bronze bowls and copper drums: Non-ferrous archaeometallurgical evidence for Khao Sek's involvement and role in regional exchange systems", "created_at": "2017-07-27T02:34:23.007-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34051058/High_tin_bronze_bowls_and_copper_drums_Non_ferrous_archaeometallurgical_evidence_for_Khao_Seks_involvement_and_role_in_regional_exchange_systems?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_34051058", "summary": "This paper documents the copper-base production and consumption assemblage for Khao Sek, comparing and contrasting typological, technological, elemental and isotopic data to provide detailed interpretations.

Can it be considered to qualify as an early city at all? Furthermore, does its socio-political configuration suggest that the city-State concept can be applied to this trading centre? \nIn order to answer these questions, the first part of the discussion begins with a few definitions of the city in the Southeast Asian context, followed by a brief overview of the various contemporaneous moated settlements of Mainland Southeast Asia and of the Early Historical Period enclosed cities of Oc eo and Angkor Borei. This overview is complemented with an introduction to the few data available for the more-or-less contemporaneous settlements excavated in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and to Indian enclosed cities of the Early Historical Period. \nIt is argued here that, among the various sources of urban inspiration, Khao Sam Kaeo may owe much to the contemporaneous moated settlements that are found in many parts of Mainland Southeast Asia as well as to the South Asian enclosed cities that arose during this region\u2019s second urbanisation, which took place by the early to mid-1st millennium BC", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86636185, "asset_id": 80162267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 420501, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 556602, "name": "Archaeology of Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Cities?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 995459, "name": "History Of: Architecture and Urbanism In South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Architecture_and_Urbanism_In_South_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1789765, "name": "Asian Port Cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Port_Cities?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 38187425, "title": "2018 Learning from Paleo-Landscapes: Defining the Land-Use Systems of the Ancient Malayo-Polynesian Homeland", "created_at": "2019-01-20T20:05:52.295-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38187425/2018_Learning_from_Paleo_Landscapes_Defining_the_Land_Use_Systems_of_the_Ancient_Malayo_Polynesian_Homeland?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_38187425", "summary": "Paleo-landscape investigations contextualize how people have inhabited and coevolved dynamically with their landforms, resource zones, and social-ecological niches during measured time intervals and through extended chronological sequences.

During the time range of interest, the region\u2019s coastlines and habitat configurations were substantially different from today\u2019s circumstances, prior to change in sea level, accelerated slope erosion, lowland sedimentary buildup, and some of the world\u2019s most rapid recorded tectonic uplift. The results show that people in eastern Taiwan at 2200\u20132000 BC faced a crisis of limited suitable landforms for their particular mode of subsistence economy, thus instigating overseas migration to the northern Philippines as a means to expand into other territories, with continued effects through 1500 BC and thereafter.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60068384, "asset_id": 38187425, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5396570, "first_name": "Hsiao-chun", "last_name": "Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "HsiaochunHung", "display_name": "Hsiao-chun Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/HsiaochunHung?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5396570/2368493/93661660/s65_hsiao-chun.hung_.jpg"}, {"id": 33506876, "first_name": "Mike", "last_name": "Carson", "domain_name": "uog", "page_name": "MikeCarson", "display_name": "Mike  Carson", "profile_url": "https://uog.academia.edu/MikeCarson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33506876/9897354/20010869/s65_mike.carson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90415, "name": "Taiwan Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126498, "name": "Philippine Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 238443, "name": "Austronesian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 244992, "name": "Southeast Asian prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 462496, "name": "Pacific and Island Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_and_Island_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 35716233, "title": "Video and transcript of Charney Cornell talk, \"Rohingya Crisis\" on history, migrants, refugees, ethnicity, and the state in Myanmar", "created_at": "2018-01-20T06:19:16.234-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35716233/Video_and_transcript_of_Charney_Cornell_talk_Rohingya_Crisis_on_history_migrants_refugees_ethnicity_and_the_state_in_Myanmar?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_35716233", "summary": "Cornell has put the video and a transcript of my and Eant Thiri Thu's talks at Cornell on 7 November 2017.

The piece remains a unique find for Europe and represents the oldest evidence so far for nautilus-shaped vessels in this area. Provided that the early medieval bowl was produced in the Carpathian Basin the question arises as to when and along what way the piece\u2019s model \u2013 a genuine nautilus shell from Indo-Pacific waters \u2013 might have reached Europe. In this respect, two possible scenarios are discussed: On the one hand, postmortal drift provides the possibility of conveying the gasfilled shells for several thousand kilometres. Alternatively, direct transfer of such shells from recent habitats via selected regions in South-East Asia and around the Bay of Bengal can be taken into consideration. Aware of the fact that nautilus shells rarely drift very far and that most of these specimens arrive badly damaged, the author favours the idea of a stage-by-stage transfer along known trade routes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48473597, "asset_id": 28158235, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4037476, "first_name": "Raimar W.", "last_name": "Kory", "domain_name": "imtek", "page_name": "RaimarWKory", "display_name": "Raimar W.

Eren , Jiarong Yuan, David J. Cohen, Yiyuan Li. Quaternary International 269 (2012) 9-21. The use of bamboo by hominins in Southeast Asia has long been used as an explanation for the lack of stone tool innovation and diversity in that region during the Pleistocene. The paleoenvironmental and ethnographic basis of \u201cBamboo hypothesis\u201d has been critiqued recently, but those factors are not directly relevant to the question of whether prehistoric hominins actually used bamboo. There is an even more rudimentary question that should be answered first: is it even possible to make complex bamboo tools with simple flaked cobble tool industries? This paper shows that it is indeed possible to procure and manipulate bamboo in a variety of ways with replicated stone tools. Not all bamboo stems are of equal quality, which should add a layer of intricacy in need of consideration by any future advocate of the Bamboo Hypothesis. Pilot knapping studies are also discussed, and suggest that the raw material constraints presented by local raw materials may generally be given undue weight in the morphological appearance of Southeast Asian Pleistocene stone tools.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35475577, "asset_id": 9194018, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 110361, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Cohen", "domain_name": "taiwan", "page_name": "DavidCohen", "display_name": "David J Cohen", "profile_url": "https://taiwan.academia.edu/DavidCohen?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/110361/5888612/6687047/s65_david.cohen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10158, "name": "East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19728, "name": "Lithic Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithic_Technology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30825, "name": "Upper Paleolithic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Upper_Paleolithic?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 233708, "title": "LA-ICP-MS Analysis of Agate and Carnelian:  Analysis of Geological Sources from Central, South, and Southeast Asia and Beads  from Iron Age sites in Cambodia ", "created_at": "2010-05-05T06:22:34.350-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/233708/LA_ICP_MS_Analysis_of_Agate_and_Carnelian_Analysis_of_Geological_Sources_from_Central_South_and_Southeast_Asia_and_Beads_from_Iron_Age_sites_in_Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_233708", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 941688, "asset_id": 233708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17869, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "AlisonCarter", "display_name": "Alison K Carter", "profile_url": "https://uoregon.academia.edu/AlisonCarter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17869/5981/19917901/s65_alison.carter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25048, "name": "Archaeological Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Chemistry?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50307, "name": "Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beads?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50743, "name": "Compositional Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Compositional_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50744, "name": "LA-ICP-MS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LA-ICP-MS?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 12005039, "title": "An early Middle Holocene Tridacna Adze from Ilin Island, Mindoro, Philippines", "created_at": "2015-04-18T17:33:36.592-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12005039/An_early_Middle_Holocene_Tridacna_Adze_from_Ilin_Island_Mindoro_Philippines?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_12005039", "summary": "Shell artefacts in Island Southeast Asia have often been considered local variants of ground-stone implements, introduced in the Late Pleistocene from Mainland Southeast Asia.

Here we review the range of earthenware technological traditions reflected in the excavated\narchaeological, and focus in detail on the technology and geochemistry ceramics recovered from an excavation trench into the southern edge of the Vat Komnou mound, located in the central section of the community\u2019s lower segment. We use a technologie approach to contrast a localized geochemical signature in the Angkor Borei ceramic assemblage with particular morphological and production-related characteristics that reveal broader technological traditions through cultural transmission. In some cases, and at some points in the sequence, aspects of the Angkor Borei earthenware ceramic assemblage echo technological traditions encompass much of the Lower and Middle Mekong regions in which protohistoric populations interacted.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59947903, "asset_id": 39765862, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}, {"id": 43128037, "first_name": "Shawn", "last_name": "Fehrenbach", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ShawnFehrenbach", "display_name": "Shawn  Fehrenbach", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ShawnFehrenbach?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7275, "name": "South East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16007, "name": "Ceramic Analysis (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 6372050, "title": "Southeast Asia and the Early Maritime Silk Road", "created_at": "2014-03-11T03:38:59.277-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6372050/Southeast_Asia_and_the_Early_Maritime_Silk_Road?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_6372050", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33513690, "asset_id": 6372050, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 420504, "name": "Maritime exchange", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_exchange?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 39048796, "title": "The Angkorian city: From Hariharalaya to Yashodharapura", "created_at": "2019-05-07T13:51:01.417-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39048796/The_Angkorian_city_From_Hariharalaya_to_Yashodharapura?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_39048796", "summary": "This chapter, in a Singapore Civilizations Museum catalogue on Angkor, provides a readable introduction to Angkorian cities.

Not only beads and bracelets were found there but also waste material indicating that glass was transformed into finished objects at the site. Most of the waste material along with bracelet fragments and a few beads manufactured using lapidary techniques are transparent green suggesting that a specialised glass workshop was established at Khao Sam Kaeo as early as the 4th century BC. This workshop could be located at or in the immediate vicinity of Hill 2 in the south part of the site, as suggested by the higher concentration of glass waste excavated in this area.\nGlass compositions obtained using Laser Ablation\u2014Inductively Coupled Plasma\u2014Mass Spectrometry revealed the presence of two main types of glass: a mineral soda alumina glass and a potash glass. Trace elements suggest a Northeastern Indian origin for the mineral soda glass. Potash glass might come from Southern China but no production center has been identified so far. The presence of glass from Northeastern India combined with the use of Indian lapidary techniques for the shaping of some beads reinforces other archaeological evidence suggesting the presence of Indian craftsmen at the site. \nArtifacts similar in terms of composition and style to those found in Khao Sam Kaeo were found in different regions of Southeast Asia such as Vietnam and the Philippines showing that this material was not limited to local consumption but distributed over fairly long distances. This study is placing Khao Sam Kaeo at early date in a well-established exchange network encompass\u0002ing the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. \nThe excavation conducted at Khao Sam Kaeo has also changed the long-held view of South Asia being the sole bead supplier for Southeast Asia and is showing instead that bead technology transfer earlier that initially thought.

An unusual and exceptional amulet showing the abhi\u1e63eka of Gaja-Lak\u1e63m\u012b goddess was recently unearthed at Angkor Borei. This religious theme is very rare for pre-Angkorian Cambodia. The iconographic study reveals an original and syncretic composition combining the Indian theme of \u015ar\u012b-Lak\u1e63m\u012b being anointed with a central element of the old animist aborigenous Khmer tradition, the buffalo sacrifice.

As part of this long-term research program investigations have been initiated in the Tuyin-Thetso uplands, located 11 km southeast of Bagan\u2019s walled and moated epicenter. This mountainous area figures prominently in the chronicles of early Bagan, given that it was one of five places around the city that a royal white elephant carrying a Buddhist tooth-relic kneeled down, prompting King Anawrahta (10441077 CE) to build a pagoda (i.e., temple) there. Numerous 13th century religious monuments were subsequently built on the Tuyin Range. Recent explorations in these uplands have drawn attention to an additional feature of historical significance, a rock-cut tank located along the eastern edge of the Thetso-Taung ridge. Referred to by local villagers as Nat Yekan (Spirit Lake), this reservoir appears to have been integral not only to the initial collection and subsequent redistribution of water across the Bagan plain via a series of interconnected canals and reservoirs, but also, through its associated iconographic imagery, it may have been intended to symbolically purify this water, enhancing its fertility prior to its flowing into the city\u2019s peri-urban zone. Hydrological modelling, excavations, and both iconographic and epigraphic analysis are used to build a multilayered understanding of Nat Yekan\u2019s economic, political, religious, and ideological significance during Bagan\u2019s Classical era.  \r\n \r\nhttps://irawbagan.wordpress.com/\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58248669, "asset_id": 38209894, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2247261, "first_name": "Kong", "last_name": "Cheong", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "KongCheong", "display_name": "Kong F Cheong", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/KongCheong?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2247261/716663/1845046/s65_kong.cheong.jpg"}, {"id": 33089888, "first_name": "Gyles", "last_name": "Iannone", "domain_name": "trentu", "page_name": "GylesIannone", "display_name": "Gyles Iannone", "profile_url": "https://trentu.academia.edu/GylesIannone?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 4258151, "first_name": "Saw", "last_name": "Tun Lin (Lynn)", "domain_name": "linkzb", "page_name": "SawTunLynn", "display_name": "Saw  Tun Lin (Lynn)", "profile_url": "https://linkzb.academia.edu/SawTunLynn?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4258151/1688811/14168340/s65_saw.tun_lynn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2215, "name": "Water", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 5780, "name": "Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7279, "name": "Bagan period (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bagan_period_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23199, "name": "Social Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Ecology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24217, "name": "Ritual Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual_Theory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 27881, "name": "Burma Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burma_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40780, "name": "Settlement archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settlement_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 45401, "name": "Water Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_Management?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 951143, "name": "Archeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1409076, "name": "Souheast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Souheast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 33905193, "title": "Development of maritime Trade Polities and diffusion of the \" South China Sea Sphere of Interaction pan-regional culture \" : The Khao Sek excavations and industries' studies contribution", "created_at": "2017-07-17T02:57:45.858-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33905193/Development_of_maritime_Trade_Polities_and_diffusion_of_the_South_China_Sea_Sphere_of_Interaction_pan_regional_culture_The_Khao_Sek_excavations_and_industries_studies_contribution?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_33905193", "summary": "This paper presents the results of the excavations and an overview of the different industries\u2019 technological studies of the late prehistoric port-of-trade of Khao Sek.

These show Arakan to have had strong ties to Southeastern Bengal (the Samata\u1e6da and Harikela regions) and beyond this with the Buddhist communities of Northeastern India using Sanskrit as preferential medium of expression. A first batch of Arakan Sanskrit inscriptions was studied by E.H. Johnston and published posthumously in 1943. Since then, this field has moved forward thanks mainly to three articles by D. C. Sircar that appeared in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, no further epigraphic material of early Arakan has been published. The Sanskrit inscriptions of Arakan are often in deplorable state of preservation. But even fragmentary material can throw new light on the past, especially when studied in combination with epigraphical and numismatic discoveries made in Southeast Bengal over the past half-century. This article deals with three such fragmentary inscriptions, all previously unpublished. It presents the discovery that the ancient name of Arakan was K\u0101mara\u1e45ga, discusses aspects of the history of Buddhism in Arakan during the first millennium, and discusses the problem of the chronology of early Arakan based on a detailed palaeographic analysis of the inscriptions published here.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47368082, "asset_id": 27117490, "asset_type": "Work",

While we know what artefacts typical of the region and era look like, many objects can be identified and classified as originating from locations far from the site where they were excavated. The findings include bronze drums, mirrors, vessels and coins from the north (China or northern Vietnam) as well as precious stone ornaments, glass, the first gold and silver or special ceramic ware from the west (India via the Thai-Malay Peninsula or via the \"silver road\" through northern Burma and along the Mekong River). However, not every strange-looking\" item is proof of\"trade\" along the maritime silk route.\nSometimes it is difficult to decide which objects are really trade ware, and which instead came with migrants, as tribute, as presents of envoys, or if they might even have been locally \" imitated\" by itinerant craftsmen. This paper gives some examples of how \"strange objects\" are often categorized too quickly as trade ware, and the products resulting from migrations are underestimated.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60299808, "asset_id": 40091285, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3348664, "first_name": "Andreas", "last_name": "Reinecke", "domain_name": "dainst", "page_name": "AndreasReinecke", "display_name": "Andreas Reinecke", "profile_url": "https://dainst.academia.edu/AndreasReinecke?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3348664/1122030/15359154/s65_andreas.reinecke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 151232, "name": "Vietnam Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8181374, "title": "Monuments and Identity at the Dvaravati town of Kamphaeng Saen", "created_at": "2014-09-03T01:19:09.370-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8181374/Monuments_and_Identity_at_the_Dvaravati_town_of_Kamphaeng_Saen?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_8181374", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34614886, "asset_id": 8181374, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1129892, "first_name": "Matthew", "last_name": "Gallon", "domain_name": "mass", "page_name": "MatthewGallon", "display_name": "Matthew Gallon", "profile_url": "https://mass.academia.edu/MatthewGallon?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1129892/395938/482237/s65_matthew.gallon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9437, "name": "Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 148028, "name": "Monuments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monuments?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 951143, "name": "Archeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1250015, "name": "Dv\u0101ravat\u012b", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 2307864, "title": "Investigating Cultural Evolution Using Phylogenetic Analysis: The Origins and Descent of the Southeast Asian Tradition of Warp Ikat Weaving", "created_at": "2012-12-18T12:07:17.186-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2307864/Investigating_Cultural_Evolution_Using_Phylogenetic_Analysis_The_Origins_and_Descent_of_the_Southeast_Asian_Tradition_of_Warp_Ikat_Weaving?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2307864", "summary": "The warp ikat method of making decorated textiles is one of the most geographically widespread in southeast Asia, being used by Austronesian peoples in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, and Daic peoples on the Asian mainland.

These sites, occupied during the Bronze and Iron Ages respectively, were excavated in the hope that they would provide some insight into the hitherto uninvestigated area of prehistoric social development in the Mun River basin.\r\n\r\nUsing the mortuary remains from Ban Lum Khao it has been possible to draw inferences regarding the socio-political environment during the Bronze Age.  The evidence from Non Muang Kao, while not as plentiful, indicates that dramatic social changes took place in the region from c. 1000-500 BC.\r\n\r\nA significant portion of the thesis is dedicated to anthropological and archaeological theory, pertaining to social organisation.  An overview of the present state of archaeological research in the Mun River valley is followed by a description of the excavations at Ban Lum Khao and Non Muang Kao.  Succeeding chapters are dedicated to the analysis of the archaeological remains, including the presentation of a ceramic categorisation.  The data from Ban Lum Khao are subjected to statistical analysis in an attempt to identify possible differences in mortuary practice which may be indicative of the social structure.  The evidence from Ban Lum Khao seems to indicate that no entrenched hierarchical system existed during the time the cemetery was in use.  The material from Non Muang Kao and other contemporaneous Iron Age sites, however, suggests that such systems developed in subsequent periods.  The thesis concludes with an overview of traditional models of social organisation as they pertain to the evidence from Northeast Thailand with a recommendation that the heterarchical model be embraced.  It is felt that this paradigm best explains the available data.\r\n\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 10856943, "asset_id": 1438599, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 348055, "first_name": "Dougald", "last_name": "O'Reilly", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DougaldOReilly", "display_name": "Dougald O'Reilly", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DougaldOReilly?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/348055/94305/569254/s65_dougald.o_reilly.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42197, "name": "Iron Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iron_Age?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52622, "name": "Diachronic Syntax", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diachronic_Syntax?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 58724, "name": "Bronze Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bronze_Age?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 45103708, "title": "Islamisation and the Formation of Vernacular Muslim Material Culture in 15th-Century Northern Sumatra", "created_at": "2021-02-11T17:32:53.403-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45103708/Islamisation_and_the_Formation_of_Vernacular_Muslim_Material_Culture_in_15th_Century_Northern_Sumatra?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_45103708", "summary": "This study presents a distinctive type of Muslim gravestone found on the northern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, that dates to the 15th century. These grave markers, locally known as plang-pleng, provide evidence for the formation and disappearance of an early form of vernacular Muslim material culture in Southeast Asia. We documented over 200 of these gravestones during a large-scale archaeological landscape survey. In this article, we present a typology of these gravestones based upon shape, morphology and ornamentation. We then discuss their geographical distribution and periodisation based on examples with dated Arabic inscriptions. Our results show that these gravestones were initially a cultural product of the historic trading settlement of Lamri dating from the early 15th century. By the middle of the 15th century, variations of these stones started to appear widely near the Aceh river. The plang-pleng tradition was displaced in the early 16th century by the batu Aceh gravestones associated with the Aceh sultanate, which became a standardised part of Muslim material culture in the region for the next two centuries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65668037, "asset_id": 45103708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74355, "first_name": "R.

this article is on the so-called Negritos of Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand, but attention is also paid to other parts of Southeast Asia. I present a survey of current views on the \u201cnegrito\u201d phenotype\u2014is it single or many? If the phenotype is many (as now seems likely), it must have resulted from parallel evolution in the several different regions where it has been claimed to exist. This would suggest (contrary to certain views that have been expressed on the basis of very partial genetic data) that the phenotype originated recently and by biologically well-authenticated processes from within the neighbouring populations. Whole-genome and physical-anthropological research currently support this view. Regardless of whether the negrito phenotype is ancient or recent\u2014and to the extent that it retains any valid biological reality (which is worth questioning)\u2014explanations are still needed for its continued distinctiveness. In the Malay Peninsula, a distinctive \u201cSemang\u201d societal pattern followed by most, but not all, so-called Negritos may have been responsible for this by shaping familial, breeding and demographic patterns to suit the two main modes of environmental appropriation that they have followed, probably for some millennia: nomadic foraging in the forest, and facultative dependence on exchange or labour relations with neighbouring populations. The known distribution of \u201cnegritos\u201d in the Malay Peninsula is limited to areas within relatively easy reach of archaeologically authenticated premodern transpeninsular trading and portage routes, as well as of other non-negrito, Aslian-speaking populations engaged in swidden farming. This suggests that their continued distinctiveness has resulted from a wish to maintain a complementary advantage vis-\u00e0-vis other, less specialised populations. Nevertheless, a significant degree of discordance exists between the associated linguistic, societal-tradition and biological patterns, which suggests that other factors have also been at play.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32873501, "asset_id": 5264122, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403289, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Benjamin", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "GeoffreyBenjamin", "display_name": "Geoffrey Benjamin", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/GeoffreyBenjamin?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403289/357126/13699011/s65_geoffrey.benjamin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5504, "name": "Comparative Genomics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Genomics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5603, "name": "Endangered Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endangered_Languages?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15406, "name": "Social Organisation (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Organisation_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 32948, "name": "Hunter-Gatherers (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunter-Gatherers_Anthropology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 36595, "name": "Endangered languages/cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endangered_languages_cultures?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 64117, "name": "Orang Asli", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orang_Asli?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 95891, "name": "Mon-Khmer linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon-Khmer_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 231456, "name": "Negritos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Negritos?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 419213, "name": "Etnik Orang Asli Di Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etnik_Orang_Asli_Di_Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37129902, "title": "The decentralized Austronesian polity: Of Mandalas, Negaras, Galactics, and the South Sulawesi Kingdoms", "created_at": "2018-07-26T15:14:28.672-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37129902/The_decentralized_Austronesian_polity_Of_Mandalas_Negaras_Galactics_and_the_South_Sulawesi_Kingdoms?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37129902", "summary": "Various models have been presented to describe early Southeast Asian political formations that draw on both indigenous and imported Indic ideas.

It is in this latter environment that most funerary deposits seem to concentrate. As mentioned above, the western part of Hill 2 may have corresponded to a cemetery. The funerary mode consists of pots found empty or containing ashes (and in one instance cremated bones of two children), with which ornaments were sometimes associated", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86635949, "asset_id": 80161878, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17007, "name": "Prehistoric Settlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Settlement?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42249, "name": "Thai Archaeology and Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Archaeology_and_Prehistory?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 408818, "name": "Thailand archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 583951, "name": "Ancient Ports and Harbours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Ports_and_Harbours?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 75278729, "title": "The elaboration of political models in maritime Southeast Asia and of pan-regional culture: Contribution from Khao Sek stone ornament craft system study", "created_at": "2022-04-02T22:29:35.917-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75278729/The_elaboration_of_political_models_in_maritime_Southeast_Asia_and_of_pan_regional_culture_Contribution_from_Khao_Sek_stone_ornament_craft_system_study?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_75278729", "summary": "This paper is a technological reconstruction of Khao Sek stone ornaments industries and its comparison with that of the port-city of Khao Sam Khao.

I apply the adaptive flexibility hypothesis, derived from cognitive ecology, to model the global data and address these questions. Water-crossing behaviors appear to have emerged among different regional hominin populations in similar ecologies, initially representing nonstrategic range expansion. However, an increasing readiness to form connections with novel environments allowed some H. sapiens populations to eventually push water crossings to new extremes, moving out of sight of land, making return crossings to maintain social ties and build viable founder populations, and dramatically shifting subsistence and lithic provisioning strategies to meet the challenges of variable ecological settings.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64469085, "asset_id": 44119219, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4106300, "first_name": "Dylan", "last_name": "Gaffney", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "DylanGaffney", "display_name": "Dylan Gaffney", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/DylanGaffney?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4106300/9871257/11003639/s65_dylan.gaffney.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14492, "name": "Coastal and Island Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_and_Island_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15331, "name": "Cognitive archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30254, "name": "Pleistocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pleistocene?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30543, "name": "Pacific Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 32780, "name": "Mediterranean archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 34853, "name": "Northeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Northeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 39747, "name": "Cognitive Flexibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Flexibility?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 74400, "name": "Japanese archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 151582, "name": "Ancient Seafaring", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Seafaring?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 993249, "name": "Islands Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islands_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 41674409, "title": "(2018) Sub-Operation 2223a: Archaeological Investigation of Nat Yekan Tank (Spirit Lake) on the Tuyin-Thetso Range, Bagan, Myanmar", "created_at": "2020-01-19T10:05:20.598-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41674409/_2018_Sub_Operation_2223a_Archaeological_Investigation_of_Nat_Yekan_Tank_Spirit_Lake_on_the_Tuyin_Thetso_Range_Bagan_Myanmar?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_41674409", "summary": "Integrated Socio-Ecological History of Residential Patterning, Agricultural Practices, and Water Management at the \u201cClassical\u201d Burmese (Bama) Capital of Bagan, Myanmar (11th to 14th Century CE): Report on the 2018 IRAW@Bagan Field Season.

"This talk was given at a workshop/round-table entitled \"The Greater South China Sea Interaction Zone\" (http://tangcenter-columbia.org/may-27-28-2018-tang-workshop/). Aimed at an interdisciplinary audience, but still containing linguistic data and description, it summarizes the issues of the linguistic typological convergence of Sinitic, Tai-Kadai, Hmong-Mien, and Vietic (e.g., Haudricourt 1954a, 1954b), starting in the first half of the 1st millennium CE (but continuing into the 2nd mill.). While lexical material largely moved from Sinitic to the other language groups, all of them together underwent simplification, such as the loss of affixes, presyllables, and final fricatives and glottal stop, and the reduction of initial consonant clusters. The convergence is suggestive of McWhorter's (2007) notion of \"Non-hybrid conventionalized second language\" and imperfect L2 acquisition (i.e. not creoles, but reduction in language contact over a period of centuries). In addition, the development of tones occurred in parallel ways in all of the languages. The timing of the tonogenesis, as seen in the parallel lexical data sets in all the languages, is strongly supportive of borrowing in the first centuries CE, thereby allowing considering of such words as metals and metal implements and their exchange among the language groups/speech communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56505907, "asset_id": 36579224, "asset_type": "Work",

Southeast Asia?", "created_at": "2013-08-09T10:48:42.737-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4206429/Is_the_functional_approach_helpful_to_overcome_the_Typology_dilemma_of_lithic_archaeology_in_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_4206429", "summary": "Traditional analysis of lithic assemblages used Typology mainly as an instrument for their chronological and regional classification. The presence of apparently characteristic and recognisable \u201ctool types\u201d in stratified layers of different archaeological sites helped to link these sites and their stratigraphy to cultural units, and consequently to define prehistoric periods. On the other hand, Typology responded to the question of tool use with a very subjective view from a far distance in time rather than to recognize the actual intention of the prehistoric tool makers and tool users. Furthermore, typologists simply disregarded a wide range of artefacts not belonging to a type category. Assemblages with few or absent types remained ambiguous.\r\nLithic Technology as method succeeding Typology is as well focussing mainly on the morphological features of lithic artefacts in order to receive information about their raw material procurement, manufacturing and curation, the so-called \u201ccha\u00eene operatoire\u201d. However, a closer look into the function of lithic artefacts as the actual reason for their production is not a prime target of Lithic Technology. It thus seems to be rather an addition to Typology than a new approach for understanding stone tools.\r\nA more realistic characterization of stone tools should reflect their actual uses and purposes. This is the field of microscopic use-wear analysis. Investigating wear features on artefact surfaces by using optical light microscopy, chemical analysis and SEM, microwear analysis is the instrument for the functional interpretation of lithic artefacts. With it, we can identify if and how those artefacts were used. It does neither require Typology nor Lithic Technology to function, although the microwear analyst needs to be acquainted with those methods.\r\nIf we consider our question for the missing types in Southeast Asia\u2019s Lithic a typological problem, then perhaps it could be solved through the functional approach.

Despite structural similarities, both communities would have been perplexed at the alienness of the populous settlement of Liangzhu within the lush evergreen surroundings, the masterful jade craftsmanship, the network of Cycladic villages surrounded by meagre land from which a living was eked out and hard rocks mined for rare minerals, and the intrepid sailing of dangerous Aegean waters for trade, community, marriage, and war. Activities and mentalities of distant cultures are classified as parallel items. The prehistoric inhabitants of the Yangtze delta's habitat and the deep blue of the Aegean Sea left us with unique a cultural heritage that promotes its investigation, interpretation, and dissemination using modern technology. Cultural tourism and ecological protection with interpretation and integration in the context of tangible and intangible cultural heritage are linked to sustainable development goals Yangtze River delta and the Cycladic islands act as heritage regions.

"work_12346841", "summary": "We report a successful extraction and sequencing of ancient DNA from carbonized rice grains (Oryza sativa) from six archaeological sites, including two from India and four from Thailand, ranging in age from ca. 2500 to 1500 BP. In total, 221 archaeological grains were processed by PCR amplification and primary-targeted fragments were sequenced for comparison with modern sequences generated from 112 modern rice populations, including crop and wild varieties. Our results include the genetic sequences from both the chloroplast and the nuclear genomes, based on four markers from the chloroplast and six from the nuclear genome. These markers allow differentiation of indica rice from japonica rice, the two major subspecies of Asian rice (O. sativa) considered to have separate geographical origins. One nuclear marker differentiates tropical and temperate forms of subspecies japonica. Other markers relate to phenotypic variation selected for under domestication, such as non-shattering, grain stickiness (waxy starch) and pericarp colour. Recovery and identification of sequences from nuclear markers was generally poor, whereas recovery of chloroplast sequences was successful, with at least one of four markers recovered in 61 % of archaeological grains. This allowed for successful differentiation of indica or japonica subspecies variety, with japonica identified in all the Thai material and a mixture of indica and japonica chloroplasts in the two Indian assemblages. Rice subspecies was also assessed through conventional archaeobotanical methods relying on grain metrics, based on measurements from 13 modern populations and 499 archaeological grains. Grain metrics also suggest a predominance of japonica-type grains in the Southeast Asian sites and a mixture of japonica and indica in the Indian sites with indica in the minority. The similar results of grain metrics and ancient DNA (aDNA) affirm that grain measurements have some degree of reliability in rice subspecies identification. The study also highlights the great potential of ancient DNA recovery from archaeological rice. The data generated in the present study adds support to the model of rice evolution that includes hybridization between japonica and proto-indica.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38160108,

Several glass types were identified, including two subtypes of high-alumina mineral soda glass, and lead\u2013potash glass.

Zakharov. Political History of Central Vietnam in the Second \u2013 Eighth Centuries: Linyi and Camp\u0101. Moscow: Institut Stran Vostoka, 2015. 160 pp., ill., map.\nThe book brings together current historiographic trends depicting early history of Central Vietnam lands as an area of mutual rivalry of various political centres with unstable political hegemony (Southworth 2001, 2004; Vickery 2005, 2009; Schweyer 2012).\nFirst chapter contains a short overview of the sources of Camp\u0101 history. The second one tells a history of the kingdom of Linyi known from ancient Chinese sources and situated between the Ngang Pass and the H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Pass, with a conjectural centre near the modern city of Hu\u1ebf. The author shows the discrepancies of Chinese texts that mixed data on the Linyi history in the fifth century narrating contradictory stories of the king Fan Huda\u2019s successors. He doubts William Southworth\u2019s hypothesis that Camp\u0101 may be identified with the kingdom of Xitu mentioned in the Chinese texts. Despite Anne-Val\u00e9rie Schweyer supports this suggestion, it looks ill-founded: the Chinese describe Xitu as a small kingdom with 2,000 families. In comparison with an army of Linyi that consisted of 40,000-50,000 soldiers it should have been a small principality. But I agree with an old idea by Rolf Stein (1947) that Linyi and Camp\u0101 cannot be identified with each other until at least the seventh century.\nThe third chapter gives a brief account of current archaeology of Central Vietnam. The fourth offers an analysis and the first Russian translation of the V\u1ecf-c\u1ea1nh inscription found near Nha Trang. The author holds that the inscription cannot be dated earlier than the fourth or fifth century CE as it contains a verse in the vasantatilaka poetic metre that has been in use in royal epigraphy from the Imperial Guptas only.\nThe fifth chapter offers Russian translations of early Camp\u0101 inscriptions. The author gives a detailed commentary of previous translations into French and English made by Louis Finot, Edouard Huber, Paul Mus, Georges Maspero, Ramesh Chandra Majumdar, William Southworth, Karl Heinrich Golzio, Anne-Val\u00e9rie Schweyer, Dominic Goodall, and Arlo Griffiths.\nThe sixth chapter reconstructs a history of the kingdom in the Thu Bon River Valley that since the sixth century had been called Camp\u0101. The author shows that it sometimes enjoyed hegemony over remote lands in the Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean, Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a and Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf provinces. He stresses that during the reign of Prak\u0101\u015badharman-Vikr\u0101ntavarman the kingdom (k\u1e63o\u1e47\u012b, de\u1e63a, r\u0101jya) consisted of provinces (vi\u1e63aya). He also points out that the land-surveying mentioned in the earliest inscription of the Thu Bon Valley and issued by the king Bhadravarman testifies to the existence of well-developed early statehood.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36997240, "asset_id": 11466400, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24241664, "first_name": "Anton", "last_name": "Zakharov", "domain_name": "ivran", "page_name": "AntonZakharov", "display_name": "Anton Zakharov", "profile_url": "https://ivran.academia.edu/AntonZakharov?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24241664/6543277/49699602/s65_anton.zakharov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5076, "name": "Sanskrit language and literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_language_and_literature?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6921, "name": "Sanskrit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 220419, "name": "Sanskrit epigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_epigraphy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 973407, "name": "Sanskrit and Old Khmer Epigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_and_Old_Khmer_Epigraphy?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 1022209, "title": "In the long term: Three themes in Malayan cultural ecology", "created_at": "2011-10-17T17:42:50.254-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1022209/In_the_long_term_Three_themes_in_Malayan_cultural_ecology?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_1022209", "summary": "Cultural values and human ecology primarily concern power and history; \"systems\" emerge only when conducting studies on a prehistoric time-scale.

The coefficients of input variables from the LR model could explain how much they influence the chance to discover the new ancient sites. The most influential factor was the distance from the ancient settlement, followed by locating on salt crust area and saline wet belt and distance from water bodies. Frequency ratios strongly supported these findings. Final results from the models were raster-based probability maps of ancient salt-making site occurrence. Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC) were used to validate the FR and LR probability maps and resulted in areas under curves (AUC) of 0.810 and 0.908, respectively. It revealed that LR model could conclusively provide a better result. The study results fruitfully serve the objectives of the study.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72053175, "asset_id": 56889598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1124935, "first_name": "montri", "last_name": "thanaphatarapornchai", "domain_name": "biotech", "page_name": "montrithanaphatarapornchai", "display_name": "montri thanaphatarapornchai", "profile_url": "https://biotech.academia.edu/montrithanaphatarapornchai?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1124935/836331/51998268/s65_montri.thanaphatarapornchai.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1252, "name": "Remote Sensing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remote_Sensing?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1363, "name": "Spatial Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Modeling?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12222, "name": "Survey (Archaeological Method & Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Survey_Archaeological_Method_and_Theory_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23618, "name": "Remote Sensing (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remote_Sensing_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24535, "name": "Archaeological Predictive Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Predictive_Modeling?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25815, "name": "History of salt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_salt?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25816, "name": "Archaeology of salt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_salt?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30271, "name": "Archaeological Heritage Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Heritage_Management?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 47625, "name": "GIS and Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/GIS_and_Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 72973, "name": "Archaeology of food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_food?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 83428, "name": "GIS Applications in Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/GIS_Applications_in_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 172771, "name": "Prehistoric salt production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_salt_production?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 257153, "name": "Spatial Analysis and Predictive Modelling in Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Analysis_and_Predictive_Modelling_in_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 299754, "name": "Archaeological Predictive Modelling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Predictive_Modelling?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 514223, "name": "Ethnography of salt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography_of_salt?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1009312, "name": "Geographic Information Systems (GIS)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geographic_Information_Systems_GIS_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1214565, "name": "Archaeology of salt-production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_salt-production?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 39885191, "title": "2017 Cultural Interactions in Mainland and Island Southeast Asia and Beyond, 2000 BC-AD 200", "created_at": "2019-07-21T03:11:26.251-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39885191/2017_Cultural_Interactions_in_Mainland_and_Island_Southeast_Asia_and_Beyond_2000_BC_AD_200?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_39885191", "summary": "This chapter explores the archaeological record of cultural interactions in Southeast Asia (SEA), from the Neolithic past up through the period of historically reported kingdoms, from approximately 2000 BC through AD 200. Cultural interactions have been evidenced in different forms, such as human migrations in a large scale, traveling craftsmen and merchants in smaller scales, and overlapping patterns of exchange of knowledge, raw materials, finished products, new ideas, and people throughout SEA. Rivers and seas provided natural conduits for such networks across SEA, while overland routes also were developed. Communities were interconnected across SEA and with other civilizations (e.g., China, India, Arabia, and Rome) by river, sea, and land. Through examining these networks, we can learn about the long-term and inter-linked developments of SEA cultures that we see today. Archaeology has a long history of examining cross-community interactions. Precious stone ornaments, distinctively decorated pottery, glass beads, casting molds for metal-production, and other tangible artifacts constitute the hard evidence of materials that were transported from one place to another in dated contexts. With these indisputable facts in hand, archaeologists can reconstruct maps of ancient networks of communications and trade contacts during specific time periods. We further can consider how the material evidence relates with larger themes of economic production, social meaning of trade and exchange, and opportunities for political and ideological developments. The geographic setting of SEA is highly propitious for several inter-community networks, often overlapping. River systems flow in reticulate patterns of waterways throughout much of Mainland SEA, while the Red River and Mekong River connect farther in two major routes with southern China. Additionally, coastlines enable contacts across the sea in all directions, linking Mainland and Island SEA with each other and with distant lands. Inter-community trading and other networking activities have greatly shaped the cultures, histories and languages of SEA over long time scales, through both \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" processes. The bottom-up developments entailed regular routines among local families who traded foods, exchanged finished craft goods and perhaps formed alliances at various scales within their communities and throughout whatever networks were available.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74598918, "asset_id": 39885191, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5396570, "first_name": "Hsiao-chun", "last_name": "Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "HsiaochunHung", "display_name": "Hsiao-chun Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/HsiaochunHung?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5396570/2368493/93661660/s65_hsiao-chun.hung_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 563203, "name": "Maritime trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_trade?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33885636, "title": "Matthew P.

Situ\u00e9e \u00e0 mi-chemin entre Phnom Penh et l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sud du Tonl\u00e9 Sap, Longvek se trouve juste au nord de Oudong, dans les provinces de Kampong Chhnang o\u00f9 plusieurs monuments, fragments d'inscriptions, et sculptures pr\u00e9angkoriens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts.

The analysis focuses on pottery assemblages from fifteen sites recently excavated by the Thai-French archaeological mission in the Thai-Malay Peninsula. The reconstruction of various cha\u00eenes op eratoires and the identification of pottery traditions reveal some Sa Huynh-Kalanay-related pottery were produced by local groups while others have an exogenous origin.

Carnelian beads in particular have long been held as a type marker of early contact across the Bay of Bengal, from the mid-late 1 st millennium BC. With this paper we demonstrate, from the central-northern Myanmar settlement and cemetery sites of Oakaie and Nyaung'gan, not only the presence of semi-precious stone beads, but also their production during the Late Neolithic to Early-Mid Bronze Age, late 2 nd millennium to early-mid 1 st millennium BC. We employed the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire technique to establish reliable links between the industrial and funerary evidence, as represented by 489 finished beads and a vast quantity of production debris. The sites in question are chronologically-overlapping and separated by only five kilometres, but such ornaments are found across the region and it is of fundamental importance to provide a solid foundation to expand semi-precious stone ornament studies and unravel the complex networks of social interactions that led to their exchange.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65157370, "asset_id": 44683283, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37322, "name": "Burmese/Myanmar history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burmese_Myanmar_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 70055, "name": "Ancient technologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_technologies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 534557, "name": "Ornament studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ornament_studies?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 35667987, "title": "Rediscovering an Old Relationship: Taiwan and Southeast Asia's Long, Shared History", "created_at": "2018-01-14T21:16:39.172-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35667987/Rediscovering_an_Old_Relationship_Taiwan_and_Southeast_Asias_Long_Shared_History?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_35667987", "summary": "Contemporary impressions of Taiwan\u2019s relations with Southeast Asia tend to focus on flows of labor, capital, tourism, and marriage. Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand carry the impression that they are the origins of cheap, sometimes easily exploitable, migrant labor for employers in Taiwan. Many people in Taiwan also see the former two countries as sources of brides for lower-income men. These same countries, along with Cambodia and, to a lesser degree, Malaysia, are locations where Taiwanese capital is invested in factories for low-cost labor, proximity to Taiwan and China, and the relative absence of political contentiousness for being Taiwanese. With the advent of cheap air travel, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also offer the middle class in these areas options for quick holiday getaways. These interactions and the condescension toward Southeast Asia that sometimes accompany them belie the rich history of interactions that Taiwan and Southeast Asia share.\n\nhttp://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=831", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55538728, "asset_id": 35667987, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

"Based on a comparative study of two indigenous cultural villages, namely the Mah Meri Cultural Village in Carey Island, and the Orang Seletar Cultural Centre in Johor Bahru, both in West Malaysia, I seek to explore the motives for the development of these indigenous cultural villages, their contribution to broader politics in Malaysia, and their impacts on the cultural heritage of the indigenous communities. I will examine the dynamics surrounding the establishment of these cultural villages, focusing on the Malaysian government\u2019s ideologies to assimilate the indigenous communities into the mainstream Malaysian society vis-\u00e0-vis the indigenous communities\u2019 own sense of cultural identity and heritage, and the roles of cultural brokers in these establishments. My study shows that traditional knowledge and practices, which form an integral part of the indigenous communities\u2019 sense of cultural pride and identity, take on additional meanings as communities adapt to the demands of modernisation and development, and serve as a lifeline for communities in the face of adversity. Cultural heritage is dynamic and constantly evolving, as indigenous communities are actively involved in the refashioning of their cultural heritage to cope with the challenges of rapid urbanisation and development on their traditional lands. Although these communities have established indigenous cultural villages to showcase and preserve their cultural heritage, the level of success enjoyed by the communities in instrumentalising their cultural heritage for the reassertion of their identity and self-determination hinges on the level of agency and authority extended to the communities in managing these indigenous cultural villages.",

Cai demonstrates how they are often beset with the politics of brokerage and representation that reinforce a culture of dependency on the brokers, marginalising their intended beneficiaries. \n\nBy critically examining the relationship between Indigenous tourism and development through the establishment of Indigenous cultural villages, the book addresses the complexities of adopting the \u2018culture for development\u2019 paradigm as a developmental strategy. Demonstrating that the opportunities for self-representation and self-determination can become entwined with the politics of brokerage and the contradictory dualism of culture, the book shows how this can both facilitate and compromise their intended outcomes. Challenging the simplistic conceptualisation of Indigenous communities as harmonious and unified wholes, Cai shows how Indigenous cultures are actively forged, struggled over and negotiated in contemporary Malaysia. \n\nConfronting the largely positive rhetoric in current discourses on the benefits of community-based cultural projects, Staging Indigenous Heritage should be essential reading for academics and students in the fields of museum studies, cultural heritage studies, Indigenous studies, development studies, tourism, anthropology and geography. The book should also interest museum and heritage professionals around the world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64239471, "asset_id": 36146302, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

The exchange of bronze drums established alliances between early centres favouring the trade of other goods, and defining early cultural spheres which set the stage for the process of state formation in the historic period.

Within these assemblages, ceramic objects are almost always the most visible and prolific artefacts and yet also the least studied and understood, despite their demonstrated potential in answering a wide range of archaeological questions about the prehistoric past in other parts of the world. More often than not, conventional archaeological approaches towards ceramic classification are usually based on arbitrary sets of parameters which do not necessarily reflect the intended purpose and use by both the producers and consumers respectively. This results in the creation of etic ceramic typologies with little analytical utility beyond their descriptive value. Consequently, ceramic data is usually underutilized in archaeological research which, in turn, leads to the relegation of ceramic artefacts to ancillary functions in relative dating and culture history.\n\nThis paper focuses on archaeological ceramics recently excavated from three Iron Age mortuary sites in Northwest Cambodia: Phum Sophy (2009 \u2013 2010), Phum Lovea (2011 \u2013 2013) and Prei Khmeng (2014), as well as demonstrating their potential as proxies of social organization and the political economy of the archaeological cultures in question. The paper first identifies ceramic typologies based on both microscopic fabric characteristics and macroscopic morphological features by using the technique of thin-section petrography within the complementary analytical framework of the cha\u00eene op\u00e9ratoire. Thereafter, intra- and inter-site patterns in the variation and distribution of these ceramic typologies are analysed \u2013 in conjunction with the associated artefact assemblage and bioanthropological data within their respective burial contexts \u2013 to reconstruct and understand the social dynamics involved in the production, consumption and eventual deposition of these artefacts across the three sites. In doing so, this paper argues that this multi-scalar and multi-proxy approach will not only produce emic ceramic typologies, but also a nuanced understanding of the development and intensification of social complexity within late prehistoric societies on the cusp of state-formation in Mainland Southeast Asia.\n\n*Presented at the 16th International Conference of the European Association of Southeast Asian Archaeologists, Poznan, Poland, 3-7 July 2017\n\n**Session: Bridging the Biocultural Divide: Collaboration and the Construction of Holistic Perspectives of the Past in Southeast Asia.

The human remains unearthed from this site provided an excellent opportunity to assess phenotypic and biological relationships between the Gaomiao and prehistoric and modern human populations that have inhabited East/Southeast Asia over the past ca. 10,000 years through cranial morphometrics. The assessment of morphometric affinity presented here addresses the peopling of East Asia, particularly in the context of the 'two-layer' hypothesis describing the population history of this region. The results suggest that the Gaomiao skeletons inherited genetic signatures from early colonising populations of Late Pleistocene southern Eurasian origin to a certain extent, and might share a common ancestry with present-day Australian Aboriginal and Melanesian people.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52358837, "asset_id": 32111305, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

different types of socio-religious patterns followed in Southeast Asia relate directly to certain institutionalised ways of orientating people\u2019s apperceptions and ways of talking about the world.

Rather, they have historical and social contexts \u2013 in particular, those set by the processes through which the pre-modern states were brought into being, which have had a continuing influence on these patterns right into modern times. At least four kinds of early state are recognisable in Southeast Asia: coastal trading states, colonial-response states, inland sacred-city (or \u2018middle kingdom\u2019) states, and cultural suppletion (or mainland migration) states. The modern nation-state also has a profound bearing on these issues.\nThe chapter indicates how various domains of culture and society in Southeast Asia \u2013 such as language structure, social organisation, modal personality, religious patterns, ecological types \u2013 may be interrelated, even though they have usually been treated separately. The argument is not a cultural-determinist one. Rather, it is concerned with the contextual placing of the different modes of orientation and the ways in which those modes have been used by people in attempting to change or regulate their society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86191578, "asset_id": 1022541, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403289, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Benjamin", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "GeoffreyBenjamin", "display_name": "Geoffrey Benjamin", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/GeoffreyBenjamin?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403289/357126/13699011/s65_geoffrey.benjamin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 209, "name": "Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Theory?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15406, "name": "Social Organisation (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Organisation_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 404737, "title": "Regional Developments: Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2011-01-06T17:10:32.886-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/404737/Regional_Developments_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_404737", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30174767, "asset_id": 404737, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 768, "name": "Biological Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1703, "name": "Stable Isotope Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_Isotope_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2364, "name": "Paleopathology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleopathology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 14007, "name": "Osteoarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Osteoarchaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25711, "name": "Paleodemography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleodemography?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26750, "name": "History of Archeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Archeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 35985, "name": "Mortuary archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mortuary_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 43884, "name": "History of Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 88815, "name": "Legislation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legislation?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 503358, "name": "Archaeological Excavation Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Excavation_Methodology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 62036032, "title": "Genome Analysis Traces Regional Dispersal of Rice in Taiwan and Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2021-11-19T14:05:57.721-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62036032/Genome_Analysis_Traces_Regional_Dispersal_of_Rice_in_Taiwan_and_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_62036032", "summary": "The dispersal of rice (Oryza sativa) following domestication influenced massive social and cultural changes across South, East, and Southeast (SE) Asia. The history of dispersal across islands of SE Asia, and the role of Taiwan and the Austronesian expansion in this process remain largely unresolved. Here, we reconstructed the routes of dispersal of O. sativa ssp. japonica rice to Taiwan and the northern Philippines using whole-genome resequencing of indigenous rice landraces coupled with archaeological and paleoclimate data. Our results indicate that japonica rice found in the northern Philippines diverged from Indonesian landraces as early as 3,500 years before present (BP). In contrast, rice cultivated by the indigenous peoples of the Taiwanese mountains has complex origins. It comprises two distinct populations, each best explained as a result of admixture between temperate japonica that presumably came from northeast Asia, and tropical japonica from the northern Philippines and mainland SE Asia, respectively. We find that the temperate japonica component of these indigenous Taiwan populations diverged from northeast Asia subpopulations at about 2,600 BP, whereas gene flow from the northern Philippines had begun before $1,300 BP. This coincides with a period of intensified trade established across the South China Sea. Finally, we find evidence for positive selection acting on distinct genomic regions in different rice subpopulations, indicating local adaptation associated with the spread of japonica rice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74906636, "asset_id": 62036032, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28295, "first_name": "Dorian", "last_name": "Fuller", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "DorianFuller", "display_name": "Dorian Fuller", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/DorianFuller?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28295/9222/222915/s65_dorian.fuller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1742, "name": "Archaeobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeobotany?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24516, "name": "Chinese archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 459924, "name": "Crop domestication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crop_domestication?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1074331, "name": "Rice Cropping System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rice_Cropping_System?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 49217356, "title": "Vi\u1e63\u1e47uvarman in the Golden Peninsula", "created_at": "2021-06-12T00:32:30.573-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49217356/Vi%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87uvarman_in_the_Golden_Peninsula?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_49217356", "summary": "This article develops from recent numismatic studies and discoveries made at the site of Khuan Luk Pat, in Khlong Thom district, Krabi province of Peninsular Thailand.

is a rock shelter in East Timor with cultural remains dated to 42,000 years ago, making it one of the oldest known sites of modern human activity in island Southeast Asia. It has special global significance for its record of early pelagic fishing and ancient shell fish hooks. It is also of regional significance for its early occupation and comparatively large assemblage of Pleistocene stone artefacts. Three major findings arise from our study of the stone artefacts. First, there is little change in lithic technology over the 42,000 year sequence, with the most noticeable change being the addition of new artefact types and raw materials in the mid-Holocene. Second, the assemblage is dominated by small chert cores and implements rather than pebble tools and choppers, a pattern we argue pattern, we argue, that is common in island SE Asian sites as opposed to mainland SE Asian sites. Third, the Jerimalai assemblage bears a striking resemblance to the assemblage from Liang Bua, argued by the Liang Bua excavation team to be associated with Homo floresiensis. We argue that the near proximity of these two islands along the Indonesian island chain (c.100 km apart), the long antiquity of modern human occupation in the region (as documented at Jerimalai), and the strong resemblance of distinctive flake stone technologies seen at both sites, raises the intriguing possibility that both the Liang Bua and Jerimalai assemblages were created by modern humans.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50244374, "asset_id": 29788652, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 309984, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Clarkson", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "ChristopherClarkson", "display_name": "Christopher Clarkson", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/ChristopherClarkson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/309984/62495/20350330/s65_christopher.clarkson.jpeg"}, {"id": 31304, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Marwick", "domain_name": "washington", "page_name": "BenMarwick", "display_name": "Ben Marwick", "profile_url": "https://washington.academia.edu/BenMarwick?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31304/81731/89593/s65_ben.marwick.jpg"}, {"id": 34901610, "first_name": "Sue", "last_name": "O'Connor", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "SueConnor", "display_name": "Sue  O'Connor", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/SueConnor?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 772, "name": "Human Evolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Evolution?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19728, "name": "Lithic Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithic_Technology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 91632, "name": "Stone tools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_tools?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25042670, "title": "Prehistoric iron production technologies in the Upper Thai-Malay Peninsula: metallography and slag inclusion analyses of iron artefacts from", "created_at": "2016-05-04T23:14:50.901-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25042670/Prehistoric_iron_production_technologies_in_the_Upper_Thai_Malay_Peninsula_metallography_and_slag_inclusion_analyses_of_iron_artefacts_from?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_25042670", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45365670, "asset_id": 25042670, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 270671, "name": "Archaeo-Metallurgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeo-Metallurgy?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 271242, "name": "Archaeology, History, Ancient Indian Ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_History_Ancient_Indian_Ocean?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1238732, "name": "Archaeology of Maritime Exchange", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Maritime_Exchange?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 14204060, "title": "Composite hunting technologies from the Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene, Niah Cave, Borneo", "created_at": "2015-07-20T03:02:45.837-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14204060/Composite_hunting_technologies_from_the_Terminal_Pleistocene_and_Early_Holocene_Niah_Cave_Borneo?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_14204060", "summary": "Renewed archaeological investigation of the West Mouth of Niah Cave, Borneo has demonstrated that even within lowland equatorial environments depositional conditions do exist where organic remains of late glacial and early post-glacial age can be preserved. Excavations by the Niah Cave Research Project (NCP) (2000\u20132003) towards the rear of the archaeological reserve produced several bone points and worked stingray spines, which exhibit evidence of hafting mastic and fibrous binding still adhering to their shafts. The position of both gives strong indication of how these cartilaginous points were hafted and gives insight into their potential function. These artefacts were recovered from secure and 14C dated stratigraphic horizons. The results of this study have implications for our understanding the function of the Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene bone tools recovered from other regions of Island Southeast Asia. They demonstrate that by the end the Pleistocene rainforest foragers in Borneo were producing composite technologies that probably included fishing leisters and potentially the bow and arrow.",

The movement of this religion into the region was largely determined by preexisting settlement patterns, with moated sites being particularly important. The arrival of Buddhism also introduced monumental architecture and a definable art style. These moated settlements were dependent on large-scale river systems such as the Mun and Chi, particularly in regard to water management, agriculture, transport, and communication. A study of the distribution of sema stones also provides evidence for the spread of Buddhism, while Buddha images carved into rock faces on mountaintops and evidence for rock shelters illustrate that the tradition of forest monks was functioning alongside the more established urban monasticism. The relationship between Buddhism and society is explored, illustrating how the arrival of this religion resulted in new cognitive and physical conceptions of the landscape best demonstrated by changes in settlement planning. Finally, it is shown that Buddhism did not function outside of society but existed in an interdependent relationship with both the lay community and local rulers, with patronage being granted in return for not only spiritual guidance but political legitimization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38805852, "asset_id": 11297917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 32363, "name": "Historical Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Ecology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 1408609, "title": "Usewear and residue analysis: contribution to the study of the lithic industry from Tabon Cave, Palawan, Philippines", "created_at": "2012-02-18T17:23:47.927-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1408609/Usewear_and_residue_analysis_contribution_to_the_study_of_the_lithic_industry_from_Tabon_Cave_Palawan_Philippines?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_1408609", "summary": "\"Tabon Cave yielded occupation layers spanning from the Upper Palaeolithic to the Neolithic.

It should be considered following points before: Features in detail of archaeological culture of Hatti (3rd millennium BC) and also Hittite (2nd millennium BC) periods should be well known. Hattian material culture related to tradiditional Anatolian culture that comes from Neolithic \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck. On the other hand, contrary to common belief we should know that the Hittite have never had distinctive archaeological style during its reign. Though most of books tell fantastic stories of 'Hittite art' , it just consist of quotations assemblage from the arts of Anatolian, Mesopotamian and North African Bronze Age cultures. Architecture codes of spectecular palace and temples of Hattu\u0161a lie behind the colossal architecture style of Assyrian Trade Colonial period of Anatolia. 'Hittite pottery' is nothing but the continuation of traditional Hattian (Anatolian) period, and so on. Accordingly, Anatolian Early Bronze Age archaeological culture had obviously been inherited by Hittite, it seems heirs settled down at and used it up, but hardly ever created their own distinct style during the 450 years. Contrary to countless speculativ suggestions, neither Hatti nor Hittite have contacted Caucasian cultures. There is no archaeological trace regarding this 'potential connections'. It is obvious that the arriving route of the Hittites to Anatolia was not on the Caucasus. Hittites, during their life, not only set a foot on Caucasus but also passed trough the Eastern side of Euphrates as well. Hittites were not a nativ people of Anatolia, they most probably came to Anatolia from outside. We could not know where they entered this land, arguably from Thrace, but we know well that arriving line was not through the Caucasus. Caucasian territory during the third and second millennium BC has been mainly controlled by Hurrians as a owner of Karaz Culture. Up to day there has not been any defined 'unfamiliar' archaeological record over there. We should know that Hattians and Hittites two seperate cultures in social, economic and ethnical ways: Hattians were sedentary people. Hittites, before their Anatolian adventure, most probably were uncivilized nomadic people of steppes. They must have been frst introduced sedentary life and learned everything in Anatolia as a sedentary community, when they arrived this land towards the beginig of the second millennium BC. Particularly during the trasition period from Early Bronze to Middle Bronze-the time span was also the date on which the Hittites are starting to emerge-radical changes did not ocur in Central Anatolia. Because they have nothing to change the productive Hattian life style. In conclusion Hattians and Hittites were the two independent and seperate communities, Hittite were not continuation of Hatti. At least we know that because of its agglutinative structure Hattian should be differed from the European languages. By the way let's remember that 'ergative' cases could not afford to do the same in two different languages. In my opinion Proto Hattian people should have hypotetically been Altai origin as the other specific Asiatic people of Anatolia, Mesopotamia and North Africa (i.e. Hurri, Elamite, Kassite, Hyksos, smiths of the Luristan and etc). Hattian, like the others while one language within \"Archaic Altaian\" before 10.000 BC, it separated and determined its own destinity towards Anatolia (Guneri, A.S. 2016, Turk-Altay Theory).",

"Archaeobotanical studies tend to concentrate on the evidence for specialised agricultural food production, with less attention directed towards the use of plant foods within hunter-gatherer contexts. Here, the authors present evidence for the exploitation of Canarium nuts from four late hunter-gatherer sites in southern China. Canarium nuts contributed to the inhabitants\u2019 diets from as early as 9000 cal BP. They also identify new uses of Canarium, c. 4500\u20134400 cal BP, as ritual offerings in the context of the introduction of rice and millet farming.

BCE. This article discusses the glass material found at Khao Sek using typological observation but also elemental analysis with laser ablation \u2013 inductively coupled plasma \u2013 mass spectrometry. Beyond obvious morphological resemblance, compositional analyses of the glass confirm similarities between the glass industries at Khao Sam Kaeo and Khao Sek and the existence of a fairly standardized glass ornament production at an early period. This article provides new arguments to discuss the fashioning of a regional standardized craft system as early as the mid-first millennium BC and its role in participating in the production of a pan-regional style, the \" Late Prehistoric South China Sea style \".

Nous rappelons juste ici que le groupe central de Prah K\u00f4 comprend, sur une plate-forme commune en gr\u00e8s, six tours de brique aux soubassements de gr\u00e8s, r\u00e9parties sur deux rang\u00e9es Nord-Sud. 1.

Pottier \u00e9tait architecte-conseil de 1993 \u00e0 1995. 2.

For some specialists, this architectural type was copied from an early Indian type of mosques. For others, it was developed in Java before Islamization and adopted for the purpose of the new Muslim faith around the fifteenth century. \nIn continuity of a reflection outlined by some historians and architects this article proposes to shed more light on this latter hypothesis, on the basis of new archaeological and iconographical sources. While these materials show indeed the anteriority of buildings with a concentric pattern, spread during the Hindu-Buddhist period in Java, they also allow to determine that this type was used for Hindu and Buddhist cults from the seventh century onwards.

Samples from four kiln complexes in China\u2014Jingdezhen, Dehua, Huajiashan, and Minqing, hypothesized to be potential sources of the shipwreck\u2019s qingbai ceramics based on visual inspection\u2014were also analyzed to establish reference groups. Results from kiln samples show that different kiln complexes can be clearly differentiated by pXRF analysis of glazes. Based on pXRF analysis of ceramic samples from the JSW, there appear to be four compositional groups, and each group closely matches one of the four kiln reference groups.

A suite of geoarchaeological methods suggest largely uninterrupted deposition, against a backdrop of geological data that show major changes in sea levels. Although there is a small assemblage of mostly undiagnostic ceramics and stone artefacts, there are some distinct changes in stone artefact technology and ceramic fabric. There is a substantial faunal assemblage, with changes in both the mammalian and shellfish taxa during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition that correlate with local sea level fluctuation. This assemblage provides an opportunity to explore subsistence behaviours leading up to the transition to the Neolithic. We explore the implications for current debates on the prehistoric origins of agricultural subsistence in mainland Southeast Asia. The data highlight the importance of local contingencies in understanding the mechanisms of change from foragers to agriculturalists.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50423680, "asset_id":

Lasting from approximately the sixth to the ninth centuries CE and focused in today\u2019s central Thailand, Dv\u0101ravat\u012b in one or another form has been of major concern to Thai and Southeast Asian art historians and archaeologists for over 80 years. Moreover, it has recently been the focus of several international blockbuster exhibitions. Dv\u0101ravat\u012b is often referred to as a kingdom, a time period, a material culture, a geographical entity, an art style, even just a \u201cculture\u201d, or any combination of these. What does the material and epigraphic evidence support? Academic debates mainly relate to issues of dating and geographical extent, such as, which centuries marked the beginning and end of a so-called \u201cDv\u0101ravat\u012b period\u201d and how extensive were the geographical limits of these art forms. However, virtually no discussion has taken place about why this artistic or cultural period should be defined by the name of an elusive polity or to what extent something called \u201cDv\u0101ravat\u012b art\u201d has any reality.  This paper presents an overview of recent findings and compares different interpretations as well as reassesses commonly held assertions about Dv\u0101ravat\u012b. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.nomadit.co.uk/euraseaa/euraseaa15/panels.php5?PanelID=3533 ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52011510, "asset_id": 12753865, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 684828, "first_name": "Nicolas", "last_name": "Revire", "domain_name": "artic", "page_name": "NicolasRevire", "display_name": "Nicolas Revire", "profile_url": "https://artic.academia.edu/NicolasRevire?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/684828/2836318/83102129/s65_nicolas.revire.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94916, "name": "Indology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9845803, "title": "Living in the Landscape: Essays in Honour of Graeme Barker (edited by Katherine Boyle, Ryan J.

They mirror the scope of Barker\u2019s legacy through a focus on transitions in the human\u2013environment relationship, how they are enacted and perceived. The assembled chapters illustrate how climate, demographic, subsistence, social and ecological change have affected cultures from the Palaeolithic to Historical, from North Africa and West-Central Eurasia to Southeast Asia and China.

There are about 24 areas in the world from which crop species originated, and attention has focused on the dynamics of the domestication process and the evolutionary genetics of crop origins and divergence 1. By contrast, relatively little attention has been focused on the dispersal and diversification of crops from their centres of origin, and the accompanying evolution of adaptive traits that enable these domesticated species to establish themselves in different environmental and cultural contexts 2. Reconstructing the patterns and timing of the spread of domesticated species can help us understand the climatic and other environmental factors that govern the expansion of their species range, as well as the relationship between crop dispersal and human migration and history. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major staple crop, providing more than 20% of calories for more than half of the human population. Domesticated rice encompasses genetically distinct populations grown in sympatry, including major subgroups japonica and indica (sometimes recognized as subspecies), as well as geographically more restricted circum-aus, and circum-basmati rices 3,4. It is mainly cultivated in monsoon Asia, but rice is distributed across a wide latitudinal range, spanning tropical and temperate zones of Asia, probably requiring local water, temperature and photoperiod adaptation. Rice is grown in lowland ecosystems under paddy, deepwater or seasonal flood conditions, as well as in upland rainfed areas 5. Archaeological evidence 6-8 indicates that cultivation of japonica rice began around 9,000 yr bp in the lower Yangtze Valley, whereas proto-indica rice cultivation started more than 5,000 yr bp in the lower Ganges valley 9. Archaeological 10 and most population-genetic analyses 11-13 suggest that important domestication alleles have a single origin in japonica rice in East Asia. The spread of japonica to South Asia about 4,000 yr bp led to introgression of domestication alleles into proto-indica or local Oryza nivara populations and the emergence of indica rice 11-13. While the origins of rice have been the focus of intensive study, less attention has been paid to its spread after domestication. From the Yangtze and Ganges Valleys, respectively, japonica and indica dispersed across much of Asia over the last five millennia, providing sustenance for emerging Neolithic communities in East, Southeast and South Asia 14. Archaeological data show the general directional-ity of rice dispersal 9,15 ; however, the details of dispersal routes and times and the environmental forces that shaped dispersal patterns remain unknown. In this study we undertake population-genomic analyses to examine environmental factors associated with the geographic distribution of rice diversity, and reconstruct the ancient dispersal of rice in Asia.

It is also significant in the discourse of the Austronesian dispersal during the Neolithic period. However, it was critiqued that the tendency of archaeology of early agriculture is to treat time as chronological, rather than as a lived experience. This paper is a preliminary exploration on the temporality of the people in Island SEA as reflected in their rice agriculture. Specifically, the following questions are addressed: (a) How is the temporality of the people represented in ethnography? (b) How is time treated in dealing with the archaeology of early agriculture? (c) Including available literature on climate and environmental variations, can we deduce their effects on rice agriculture and the temporalities of the people involved in rice cultivation? This paper also assesses the possibility of incorporating \u201ctaskscape\u201d into interpreting the archaeology of early agriculture in SEA.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39168260, "asset_id": 16759715, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158140, "first_name": "Michelle Sotaridona", "last_name": "Eusebio", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "MichelleSotaridonaEusebio", "display_name": "Michelle Sotaridona Eusebio", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/MichelleSotaridonaEusebio?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158140/94345/11127910/s65_michelle.eusebio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10225, "name": "Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48174, "name": "Temporality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporality?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 87401, "name": "Rice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rice?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1003416, "name": "Island Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Island_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 15998664, "title": "Society for East Asian Archaeology SEAA7", "created_at": "2015-09-21T18:24:48.173-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15998664/Society_for_East_Asian_Archaeology_SEAA7?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_15998664", "summary": "The Society for East Asian Archaeology (SEAA) is pleased to announce that the Seventh SEAA Worldwide Conference will be held in Cambridge and Boston, Massachusetts, USA, on June 8- 12, 2016.

the recent shift in historical perspectives concerning the mid-first millennium exchanges between the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal and the subsequent new perspectives on the cultural evolution of this broad region. In particular, it reviews the results of recent research conducted on what appeared as the earliest complex trading-polities that developed in the Kra Isthmus from the late fifth to early fourth century BC. The discovery of their cosmopolitan and early urban nature, pushed back in time developments traditionally attributed to the early historical period. These trading polities produced or concentrated many of the shared cultural items distributed over a wide region. Technological analysis demonstrated that most of these items were culturally hybrid, combining technologies and styles from various Asian horizons thus allowing to discuss further the concept of a panregional culture and cultural transfers.

His main argument is that the hereditarily closed ranking system of Brunei\u2019s dominant ethnic group produced, or at least perpetuated, ethnic diversity and the development of an invented historiography in relation to ethnic origins to support the position of the dominant group. Similar relationships between rank, or status, and origins are found throughout much of the Austronesian-speaking world. In most of these societies origins are of fundamental social and political importance, often expressed through complex traditions that through recourse to origins function to establish social difference between individuals, social or ethnic groups in order to justify claims of precedence: a priority, seniority or superiority that can relate to rights over resources, political offices or the political or ritual ascendancy of one group over another. Drawing on data from the wider Austronesian world, particularly ideas of \u2018origin and precedence\u2019, this chapter presents a comparative analysis of various Brunei origin traditions, supplemented by historical, archaeological and linguistic data.

The article presents a reconstruction of previously unpublished funerary monuments interpreted also through comparisons with artistic and epigraphic evidence from Gandhara and Central Asia. The site (renamed as\nButkara IV) is located between two important Buddhist sanctuaries (Butkara III and Butkara I) at the outskirts of a major ancient urban area in Middle Swat. The main monument of the site is a multiple-burial building with twenty individuals deposed inside its three chambers. The study originated from the DNA analysis, family relatedness, and associated radiocarbon dates of 5 individuals from the main monument.

These conclusions are currently based on nominal differences in vertebrate taxonomic composition observed at different archaeological sites. In this paper, we take a statistical approach to test whether hunter-gather and early agricultural subsistence economies really can be confidently distinguished based on the relative taxonomic composition of the recovered animal bone assemblages. A regional database of terrestrial and arboreal vertebrate faunas was created for 32 archaeological sites across Southeast Asia from the Terminal Pleistocene to the Late Holocene, and principal component analysis was performed. The resultant data indicates that terrestrial vertebrate taxonomic composition is a relatively strong indicator of the general subsistence base for the various archaeological sites studied and can be used to determine whether the inhabitants subsisted purely from hunting, or from a mixture hunting and animal management.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58547610, "asset_id": 38481518, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 326511, "first_name": "Rebecca", "last_name": "Jones", "domain_name": "australianmuseum", "page_name": "RebeccaJones", "display_name": "Rebecca K Jones", "profile_url": "https://australianmuseum.academia.edu/RebeccaJones?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/326511/136412/32600789/s65_rebecca.jones.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5069, "name": "Principal Component Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Principal_Component_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30254, "name": "Pleistocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pleistocene?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 78965, "name": "Holocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocene?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 142522, "name": "Domestication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestication?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 27797414, "title": "Thai-Malay Peninsula and South China Sea networks (500 BCeAD 200), based on a reappraisal of \" Sa Huynh-Kalanay \" -related ceramics", "created_at": "2016-08-15T16:31:05.212-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27797414/Thai_Malay_Peninsula_and_South_China_Sea_networks_500_BCeAD_200_based_on_a_reappraisal_of_Sa_Huynh_Kalanay_related_ceramics?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_27797414", "summary": "From 500 BC to AD 200, cultural exchanges in the South China Sea were emphasized by the expansion and intensification of long-distance interaction networks.

This paper aims to explore the various modes of circulation of Sa Huynh-Kalanay-related pottery and to define whether they involved the movement of goods and/or of people such as merchants or craftsmen. The analysis focuses on pottery assemblages from fifteen sites recently excavated by the Thai-French archaeological mission in the Thai-Malay Peninsula. The reconstruction of various cha\u00eenes op eratoires and the identification of pottery traditions reveal some Sa Huynh-Kalanay-related pottery were produced by local groups while others have an exogenous origin.

It has been done by elaborating upon the nature, function and pattern of the settlements through a combined methodology of programmatic total survey, stratigraphically informed excavations and geoarchaeological understanding of the continuously changing alluvial context. The outcome is encouraging. It has been possible to delineate a method to designate the settlements and their spatial boundary by considering the spatial patterning of archaeological places including the tanks. At the same time, it was found that the pattern of the settlement was partially controlled by the rivers and the settlements were abandoned for different reasons. The settlements that have been interpreted in this paper have been found \u2013 in opposition to the established narratives - to be abandoned possibly because of floods and avulsion of rivers. It has also been proposed that the dichotomy between the urban and rural for assigning nature of the settlements might be problematic as the religious establishments acted as the core of these settlement structures.

Terrestrial sites\nhave yielded massive amounts of ceramic material and the archaeological reports of\nshipwreck cargoes corroborate the versatile and extensive qualities of trade ceramics in\nthe region. The sheer quantity of ceramic artefacts found in shipwreck assemblages,\npaired with a well-researched framework of the aesthetic, show that there is no doubt\nthat we rely heavily on ceramic data to date wrecks and establish regional trading\npatterns. This paper will debate that we are too 'ceramo-centric' in our analyses of\nshipwrecks. While ceramics typically represent the bulk of the recovered material in\nthese instances, many other types of media are present in the assemblage. Yet, these\n\u201clesser\u201d materials suffer from a lack of investigation and therefore play virtually no role in\nthe archaeological and historical assessment. This case study focuses on the nonceramic\nassemblages for six shipwrecks from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries of\nSoutheast Asia (three Chinese-built and three Southeast Asian-styled junks). The\ntypological study of the metallurgical, organic and geological material from these wrecks\ncan complement much of the work surrounding existing trade models as well as reveal\nnew concepts of crew life, belief systems and culture. These facets come together to\noffer a more holistic narrative as well as stimulating the need within the region for more\nstudy regarding the locations where past peoples mined and manufactured raw metals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35865291, "asset_id": 9669623, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 326121, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Fahy", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "BrianFahy", "display_name": "Brian  Fahy", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/BrianFahy?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/326121/136295/158288/s65_brian.fahy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29709, "name": "Underwater Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Underwater_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 44631, "name": "Ancient Shipwrecks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Shipwrecks?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 48820, "name": "Shipwrecks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipwrecks?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 400085, "name": "Archaeology: Maritime & Underwater archaeology; shipwreck archaeology; archaeology of piracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_Maritime_and_Underwater_archaeology_shipwreck_archaeology_archaeology_of_piracy?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 8571523, "title": "HUKAY 19 (2014) The Last Voyage of the Dead: The Milky Way and the Boat-Shaped Burial  Markers of the Philippines Archipelago", "created_at": "2014-09-30T12:14:04.935-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8571523/HUKAY_19_2014_The_Last_Voyage_of_the_Dead_The_Milky_Way_and_the_Boat_Shaped_Burial_Markers_of_the_Philippines_Archipelago?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_8571523", "summary": "The boat-shaped burial markers of the Philippines archipelago and their original astronomical orientation towards the Milky Way concretely manifest the purpose and concern of monumental architecture and the archipelago\u2019s indigenous world view. In the archaeological record of Malayo-Polynesian Philippines, monumental remembrance is not materialised in structures that either defy the earth, like the tower form, or that identify with nature and the cosmos, like the mound. Instead, boat-shaped burial markers laid out low to the ground in stones or coral slabs appear to flow and disappear into the farther landscape. The fickle and frequently powerful and destructive natural environment defines the cosmological, which can only be highlighted or pointed out, not mastered or made a home of. Initial findings seem to show that the boat-shaped burial markers pointed towards the place where the Milky Way appeared to rise up from the horizon in the first hours of the evening, at the start of the short dry season. In the case of the Catanauan burials, this orientation seems to have determined the choice of Tuhian cove itself where the markers are found; the cove opened to a magnificent view of the Milky Way precisely at that time of year. The Annales concept of the longue duree and some ethnoastronomical parallels help clarify these peculiarities of the monumental architecture of the various Malayo-Polynesian peoples of the Philippines archipelago, who shared in the region-wide Austronesian ethnic and linguistic heritage, but who more peculiarly shared in their archipelago\u2019s distinctively stormy weather. \r\n",

Serialised in Le Tour du Monde, a popular French magazine devoted to expeditions abroad, it had been rewritten by a ghostwriter and illustrated with engravings based on Mouhot\u2019s own drawings. It quickly caused a sensation, not for its descriptions of the flora and fauna of Southeast Asia, but for its tales of a lost civilisation hidden in the tropical jungles of Cambodia. \n\nMouhot\u2019s publications set the tone for how France, and the Western world in general, would view and imagine Angkor. They initiated the ways in which Angkor has been presented to the world over the past century and a half, with the lure of the exotic orient and enduring fantasies of discovering \u201clost civilisations\u201d taking centre stage. This essay looks at to what extent these perceptions remain today and how much they have changed. It does so by exploring the paintings, photographs, architectural drawings, museum displays, and colonial expositions dedicated to the topic, and by contextualising those against the colonial mindset of the time, which framed the West\u2019s understanding and representation of Angkor. It concludes with a look at Angkor in post-independence Cambodia, and an examination of how much the images, tropes, and exoticising stereotypes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century are still being perpetuated.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64027257, "asset_id": 43719674, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 245915, "name": "Political history of Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_history_of_Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1100198, "name": "Cambodian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Politics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1143877, "name": "Angkor Wat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor_Wat?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 43181170, "title": "Social Status and Its Relationship to Non-specific Stress at Late Iron Age Non Ban Jak, Northeast Thailand", "created_at": "2020-05-27T16:21:48.858-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43181170/Social_Status_and_Its_Relationship_to_Non_specific_Stress_at_Late_Iron_Age_Non_Ban_Jak_Northeast_Thailand?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_43181170", "summary": "The rise of social inequality is a key development in human history and is linked to deteriorating health. These associated health impacts are poorly understood for Iron Age (420 B.C.-A.D. 500) northeast Thailand. To clarify this issue we investigate whether social status differences influence non-specific stress at the site of Non Ban Jak (A.D. 300-800), which comprises two separate burial mounds. These mounds are thought to represent the neighborhoods of two distinct social groups at the site. Quantitative analyses were used to explore differences in grave goods among the adults of Non Ban Jak (N = 47). Long bone lengths, ages at death, and linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) were examined to explore differences in non-specific stress on the basis of age, sex, burial mound, and mortuary phase. Results demonstrated that older adults of both sexes, males of all ages, and west mound individuals received greater grave good quantities and may therefore have been of higher social status. West mound individuals were taller and had a lower prevalence of LEH compared to those from the east mound. Although female LEH prevalence and mortality were reduced relative to males, decreasing stature over time and high neonatal mortality indicated greater female stress. Lower-status individuals may therefore have suffered increased stress relative to those of higher status. Artifactual and epigraphic evidence supports the suggestion of sex-and class-based status differences at Non Ban Jak, legitimized and perpetuated through the adoption of residential burial and new religious ideologies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63447071, "asset_id": 43181170, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1380301, "first_name": "Stacey", "last_name": "Ward", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "StaceyWard", "display_name": "Stacey M .

Also known as insular Southeast Asia, the region inconveniently crisscrosses many contemporary political boundaries. Its heartland lies in Indonesia, and indeed the Richman Collection is particularly rich in objects from Borneo and Sumatra. The same mountain chain that forms Sumatra's backbone dips under the sea as it crosses the unmarked border between Indonesia and India, then emerges farther north as the Nicobar and Andaman archipelagoes. Regional affinities also extend north of Indonesia throughout Southeast Asia's other great archipelagic nation, the Philippines, to the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan, and even to such mainland peoples as the Jorai of Vietnam and the peoples of the Naga hills in Assam, India.\r\n\r\nIsland Southeast Asia is the term increasingly used for the region that, in the earlier literature, was referred to as the Malay Archipelago, Indonesia, or Malaysia, in the broadest sense of those terms. The term Malay Archipelago was inadequate because Malays are only one of the region's hundreds of ethnic groups, and because Indonesia and Malaysia have now been adopted as names for nations. Island Southeast Asia has thus been increasingly accepted as a term for this culture area, even though it includes related mainland peoples as well. The region comprises one of the five standard parts of Oceania (the Pacific islands), the other four being Melanesia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Australia. The dual aspect of its identity is aptly expressed in its name, sprawled as it is within Oceania's island realm and yet historically in continuous contact with events and influences from the Asian mainland. The region minimally includes the modern nations of the Philippines, Indonesia (except Irian Jaya), Brunei, and the eastern part of Malaysia (Sarawak and Sabah). \r\n= = = = = = =\r\nNote: the full book is out of print but available online from the Metropolitan Museum of Art: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/Art_of_Island_Southeast_Asia_The_Fred_and_Rita_Richman_Collection ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56792203, "asset_id": 36839339, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25370, "name": "Contemporary Indigenous Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Indigenous_Arts?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 36130, "name": "Prehistoric And Tribal Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_And_Tribal_Arts?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 159045, "name": "Malaysian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 250543, "name": "Primitive Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primitive_Arts?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 539122, "name": "Philippine art and culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_art_and_culture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 35558365, "title": "\"Dev\u0101n\u012bka\u2019s inscription from V\u0103t Luong K\u0103u near Vat Phou in Laos K. 365: first English translation,\" in: South East Asian Review.

I think that Dev\u0101n\u012bka ruled an at least autonomous kingdom which had little, if any, in common with Early Zhenla, Camp\u0101, or Funan \u6276\u5357 situated in the Lower Mekong Basin.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55424118, "asset_id": 35558365, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24241664, "first_name": "Anton", "last_name": "Zakharov", "domain_name": "ivran", "page_name": "AntonZakharov", "display_name": "Anton Zakharov", "profile_url": "https://ivran.academia.edu/AntonZakharov?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24241664/6543277/49699602/s65_anton.zakharov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 786821, "name": "Cambodian inscriptions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_inscriptions?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 973407, "name": "Sanskrit and Old Khmer Epigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sanskrit_and_Old_Khmer_Epigraphy?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 30576294, "title": "NH\u00c0 N\u01af\u1edaC S\u1edaM \u1ede B\u1eaeC VI\u1ec6T NAM (2016, Kh\u1ea3o C\u1ed5 H\u1ecdc)", "created_at": "2016-12-22T07:34:04.880-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30576294/NH%C3%80_N%C6%AF%E1%BB%9AC_S%E1%BB%9AM_%E1%BB%9E_B%E1%BA%AEC_VI%E1%BB%86T_NAM_2016_Kh%E1%BA%A3o_C%E1%BB%95_H%E1%BB%8Dc_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_30576294", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51017887, "asset_id": 30576294, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 428285, "first_name": "Nam", "last_name": "Kim", "domain_name": "wisc", "page_name": "NamKim", "display_name": "Nam C Kim", "profile_url": "https://wisc.academia.edu/NamKim?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/428285/105049/974708/s65_nam.kim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7396, "name": "Vietnamese History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25518, "name": "Ancient Civilization (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Civilization_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1029255, "name": "Ancient Urbansim", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Urbansim?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1205503, "name": "Vietnamese Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 20084728, "title": "Recent Development of Palaeolithic Studies in Sabah", "created_at": "2016-01-07T10:27:26.657-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20084728/Recent_Development_of_Palaeolithic_Studies_in_Sabah?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_20084728", "summary": "The Palaeolithic in Sabah began around 27,000 to 22,000 years ago based on the systematic and scientific study of archaeological sites in the Tingkayu Valley in 1988.

In Mansuli Valley, there are two types of sites, open and cave site. Both types of this site show thatit was occupied repeatedly. Moreover, in terms of the distribution of Palaeolithic sites also show that the area west of Sabah (Interior Division) has evidence of Palaeolithic culture too. In fact. it is possible that these sites have the same age with Mansuli Valley sites.

The geochemical data comprising biomarker and carbon isotopes on chromatographic fractions were compared to oil seep references from different areas in southern and southwest Iran. To complete the investigation, data on bitumen from several archaeological sites in Iran were used as proxies. Results show that there are two types of Iranian bitumen in the Phanom-Surin samples as well as two distinct varieties of torpedo jars. A potentially older category, represented in the assemblage by a single example, may have been kept in circulation for half a century or more beyond its period of regular use.

"Against the backdrop of a comprehensive archaeobotanical review, we present linguistic evidence that allows us to develop a model of the dispersal of bananas westwards from New Guinea. This westward dispersal is a window on pre-Austronesian contact between New Guinea and regions to the west. The linguistically-derived model is compatible with archaeobotanical and botanical data. Our interpretation accords with evidence for maritime interactions from the early Holocene in western New Guinea and eastern Indonesia. In the first half of this paper the history of banana domestication, which has been partially documented through archaeobotanical, genetic and phytogeographic research, is reviewed. On the basis of this multidisciplinary and chronological context, the second half of the paper presents a detailed, linguistically-derived interpretation for the westward diffusion of bananas from New Guinea into eastern Indonesia. Apparently cognate terms for 'banana' in the modern languages of Melanesia and eastern Indonesia are reviewed and evaluated. The distribution of one particular cognate term correlates with the range of a linguistic substrate identified in western Melanesia and eastern Indonesia, and is argued to be associated with an early, pre-Austronesian diffusion of banana cultivars westward from New Guinea.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46610401, "asset_id": 26296827, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 702099, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Donohue", "domain_name": "livingtongues", "page_name": "MarkDonohue", "display_name": "Mark Donohue", "profile_url": "https://livingtongues.academia.edu/MarkDonohue?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 778, "name": "Diachronic Linguistics (Or Historical Linguistics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diachronic_Linguistics_Or_Historical_Linguistics_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9183, "name": "Comparative Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 36100, "name": "Botanical History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Botanical_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 44390, "name": "Vegetation History and Archaeobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vegetation_History_and_Archaeobotany?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 22070483, "title": "Brandao et al 2016 Quantifying the legacy of the Chinese Neolithic on the maternal genetic heritage of Taiwan and Island Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2016-02-16T15:00:22.917-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22070483/Brandao_et_al_2016_Quantifying_the_legacy_of_the_Chinese_Neolithic_on_the_maternal_genetic_heritage_of_Taiwan_and_Island_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_22070483", "summary": "[This multi-authored paper on the use of archaeological DNA is significant to Myanmar because it is the first publication of DNA data from Myanmar derived from a database of over 500 samples collected by co-author Bob Hudson and members of the Field School of Archaeology, Pyay, in conjunction with Huddersfield University, UK.  While only a small sample from Myanmar is used in this paper, further papers that focus more specifically on the archaeological genetics of Myanmar are forthcoming]. ******                     \nABSTRACT\nThere has been a long-standing debate concerning\nthe extent to which the spread of Neolithic ceramics\nand Malay-Polynesian languages in Island Southeast Asia\n(ISEA) were coupled to an agriculturally driven demic dispersal\nout of Taiwan 4000 years ago (4 ka). We previously\naddressed this question using founder analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control-region sequences to identify major lineage clusters most likely to have dispersed\nfrom Taiwan into ISEA, proposing that the dispersal had a\nrelatively minor impact on the extant genetic structure of\nISEA, and that the role of agriculture in the expansion of the Austronesian languages was therefore likely to have\nbeen correspondingly minor. Here we test these conclusions\nby sequencing whole mtDNAs from across Taiwan\nand ISEA, using their higher chronological precision to\nresolve the overall proportion that participated in the \u201cout-of-\nTaiwan\u201d mid-Holocene dispersal as opposed to earlier,\npostglacial expansions in the Early Holocene. We show\nthat, in total, about 20 % of mtDNA lineages in the modern\nISEA pool result from the \u201cout-of-Taiwan\u201d dispersal, with\nmost of the remainder signifying earlier processes, mainly\ndue to sea-level rises after the Last Glacial Maximum.\nNotably, we show that every one of these founder clusters\npreviously entered Taiwan from China, 6\u20137 ka, where rice farming originated, and remained distinct from the indigenous\nTaiwanese population until after the subsequent dispersal\ninto ISEA.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42744844, "asset_id": 22070483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29898, "first_name": "Bob", "last_name": "Hudson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "BobHudson", "display_name": "Bob Hudson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/BobHudson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29898/9726/16646622/s65_bob.hudson.jpg"}, {"id": 81525, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Oppenheimer", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "StephenOppenheimer", "display_name": "Stephen Oppenheimer", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/StephenOppenheimer?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 5820450, "first_name": "Pedro", "last_name": "Soares", "domain_name": "requimte", "page_name": "PedroSoares", "display_name": "Pedro Soares", "profile_url": "https://requimte.academia.edu/PedroSoares?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5820450/2501730/2904974/s65_pedro.soares.jpg"}, {"id": 510016, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Richards", "domain_name": "hud", "page_name": "MartinRichards", "display_name": "Martin B Richards", "profile_url": "https://hud.academia.edu/MartinRichards?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/510016/177348/206766/s65_martin.richards.jpg"}, {"id": 10588607, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Bulbeck", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DavidBulbeck", "display_name": "David Bulbeck", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DavidBulbeck?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10588607/3197640/3763672/s65_david.bulbeck.jpg"}, {"id": 32927803, "first_name": "Francesca", "last_name": "Gandini", "domain_name": "hud", "page_name": "FrancescaGandini", "display_name": "Francesca Gandini", "profile_url": "https://hud.academia.edu/FrancescaGandini?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32927803/9794651/13166899/s65_francesca.gandini.jpg"}, {"id": 7097161, "first_name": "Maru", "last_name": "Mormina", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MaruMormina", "display_name": "Maru Mormina", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MaruMormina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7097161/2671534/20271909/s65_maru.mormina.jpg"}, {"id": 2639030, "first_name": "Joyce", "last_name": "White", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "JoyceWhite", "display_name": "Joyce White", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/JoyceWhite?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21967, "name": "Ancient DNA (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_DNA_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25712, "name": "Ancient DNA Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_DNA_Research?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63093, "name": "Mitochondrial DNA", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mitochondrial_DNA?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19875754, "title": "Differentiating Khmer Stoneware Production: An NAA Pilot Study from Siem Reap Province, Cambodia", "created_at": "2015-12-28T15:33:47.067-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19875754/Differentiating_Khmer_Stoneware_Production_An_NAA_Pilot_Study_from_Siem_Reap_Province_Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_19875754", "summary": "We report analytical results for stoneware samples from four excavated Angkor-period kilns in the Greater Angkor area.

Within the context of debates about the population history of Island South-East Asia (ISEA), the Kalimantan region remains poorly documented and understood. When authors mention this region it is usually with regard\r\nto its strategic location facing the Wallace line on the edge of Sundaland, as a gateway from Sunda to Sahul during the late Pleistocene period, or as part of models of the diffusion of the Neolithic cultural complex from Taiwan and the Philippines and the Malay Peninsula. Such dis-\r\ncussions lead us to expect that archaeological investigation of Kalimantan will provide new data that may lead to the reappraisal of the role of this region during Holocene prehistory and the associated cultural and population diffusion processes. Archaeological research in the Liang Abu rock shelter (East Kalimantan) led to the discovery and analysis of a pottery assemblage including red-slipped, cord-marked and incised pottery sherds, radiocarbon dated to 1672\u00b121 BP and 1524\u00b122 BP. In order to discuss our findings we undertake a reappraisal of the pottery material and associated radiocarbon dates from archaeological sites on Borneo Island, which provide us with an appropriate framework for a comparative analysis. This allows us to to include the inland region of Kalimantan in the technological network of Neolithic Island South East Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34934870, "asset_id": 8562687, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 941780, "first_name": "S\u00e9bastien", "last_name": "Plutniak", "domain_name": "univ-tours", "page_name": "S\u00e9bastienPlutniak", "display_name": "S\u00e9bastien Plutniak", "profile_url": "https://univ-tours.academia.edu/S%C3%A9bastienPlutniak?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/941780/460838/28300395/s65_s_bastien.plutniak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2213, "name": "Pottery (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2786, "name": "Ceramic Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Technology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 16007, "name": "Ceramic Analysis (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 28829, "name": "Indonesia (Area Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia_Area_Studies_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30543, "name": "Pacific Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 55424, "name": "Kalimantan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kalimantan?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 86259, "name": "Pottery technology and function", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_technology_and_function?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 115671, "name": "Pottery studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 136543, "name": "Red slip ware", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Red_slip_ware?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 238443, "name": "Austronesian Prehistory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Prehistory?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 615585, "name": "Borneo Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 981734, "name": "Kalimantan Timur", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kalimantan_Timur?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1411213, "name": "Kutai Balikpapan Kalimantan Timur", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kutai_Balikpapan_Kalimantan_Timur?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 919297, "title": "On the origin of pre-Angkorian peoples: perspectives from cranial and dental affinity of the human remains from Iron Age Phum Snay, Cambodia", "created_at": "2011-09-15T09:08:16.410-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/919297/On_the_origin_of_pre_Angkorian_peoples_perspectives_from_cranial_and_dental_affinity_of_the_human_remains_from_Iron_Age_Phum_Snay_Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_919297", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39363070, "asset_id": 919297, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 348055, "first_name": "Dougald", "last_name": "O'Reilly", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DougaldOReilly", "display_name": "Dougald O'Reilly", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DougaldOReilly?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/348055/94305/569254/s65_dougald.o_reilly.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2044377, "title": "Halcrow, S.

Empire was at its peak from the 10th to 13th centuries CE. It wielded great influence across mainland Southeast Asia and is now one of the most archaeologically visible polities due to its expansive religious building works. This paper presents archaeobotanical evidence from two of the most renowned Angkorian temples largely associated with kings and elites, Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm. But it focuses on the people that dwelt within the temple enclosures, some of whom were involved in the daily functions of the temple. Archaeological work indicates that temple enclosures were areas of habitation within the Angkorian urban core and the temples and their enclosures were ritual, political, social, and economic landscapes. This paper provides the first attempt to reconstruct some aspects of the lives of the non-elites living within the temple enclosures by examining the archaeobotanical evidence, both macroremains and phytoliths, from residential contexts and data derived from inscriptions and Zhou Daguan's historical account dating to the 13th century CE. Research indicates that plants found within the temple enclosure of Ta Prohm and Angkor Wat were grown for ritual or medicinal use, and also formed important components of the diet and household economy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64408511, "asset_id": 44065118, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28295, "first_name": "Dorian", "last_name": "Fuller", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "DorianFuller", "display_name": "Dorian Fuller", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/DorianFuller?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28295/9222/222915/s65_dorian.fuller.jpg"}, {"id": 82992, "first_name": "Piphal", "last_name": "Heng", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "PiphalHeng", "display_name": "Piphal Heng", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/PiphalHeng?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82992/46320759/35831157/s65_piphal.heng.png"}, {"id": 3208380, "first_name": "Cristina", "last_name": "Castillo", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "CristinaCastillo", "display_name": "Cristina Castillo", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/CristinaCastillo?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3208380/1055062/2048413/s65_cristina.castillo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1742, "name": "Archaeobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeobotany?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37520340, "title": "Thinking Outside the \u201cPot.\u201d The Cha\u00eene Op\u00e9ratoire of Prehistoric Ceramics in Northwest Cambodia", "created_at": "2018-10-02T23:04:38.132-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37520340/Thinking_Outside_the_Pot_The_Cha%C3%AEne_Op%C3%A9ratoire_of_Prehistoric_Ceramics_in_Northwest_Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37520340", "summary": "As an ubiquitous artefact-class that is abundantly present and well-preserved across most archaeological sites in Southeast Asia, ceramics are among the most important sources of information in the study of social-political organization and evolution of prehistoric societies within the region. From the production of utilitarian cooking pots and storage containers to elaborately-fashioned mortuary and ritual vessels, ceramic artefacts are well-represented in prehistoric political economies as in their wide distribution and consumption across all levels of prehistoric society. Intricate decorations on these artefacts can also provide a glimpse into the artistic and ritualistic aspects of social life in the ideological sphere of the prehistoric society in question.\n\nTo this end, this paper presents the results of the analysis of 84 ceramic vessels across 44 individual burials at the Iron Age sites of Phum Sophy (cal. AD 87-526), Phum Lovea (cal. 3 BC-AD 571) and Prei Khmeng (cal. AD 23-623) as well as over 7000 ceramic vessel fragments and sherds from non-burial contexts (O'Reilly and Shewan 2015; O'Reilly et al. 2015; O'Reilly et al. 2014). Ceramic typologies and varieties are established based their respective cha\u00eenes op\u00e9ratoires as observed from both macroscopic morphological and decorative features as well as microscopic fabric characteristics through thin-section petrography. Thereafter, the intra-site distribution and variation patterns of these ceramic typologies are analysed \u2013 in relation to their associated artefact assemblage and bioanthropological data within their respective burial contexts \u2013 to reconstruct and understand the social dynamics involved in the production, consumption and eventual deposition of these artefacts. A comparison of these patterns with those established using 89 ceramic vessels from 71 individual burial contexts across two mortuary phases (MP 1 & 2) at the contemporaneous Iron Age site of Non Ban Jak (c. AD 220-820) (Heath 2016; Higham et al. 2014) in northeast Thailand is also made for an inter-regional perspective. In doing so, this paper not only seeks to establish emic and nuanced Iron Age ceramic typologies for northwest Cambodia, but also highlight the importance of ceramic artefacts in the study of social complexity in Southeast Asian prehistory.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57493271, "asset_id": 37520340, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 371409, "first_name": "Tse Siang", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "TseSiangLim", "display_name": "Tse Siang Lim", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/TseSiangLim?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/371409/99250/34186667/s65_tse_siang.lim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37313083, "title": "Portable X-ray fluorescence analysis of ceramic covered boxes from the 12th/13th-century Java Sea Shipwreck: A preliminary investigation", "created_at": "2018-08-29T14:25:56.479-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37313083/Portable_X_ray_fluorescence_analysis_of_ceramic_covered_boxes_from_the_12th_13th_century_Java_Sea_Shipwreck_A_preliminary_investigation?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37313083", "summary": "Forty-one ceramic boxes from the twelfth- or thirteenth-century Java Sea Shipwreck were analyzed at the Elemental Analysis Facility at Chicago's Field Museum using nondestructive portable x-ray fluorescence (PXRF).\nTwenty-two samples have a qingbai-type glaze and nineteen are painted ware with painted black decorations originally covered by a lead-based green glaze.

The term homo pictor refers to the cultural anthropological dimension and the fundamental importance of the relationship between images and humans. It is not by accident, then, that analysis and interpretation of images are of great significance in the archaeological disciplines. Many material remains of past cultures carry images or pictorial elements that are invaluable in the interpretation of these cultures. Correspondingly, there is a broad spectrum of analytical methods that are employed to answer a variety of questions. While some of these methods of image analysis have their conceptual foundation in art history, others have been developed autonomously within the field of archaeology and without reference to interdisciplinary discourses. A consistent theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic conceptualisation of a discipline-specific or historic study of images in archaeology has not yet been articulated. Since the pictorial and the iconic turn there has been a vast trans-and interdisciplinary research on images and their perception under the categories of image science (Bildwissenschaften) and visual culture studies. The conference seeks to explore whether and how these contemporary developments can contribute to theories of the image and methods of image analysis within archaeology. Reciprocally, it will also be asked in what ways archaeology \u2013 due to its large material corpora and long scholarly tradition \u2013 could make a considerably larger contribution to the fields of image and visual culture studies than acknowledged to date \u2013 especially as the object of its research reaches back to the origins of humans and images and their relationship.",

"summary": "The Anyathian culture, one of the prominent stone artefact traditions in Mainland Southeast Asia spanning the Pleistocene and Holocene, has been frequently described at archaeological sites in the central belt of Myanmar. Human exploitative patterns of plant and animal resources relating to the Anyathian are obscure due to the paucity of systematic stratigraphic excavations in Myanmar. However, recent research in the States of Shan and Kayin has shown that Myanmar has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of human subsistence economies at hunter-gatherer sites throughout the Pleistocene and Holocene.

Berdasarkan alasan arsitektural, kami menarik kesimpulan bahwa candi itu adalah bangunan berlatar belakang Sivaisme. Konon, batu-batu tabung itu rupanya diletakkan di dalam alas candi dan menutupi peripih-peripih yang dibuat selama candi dibangun, berkaitan dengan persiapan ritual tata letak candi. Meskipun benda yang persis sama belum pernah ditemukan di Jawa selama ini, artefak berbentuk lain dengan fungsi ritual yang sama dapat dikenali di beberapa situs yang kurang lebih semasa di daerah yang sama.

These sites can be used as an evidence of the existence of an upriver-downriver economical interaction.  The discovery of these two river jetties may affirm the complexity of the Site of Sungai Batu not only  as a centre for religious and production activities, but also the exchange of commodity, namely the iron based trade. This paper discusses the result of preliminary research done on those two sites, in terms of forms and its functions, and  relation to the history of Sungai Batu.

"The study of flaked stone assemblages from Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands has contributed little to the understanding of the region\u2019s prehistory.  The primary reason for this is that few formally shaped stone tool types have been identified from the region.  Archaeologists commonly describe these excavated stone artefact assemblages as \u2018amorphous\u2019, \u2018opportunistic\u2019 or \u2018monotonous and unimaginative\u2019.\r\n\r\nTo overcome the interpretive problems posed by these assemblages, Johan Kamminga conducted an extensive experimental program of stone tool-use in the Philippines.  This provided a reference collection of stone tools, with use-wear patterns and residues from a wide range of activities, relevant to both prehistoric hunter-gatherer and farming peoples from the region.  These activities include working bamboo, rattan, pandanus and reed, in addition to more complex functions including the manufacture of multi-component bows and arrows.  Rice harvesting was also investigated, including upland and paddy varieties.\r\n\r\nThe wear patterns associated with these activities are studied by the author using microscopic analysis, including low-power optical and scanning electron microscopy.  A preliminary investigation of residues is also conducted.  The results of the experimental program and preliminary microscopic study are then applied to a collection of archaeological stone tools from caves in East Timor, excavated by Ian Glover in 1966-7.  This analysis identifies a number of \u2018glossed flakes\u2019 as rattan processing tools, which formed a major component of the cave assemblages for over 10,000 years, until the introduction of metal.  Other activities are also identified, such as working wood and possibly bamboo.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these results with previous reports, demonstrates that rattan processing was probably also an important activity at Leang Burung in Sulawesi.  The importance of this activity to different prehistoric peoples, over great distances in time and space, attests to the overall utility of rattan as a manufacturing material.  The utility of rattan and bamboo, and their demonstrated ability to be successfully worked with a simple, non-standardised stone technology, can account for the apparent \u2018amorphous\u2019 nature of assemblages from the region.  Moreover, the results of this research demonstrate that the lack of formal shaping need no longer be an obstacle to the study of Southeast Asian \u2013 Pacific Island stone tools, as functional analysis can overcome the interpretive problems this may otherwise pose.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76770845, "asset_id": 64991229, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 210085801, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Davenport", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DanielDavenport7", "display_name": "Daniel R .

This article introduces Cambodian archaeological heritage management and its relationships to cultural tourism and economic development. Understanding Cambodian heritage management requires familiarity with UNESCO World Heritage designations which drive many developments in the country. Two primary areas of concern for both community archaeology and more top-down approaches are: (1) the challenges of working between multiple and competing stakeholder agendas, in which local community voices are rarely heard; and (2) the impact of specific management decisions on local communities.

Using a mixed method approach combining morphometric analyses, cluster analysis, mortality profiles, and body part representation, dogs are confidentially determined to be domesticated, and pigs are argued to represent an early management strategy. Direct 14C dating on select pig and dog elements provide the current earliest date for these domesticated animals in northern Vietnam and reflects the early expansion of farming communities into Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61378784, "asset_id": 41126200, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 326511, "first_name": "Rebecca", "last_name": "Jones", "domain_name": "australianmuseum", "page_name": "RebeccaJones", "display_name": "Rebecca K Jones", "profile_url": "https://australianmuseum.academia.edu/RebeccaJones?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/326511/136412/32600789/s65_rebecca.jones.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 142522, "name": "Domestication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestication?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38640811, "title": "Preliminary Study on Shiwan Kilns Stamped Storage Jars in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.

Southeast Asians transformed their physical and social environments further through their participation in international maritime trade networks. Early state formation characterized much of the mainland by the mid-first millennium C.E. We examined a protohistoric (200 B.C.E.\u2013200 C.E.) skeletal sample from the Vat Komnou cemetery at Angkor Borei in the Mekong Delta (southern Cambodia) to understand the health impacts of this changing environment. Degenerative joint disease patterns indicate a distinct sexual division of labor. Although intentional dental filing was practiced, its impact on oral-dental health could not be determined. Dental pathologies suggest a mixed diet with more fibrous foods and a lower reliance on soft, processed agricultural foods.

We examined a protohistoric (200 B.C.E. to 200 C.E.) skeletal sample from the Vat Komnou cemetery at Angkor Borei in the Mekong Delta (southern Cambodia) to understand the health impacts of this changing environment. Degenerative joint disease patterns indicate a distinct sexual division of labor. Although intentional dental filing was practiced, its impact on oral-dental health could not be determined. Dental pathologies suggest a mixed diet with more fibrous foods and a lower reliance on soft, processed agricultural foods.

Ongoing archaeological investigations at Bubog 1 Rockshelter on Ilin Island and Ille Cave & Rockshelter in northern Palawan, delivered obsidian artefacts, found in Terminal Pleistocene and Early Holocene layers. PXRF analysis of the obsidian samples from Mindoro and Palawan shows that they were coming from the same, yet unknown source.

In Iron Age Taiwan, its presence dates back to the early 1 st millennium AD. This research discusses m-Na-Al glass beads excavated from Iron Age sites in Taiwan. No production sites for m-Na-Al have been found, but microstructural analysis suggests m-Na-Al glass appears to originate around South Asia and is exchanged widely. SEM-EDS and EPMA were used to analyse red, orange, yellow, green and blue m-Na-Al glass. The microstructure of the glass shows the presence of plagioclase and alkali feldspar relics in the glass, suggesting a low manufacturing temperature. Copper-based colourants are identified in red, orange, blue and green glass, while lead tin oxide is used in yellow and green glass. It appears that various types of copper-containing raw materials were procured by craftspeople, and a self-reduction process for producing red and orange glass is tentatively proposed. Additionally, the microstructure of yellow glass reveals different colouring paths were used. These results increase our understanding of the selection of raw materials, and provide an impetus for further research on the cross craft interaction between glass and copper production.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80901683, "asset_id": 71646043, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2087773, "first_name": "Kuan-Wen", "last_name": "Wang", "domain_name": "sinica", "page_name": "KuanWenWang", "display_name": "Kuan-Wen  Wang", "profile_url": "https://sinica.academia.edu/KuanWenWang?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2087773/681607/38490118/s65_kuan-wen.wang.jpg"}, {"id": 1594169, "first_name": "Caroline", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "sheffield", "page_name": "CarolineJackson", "display_name": "Caroline Jackson", "profile_url": "https://sheffield.academia.edu/CarolineJackson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1594169/3519566/4132630/s65_caroline.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3316, "name": "Archaeological Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Science?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22018, "name": "Glass (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24522, "name": "Archaeometallurgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeometallurgy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41438, "name": "Ancient Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 88735, "name": "Ancient Glass Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 90415, "name": "Taiwan Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94753, "name": "Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 270775, "name": "Ancient Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 737477, "name": "Glass and Beads Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_and_Beads_Technology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1313100, "name": "Early Copper Metallurgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Copper_Metallurgy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1771346, "name": "Archaeological Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Glass?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 44805827, "title": "Excavating Southeast Asia's prehistory in the Cold War: American archaeology in neocolonial Thailand [Thai Version]", "created_at": "2020-12-31T00:15:07.624-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44805827/Excavating_Southeast_Asias_prehistory_in_the_Cold_War_American_archaeology_in_neocolonial_Thailand_Thai_Version_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_44805827", "summary": "Translated by Kriangsak Chetpatanavanich.

It appears in many medieval Chinese chronicles and encyclopedias. Contemporary Cambodia and Vietnam share its memory as one of their ancient powerful states; for the Cambodians, Funan is their first true empire. Funan emerged on the ancient trade sea routes along the coastlines of South Vietnam and Cambodia and the Gulf of Siam. The rulers of Funan claimed and sometimes conquered the enclaves around the Gulf of Siam as well as in the inferiors of Indochina. The culture of Funan bears many traits of Indian or Indic influence. The scholarship of the early twentieth century viewed the reasons of this influence in a large-scale Indian colonization of Southeast Asia. The main proponent of this theory was the Indian historian Ramesh Chandra Majumdar. When Southeast Asian nations gained independence, the colonization theory was no longer tenable. The scholars of the early twentieth century, Majumdar and George C\u0153d\u00e8s among them, treated Funan as a full-fledged state. But later, in the last third of the century, Claude Jacques and Michael Vickery argued that Funan was at its best chiefdom or a conglomerate of chiefdoms. My paper aims at examining the Chinese chronicles to answer whether Funan was a state or not. Another point is to establish the stages of Indian or Indic influences in the Funan culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61898201, "asset_id": 41742197, "asset_type": "Work",

volume explores the rich world of portable art in the Asia-Pacific, from the earliest examples of beads and other ornaments made by Pleistocene hunter-gatherers in Australia and Southeast Asia to the staggering diversity of small carved objects and related artworks from the recent past and ethnographic present of Oceania. The book provides an important compilation of the many discoveries of portable art made at archaeological sites across this vast region. It also presents a stimulating discussion of what portable art is and what it means from a uniquely Australasian perspective, as well as from the viewpoint of those interested in the origin of art and the evolutionary history of our species.\"-Adam Brumm, Griffith University, Australia Readers undertaking tertiary archaeology courses interested in the art of the Asia-Pacific region or human behavioural evolution, along with anyone who is fascinated by the development of our modern ability to decorate ourselves and our world, should find this book a good addition to their library. 20% Discount Available-enter the code FLR40 at checkout* Hb: 978-1-138-23776-6 | $193.60 * Offer cannot be used in conjunction with any other offer or discount and only applies to books purchased directly via our website.

Two of these artefacts come from contexts dating to between 38,000 and 42,000 cal. BP (calibrated years before present), and exhibit manufacturing traces (drilling, pressure flaking, grinding), as well as red colourant staining. Through describing more complete Nautilus shell ornaments from younger levels from this same site (>15,900, 9500, and 5000 cal. BP), we demonstrate that those dating to the initial occupation period of Jerimalai are of anthropogenic origin. The identification of such early shell working examples of pelagic shell in Island Southeast Asia not only adds to our growing under- standing of the importance of marine resources to the earliest modern human communities in this re- gion, but also indicates that a remarkably enduring shell working tradition was enacted in this area of the globe. Additionally, these artefacts provide the first material culture evidence that the inhabitants of Jerimalai were not only exploiting coastal resources for their nutritional requirements, but also incor- porating these materials into their social technologies, and by extension, their social systems. In other words, we argue that the people of Jerimalai were already practicing a developed coastal adaptation by at least 42,000 cal.

Arguments that western Europe was the locus for the development of artistic expression are evaluated and challenged in the light of the dates obtained for Maros cave. The weight of evidence now points to the widespread presence of parietal art across the Eurasian continent from c.40,000 BP, the ultimate origin of which may lie in the African continent c.60,000 BP. This contradicts the Eurocentric notion that a creative explosion took place uniquely in western Europe c.40,000, leading to the establishment of human culture. A further consequence of the dating evidence from Maros cave is to undermine the theory that Neanderthals were the creator of the earliest cave art. As the distribution of Neanderthals was limited to Europe they cannot be relied upon to explain paintings in Asia, which either predate or are contemporary with those found in Europe.\r\n\r\nKEYWORDS\r\nPLEISTOCENE, UPPER PALAEOLITHIC, ORIGINS OF ART, PARIETAL ART, CAVE ART, MAROS CAVE, LASCAUX CAVE, PECH MERLE CAVE, CHAUVET CAVE, ALTAMIRA CAVE, EL CASTILLO CAVE,

individual recovered from a discrete archaeological context and dating to the Early Holocene from Ille Site, Palawan, Philippines provided a unique opportunity to utilize anthropogenic bone modifications to reconstruct the postmortem history of the body prior to its deposition. Aside from being burnt, the remains were found to exhibit a combination of cutmarks, scrape marks and impact scars indicative of disarticulation, defleshing, and hammerstone percussion. The results clearly demonstrate complex ritualistic treatment of the body prior to interment that, so far, has not been recorded in Southeast Asia. This thus adds to a growing data of varying burial traditions during the early Holocene across the region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31616906, "asset_id": 3705412, "asset_type": "Work",

"summary": "Fine art objects are often described as representative of certain craft or artistic traditions. In the case of Thai bronze Buddha images, art historical scholarship suggests that new styles often emerged from combinations of older styles transmitted between craft specialists. This process of transmission with modification is a key attribute of Darwinian evolutionary processes and suggests that lineages of artistic traditions such as Buddha images may be fruitfully investigated using quantitative evolutionary methods. The dominant method for reconstructing evolutionary lineages is cladistics. A cladistic analysis of 42 well-provenanced images in the Griswold collection is presented here to evaluate the usefulness of this approach. Six statistical tests are employed to determine if historical lineages can be reliably reconstructed using cladistic methods. All tests support the robustness of the results of the cladistic analysis. Quantitative evolutionary methods are concluded to be suitable and useful for understanding the evolution of craft traditions such as Thai bronze Buddha images.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 23230295, "asset_id": 1773421, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31304, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Marwick", "domain_name": "washington", "page_name": "BenMarwick", "display_name": "Ben Marwick", "profile_url": "https://washington.academia.edu/BenMarwick?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31304/81731/89593/s65_ben.marwick.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4207, "name": "Phylogenetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phylogenetics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26719, "name": "Cladistics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cladistics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 32621, "name": "Religious art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 50215, "name": "Computer Applications & Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Applications_and_Quantitative_Methods_in_Archaeology_CAA_?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 404692, "title": "Recent Research on Iron Age Glass and Stone Beads from Promtin Tai, Central Thailand", "created_at": "2011-01-06T13:33:24.876-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/404692/Recent_Research_on_Iron_Age_Glass_and_Stone_Beads_from_Promtin_Tai_Central_Thailand?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_404692", "summary": "In Thai. English Abstract: \r\n\r\nPromtin Tai is an Iron Age and Early Historic period site located in Lopburi province Thailand. Recent excavations by Dr. Thanik Lertcharnrit and Silpakorn University have uncovered Iron Age burials with ceramics, bronze and iron artifacts, and stone and glass beads. Almost 1000 glass beads and artifacts were found during the 2007 field season and twenty-three glass beads were selected for additional compositional analysis using Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois.  Most of the beads were small annular or globular monochromatic glass beads commonly described as Indo-Pacific beads. Results indicate that many of the glass beads found in burials were made from potash glass and mineral soda glass with variable amounts of alumina and lime. A smaller quantity of beads were made from high-alumina soda glass. In addition to Indo-Pacific beads, there were also more unusual bead types including glass beads that were made to imitate agate or onyx stone beads, gold-glass beads, and faience beads. The glass bead evidence from Promtin Tai highlights its importance as a transitional site from the late prehistoric into the Early Historic period. The diversity of glass beads and glass types found at the site underscore its connectedness to multiple trade networks.\r\n\tThe stone beads at Promtin Tai are made from a variety of materials including agate, carnelian, as well as greenstone beads that may have been made from nephrite. The greenstone beads come in a variety of shapes and sizes, including bead shapes that we do not find in agate or carnelian. The origin of the nephrite beads is still unknown, however there are similar beads at other sites in Central Thailand.  The origin of the agate and carnelian beads has also been the source of much speculation.  Some of the agate and carenlian beads at Promtin Tai look similar in style and manufacturing method, specifically the drilling technique, to those found during the same time period in South Asia.  However other scholars have wondered if some of these beads were made in Southeast Asia (e.g. Theunissen et al. 2000).  Investigation of this question is ongoing, using LA-ICP-MS to analyze both stone beads and geological sources from across South and Southeast Asia. Preliminary results show that most of the beads from Promtin Tai are compositionally consistent with the Indian agate sources. This strongly indicates that the beads were being imported from South Asia, and not being made in Thailand. However there are a few beads that do appear to be compositionally distinct from the Indian sources. The meaning of these distinct beads is still unclear, however future research should help determine if some stone beads were being manufactured in Southeast Asia.   \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 1915939, "asset_id": 404692, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17869, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "AlisonCarter", "display_name": "Alison K Carter", "profile_url": "https://uoregon.academia.edu/AlisonCarter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17869/5981/19917901/s65_alison.carter.jpg"}, {"id": 574554, "first_name": "Thanik (formerly Sawang)", "last_name": "Lertcharnrit (formerly Lertrit)", "domain_name": "su-th", "page_name": "ThanikLertcharnrit", "display_name": "Thanik (formerly Sawang) Lertcharnrit (formerly Lertrit)", "profile_url": "https://su-th.academia.edu/ThanikLertcharnrit?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/574554/204732/238927/s65_thanik.lertcharnrit.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 82085910, "title": "Diachronic modeling of the population within the medieval Greater Angkor Region settlement complex", "created_at": "2022-06-22T19:01:03.120-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82085910/Diachronic_modeling_of_the_population_within_the_medieval_Greater_Angkor_Region_settlement_complex?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_82085910", "summary": "The Greater Angkor Region was home to approximately 700,000 to 900,000 inhabitants at its apogee in the 13th century CE.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87903987, "asset_id": 82085910, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 82992, "first_name": "Piphal", "last_name": "Heng", "domain_name": "ucla", "page_name": "PiphalHeng", "display_name": "Piphal Heng", "profile_url": "https://ucla.academia.edu/PiphalHeng?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82992/46320759/35831157/s65_piphal.heng.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 130, "name": "Ancient History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310, "name": "Demography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Demography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4808, "name": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Planning?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6779, "name": "Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 21310, "name": "Urbanization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 79986, "name": "Spatial demography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_demography?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 96816, "name": "Greater Mekong Sub Region and Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greater_Mekong_Sub_Region_and_Japan?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 82085849, "title": "Centralized power/decentralized production?

In 2017 The French Archaeological Mission in Peninsular Thailand carried out an excavation at Wang Duan, near Prachuap Khiri Kan on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand, in order to start to fill this gap and to investigate coastal groups in the upper part of the TMP. The aim of the investigation was to study the evolution of coastal groups in relation to their involvement in exchange networks both along and across the TMP. The investigations identified traces of coastal and estuarine occupation characterized by ceramics of slightly different types and by the notable absence of human or animal bones. Occupation of these scattered sites took place during a prehistoric period that roughly corresponds to the early and late Neolithic period (corresponding elsewhere in Mainland Southeast Asia to the Bronze Age). The evolution of the ceramics and parallels with other assemblages in Thailand suggest contact during the first part of the first millennium BCE, and engagement in regional networks.

How and why behaviors, beliefs, and ideas are learned and shared among a group of people and transmit- ted from one generation to the next lies at the heart \r\nof our discipline. It is foundational to the understanding of cultural persistence and change. What factors influence people to perpetuate or deviate from the behaviors of other group members? How are social group boundaries pro- duced, maintained, and changed by the cumulative outcome of these decisions? Archaeologists are well positioned to study the material consequences of these processes. Indeed, archaeological research in many domains\u2014including style, artifact distributional patterning, and chronology construction\u2014depends on understanding the mechanisms and \r\nmanifestations of cultural transmission. Therefore, three key avenues of research\u2014the socially organized nature of learning, cultural transmission, and cultural boundaries\u2014form the basis of this volume. The boundaries we describe, however, are not only those found within and between \r\nsocieties that we study (past and present); they are also found within and between communities of scholars who study them. Our dual goals are to identify salient issues that are germane to discrete (and sometimes opposed) research programs, and to offer new ethnographically-derived case studies that offer insights to scholars who employ a range of different intellectual paradigms.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38201105, "asset_id": 14091180, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

This archaeological site can be labeled as one among the Ban Chiang Cultural Tradition Sites. Standard methodology of physical anthropology was applied to the sample analyzed for this research. Attempt was paid for recording the metrical and non-metrical characteristics as well as traces of pathology existing, if any, on the remains. The comparison of the human skeletons from some Ban Chiang Cultural Tradition sites indicates that there are both the similarity in the common characteristics and the difference of some traits, while the comparison between ancient and modern NE Thais skeletal remains revealed the same result of human skeletons characters. The studies of the human skeletons also lead to some socio-cultural implications concerning the prehistoric population and cultures of the NE Thailand. For example, the present researcher is convinced that the prehistoric population of this site had settled continuously on the same location. The life expectancy of the new born cohort raised up from early to late periods. The pathological findings on the Ban Khok Khon skeletal specimens support the palaeodemography, dental and infracranial  pathologies, that the health of ancient population in this area are generally good.

Cambodia was an important urban center related to the early first millennium C.E. polity known as Funan. Excavations in the protohistoric period Vat Komnou Cemetery site uncovered over 1300 glass and stone beads, which are important material indicators of trade. In this article, we review data from earlier studies and add new previously unpublished data on glass and stone beads from this collection as well as previously unpublished glass compositional analyses from the nearby site of Oc Eo, Vietnam. Examinations of the glass beads highlight the presence of large quantities of high alumina mineral soda glass associated with Sri Lankan or South Indian bead production as well as smaller quantities of other glass types in circulation throughout Southeast Asia. Compositional and morphological studies of agate/carnelian beads show strong affinities with the Indian bead industry, while the garnet beads came from raw material sources in southern India. Overall, Angkor Borei\u2019s bead collection shows strong contacts with different regions of South Asia. Comparison with the bead assemblages of other contemporaneous sites demonstrate strong affinities with sites farther inland, such as Phum Snay and Prei Khmeng, Cambodia and Ban Non Wat, Thailand rather than other maritime coastal sites in Southeast Asia. We argue that the stone and glass beads at Angkor Borei are related to intensified interaction with South Asia and that elites at Angkor Borei used these exotic prestige goods to build alliances with sites farther inland forming an intraregional exchange network we call the Mekong Interaction Sphere.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 50307, "name": "Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 82703, "name": "South China Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_China_Sea?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94753, "name": "Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 274081, "name": "Stone beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 520053, "name": "Asian Perspectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Perspectives?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 73456262, "title": "- Introduction_Khao Sam Kaeo_book_proofs", "created_at": "2022-03-10T01:52:02.566-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73456262/_Introduction_Khao_Sam_Kaeo_book_proofs?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_73456262", "summary": "Port-cities that developed with the Maritime Silk Roads can be regarded as active agents of what are now considered previous globalisations. This book is about Khao Sam Kaeo, one of those nodes which emerged along the eastern coast of the Thai-Malay Peninsula when Southeast Asia integrated the maritime Silk Roads (see general Map 1 peninsula). Its excavation from 2005 to 2009 (see general Map 2 site) and the multidisciplinary research conducted on its materials, shed light on what I argue to be the earliest port-city identified so far in the South China Sea, which has also been a seat for many cultural experimentations. This enclosed settlement, the earliest identified so far in this maritime basin, whose cosmopolitan configuration is reflected both by its urbanism and industries, thrived from the 4th to the 1st c. BC. It developed at a time when circumnavigation around the Peninsula was probably not yet taking place and transisthmian routes in this part of the Kra Isthmus were predominantly used, passing through series of river valleys, linking the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea. At the exit of transpeninsular routes, this node hosted foreign communities, staying within quarters materialised by embankments, received commodities and cultural elements; it also produced hybrid cultural products that were redistributed from one basin to the other, thus contributing to the cultural process. Khao Sam Kaeo prefigured some of the pre-modern trading societies and their entrep\u00f4ts such as the Malays in Srivijaya and in Melaka, the Acehenese in Aceh in Sumatra, the Makassarese and Makasar in Sulawesi and Sulu Sultanate of the Philippines. The multi-ethnic settlement of Khao Sam Kaeo hosted hybrid industries associating artisans, technologies and styles of various Asian horizons producing goods feeding different networks and serving different socio-political strategies of its actors. Some may correspond to a trans-ethnic South China Sea network culture shared by communities located along the fringe of the South China Sea. The elaboration of a shared cultural matrix results from an intensive as well as an extensive connectivity within the South China Sea, probably from the Neolithic. This cultural matrix was driven by shared common socio-political practices that perpetuated even when, evolving in time, it began to adapt foreign vocabulary coming from furtheraway \" lands\".

In this paper, we present the results of two field seasons of excavation at the temple site of Ta Prohm. Using LiDAR data to focus our excavations, we offer evidence for residential occupation within the temple enclosure from before the 11th century a.d. until the 14th century.

Understanding the relationship between documentary and archaeological sources has been among the most persistent of these challenges (e.g., Feinman 1997; Kepecs 1997; Stark and Allen 1998). Chapters in this volume use case studies across the Old World to offer original contributions and explore significant, if sometimes intractable issues. Kohl (chapter 10) directly asks whether archaeological and written sources are qualitatively distinct or complementary.

The earliest known archaeological evidence for which dates to the mid Warring States Period (481/403 BCE - 221 BC). This long history brings with it a steep tradition of Sino-Foreign maritime exchange; one which during the height of China\u2019s maritime power in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD), was dramatically altered by the expansionist foreign policy of Emperor Yong Le.  Like every Chinese ruler for more than 1,000 years, Yong Le aspired to incorporate Southeast Asian polities into a system of hierarchical and tributary relationships which centred on the Ming Court. This was simultaneously an exceptional yet traditional extension of Chinese military power, an unorthodox use of maritime resources within a very old structure, and one which had a significant impact on Southeast Asian shipbuilding.\n\nThis paper will explore the impact of Sino-Foreign maritime exchanges on Southeast Asian shipbuilding traditions in the Ming Dynasty and examine the interplay of local and interregional traditions with the technological innovation, hybridisation and transfer resulting from, the \u2018Southeast Asian Effect\u2019 on outsourced ship construction. This paper will further demonstrate that this created a complex developmental path dependence present in the maritime archaeological record, as evidenced by the Bukit Jakas, Phu Quoc and other shipwreck

This paper presents a multiscalar investigation that questions this assumption by reconceptualizing the relationships between glocal phenomena and settlement forms in ancient and Medieval Southeast Asia (100-1300 CE). Focusing on the Malay Peninsula, a part of the region thought to be most affected by global influences, this paper demonstrates that relationships between global trade and local settlement behaviours are not deterministic, offering an example of how multiscalar or glocal analyses can disrupt deterministic explanations of the archaeological record and enhance understanding of the interactions between the global and local scales of human activity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56912863, "asset_id": 36962818, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

circular, moated sites of Northeast Thailand are among the most readily distinguished archaeological features in prehistoric Southeast Asia via aerial survey. Seminal work analysing the distribution of these sites was undertaken by Moore, Welch and McNeill in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These studies sought to analyse spatial clustering and the relationship between elevation with site size and density. Recent research by the authors has led to the discovery of further moated sites in Northeast Thailand thereby potentially affecting the conclusions reached by Moore, Welch and McNeill. This paper revisits Moore's original nearest neighbor analysis, including newly identified sites. Moore had concluded there was a random distribution of moated sites in her study area but the updated research clearly demonstrates clustering of moated sites in the Khorat Basin. The elevation at which settlements are located is also revealed to be correlated to the size of the sites and the density of distribution of sites in the study area. The authors argue that these results may be due to the reduced availability of water at higher elevations a finding which correlates strongly with recent evidence which links patterns of precipitation to the distribution and density of sites on the Khorat Plateau. These findings may also have implications for the interpretation of socio-political organisation of Iron Age sites in Northeast Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54191190, "asset_id": 34285205, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33546492, "first_name": "Glen", "last_name": "Scott", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "GlenScott", "display_name": "Glen Scott", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/GlenScott?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33546492/9903755/11154195/s65_glen.scott.jpg"}, {"id": 348055, "first_name": "Dougald", "last_name": "O'Reilly", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DougaldOReilly", "display_name": "Dougald O'Reilly", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DougaldOReilly?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/348055/94305/569254/s65_dougald.o_reilly.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42197, "name": "Iron Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iron_Age?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 423974, "name": "Northeast Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Northeast_Thailand?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 32287298, "title": "Globalization at the Dawn of History: The emergence of global cultures in the Mekong and Red River Deltas", "created_at": "2017-04-05T20:34:09.281-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32287298/Globalization_at_the_Dawn_of_History_The_emergence_of_global_cultures_in_the_Mekong_and_Red_River_Deltas?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_32287298", "summary": "From: Carter, Alison Kyra, and Nam C.

external actors: Taiwan and Island Southeast Asia in the case of nephrite, and South Asia in the case of carnelian. Carnelian beads in particular have long been held as a type marker of early contact across the Bay of Bengal, from the mid-late 1st millennium BC. With this paper we demonstrate, from the central-northern Myanmar settlement and cemetery sites of Oakaie and Nyaung\u2019gan, not only the presence of semi-precious stone beads, but also their production during the Late Neolithic to Early-Mid Bronze Age, late 2nd millennium to early-mid 1st millennium BC. We employed the chaine operatoire technique to establish reliable links between the industrial and funerary evidence, as represented by 489 finished beads and a vast quantity of production debris. The sites in question are chronologically-overlapping and separated by only five kilometres, but such ornaments are found across the region and it is of fundamental importance to provide a solid foundation to expand semi-precious stone ornament studies and unravel the complex networks of social interactions that led to their exchange.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37322, "name": "Burmese/Myanmar history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burmese_Myanmar_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 70055, "name": "Ancient technologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_technologies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 534557, "name": "Ornament studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ornament_studies?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 75278732, "title": "Myanmar's earliest Maritime Silk Road port-settlements revealed", "created_at": "2022-04-02T22:29:36.357-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75278732/Myanmars_earliest_Maritime_Silk_Road_port_settlements_revealed?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_75278732", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83111857, "asset_id": 75278732, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37322, "name": "Burmese/Myanmar history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burmese_Myanmar_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40683, "name": "Antiquity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antiquity?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 270775, "name": "Ancient Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 444917, "name": "Chinese History /Han Dynasty/Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_History_Han_Dynasty_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 510080, "name": "Human Settlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Settlement?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 583951, "name": "Ancient Ports and Harbours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Ports_and_Harbours?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1807592, "name": "Archaeology of South China Sea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_South_China_Sea?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2981728, "name": "Myanmar Archaeological Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar_Archaeological_Studies?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 75278741, "title": "Southeast Asian Evidence for Early Maritime Silk Road Exchange and Trade-Related Polities", "created_at": "2022-04-02T22:29:37.624-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75278741/Southeast_Asian_Evidence_for_Early_Maritime_Silk_Road_Exchange_and_Trade_Related_Polities?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_75278741", "summary": "This chapter focuses on the recent shift in historical perspectives concerning the mid-first millennium exchanges between the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal and the subsequent new perspectives on the cultural evolution of this broad region.

research on glass along the Silk Road was the subject of an international conference within the scope of the \u00bbSino-German Project on Cultural Heritage Preservation\u00ab of the RGZM and the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology, hosted in December 2008 in Mainz. Since Antiquity the routes of the so-called Silk Road formed an important network for commercial, cultural and technological exchange. Far-reaching and criss-crossing the Asian continent they connected eastern and south-eastern parts of Asia to the Mediterranean world via both maritime and overland routes. Named after the lucrative silk trade, which developed during Han Dynasty, one tends to think of the Silk Road as a one-way road starting in China and ending at the Mediterranean. However, goods, technologies and ideas were travelling in both directions, and glass is an excellent example for a trade-good that arrived in the East from the West. The key developments of glass, which had its origins in the Middle and Near East, mainly took place in the Mediterranean and in the Arab World during Antiquity and Islamic times. Although known in the Far East since at least the Han Dynasty and treated as equivalent to precious stones, glass never played a significant role in Far Eastern cultures. Therefore glass finds from Far Eastern sites provide evidence for far-reaching trade relationships and imply cross-fertilization with other cultures. Thus the contributions to this conference dealt with a geographical area between Western Europe, the Balkans, the Near East, Central Asia, as well as Eastern and Southeastern Asia and covered a chronological range from 200 BC to AD 1000. The conference focused on the one hand on recent results of scientific analyses of glass and on the other hand on archaeological questions. The possibility of interdisciplinary research was one of the focal points of the conference and hence this volume, as well as questions on workshops, raw material, technology and trade. The international conference was considered to provide the participants with an insight beyond their own immediate concerns. By means of presenting studies of regionally specific glass forms and techniques as well as current methods and discoveries, even when not directly connected to the Silk Road, a broader perspective is offered.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140756513, "first_name": "Bettina", "last_name": "Zorn", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BettinaZorn", "display_name":

Forty-four glass artefacts from Jiuxianglan were analysed in this study, including beads and waste.  The results indicate that there is not a complete match of the chemical composition and the microstructure between the finished beads and waste; therefore local production of beads analysed here is not supported by the evidence at this site and the finished glass beads may have been imported from the South China Sea region.  Scientific analysis also revealed information on raw materials and the colouring process.  While the red and orange glass beads are both coloured by cuprite, the source of the copper-containing raw materials appears to vary.  The microstructure of orange and yellow glass beads from Jiuxianglan are also different from beads from other sites, suggesting different colouring raw materials or colouring processes.

In this paper, I explore the concepts of domestication and cultivation through\nAustralasian evidence, and comparatively with examples from other regions of the world, in order to illustrate the diversity of human relationships with their living and geological environment. I argue that the dependence upon food-producing strategies was the unintended result of a prolonged process, involving a series of conscious decisions by human agents. These decisions were almost surely consistent with the socio-economic context in which they were taken, and it is likely that they pursued the preservation of their former lifestyles rather than socio-cultural change.

remained unchanged for millennia. To explain these unique characteristics, some scholars offered what is called the \" bamboo hypothesis \" : if SE Asian stone tools are simple it would be because they were actually used to manufacture more complex implements made of bamboo. This hypothesis relies on a series of indirect evidence, among which the fact that use-traces occurring on the stone tools result from plant processing. These traces are often interpreted as due to bamboo working although in the absence of an adapted reference collection such a precise diagnosis is impossible to make. A fundamental question remains to be addressed: is it possible to distinguish the working of bamboo from the one of other plants based on the traces they produce? To answer this, we carried out several experiments, grounded on ethnoarchaeological observations, which involved 15 tropical plant taxa, including 3 bamboo genera and conducted microscopic use-wear analysis of the experimental tools. Our results show that the use-wear created by processing mature bamboo is well-developed and can be defined through a set of criteria. Altogether they distinguish bamboo wear from the one produced by other plants, although some overlapping exists. Our results can be used as a reference to which the traces on archaeological stone tools can be compared in order to determine whether they were really used to process bamboo and to what extent.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41836132, "asset_id": 21371841, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 648784, "first_name": "Alfred", "last_name": "Pawlik", "domain_name": "ateneo", "page_name": "AlfredPawlik", "display_name": "Alfred Pawlik", "profile_url": "https://ateneo.academia.edu/AlfredPawlik?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/648784/2790331/14706844/s65_alfred.pawlik.jpg"}, {"id": 671227, "first_name": "Hermine", "last_name": "Xhauflair", "domain_name": "csic", "page_name": "HermineXhauflair", "display_name": "Hermine Xhauflair", "profile_url": "https://csic.academia.edu/HermineXhauflair?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/671227/1764149/34750008/s65_hermine.xhauflair.jpg"}, {"id": 340791, "first_name": "Taj", "last_name": "Vitales", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "TajVitales", "display_name": "Taj Vitales", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/TajVitales?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/340791/2811402/3279855/s65_taj.vitales.jpg"}, {"id": 45352225, "first_name": "Dante", "last_name": "Manipon", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DanteManipon", "display_name": "Dante Manipon", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DanteManipon?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45352225/12148883/13531597/s65_dante.manipon.jpg"}, {"id": 20133557, "first_name": "Eusebio \"Bong\"", "last_name": "Dizon", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BongDizon", "display_name": "Eusebio \"Bong\"  Dizon", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BongDizon?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20133557/27012011/25445549/s65_eusebio_bong_.dizon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 395, "name": "Experimental Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15328, "name": "Use Wear Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Use_Wear_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36962, "name": "Tropical environments (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tropical_environments_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38032, "name": "Lithic Technology (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lithic_Technology_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 39890, "name": "Bamboo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bamboo?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41464, "name": "Traceology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traceology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 16313727, "title": "Evolution of the Hoabinhian Techno-Complex of Tam Hang Rock Shelter in Northeastern Laos.

An excavation report was quickly published in 1965 in Vietnamese language. One of the five discovered burials (No. 2) contained more than 100 offerings, mostly bronze objects, and belong to the richest equipped prehistorical graves in Southeast Asia. The remaining burials should have contained not a single offering. Therefore, this site was also seen as very impressive example for strong social differences during the early Dong Son culture in Northern Vietnam. A sample of the wooden coffin was radiocarbon dated in the 1970ies, and the result was one of the strongest arguments for the early beginning of the Dong Son culture around 500 BC or even earlier.\r\nThe author visited Viet Khe in 2013 and talked with eyewitnesses of the excavation in 1961. They told another, much more likely story from the discovery of these 5 burials, which were heavely looted before burial No. 2 was saved.\r\nBesides, some arguments are given for a younger date of this rich burial from  Viet Khe around the 2nd century BC.

ceramics. Little is known about the range of diverse food items, how they were prepared and consumed, and the importance these foods played in the social lives of people in the past. My research seeks to extend the treatment of food in Southeast Asia archaeology from subsistence \u201cstrategies\u201d to foodways by incorporating technofunctional and organic residue analyses of earthenware pottery vessels to address outstanding questions about their function with regard to the preparation and consumption of food. This paper presents preliminary findings on a range of prehistoric earthenware pottery excavated from R\u1ea1ch N\u00fai, An S\u01a1n (Neolithic), and G\u00f2 \u00d4 Ch\u00f9a (Metal Age) sites in Long An Province, Southern Vietnam. Results are compared with similar data from experimental and ethnographic pottery as well as integrated with complementary data associated with the archaeological pottery samples. It is predicted that integrative analysis of technofunctional aspects of earthenware pottery with organic residue analysis will provide new perspectives on the foodways in Southern Vietnam during the Neolithic and Metal Age.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37597360, "asset_id": 12324241, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158140, "first_name": "Michelle Sotaridona", "last_name": "Eusebio", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "MichelleSotaridonaEusebio", "display_name": "Michelle Sotaridona Eusebio", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/MichelleSotaridonaEusebio?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158140/94345/11127910/s65_michelle.eusebio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1740, "name": "Foodways (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foodways_Anthropology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2213, "name": "Pottery (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 28020, "name": "Residue Analysis (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residue_Analysis_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 28899, "name": "Residue and Use-Wear Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residue_and_Use-Wear_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 52254, "name": "Foodways", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foodways?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 158455, "name": "Vietnamese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 284519, "name": "Organic Residue Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Residue_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 612435, "name": "Organic Residues Analysis of Pottery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Residues_Analysis_of_Pottery?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 1120118, "title": "Pelagic Fishing at 42,000 Years Before the Present and the Maritime Skills of Modern Humans", "created_at": "2011-11-27T20:19:57.243-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1120118/Pelagic_Fishing_at_42_000_Years_Before_the_Present_and_the_Maritime_Skills_of_Modern_Humans?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_1120118", "summary": "By 50,000 years ago, it is clear that modern humans were capable of long-distance sea travel as they colonized Australia.

The history of dispersal across islands of SE Asia, and the role of Taiwan and the Austronesian expansion in this process remain largely unresolved. Here, we reconstructed the routes of dispersal of O. sativa ssp. japonica rice to Taiwan and the northern Philippines using whole-genome resequencing of indigenous rice landraces coupled with archaeological and paleoclimate data. Our results indicate that japonica rice found in the northern Philippines diverged from Indonesian landraces as early as 3,500 years before present (BP). In contrast, rice cultivated by the indigenous peoples of the Taiwanese mountains has complex origins. It comprises two distinct populations, each best explained as a result of admixture between temperate japonica that presumably came from northeast Asia, and tropical japonica from the northern

New, regionally-specific archaeological models are being developed, and biological anthropological research has an important role to play in establishing past human experience within these models. In the Indo-Pacific, research using ancient and modern human tissues is adding insight into global processes of prehistoric settlement and migrations, subsistence change and human biosocial adaptation. This review synthesises current themes in biological anthropology in this region.

A number of new trends, interpretations and sites are emerging. However, there remains a lack of clarity regarding the integration of settlements and cities into the history of the region.

The composition of Binjai Tamieng has a somewhat similar signature to sites from Southern Thailand and Peninsular Ma-laysia. Testudine and artiodactyl remains are predominant in the vertebrate assemblage, while other species such as crocodile and a small cetacean were probably opportunis-tically hunted or scavenged. Animal bone was probably also used for the manufacturing of tools. Javan-and possibly Sumatran rhinoceros are present on the site. A number of human remains show traces of disarticulation and may be indicative of complex funerary rituals or cannibalism .", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53614349, "asset_id": 33593629, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3902980, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Gruwier", "domain_name": "vub", "page_name": "BenGruwier", "display_name": "Ben Gruwier", "profile_url": "https://vub.academia.edu/BenGruwier?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3902980/1448333/1772120/s65_ben.gruwier.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4904, "name": "Archaeozoology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeozoology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33184518, "title": "Call for Papers: What\u2019s in Asian Museology?

This session seeks to explore the contemporary museum practices of Asia, responding to the call from MacDonald and Fyfe (1996) to retheorise museums in terms of their contexts, contests and contents. A recent study by Evans and Rowlands (2015) shows how \u2018universal\u2019 Western heritage values have been appropriated and renegotiated through local museum initiatives in China, highlighting the complexity and fluidity of these processes. These grounded realities suggest a pressing need for rethinking and reconceptualising the ideas of \u2018heritage\u2019 and \u2018the museum\u2019 in local contexts.

A total of 163 taxonomic classifications provide 29,842 identified specimens in this dataset. Using nestedness and squared chord distance metrics, results indicate that narrowing diet breadth and similar faunal composition is broadly characteristic of this region through time. A historical review of recording techniques indicates that while minimum number of individual (MNI) faunal quantification remained abundant during the twentieth century, number of identified specimen (NISP) quantification is more prevalent today. Synthesis of taxonomic composition suggests that Peninsular Malaysian sites have a higher abundance of wild boar (Suidae) in relation to Thailand sites that have a higher abundance of deer (Cervidae). Turtles and molluscs appear at almost every site in relative high occurrence and abundance. Future archaeozoological research should focus on standardizing quantification techniques, and providing fine-grained identification of turtle specimens to more accurately investigate shifting subsistence strategies, paleoenvironmental change, and seasonal occupation of sites throughout mainland Southeast Asia during the Pleistocene and Holocene.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38153438, "asset_id": 13895837, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3054011, "first_name": "Cyler", "last_name": "Conrad", "domain_name": "lanl", "page_name": "CylerConrad", "display_name": "Cyler Conrad", "profile_url": "https://lanl.academia.edu/CylerConrad?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3054011/1004114/19674279/s65_cyler.conrad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1624, "name": "Zooarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zooarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6482, "name": "Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Meta-Analysis_and_Systematic_Review?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 139308, "name": "Nestedness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nestedness?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 2411553, "title": "Hudson-2011-Buddha Images And Reliquaries From Bagan", "created_at": "2013-01-16T05:08:04.267-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2411553/Hudson_2011_Buddha_Images_And_Reliquaries_From_Bagan?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2411553", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30441187, "asset_id": 2411553, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29898, "first_name": "Bob", "last_name": "Hudson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "BobHudson", "display_name": "Bob Hudson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/BobHudson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29898/9726/16646622/s65_bob.hudson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7279, "name": "Bagan period (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bagan_period_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11564165, "title": "\u041d\u0430\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0411\u0445\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 I, \u0446\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0427\u0430\u043c\u043f\u044b: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439 // \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a. \u0410\u0444\u0440\u043e-\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c. 2011. \u2116 2. \u0421. 16\u201324.", "created_at": "2015-03-21T04:07:27.659-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11564165/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%B8_%D0%91%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_I_%D1%86%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8F_%D0%A7%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BF%D1%8B_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%B8_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%92%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D0%90%D1%84%D1%80%D0%BE_%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B8_%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C_2011_2_%D0%A1_16_24?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_11564165", "summary": "The Inscriptions of Bhadravarman I, King of Champa: A Translation into Russian with a Commentary', in Vostok (Oriens) 2011 No. 2, pp. 16\u201324.\nThe paper contains the first Russian translation of the Sanskrit inscriptions of Bhadravarman I who  was a king of one of Champa polities of Central Vietnam in the fifth century C.E.

of Cambodia&#39;s Angkor Wat temple in the last century. There has, however, been little research on the functions and internal organisation of the large rectangular enclosure surrounding the temple. Such enclosures have long been assumed to have been sacred precincts, or perhaps \u2018temple-cities\u2019: work exploring the archaeological patterning for habitation within them has been limited. The results of LiDAR survey and excavation have now revealed evidence for low-density residential occupation in these areas, possibly for those servicing the temple. Recent excavations within the enclosure challenge our traditional understanding of the social hierarchy of the Angkor Wat community and show that the temple precinct, bounded by moat and wall, may not have been exclusively the preserve of the wealthy or the priestly elite.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87903982, "asset_id": 82085896, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

rise of social inequality is a key development in human history and is linked to deteriorating health. These associated health impacts are poorly understood for Iron Age (420 B.C.\u2013A.D. 500) northeast Thailand. To clarify this issue we investigate whether social status differences influence non-specific stress at the site of Non Ban Jak (A.D. 300\u2013800), which comprises two separate burial mounds. These mounds are thought to represent the neighborhoods of two distinct social groups at the site. Quantitative analyses were used to explore differences in grave goods among the adults of Non Ban Jak (N = 47). Long bone lengths, ages at death, and linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) were examined to explore differences in non-specific stress on the basis of age, sex, burial mound, and mortuary phase. Results demonstrated that older adults of both sexes, males of all ages, and west mound individuals received greater grave good quantities and may therefore have been of higher social status.

There are valid concerns about whether it is appropriate to apply to other parts of the world a term originally coined in the second half of the nineteenth century within the classification systems being established then for European prehistory. However, despite alternative local terminologies being proposed (e.g. Bacus 2004; Soejono 1997), the term \u2018Neolithic\u2019 remains a convenient label for the first pottery-using societies in Island Southeast Asia.

We propose this site was part of historic Lamri, known from documentary sources as an important node in the maritime &amp;quot;silk road&amp;quot; between the 9th to 16th centuries ce. Our landscape archaeological survey revealed large concentrations of ceramics on the headland that span from the early 13th through the mid-16th century, some of them of imperial quality. Several of the Muslim grave markers at this site are of a distinctive type and date across nearly the entire range of the 15th century. Geological evidence suggests low-lying parts of Lamri were destroyed by a major tsunami at the end of the 14th century. However, our data show that activity on the elevated headland continued until the site was abandoned in the mid-16th century. The lack of material culture dating from the 9th to 13th centuries suggests that earlier textual references to Lamri referred more generally to a broad stretch of the north Sumatran coast, with the headland in Lamreh village emerging as the geographic centre of historic Lamri after the turn of the 13th century.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5979498, "first_name": "Edmund", "last_name": "Edwards McKinnon", "domain_name": "iseaslib", "page_name": "EdmundEdwardsMcKinnon", "display_name": "Edmund Edwards McKinnon", "profile_url": "https://iseaslib.academia.edu/EdmundEdwardsMcKinnon?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5979498/19045045/18995083/s65_edmund.edwards_mckinnon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1344, "name": "Islamic Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30723, "name": "Maritime Trade Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Trade_Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 93454, "name": "Acehnese history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acehnese_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 257992, "name": "Historical Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 993388, "name": "Acehnese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acehnese_Studies?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 44708668, "title": "Religion et pouvoir royal au L\u0101n X\u0101ng (XIVe - XVIe si\u00e8cles)", "created_at": "2020-12-15T03:45:25.092-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44708668/Religion_et_pouvoir_royal_au_L%C4%81n_X%C4%81ng_XIVe_XVIe_si%C3%A8cles_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_44708668", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65188475, "asset_id": 44708668, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18042891, "first_name": "Michel", "last_name": "Lorrillard", "domain_name": "efeo", "page_name": "michellorrillard", "display_name": "Michel Lorrillard", "profile_url": "https://efeo.academia.edu/michellorrillard?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18042891/5022687/8141872/s65_michel.lorrillard.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 376988, "name": "Lao Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lao_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 672224, "name": "Thai Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Buddhism?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1487747, "name": "History of Laos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Laos?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1880803, "name": "Manuscript Studies In Northern Thai and Lao Langage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Manuscript_Studies_In_Northern_Thai_and_Lao_Langage?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 40787763, "title": "Rethinking the Histories of Ports in Asia:  Beyond Cosmopolitanism, Metrocentricism, and Romanticization.

The romance of exotic encounters and long-distance seafaring evoked by ports, especially in Asia, dovetails with the agenda of global history, a discipline that recently emerged to prominence. Thus far, this new research seems to be fixated on the study of connections, exchanges, and networks in major ports, where the interaction of the local and global gave rise to cosmopolitan identities. Yet, there have been few attempts to tackle fundamental conceptual issues that plagued a previous generation of port scholarship: what are port cities, and how should they be studied? \nThe objective of this panel is to confront these questions by reconsidering the histories of ports in three distinct but interrelated ways. First, it delves into how \u201cport towns\u201d and \u201cport cities\u201d should be defined. Second, it stresses the need to consider how ports are embedded within hinterlands that play a role in determining their purpose and character. Finally, the panel draws attention to the need to broaden the scope of port scholarship to include non-metropolitan centres, especially in provincial or peripheral regions. \nThese conceptual issues have implications for the historical study of ports. What are power relations like between port and hinterland? What role do non-metropolitan ports play in a region dominated by metropolitan ports? Why do centres of power in maritime Asia often have major port functions? \nTo answer these questions, this panel draws from the disciplines of archaeology, economics, geography, and history. Phacharaphorn Phanomvan explores the definition of \u201ccoastal\u201d versus \u201cport\u201d cities through a long-run comparative analysis of cities historically associated with \u201ctrade\u201d in the eastern Bay of Bengal, from the fifth to the sixteenth century. Michael Leadbetter examines how material evidence changes prevailing archaeological and historical interpretations about the function of coastal settlements and their hinterlands across Southeast Asia between the seventh and seventeenth history. Michael Yeo considers the significance of Sandakan\u2014a small port in northern Borneo\u2014in facilitating the movement of people around its wider region from the late nineteenth century. Together, these papers provide new perspectives on the historical study of ports in and beyond Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61068995, "asset_id": 40787763, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2327, "name": "Transnational and World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_and_World_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 9437, "name": "Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 18888, "name": "Cities and globalization/Global cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cities_and_globalization_Global_cities?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25275, "name": "Indian Ocean World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_World?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 40761049, "title": "2002 (+ Nguy\u1ec5n Chi\u1ec1u and L\u00e2m Th\u1ecb M\u1ef9 Dung) Neue Entdeckungen zur Sa-Hu\u1ef3nh-Kultur: Das Gr\u00e4berfeld G\u00f2 M\u1ea3 V\u00f4i und das kulturelle Umfeld in Mittelvietnam = Nh\u1eefng ph\u00e1t hi\u1ec7n m\u1edbi v\u1ec1 v\u0103n h\u00f3a Sa Hu\u1ef3nh: Khu m\u1ed9 t\u00e1ng G\u00f2 M\u1ea3 V\u00f4i v\u00e0 v\u1ecb th\u1ebf v\u0103n h\u00f3a c\u1ee7a n\u00f3 \u1edf mi\u1ec1n Trung Vi\u1ec7t Nam.

Thereafter, the prevalence of social stratification and entrenched hierarchies appear to have intensified during the Iron Age (c. 500 BC \u2013 500 AD) with the rise of complex prehistoric chiefdoms vis-\u00e0-vis the expansion of Chinese influence into North Vietnam, as well as the emergence of a maritime trading network between China and the Mediterranean world through Southeast Asia and India. The rapid ascent of social-political ranking over a largely unstratified system of social organization in the Bronze Age paved the way for the rise of Funan, the earliest documented Southeast Asian polity, during the late Iron Age. By the 6th century AD, a network of walled cities, brick temples, extensive canals, a writing system, monumental architecture and statuary have already been in place on the Mekong Delta for a few centuries.\r\n\r\nThe proposed paper will examine and define the material processes underlying this important phase of intensified political development and social complexity by identifying and analysing variation and distribution patterns in the production and consumption of burial ceramics from three late Iron Age mortuary sites in Northwest Cambodia \u2013 Phum Sophy, Phum Lovea and Prei Khmeng \u2013 through the theoretical lens of the political economy. Patterns derived from these sites will be compared with those established from existing ceramic typologies at contemporaneous sites principally in Thailand, but also in consideration of other Iron Age sites in Mainland Southeast Asia for a regional perspective. In doing so, the proposed paper will attempt to establish a firm correlation between these patterns and differential social status in the milieu of increasing social complexity, thereby demonstrating the capacity and potential of archaeological ceramics in understanding the social dynamics and mechanisms involved in the evolution of complex societies in prehistory.\r\n\r\n*Presented at the 2nd SEAMEO SPAFA International Conference on Southeast Asian Archaeology, 30 May \u2013 2 June 2016, Amari Watergate Hotel, Bangkok, Thailand\r\n\r\n**Panel 2: Ceramic Production Technology and Trade Networks.

the phenomenon of cultural brokerage has existed throughout the centuries of contact between different cultural communities, the subject has gained scant attention in the literature on the anthropology of development. With the increasing popularity of neoliberal approaches to development, which seek to decentralise the provision of development aid through intermediary agencies and entrepreneurs, the roles of cultural brokers in mediating the outcomes of these provisions have gradually been brought to the fore. Based on a case study of the Mah Meri Cultural Village, an indigenous cultural village in Selangor, West Malaysia, I seek to examine the roles cultural brokers play in bridging differences among the various stakeholders in indigenous activism and cultural preservation. Specifically, I seek to interrogate their roles in the social construction and translation of cultural heritage, its implications on the cultural heritage of indigenous communities and their negotiation of rights and identities, as well as their involvement in community politics. My study demonstrates that while cultural brokers can mediate dis-junctures and contradictions between development policy regimes and realities on the ground, and therefore, serving the communities in a positive manner; conversely, they can also complicate dis-junctures and contradictions between policy intent and deliverance, leading to heritage dissonance between the cultural brokers and the communities whose cultural heritage is being represented and interpreted. My study thus suggests that there is a need to rethink the concept of \u2018cultural brokerage\u2019 as a non-monolithic, multi-faceted and heterogeneous subject, made up of different individuals with diverse personalities, character and intentions, who may sometimes complicate, rather than mediate, cultural differences, thus compromising, rather than ameliorating, the developmental needs of the local communities.

The second aim is to provide\narchaeological training for Lao, Thai, and Westerners working\non mainland Southeast Asian archaeology.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 806345, "asset_id": 223428, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31304, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Marwick", "domain_name": "washington", "page_name": "BenMarwick", "display_name": "Ben Marwick", "profile_url": "https://washington.academia.edu/BenMarwick?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31304/81731/89593/s65_ben.marwick.jpg"}, {"id": 2639030, "first_name": "Joyce", "last_name": "White", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "JoyceWhite", "display_name": "Joyce White", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/JoyceWhite?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4828, "name": "Collaboration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collaboration?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88262, "name": "Mekong", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mekong?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 81148923, "title": "Archaeogenetic study of prehistoric rice remains from Thailand and India: evidence of early japonica in South and Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2022-06-10T01:53:09.791-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81148923/Archaeogenetic_study_of_prehistoric_rice_remains_from_Thailand_and_India_evidence_of_early_japonica_in_South_and_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_81148923", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87294411, "asset_id": 81148923, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1742, "name": "Archaeobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeobotany?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21967, "name": "Ancient DNA (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_DNA_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25712, "name": "Ancient DNA Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_DNA_Research?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 87401, "name": "Rice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rice?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 123284, "name": "Ancient Indian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Indian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 142522, "name": "Domestication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestication?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 77897041, "title": "Lexical Evidence of the Vietic Household Before and After Language Contact with Sinitic", "created_at": "2022-04-28T15:05:51.129-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77897041/Lexical_Evidence_of_the_Vietic_Household_Before_and_After_Language_Contact_with_Sinitic?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_77897041", "summary": "DOWNLOAD: http://hdl.handle.net/10524/52500\nThis study presents Vietnamese words which are Vietic etyma or early Chinese loanwords in the domain of the household (e.g., structures, implements, clothing, decorations, cuisine).

Excavation data and Bayesian modeling on a corpus of 16 radiocarbon dates in particular demand a revised chronology for the Angkor Wat landscape. It was initially in use from the 11th century CE with subsequent habitation until the 13th century CE. Following this period, there is a gap in our dates, which we hypothesize signifies a change in the use of the occupation mounds during this period.

To explain these unique characteristics, some scholars offered what is called the \u201cbamboo hypothesis\u201d: if SE Asian stone tools are simple it would be because they were actually used to manufacture more complex implements made of bamboo. This hypothesis relies on a series of indirect evidence, among which the fact that use-traces occurring on the stone tools result from plant processing. These traces are often interpreted as due to bamboo working although in the absence of an adapted reference collection such a precise diagnosis is impossible to make. A fundamental question remains to be addressed: is it possible to distinguish the working of bamboo from the one of other plants based on the traces they produce? To answer this, we carried out several experiments, grounded on ethnoarchaeological observations, which involved 15 tropical plant taxa, including 3 bamboo genera and conducted microscopic use-wear analysis of the experimental tools. Our results show that the use-wear created by processing mature bamboo is well-developed and can be defined through a set of criteria. Altogether they distinguish bamboo wear from the one produced by other plants, although some overlapping exists. Our results can be used as a reference to which the traces on archaeological stone tools can be compared in order to determine whether they were really used to process bamboo and to what extent.",

Some scenarios must be excluded as they lack supporting evidence, while the remaining few are weighed against each other and ranked. At this point, the scenario with the most support, consisting primarily of archaeological and historical linguistic data, is that a community of Austroasiatic speakers resided in the Red River Delta from about 4000 BP, but that by the time of the arrival of Chinese groups, Vietic (a later stage of the original Austroasiatic group there) and early Tai groups had a presence in that region. Furthermore, comparative linguistic evidence most strongly supports a dominant Vietic linguistic presence in that region at that time, the portion of Vietic that eventually split off to become the Vi\u1ec7t-M\u01b0\u1eddng sub-branch and finally, within that, Vietnamese.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 98580284, "asset_id": 75108023, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 223519, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Alves", "domain_name": "montgomerycollege", "page_name": "AlvesMark", "display_name": "Mark  Alves", "profile_url": "https://montgomerycollege.academia.edu/AlvesMark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/223519/2259170/31201522/s65_mark.alves.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17401, "name": "Southeast Asian Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Linguistics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1211689, "name": "Trong Dong Son", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trong_Dong_Son?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 71457420, "title": "Late Pleistocene foragers c. 35,000-11,500 years ago", "created_at": "2022-02-14T01:15:15.553-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/71457420/Late_Pleistocene_foragers_c_35_000_11_500_years_ago?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_71457420", "summary": "The cathedral-like Niah Caves of Sarawak (Borneo) have iconic status in the archaeology of Southeast Asia, because the excavations by Tom and Barbara Harrisson in the 1950s and 1960s revealed the longest sequence of human occupation in the region, from (we now know) 50,000 years ago to the recent past.

The\ndomestication process, which is now documented as having taken a few\nmillennia, and coming to an end between 6700 and 5900 bp, involved\nseveral well documented changes, all of which served to increase the\nyield of rice harvests by an estimated 366 per cent; this increase provides an in-built pull factor for domestication. Once domesticated, rice diversified into higher productivity, labour-demanding wet rice and lower-yield dry rice. While wet rice in the Lower Yangtze region of China provided a basis for increasing population density and social hierarchy, it was the development of less productive and less demanding dry rice that helped to propel the migrations of farmers and the spread of rice agriculture across South China and Southeast Asia. Later intensification in Southeast Asia, a shift back to wet rice, was a necessary factor for increasing hierarchy and urbanisation in regions such as Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65553098, "asset_id": 45007853, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28295, "first_name": "Dorian", "last_name": "Fuller", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "DorianFuller", "display_name": "Dorian Fuller", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/DorianFuller?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28295/9222/222915/s65_dorian.fuller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1742, "name": "Archaeobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeobotany?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16743, "name": "Plant domestication (Prehistoric Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plant_domestication_Prehistoric_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24516, "name": "Chinese archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 142522, "name": "Domestication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domestication?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 44798935, "title": "Glass beads from Guishan in Iron Age Taiwan: Inter-regional bead exchange between Taiwan, Southeast Asia and beyond", "created_at": "2020-12-30T00:35:34.856-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44798935/Glass_beads_from_Guishan_in_Iron_Age_Taiwan_Inter_regional_bead_exchange_between_Taiwan_Southeast_Asia_and_beyond?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_44798935", "summary": "Archaeological excavations at Guishan in the southern end of Taiwan have recovered more than a hundred glass beads dating to mid-1st millennium CE. This research investigates the exchange of glass beads between Guishan, eastern Taiwan and Southeast Asia, by analysing the styles, chemical composition and microstructure of 64 glass beads from Guishan, using SEM-EDS, EPMA and LA-ICP-MS. The findings suggest that beads with an m-Na-Al glass and v-Na-Ca composition are the most common, supporting evidence for bead exchange between Guishan and Southeast Asia, originated in South Asia and Western Asia. Furthermore, most m-Na-Al glasses were coloured by copper, and different types of copper-based additives may have been used for different colours, indicating the beads may be derived from multiple production centres or workshops via Southeast Asia. Conversely, the glass bead compositions suggest that glass bead exchange between other contemporary sites in Taiwan is less evident at Guishan, except for one type of yellow glass bead containing bone ash which is different. This bone-ash containing yellow glass at Guishan is firstly identified in Iron Age Taiwan as well as around the South China Sea region. Its counterparts are also found from archaeological sites in southeastern and coastal eastern Taiwan, which might indicate small scale glass bead exchange. This evidence together suggests a dynamic glass bead exchange network between Guishan, eastern Taiwan, Southeast Asia and beyond.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65295735, "asset_id": 44798935, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2087773, "first_name": "Kuan-Wen", "last_name": "Wang", "domain_name": "sinica", "page_name": "KuanWenWang", "display_name": "Kuan-Wen  Wang", "profile_url": "https://sinica.academia.edu/KuanWenWang?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2087773/681607/38490118/s65_kuan-wen.wang.jpg"}, {"id": 1594169, "first_name": "Caroline", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "sheffield", "page_name": "CarolineJackson", "display_name": "Caroline Jackson", "profile_url": "https://sheffield.academia.edu/CarolineJackson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1594169/3519566/4132630/s65_caroline.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3316, "name": "Archaeological Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Science?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12807, "name": "Archaeometry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeometry?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22018, "name": "Glass (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41438, "name": "Ancient Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 90415, "name": "Taiwan Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94753, "name": "Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 270775, "name": "Ancient Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 44077523, "title": "Archaeological Investigations in Swarnamukhi and Kalangi River Valleys", "created_at": "2020-09-12T23:56:52.058-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44077523/Archaeological_Investigations_in_Swarnamukhi_and_Kalangi_River_Valleys?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_44077523", "summary": "Explorations conducted in Swarnamukhi and Kalangi river valleys in South India have resulted in the discovery of several Neolithic, Megalithic and Early historic sites.

Dental modifications supply additional valuable insights into past human cultural behavior. At the Early Iron Age sites of G\u00f2 \u00d4 Ch\u00f9a (400-100 BC) and Prohear (main mortuary period 200 BC-AD 100), various patterns of intravitam dental staining have been found. Systematic visual analysis is presented here as a method for the thorough documentation and subsequent differentiation of specific staining patterns. Using evidence from ethnographical, historical and archaeological studies, the main pattern seen is interpreted as intentional tooth blackening. Since tooth blackening affects almost all adult individuals from G\u00f2 \u00d4 Ch\u00f9a, the custom was of high social relevance.

It covers a period of expanding networks and cross-cultural encounters from the 3rd century BCE to the 13th century CE. \n\nThe book examines the distinctiveness of these shrines, and highlights their interconnections, and their role in social integration in South and Southeast Asia. By drawing on data from shipwreck sites, the author elaborates on the material and religious intersections and transmissions between cultures across the seas. Many of these coastal shrines survived into the colonial period when they came to be admired for their aesthetic value as \u2018monuments\u2019. As nation states of the region became independent, these shrines were often inscribed on UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List on account of their Outstanding Universal Values. The book argues that in the 21st century there is a need to promote the cultural connectivity of the past as transnational heritage on UNESCO\u2019s global platform to preserve and protect our shared heritage.   \n\nThe volume will be essential reading for academics and researchers of archaeology, anthropology, museum and heritage studies, history of South and Southeast Asia, religious studies, cultural studies, and Asian studies.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63989751, "asset_id": 43687098, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434629, "first_name": "Himanshu Prabha", "last_name": "Ray", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HimanshuPrabhaRay", "display_name": "Himanshu Prabha Ray", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HimanshuPrabhaRay?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434629/18265443/82383694/s65_himanshu_prabha.ray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10104, "name": "Ancient Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Religion?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12381, "name": "Indian ancient history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_ancient_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24057, "name": "Indian Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Culture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 75814, "name": "Indian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 974836, "name": "Ancient Indian Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Indian_Religion?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 43633616, "title": "Exploring Early Political and Economic Ties between West Sopp\u00e9ng and Suppaq from About the Late Thirteenth Century until the Mid-fifteenth Century: Myth, Marriage and Trade", "created_at": "2020-07-15T23:32:55.024-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43633616/Exploring_Early_Political_and_Economic_Ties_between_West_Sopp%C3%A9ng_and_Suppaq_from_About_the_Late_Thirteenth_Century_until_the_Mid_fifteenth_Century_Myth_Marriage_and_Trade?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_43633616", "summary": "The article represents some preliminary results and ideas from current research on the five Ajattapareng kingdoms and the west coast of South Sulawesi.

Many people think of them as sailors and adventurers who traded and settled throughout the Indonesian-Malay Archipelago. While this is true of some Bugis and Makasar, such activities were undertaken by a relatively small number of individuals and no earlier than the 17th century. As Christian Pelras (1996: 3\u20134) remarks, the Bugis have long \u201cbeen among the most imperfectly known of the Insulindian peoples,\u201d while the Makasars have been identified mainly with inhabitants of the port city, Makassar. However, most Bugis and Makasar are farmers, and for centuries the organised cultivation of wet-rice has played a central role in their economic and cultural lives. The Bugis and Makasar did not convert to Islam until the early 17th century, and while Islam is an important part of their cultural identity, both groups have retained significant elements of their indigenous, pre-Islamic heritage. Both also have a rich literature, some of which contains historical information dating from about 1400 CE and records the development by these two Austronesian-speaking peoples of large agrarian kingdoms based on indigenous cultural and political precepts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48953221, "asset_id": 28547428, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

MeTas( Tower  weights), Identification Of KaNva In The Indus Script, Identification Of Troy In The Indus script,Identification Of Barley And Mustard In The Indus Script, Krishna\u2019s Mathura And Dvaraka In The Indus Script -I have shown that several seals contain vedic metrological terms,names of vedic ornaments,names of people and places etc.In this work I am carrying forward the study of vedic metrology in the Indus seals with  further illustrative examples.My perception is that only a comprehensive study of ancient vedic  metrology can decipher the script symbols satisfactorily. A significant find herein is the existence of the Kalinga malla mana system during Harappan times challenging  the common perception of its origin from the later  Kalinga kingdom(Orissa).The unicorn is identified as the pala/nishka.Intersecting circles, fish , crab,bud,tower signs also have the same indications.The six locks of hair indicate  the paNameTa weight of six barley grains.Roots  and nuts indicate viira bhadra/ Drupada/ pala.We have located Lord Krishna\u2019s Mathura and Dvaraka in the Indus valley scripts.\nIn this article we confirm Mohenjodaro as the first Dvaraka\non the basis of the inscription on the copperplate B7C2 from there and textual evidences from the Rgveda and the Mahabharata.We have located PadmakuuTa,one of the palaces of Krishna also there. \n\n",

However, it is often difficult to assess the nature of the relationship between a residue and the artefact on which it is found. It is of great importance, therefore, to determine whether residues are use-related or a result of contamination. Here, we conducted experiments with 99 tool replicas made of red jasper, processed 15 different plant taxa and mapped the distribution of residues against the use-wear traces. Our experiments addressed several questions on the spatial relationship between use-wear and use-related residues on stone tools. In the majority of cases the residues were not spatially associated with use-wear. Therefore, it appears that residues should not necessarily be considered as non-related to use because they are not in close proximity to use-wear. On the other hand, our experiments also showed that the problem of contamination should not be underestimated and can be a serious cause for misinterpreting stone tool functions. Finally, our results showed a variability in residue distribution between tools used to process different plant taxa and revealed that the water content in the contact material has an influence on residue distribution.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46604704, "asset_id": 26292131, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 648784, "first_name": "Alfred", "last_name": "Pawlik", "domain_name": "ateneo", "page_name": "AlfredPawlik", "display_name": "Alfred Pawlik", "profile_url": "https://ateneo.academia.edu/AlfredPawlik?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/648784/2790331/14706844/s65_alfred.pawlik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 395, "name": "Experimental Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15328, "name": "Use Wear Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Use_Wear_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28899, "name": "Residue and Use-Wear Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residue_and_Use-Wear_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41464, "name": "Traceology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traceology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 91632, "name": "Stone tools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_tools?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 25811096, "title": "The Spread of Chinese Words for Metals in Southern China and Mainland Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2016-06-02T12:22:51.085-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25811096/The_Spread_of_Chinese_Words_for_Metals_in_Southern_China_and_Mainland_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_25811096", "summary": "This presentation (given at SEALS 26 in Manila) is on words for Chinese words for metals (copper, bronze, iron, steel, gold, and silver) in Proto-Hmong-Mien, Proto-Tai, Proto-Vietic and Vietnamese, and other neighboring languages.

Environmental and cultural factors are both proffered as reasons for the rice being not carried into the Pacific Islands. One of the cultural factors is the resistance of the indigenous non-Austronesian speaking population in Eastern Indonesia. This is an \u201cenigmatic\u201d area because it was the jump-off area of the Austronesian-speaking farmers to the Pacific Islands according to the Out-of-Taiwan hypothesis, while the alternative hypotheses on the peopling of the Pacific pointed to this area as the homeland of the Pacific islanders. Maluku Islands, in particular, are famous for the spice trade and there are claims of its beginnings during the Metal Age or earlier. Through the lens of archaeology and ethnography of these islands, this paper explores the resistance of these indigenous hunter-gatherers to rice agriculture. Innovative perspectives and pertinent material correlates of the consequences of their resistance, with their well-known role in spice trade, on the foodways and social diversity during the Neolithic and Metal Age in the Maluku Islands are then proposed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38299426, "asset_id": 14182200, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

They still dominate mainland Southeast Asia, and were once widely used throughout maritime Southeast Asia as well. A rich epigraphic record of mostly stone and metal inscriptions has long been appreciated for the historical information it provides. However, its linguistic content remains sorely underutilized, despite being an abundant source of evidence and insight into the intricate history of contact between Southeast Asian\u2019s major language families.\r\n\r\nWith very similar scripts being used to write often very different languages, the epigraphic record readily reveals etymological connections and loan relationships that can be obscured by phonology. For instance, shared Sanskrit vocabulary becomes immediately apparent, to the point of finding many identical spellings in inscriptions centuries apart from different language families. In addition to general difficulty of access, widely varying local conventions for transcription\u2014if the texts have been transcribed at all\u2014have also served to obscure this important resource.\r\n\r\nThis paper examines the utility of a unified convention for epigraphic transliteration in Southeast Asia, as well as the challenges involved in developing such a convention. This effort has academic parallels both in the development of IAST for South Asian epigraphy beginning at the end of the 19th century, and in the role IPA has played in modern descriptive linguistics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37591672, "asset_id": 12314021, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 84701, "first_name": "Rikker", "last_name": "Dockum", "domain_name": "swarthmore", "page_name": "RikkerDockum", "display_name": "Rikker Dockum", "profile_url": "https://swarthmore.academia.edu/RikkerDockum?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/84701/8112049/24753146/s65_rikker.dockum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1207, "name": "Historical Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Linguistics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5602, "name": "Austronesian Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Languages?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17401, "name": "Southeast Asian Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19843, "name": "Tai-Kadai Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tai-Kadai_Linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 38605, "name": "Tibeto-Burman Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibeto-Burman_Linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 86664, "name": "Austronesian linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 91218, "name": "Epigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epigraphy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 95891, "name": "Mon-Khmer linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon-Khmer_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 754710, "name": "Tai-Kadai Linguistic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tai-Kadai_Linguistic_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1510617, "name": "Austroasiatic linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_linguistics?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 12230295, "title": "First Call for Papers: International Journal of Student Research in Archaeology", "created_at": "2015-05-04T11:22:32.369-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12230295/First_Call_for_Papers_International_Journal_of_Student_Research_in_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_12230295", "summary": "The International Journal of Student Research in Archaeology (IJSRA) is an open-access, peer- reviewed journal.

It appears that different systems of maritime routes were here connected by transpeninsular routes, as had already been concluded from a passage in the annals of the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE-8 CE) describing a sea voyage from the southern Chinese ports in the Gulf of...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87294372, "asset_id": 81148930, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1280637, "first_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice", "last_name": "Bellina", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9niceBellina", "display_name": "B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bellina", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/B%C3%A9r%C3%A9niceBellina?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1280637/470094/4434475/s65_b_r_nice.bellina.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 130, "name": "Ancient History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 158452, "name": "Malay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 564368, "name": "Mediterranean Climate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_Climate?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1200511, "name": "Malay peninsula", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_peninsula?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238737, "name": "Maritime Silk Roads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Silk_Roads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1238738, "name": "Contacts Between the Mediterranean World and Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contacts_Between_the_Mediterranean_World_and_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3372233, "name": "peninsula", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/peninsula?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 79725472, "title": "Re-evaluating Pleistocene\u2013Holocene occupation of cave sites in north-west Thailand: new radiocarbon and luminescence dating", "created_at": "2022-05-23T03:17:38.724-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79725472/Re_evaluating_Pleistocene_Holocene_occupation_of_cave_sites_in_north_west_Thailand_new_radiocarbon_and_luminescence_dating?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_79725472", "summary": "Established chronologies indicate a long-term \u2018Hoabinhian\u2019 hunter-gatherer occupation of Mainland Southeast Asia during the Terminal Pleistocene to Mid-Holocene (45 000\u20133000 years ago).

We report evidence from stalagmite climate records indicating a major decrease of monsoon rainfall in MSEA during the mid-\u00a0to late Holocene, coincident with African monsoon failure during the end of the Green Sahara. Through a set of modeling experiments, we show that reduced vegetation and increased dust loads during the Green Sahara termination shifted the Walker circulation eastward and cooled the Indian Ocean, causing a reduction in monsoon rainfall in MSEA.

In this paper, we evaluate the evidence of likely supply lines for relatively remote sites in the Southern Cardamom Ranges of southwestern Cambodia. We present the results of a geochemical analysis of ceramics from two contemporary and short-lived assemblages: comprehensively dated mid-15th c. to mid-17th c. CE burial complexes in the Cardamom Mountains, and a dated shipwreck (KohS\u2019dech) recovered from waters off the adjacent coastline. We compare the shipwreck assemblage with other wreck assemblages to contextualize it within larger maritime exchange patterns. The KohS\u2019dech wreck assemblage appears typical of a Southeast Asian short-haul coastal trader of this period, with a cargo consisting of a range of utilitarian household ceramics: large, medium, and small glazed stoneware storage jars, earthenware cooking pots, stoves and mortars, and \u201ctableware\u201d bowls. Comparison of burial, shipwreck, and reference ceramic compositional data confirms the jars and fine wares predominantly came from multiple production centers in Central and Northern Thailand. The few Angkorian jars identified\u00a0in the burials were evidently heirlooms from what was, by the mid-15th c. CE, a likely defunct Khmer production complex east of Angkor. The results of this provenience analysis highlight (a) the Cardamom burials as an example of previously undocumented unregulated coastal interaction and (b) the relatively sophisticated and coordinated market-oriented strategies of inland ceramic producers at this time. For mainland Southeast Asia, the water frontier integrated not only ethnically diverse maritime port communities, but also those in more remote inland regions.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32363485, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Grave", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "PGrave", "display_name": "Peter Grave", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/PGrave?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3316, "name": "Archaeological Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Science?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19455, "name": "Early Modern economic and social history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_economic_and_social_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26185, "name": "Economic archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 44631, "name": "Ancient Shipwrecks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Shipwrecks?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 166265, "name": "Ayutthaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ayutthaya?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 172270, "name": "Neutron Activation Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neutron_Activation_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 649066, "name": "Ceramic Analysis Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3224647, "name": "Age of Commerce", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Age_of_Commerce?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 77125525, "title": "Diachronic modeling of the population within the medieval Greater Angkor Region settlement complex", "created_at": "2022-04-20T18:59:40.057-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77125525/Diachronic_modeling_of_the_population_within_the_medieval_Greater_Angkor_Region_settlement_complex?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_77125525", "summary": "Angkor is one of the world\u2019s largest premodern settlement complexes (9th to 15th centuries CE), but to date, no comprehensive demographic study has been completed, and key aspects of its population and demographic history remain unknown.

Hunter-gatherers did not abandon this highland region of Thailand during periods of environmental and socioeconomic change.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83162594, "asset_id": 75365202, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 137171732, "first_name": "Sakboworn", "last_name": "Tumpeesuwan", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SakbowornTumpeesuwan", "display_name": "Sakboworn Tumpeesuwan", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SakbowornTumpeesuwan?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 22692, "name": "Luminescence Dating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Luminescence_Dating?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30254, "name": "Pleistocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pleistocene?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40683, "name": "Antiquity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antiquity?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 48310, "name": "Cave", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cave?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 66892, "name": "Chronology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chronology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 78965, "name": "Holocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocene?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 93937, "name": "Radiocarbon Dating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radiocarbon_Dating?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 112668, "name": "Radiocarbon Dating (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radiocarbon_Dating_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 970476, "name": "Hoabinhian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hoabinhian?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1288612, "name": "Hunter Gatherer Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunter_Gatherer_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 74737869, "title": "Feener et al 2021 - Plangpleng SUPPLEMENT", "created_at": "2022-03-27T19:15:35.912-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74737869/Feener_et_al_2021_Plangpleng_SUPPLEMENT?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_74737869", "summary": "This file contains the supplementary online material to: R.

Many areas experienced this first pulse of state formation, from the Irawaddy River valley of Myanmar and the Chao Phraya delta of Thailand to the Bac Bo region of northernVietnam. The archaeological record of early Southeast Asia involves nucleated settlements and religious monuments that suggest a close articulation of religious ideology and sociopolitical organization (see also Hagesteijn 1996:187). The very monumentality of the ninth-fourteenth century Angkorian empire may explain why scholarship on ancient Cambodia continues to focus on the latter period of ancient Khmer civilization rather than on its earlier periods. Yet the Angkorian state represents the endpoint i...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67446080, "asset_id": 46536516, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4081, "name": "Khmer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30344, "name": "The archaeology of state formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_archaeology_of_state_formation?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 51296, "name": "Early State Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_State_Formation?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53849, "name": "Societal Collapse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Societal_Collapse?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 88265, "name": "South east Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_east_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 97643, "name": "South East Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 233900, "name": "Archaeology of Societal Collapse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Societal_Collapse?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 245915, "name": "Political history of Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_history_of_Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 730589, "name": "Khmer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 839779, "name": "Rise and fall of civilizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rise_and_fall_of_civilizations?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1395138, "name": "Political History and Culture of Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_History_and_Culture_of_Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1807540, "name": "Angkor Borei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor_Borei?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 46536520, "title": "Residential patterning at Angkor Wat", "created_at": "2021-04-10T16:54:24.247-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/46536520/Residential_patterning_at_Angkor_Wat?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_46536520", "summary": "Considerable attention has been devoted to the architecture and art history of Cambodia&#39;s Angkor Wat temple in the last century.

Focus on the rise of the larger port towns supporting this burgeoning maritime trade (e.g., Ayutthaya, Melaka, Hoi An) has overshadowed\nsmaller maritime operations that must have serviced less regulated coastlines. In this paper, we evaluate the evidence of likely supply lines for relatively remote sites in the Southern Cardamom Ranges of southwestern Cambodia. We present the results of a geochemical analysis of ceramics from two contemporary and short-lived assemblages: comprehensively dated mid-15th c. to mid-17th c. CE burial complexes in the Cardamom Mountains, and a dated shipwreck (Koh S\u2019dech) recovered from waters off the adjacent coastline. We compare the shipwreck assemblage with other wreck assemblages to contextualize it within larger\nmaritime exchange patterns. The Koh S\u2019dech wreck assemblage appears typical of a Southeast Asian short-haul coastal trader of this period, with a cargo consisting of a range of utilitarian household ceramics: large, medium, and small glazed stoneware storage jars, earthenware cooking pots, stoves and mortars, and Btableware^ bowls. Comparison of burial, shipwreck, and reference ceramic compositional data confirms the jars and fine wares predominantly came from multiple production centers in Central and Northern Thailand. The few Angkorian jars identified in the burials were evidently heirlooms from what was, by the mid-15th c. CE, a likely defunct Khmer production complex east of Angkor. The results of this provenience analysis highlight (a) the Cardamom burials as an example of previously undocumented unregulated coastal interaction and (b) the relatively sophisticated\nand coordinated market-oriented strategies of inland ceramic producers at this time. For mainland Southeast Asia, the the water frontier integrated not only ethnically diverse maritime port communities, but also those in more remote inland regions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67447129, "asset_id": 39048844, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83474, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "MiriamStark", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/MiriamStark?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83474/2672970/3110925/s65_miriam.stark.jpg"}, {"id": 32363485, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Grave", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "PGrave", "display_name": "Peter Grave", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/PGrave?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 433802, "first_name": "Nancy", "last_name": "Beavan", "domain_name": "cardiff", "page_name": "NancyBeavan", "display_name": "Nancy Beavan", "profile_url": "https://cardiff.academia.edu/NancyBeavan?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/433802/112048/686717/s65_nancy.beavan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3316, "name": "Archaeological Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Science?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 16007, "name": "Ceramic Analysis (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19455, "name": "Early Modern economic and social history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_economic_and_social_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26185, "name": "Economic archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37521683, "title": "How Visible are the Meals of the Ancient Fishing Expeditions?

Several lipid compounds peculiar to aquatic resources break down over time in some burial environments, making their detection, identification, and quantification challenging. However, some of these compounds, including the more stable altered products of a few of them, are very useful for identifying the utilization of aquatic resources in ancient foodways, as demonstrated by many published works involving archaeological pottery, mostly from the temperate zone of Northern Hemisphere. Hence, organic residue analysis is a promising tool to reveal the narratives of ancient \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d or subsistence and culinary practices involving aquatic resources. This approach should also be useful in tropical areas, including Southeast Asia that is known to be surrounded by seas as well as has numerous rivers and lakes inland. As shown by the ubiquity of remains of aquatic resources in the archaeological record of Southeast Asia as well as the present cuisines in the region, aquatic resources have always been prominent in the foodways of this region. However, there seems to be a crisis or several challenges on the preservation, detection, and analysis of aquatic biomarkers in the tropics. This paper then will survey the works on the analyses of organic residues involving aquatic resources as well as will review my own work on modern and archaeological pottery in Southeast Asia.\n\nPaper presented at 21st Congress of the INDO-PACIFIC PREHISTORY ASSOCIATION in Hue, Vietnam on September 27, 2018 in the panel co-organized by yours truly (see https://sites.google.com/site/ippasecretariat/headline2/panel-sessions/panel-s03) ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57494746, "asset_id": 37521683, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158140, "first_name": "Michelle Sotaridona", "last_name": "Eusebio", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "MichelleSotaridonaEusebio", "display_name": "Michelle Sotaridona Eusebio", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/MichelleSotaridonaEusebio?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158140/94345/11127910/s65_michelle.eusebio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52055, "name": "Lipids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lipids?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 284519, "name": "Organic Residue Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Residue_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 311941, "name": "Lipid analysis of absorbed residues in archaeological pottery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lipid_analysis_of_absorbed_residues_in_archaeological_pottery?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 612435, "name": "Organic Residues Analysis of Pottery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Residues_Analysis_of_Pottery?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 36114942, "title": "CFP: Digital Spatiality special issue of \"Asiascape\"", "created_at": "2018-03-08T20:50:27.834-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36114942/CFP_Digital_Spatiality_special_issue_of_Asiascape_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_36114942", "summary": "Digital technologies, namely the \" internet, \" have catalyzed a dramatic shift in the production of space and how we conceive it. They are ambiguous at their borders, at once expanding yet shrinking notions of home and homeland, of the local and the global, and of the intangible and the material. Such fuzziness and shifting boundaries generate new spatial relations on multiple layers which we call \" digital spatialities. \" In choosing the term \" spatiality \" versus \" area, \" we wish to mark a deviation from and complication of traditional area studies that are bound to particular geographies, nations, languages, and/ or cultures. In our reading, \" digital spatialities \" are anchored in but equally transcend these categories. In this special issue, we aim to consider different examples of how these digital spatialities are structured, how they function, are put into practice, and how they are framed by and connected to, rather than bound by areas in the abovementioned sense. We invite contributions that explore specific digital spatialities related to Asia with these questions in mind from various disciplinary perspectives, and to consider the following questions:-what defines specific digital spatialities when we think of Asia?-how are these related to priorly existing areas and their constituents, such as language, law, communities, and cultural practices-which kinds of subjects inhabit them, and what do they do?-what kind of methodologies may we deploy in critically studying them?-how can we come to terms with the vast differences between them? By asking these questions, we aim to ignite a critical dialogue about how digitality and digital humanities can be thought of productively, and complexly, even in the wake of vast and variable differences that are not simply confined to region. Firstly, we hope to fuel a more nuanced discourse about \" the internet \" or \" digital humanities, \" in particular regarding their generalized definition and their applicability in the largely differing local and global contexts of Asia on the world stage. Secondly, we would like to begin mapping the digital areas which we identify, carefully meditating upon their relationships among and between each other, as well as the electronic shape of the \" world \" they produce.

The complex system of human-environment interactions highlights problems resulting from crucial interconnected trends. These include population growth, rapid urbanisation which is alarmingly outpaced by the expansion of urban land cover, a decreasing ratio of food producers to food consumers, and increasing soil degradation. These conditions create a truly critical developmental dynamic that casts our future in a bleak light. Calls that emphasise the need to develop knowledge-based plans for sustainable urban growth are not only urgent and understandable, but will prove to be ill-informed pipe dreams if negative trends are not reversed.\n\nOne way to counteract the quandary that global processes confront us with is to design solutions at the local scale that are appropriate to local conditions. Archaeology is increasingly revealing past tropical urban development patterns. These alert us to long histories of radically different kinds of urban planning, design, life and ecological relations. In this session we invite contributions that seek to critically operationalise current insights and evidence from the archaeology of tropical cities across the globe. What do ancient tropical urban conditions have in common? How are alternative social and ecological relations manifested in distinctive developmental trajectories and do they display causal consistencies in urban form? How has past tropical urbanisation affected long-term environmental dynamics, and how were changes managed in urban life and governance? Ultimately, how can we present and use the distinctiveness of the archaeological-material evidence-base for indigenous urban vernaculars to inform global sustainable urban development debates?",

Because Angkor is one of the largest continuous archaeological landscapes in the world and was inhabited for hundreds of years, understanding the subsurface archaeological record is a challenge for archaeologists. Till F. Sonnemann in his dissertation Angkor Underground: Applying GRP to Analyse the Diachronic Structure of a Great Urban Complex presents a cohesive argument for the use of geophysical methods, mainly ground penetrating radar (GPR), to eiciently explore the subsurface archaeological record of Angkor. Walking over 250km of Angkor's landscape, Sonnemann's GPR survey covered over 12Ha to test Bernard-Philippe Groslier's \" hydraulic city \" hypotheses and further articulate the Angkor's subsurface archaeological record. In short, this dissertation outlines an eeective method to explore the sprawling archaeological site of Angkor. This dissertation consists of an introduction, eight body chapters, a conclusion and one appendix. The main body of the dissertation can roughly be divided into three sections: 1) the first section (Chapters 1 through 4) are background chapters on the geological and cultural history of Angkor; 2) the second section (Chapters 5 and 6) focuses on the application and integration of GPR with satellite remote sensing technologies; 3) the third section (Chapters 7 and 7) focuses on discussing the data collected at Angkor during several seasons of fieldwork. In Chapter 1, The Angkor Region, Sonnemann places his research within a broader geological, cultural, and archaeological context. Basic geological and geomorphological knowledge of an area is helpful when considering any archaeological site and essential when discussing the application of any geophysical method. His discussion of how soil conditions can influence the results of a GPR survey is of great importance to this type of study. Following this, his review of the cultural history of the area emphasizes that the Angkor landscape is a palimpsest of thousands of years of human activity. With the geological and culture historical context outlined, Sonnemann focuses on the current state of archaeological research at Angkor and ongoing debates around the site such as: 1) how the water management network and the baray system functioned; 2) outlining the boundaries of Angkor; 3) deconstructing the palimpsest of an urban center.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54595927, "asset_id": 34738150, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 948327, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Storozum", "domain_name": "netivyah", "page_name": "MichaelStorozum", "display_name": "Michael Storozum", "profile_url": "https://netivyah.academia.edu/MichaelStorozum?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/948327/650025/15145296/s65_michael.storozum.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48523, "name": "Book Reviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_Reviews?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1143877, "name": "Angkor Wat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor_Wat?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33678363, "title": "Archaeology Day, 17 June 2017: Pubic Outreach at Ritidian, Guam.pdf", "created_at": "2017-06-27T15:45:09.793-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33678363/Archaeology_Day_17_June_2017_Pubic_Outreach_at_Ritidian_Guam_pdf?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_33678363", "summary": "Public involvement in archaeology has been growing ever stronger at the Ritidian Site, locally known as Litekyan, in the Ritidian Unit of Guam National Wildlife Refuge (GNWR).

The collection derives from archaeological research conducted in the Philippines in the early part of the last century- from 1922 to 1925. For more than 80 years, scholars from the Philippines, China, Japan, Europe, and North America have visited the collection to study the materials and ask new questions about the Southeast Asian past. The papers here continue this trajectory- presenting recent research on early modern trade in blue on white porcelains  (Li); technological style and the classification of large stoneware dragon jars, the cargo containers  of the second millennium Asian trade (Dueppen); the cultural context of cranial deformation in the Southern Philippines (Clark); and a sourcing study of indigenous  earthenware ceramics using instrumental neutron activation (Yao). In this paper, I provide some background to these studies in an introduction to the Philippine expedition and the remarkable museum collection that it generated.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38518664, "asset_id": 15039047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3999699, "first_name": "Carla", "last_name": "Sinopoli", "domain_name": "umich", "page_name": "CarlaSinopoli", "display_name": "Carla Sinopoli", "profile_url": "https://umich.academia.edu/CarlaSinopoli?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126498, "name": "Philippine Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1178308, "name": "Archaeology of the Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_the_Philippines?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 12129211, "title": "The History of Documentation [of the Vijayanagara Research Project] (2006)", "created_at": "2015-04-27T14:10:05.156-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12129211/The_History_of_Documentation_of_the_Vijayanagara_Research_Project_2006_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_12129211", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37438709, "asset_id": 12129211, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2131946, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Fritz", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "JohnFritz", "display_name": "John Fritz", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/JohnFritz?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2131946/2300480/2685525/s65_john.fritz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 330062, "name": "Vijayanagara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vijayanagara?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11342719, "title": "Review of From Distant Tales: Archaeology and Ethnohistory in the Highlands of Sumatra.

and cuisine of Southeast Asia (SEA), past and present. It is also significant in the discourse of the Austronesian dispersal during the Neolithic period. However, it was critiqued that the tendency of archaeology of early agriculture is to treat time as chronological, rather than as a lived experience. This paper is a preliminary exploration on the temporality of the people in Island SEA as reflected in their rice agriculture. Specifically, the following questions are addressed: (a) How is the temporality of the people represented in ethnography? (b) How is time treated in dealing with the archaeology of early agriculture? (c) Including available literature on climate and environmental variations, can we deduce their effects on rice agriculture and the temporalities of the people involved in rice cultivation?

However, it is often difficult to assess the nature of the relationship between a residue and the artefact on which it is found. It is of great importance, therefore, to determine whether residues are use-related or a result of contamination. Here, we conducted experiments with 99 tool replicas made of red jasper, processed 15 different plant taxa and mapped the distribution of residues against the use-wear traces. Our experiments addressed several questions on the spatial relationship between use-wear and use-related residues on stone tools. In the majority of cases the residues were not spatially associated with use-wear. Therefore, it appears that residues should not necessarily be considered as non-related to use because they are not in close proximity to use-wear. On the other hand, our experiments also showed that the problem of contamination should not be underestimated and can be a serious cause for misinterpreting stone tool functions. Finally, our results showed a variability in residue distribution between tools used to process different plant taxa and revealed that the water content in the contact material has an influence on residue distribution.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20133557, "first_name": "Eusebio \"Bong\"", "last_name": "Dizon", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BongDizon", "display_name": "Eusebio \"Bong\"  Dizon", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BongDizon?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20133557/27012011/25445549/s65_eusebio_bong_.dizon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 395, "name": "Experimental Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15328, "name": "Use Wear Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Use_Wear_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 35587, "name": "Quaternary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quaternary?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41464, "name": "Traceology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traceology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 51531, "name": "Pergamon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pergamon?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 74033, "name": "Mapping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mapping?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 91632, "name": "Stone tools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_tools?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94179, "name": "Rainforests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rainforests?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 198066, "name": "Contamination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contamination?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 296220, "name": "Residue and use wear analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residue_and_use_wear_analysis?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 74172735, "title": "Feener et al 2021 - Plangpleng SUPPLEMENT", "created_at": "2022-03-20T18:30:53.190-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/74172735/Feener_et_al_2021_Plangpleng_SUPPLEMENT?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_74172735", "summary": "This file contains the supplementary online material to: R.

There has been debate around the introduction and use of the potter\u2019s wheel in South Asia's Indus Civilisation for almost a century, and opinions remain divided. This paper considers the emerging ceramic traditions identified at two Indus settlements in modern Haryana, northwest India. It presents evidence demonstrating that Indus Civilisation potters utilised multiple forming techniques for producing ceramic vessels and explores the evidence for the use of rotational gestures and rotational devices in regional ceramic production industries. Two dominant technological traditions are outlined, along with the implications of this discovery and future research opportunities.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15905835, "first_name": "Alessandro", "last_name": "Ceccarelli", "domain_name": "cambridge", "page_name": "AlessandroCeccarelli", "display_name": "Alessandro Ceccarelli", "profile_url": "https://cambridge.academia.edu/AlessandroCeccarelli?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15905835/4304164/39530183/s65_alessandro.ceccarelli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2786, "name": "Ceramic Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Technology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25803, "name": "Ancient Technology (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Technology_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44901, "name": "Pottery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 169096, "name": "Harappan Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Harappan_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1000785, "name": "Harappan Civilization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Harappan_Civilization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1785274, "name": "Indus Valey Civilisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indus_Valey_Civilisation?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 59863865, "title": "Imported tradeware ceramics and their relevance for dating socio-political developments in South Sulawesi, with special reference to the Allangkanangnge ri Latanete site", "created_at": "2021-10-24T20:49:16.873-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/59863865/Imported_tradeware_ceramics_and_their_relevance_for_dating_socio_political_developments_in_South_Sulawesi_with_special_reference_to_the_Allangkanangnge_ri_Latanete_site?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_59863865", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73567551, "asset_id": 59863865, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 78430198, "first_name": "Hakim", "last_name": "Budianto", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HakimBudianto", "display_name": "Hakim  Budianto", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HakimBudianto?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246810, "name": "South Sulawesi Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Sulawesi_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 246811, "name": "South Sulawesi History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Sulawesi_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 254219, "name": "Makassar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Makassar?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 312970, "name": "Sejarah Bugis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Bugis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3062161, "name": "Kajian Sulawesi Selatan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kajian_Sulawesi_Selatan?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 53025682, "title": "A Seat at the Table: Addressing Artefact biases in Asian Shipwreck Assemblages", "created_at": "2021-09-20T11:14:16.248-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/53025682/A_Seat_at_the_Table_Addressing_Artefact_biases_in_Asian_Shipwreck_Assemblages?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_53025682", "summary": "The ceramic trade throughout Medieval Southeast Asia was prolific. Terrestrial sites have yielded massive amounts of ceramic material and the archaeological reports of shipwreck cargoes corroborate the versatile and extensive qualities of trade ceramics in the region. The sheer quantity of ceramic artefacts found in shipwreck assemblages, paired with a well-researched framework of the aesthetic, show that there is no doubt that we rely heavily on ceramic data to date wrecks and establish regional trading patterns. This paper will debate that we are too &#39;ceramo-centric&#39; in our analyses of shipwrecks. While ceramics typically represent the bulk of the recovered material in these instances, many other types of media are present in the assemblage.

Excavation data and Bayesian modeling on a corpus of 16 radiocarbon dates in particular demand a revised chronology for the Angkor Wat landscape. It was initially in use from the 11th century CE with subsequent habitation until the 13th century CE. Following this period, there is a gap in our dates, which we hypothesize signifies a change in the use of the occupation mounds during this period.

Connections have been made between patterns of dispersed agglomerations at sites such as Angkor, Pollonaruwa, and the Maya cities, which have revolutionised our understanding of how settlement agglomerations operated in the preindustrial period. By contextualising settlement agglomerations regionally and globally we are able to re-evaluate familiar historical landscapes. These sites should be considered as the domain for locating connections between the local, regional and global historical processes. The historical settlement landscapes of Java are only now beginning to be reconsidered in light of current global research into agglomerations. Similarly there is much that global perspectives could benefit from as a result of a better understanding of Java's unique historical landscapes. Thus this talk utilises a glocal approach, prioritising local action within Java, and using this to reflect on regional and global understandings of agglomerations. This paper ultimately argues for a timely rethink of Javanese agglomerations during the pre-modern historical period, and for the benefits of seeking connections between sites of historical process.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64553018, "asset_id": 44191461, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25991, "name": "Urban archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 243982, "name": "Javanese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Javanese_studies?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 36489509, "title": "\u201cTracing the trade of heirloom beads across Zomia: A preliminary analysis of beads from the upland regions of northeast India and mainland Southeast Asia\u201d in The Archaeology of Portable Art: Southeast Asian, Pacific, and Australian Perspectives, Routledge, London (2018), 49-67.", "created_at": "2018-04-24T09:40:00.673-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36489509/_Tracing_the_trade_of_heirloom_beads_across_Zomia_A_preliminary_analysis_of_beads_from_the_upland_regions_of_northeast_India_and_mainland_Southeast_Asia_in_The_Archaeology_of_Portable_Art_Southeast_Asian_Pacific_and_Australian_Perspectives_Routledge_London_2018_49_67?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_36489509", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57978911, "asset_id": 36489509, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 577494, "first_name": "Willemijn", "last_name": "van Noord", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "WillemijnvanNoord", "display_name": "Willemijn van Noord", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/WillemijnvanNoord?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/577494/6455159/7301130/s65_willemijn.van_noord.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41438, "name": "Ancient Glass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50307, "name": "Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beads?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88735, "name": "Ancient Glass Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94753, "name": "Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 299404, "name": "Zomia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zomia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 347800, "name": "Ancient beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 556033, "name": "PIXE", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PIXE?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 41694935, "title": "Charney 1996 Review of Money Markets and", "created_at": "2020-01-21T13:41:55.261-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41694935/Charney_1996_Review_of_Money_Markets_and?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_41694935", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61852796, "asset_id": 41694935, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40477654, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Wicks", "domain_name": "miamioh", "page_name": "RobertWicks", "display_name": "Robert S .

The earliest known archaeological evidence for which dates to the mid Warring States Period (481/403 BCE - 221 BC). This long history brings with it a steep tradition of Sino-Foreign maritime exchange; one which during the height of China\u2019s maritime power in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD), was dramatically altered by the expansionist foreign policy of Emperor Yong Le. Like every Chinese ruler for more than 1,000 years, Yong Le aspired to incorporate Southeast Asian polities into a system of hierarchical and tributary relationships which centred on the Ming Court. This was simultaneously an exceptional yet traditional extension of Chinese military power, an unorthodox use of maritime resources within a very old structure, and one that had a significant impact on Southeast Asian shipbuilding. This paper will explore the impact of Sino-Foreign maritime exchanges on Southeast Asian shipbuilding traditions in the Ming Dynasty and examine the interplay of local and interregional traditions with the technological innovation, hybridization and transfer resulting from, the \u2018Southeast Asian Effect\u2019 on outsourced ship construction. This paper will further demonstrate that this created a complex developmental path dependence present in the maritime archaeological record, as evidenced by the Bukit Jakas, Phu Quoc and other shipwreck assemblages.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61801307, "asset_id": 41648336, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1100656, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "WARD \u5434\u5fb7\u8d5b", "domain_name": "dlmu", "page_name": "SarahWard", "display_name": "Sarah WARD \u5434\u5fb7\u8d5b", "profile_url": "https://dlmu.academia.edu/SarahWard?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1100656/382813/41932390/s65_sarah.ward_.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7240, "name": "Silk Road Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silk_Road_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24516, "name": "Chinese archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 49329, "name": "Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protection_of_Underwater_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 247155, "name": "Archaeology of the Silk Road", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_the_Silk_Road?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 41178951, "title": "2019 (with Vin Laychour / Seng Sonetra / N.

This is based on the presence of lipid compounds peculiar to plant sources, which are the series of mid-to-long-chain fatty acids, alkanes, and alcohols, as well as a wax ester. The detection of these plant waxes provides novel archaeobotanical evidence at the molecular level of the exploitation of waxy leafy plant food sources. It also establishes the continuity of a culinary practice from Neolithic to Bronze Age that involves the usage of pottery for preparing and serving a common plant food source available within the vicinities of the three inland sites of An S\u01a1n, L\u00f2 G\u1ea1ch, and G\u00f2 \u00d4 Ch\u00f9a. \n\nPaper presented at 21st Congress of the INDO-PACIFIC PREHISTORY ASSOCIATION in Hue, Vietnam on September 25, 2018 with Dr. Philip Piper, Dr. T.

Confirmation of the relationship between Southeast Asia with other regions is evidenced in the dispersal of Austronesian languages, spoken widely in Southeast Asia. Due to the sea providing travel routes to distant regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, the expansion of the languages suggests that people from Southeast Asia migrated to both sides\u2014 eastward to Oceania and Africa to the west. Furthermore, influences of maritime activities have spread beyond ports and maritime settlements. Research has revealed that mainland Southeast Asia including Myanmar, Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam also benefited from nautical skills through their complex riverine networks. Material traces from the hinterland and along coastal rims of both oceans, show that Southeast Asia has long been a dynamic region with an intense mix of cultures in its geographical crossroads. In ancient times, Southeast Asia was the only maritime gateway to China from the west. Research on maritime history in Southeast Asia, therefore, is crucial in defining the foundations of modern economic patterns. This session welcomes researchers and young scholars from a wide range of fields and disciplines to share their work on Southeast Asia's maritime past. It aims to gain, and discuss, new insight on the maritime history of the region's connections with the wider world. Papers may include, but are not limited to, studies in material culture, traditional practices and awareness-raising activities through preservation and interpretation of the archaeological resources. Raising public awareness of the importance and potential of our maritime heritage will enrich our understanding of the past and help forge cooperation and common ground for preserving and appreciating our shared heritage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55511526, "asset_id": 35642389, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33331049, "first_name": "Abhirada Pook", "last_name": "Komoot", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "AbhiradaPookKomoot", "display_name": "Abhirada Pook Komoot", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/AbhiradaPookKomoot?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33331049/9870700/35247890/s65_abhirada_pook.komoot.jpg"}, {"id": 62212741, "first_name": "Jennifer", "last_name": "Rodrigues", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JenniferRodrigues16", "display_name": "Jennifer Rodrigues", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JenniferRodrigues16?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29709, "name": "Underwater Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Underwater_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30723, "name": "Maritime Trade Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Trade_Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35167728, "title": "Material Culture in Asia: Innovative and Critical Approaches.

The new discoveries are presented here in detail, as a substantive basis for learning about a rarely preserved event of the initial cultural inhabitation of a region, in this case in the Remote Oceanic environment of the world with its own set of unique challenges.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54113589, "asset_id": 34196818, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33506876, "first_name": "Mike", "last_name": "Carson", "domain_name": "uog", "page_name": "MikeCarson", "display_name": "Mike  Carson", "profile_url": "https://uog.academia.edu/MikeCarson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33506876/9897354/20010869/s65_mike.carson.jpg"}, {"id": 5396570, "first_name": "Hsiao-chun", "last_name": "Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "HsiaochunHung", "display_name": "Hsiao-chun Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/HsiaochunHung?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5396570/2368493/93661660/s65_hsiao-chun.hung_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2109, "name": "Environmental Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5733, "name": "Archaeological Stratigraphy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Stratigraphy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 9379, "name": "Asia Pacific Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asia_Pacific_Region?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 14492, "name": "Coastal and Island Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coastal_and_Island_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 19732, "name": "Oceania (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oceania_Anthropology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23841, "name": "Migrations (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrations_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 55005, "name": "Pacific Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Islands?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 161275, "name": "Pacific Islands Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Islands_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 33931904, "title": "2017 Nephrite and other early metal age exchange networks across the South China Sea.pdf", "created_at": "2017-07-19T01:35:02.002-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33931904/2017_Nephrite_and_other_early_metal_age_exchange_networks_across_the_South_China_Sea_pdf?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_33931904", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53899474, "asset_id": 33931904, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5396570, "first_name": "Hsiao-chun", "last_name": "Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "HsiaochunHung", "display_name": "Hsiao-chun Hung \u6d2a\u66c9\u7d14", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/HsiaochunHung?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5396570/2368493/93661660/s65_hsiao-chun.hung_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 525248, "name": "Archaeology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33866562, "title": "Perspectives on the Past, New Critical Approaches to Ritual in Southeast Asia.

Ritual is a concept invoked by many who build pictures of the past, or seek to understand the relationships between the present-day world and the past. This panel brings together a wide diversity of perspectives to consider and critique ritual and the past in Southeast Asia. The panel will consider ritual broadly \u2013 as heritage, practice, performance, tradition, religion and spiritual practice. Interdisciplinary approaches across the humanities and social sciences are crucial to improving our understanding of the region's pasts. This, in turn, deepens our understanding of the present. The panel will ideally consist of papers that examine the theme of ritual from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including anthropology, archaeology, heritage, religion, performance and theatre studies, literature and history. We expect a high degree of interaction between the papers to facilitate interdisciplinary discussion and to draw fruitful connections between the various approaches that the papers will present. The panel welcomes papers that deal with ritual in innovative ways, such as ritual as a subject of historical enquiry, ritual as a set of economic relationships, ritual landscapes and spaces, ritual connecting past and present, and ritual as heritage production. We are especially interested in papers that offer new theoretical and methodological insights into their subject matter.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53844810, "asset_id": 33866562, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}, {"id": 25162767, "first_name": "Natali", "last_name": "Pearson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "NataliPearson", "display_name": "Natali Pearson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/NataliPearson?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25162767/7149931/17371830/s65_natali.pearson.jpg"}, {"id": 16977627, "first_name": "Nien Yuan", "last_name": "Cheng", "domain_name": "sutd", "page_name": "NienYuanCheng", "display_name": "Nien Yuan Cheng", "profile_url": "https://sutd.academia.edu/NienYuanCheng?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16977627/7070087/31189276/s65_nien_yuan.cheng.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137, "name": "Economic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2527, "name": "Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4081, "name": "Khmer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 93257, "name": "Hindu Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 33839644, "title": "Beyond the Faces in the Jungle, the social and environmental cost of ritual in Southeast Asia.

Rituals are not inert expressions or reflections of humanity, ritual connects and interacts with a variety of social elements. Rituals are a powerful force that constructs the human world. The consequences of ritual as a charged process extends beyond a brief and fleeting encounter that may take place during a spiritual act. Rituals have agency which act upon human society, having their own impacts independent of human intent. Rituals have significant ecological, social, and economic effects. They may compliment and serve the interests of a society, but may also run counter to humanities interests. The ritual and temple landscapes of Southeast Asia, such as Angkor are some of the most recognisable archaeological and architectural sites on the planet. My research is informed by the archaeology and material anthropology of ritual landscapes in Southeast Asia. We know a lot about the meaning of these temples, but very little is known about the lives of the people who built and lived in these ritual landscapes. When we visit these great monuments, our focus is often on royals, deities and demons. How did the people who created and lived within these ritual landscapes live? What role did ritual systems and the changing ecology play in their lives and the continued and living history of these sacred places?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53821640, "asset_id": 33839644, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4058, "name": "Ritual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ritual?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 4081, "name": "Khmer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 61737, "name": "Malaysia History and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia_History_and_Politics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1106384, "name": "Archaelogy of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaelogy_of_Malaysia?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 30924207, "title": "2017 Aufstieg und Niedergang der Cham.

comprehensive study of ancient vedic  metrology can decipher the script symbols satisfactorily. A significant find herein is the existence of the Kalinga malla mana system during Harappan times challenging  the common perception of its origin from the later  Kalinga kingdom(Orissa).The unicorn is identified as the pala/nishka.Intersecting circles, fish , crab,bud,tower signs also have the same indications.The six locks of hair indicate  the paNameTa weight of six barley grains.Roots  and nuts indicate viira bhadra/ Drupada/ pala.We have located Lord Krishna\u2019s Mathura and Dvaraka in the Indus valley scripts.\nWe have confirmed Mohenjodaro as the first Dvaraka\non the basis of the inscription on the copperplate B7C2 from there and textual evidences from the Rgveda, Mahabharata etc.We have located PadmakuuTa,one of the\npalaces of Krishna there.Also we have identified the Sindhu(Indus) as the Vedic Sarasvati river.In this treatise\nwe are identifying the Bharadvajas,the clan of composers of the earliest vedic texts.Why were they  capable of writing those texts in the

These studies have been art-history, theological and text bound enquiries. Comparative landscape archaeologies are able to explore relationships between artefacts and features, using visualisation to ask new questions of old spaces, places and interactions. \n\nSpecifically, monastic systems had a catalytic effect on landscape use and social organisation, generating differently structured and centralised units. Monasticism and belief have been a matter of considerable study in the early medieval worlds of Anglo-Saxon England (and wider Europe) and Southeast Asia. However, there remains to be an in-depth comparative study of the formation of these religious institutions, the effect of their cumulative agencies on landscapes and the peoples living within them. The arrival of monastic religious communities coincides with detectable changes in landscape use and economic centralisation. Our emerging research demands an urgent rethinking of the formation processes and pathways that lead to intensive economic activity and alteration of settlement landscapes.\n\nOur comparative approach brings together the economic and material effects that religious institutions and power structures have on landscapes in Britain and Southeast Asia. A comparative approach to the medieval world has a number of benefits. Firstly, important social phenomena such as religious conversion, and monasticism can be explored. Secondly, considering contextually specific differences and agencies enables an appreciation of the unique elements of space and place through time. There appears to be pan-global trends related to monasticism itself, transcending the religions association with the institutions themselves. Religious organisation and power arising from the colonising of landscapes is a phenomenon which needs to be considered in more depth, and perhaps even de-contextualised from essentialised beliefs, something which we attempt in this paper.

Peung (15\u201317th centuries A.D.) in the Cardamom Mountains, Cambodia. Examination of skeletal material shows evidence consistent with scurvy \u2013 specifically, abnormal porosity on the greater wings of the sphenoid bone and hard palate, and vascular impressions on the ectocranial surface of the frontal bone and maxillary alveolar bone. In addition, this individual has evidence of cribra orbitalia indicative of anemia. Although a nutritionally linked etiology is the most common cause of scurvy, a number of other factors influencing ascorbic acid levels need to be considered in an environment with sufficient vitamin C potentially available in the diet. Assessing the environmental evidence, the possibility of a number of interrelated factors contributing to the development of scurvy in this individual seems the most plausible explan...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39221941, "asset_id": 16857494, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18630323, "first_name": "Hallie", "last_name": "Buckley", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "HallieBuckley", "display_name": "Hallie Buckley", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/HallieBuckley?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18630323/5172509/5923508/s65_hallie.buckley.jpg_oh_4ca30c7175fa8ddce706583a6075f659_oe_54c2e96d___gda___1420906856_3c13a013e25abae6c219248a96ebc580"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2364, "name": "Paleopathology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleopathology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 16087479, "title": "Advancing Southeast Asian Archaeology 2013: Selected Papers from the First SEAMEO SPAFA International Conference on Southeast Asian Archaeology, Chonburi, Thailand 2013", "created_at": "2015-09-23T09:02:02.385-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16087479/Advancing_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology_2013_Selected_Papers_from_the_First_SEAMEO_SPAFA_International_Conference_on_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology_Chonburi_Thailand_2013?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_16087479", "summary": "Published 2015 by SEAMEO SPAFA\nISBN: 978-616-7961-14-9", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17815, "first_name": "Noel Hidalgo", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "seameo-spafa", "page_name": "NoelHidalgoTan", "display_name": "Noel Hidalgo  Tan", "profile_url": "https://seameo-spafa.academia.edu/NoelHidalgoTan?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17815/5975/41941490/s65_noel_hidalgo.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15561737, "title": "Nicolas 2016 - Some Observations on Peer-Reviewing for a Journal Article - \u0e23\u0e39\u0e1b\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e21\u0e34\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13\u0e27\u0e38\u0e12\u0e34", "created_at": "2015-09-09T20:52:53.188-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15561737/Nicolas_2016_Some_Observations_on_Peer_Reviewing_for_a_Journal_Article_%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B9_%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%92%E0%B8%B4?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_15561737", "summary": "\"Peer\" reviewing:  In some instances, it is flawless, some needs revision, or it is rejected.

to AD 500) communities is presented through an analysis of advanced attrition, caries, periapical cavities, and antemortem tooth loss (AMTL). The two communities, Snay and Sophy, just 40 kilometres apart, are temporally situated in the lead-up to the establishment of Angkorian state rule, a time of significant socio-political change. The prevalence of dental pathology is compared between the two communities and with other prehistoric sites throughout the Southeast Asian Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages to determine whether health was improving or deteriorating with the transition to state society while examining factors such as the rice diet and environment. Snay and Sophy, despite their proximity in time and space, were found to exhibit differences in dental health, with Sophy generally having poorer dental health, with more advanced attrition, caries and periapical cavities. However, when compared in their broader context of the Iron Age in prehistoric Southeast Asia, both sites suggest a trend in declining dental health in the period prior to the rise of the Angkorian state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29593411, "asset_id": 2049443, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 348055, "first_name": "Dougald", "last_name": "O'Reilly", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "DougaldOReilly", "display_name": "Dougald O'Reilly", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/DougaldOReilly?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/348055/94305/569254/s65_dougald.o_reilly.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 338354, "title": "Age Estimation of Children From Prehistoric Southeast Asia: Are the Dental Formation Methods Used Appropriate?", "created_at": "2010-09-24T12:42:53.951-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/338354/Age_Estimation_of_Children_From_Prehistoric_Southeast_Asia_Are_the_Dental_Formation_Methods_Used_Appropriate?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_338354", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29562958, "asset_id": 338354, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}, {"id": 18630323, "first_name": "Hallie", "last_name": "Buckley", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "HallieBuckley", "display_name": "Hallie Buckley", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/HallieBuckley?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18630323/5172509/5923508/s65_hallie.buckley.jpg_oh_4ca30c7175fa8ddce706583a6075f659_oe_54c2e96d___gda___1420906856_3c13a013e25abae6c219248a96ebc580"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 768, "name": "Biological Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2978, "name": "Dental Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dental_Research?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6470, "name": "Dental Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dental_Anthropology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6475, "name": "Anthropology of Children and Childhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Children_and_Childhood?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 14007, "name": "Osteoarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Osteoarchaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 39495, "name": "Human Growth and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Growth_and_Development?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 121592, "name": "Dental Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dental_Development?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 1957377, "title": "La cargaison du Cirebon: un outil essentiel sur Internet", "created_at": "2012-09-21T22:24:32.263-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1957377/La_cargaison_du_Cirebon_un_outil_essentiel_sur_Internet?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_1957377", "summary": "Mise en ligne des donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 la fouilles du Cirebon trouv\u00e9 en Mer de Java.

There is a coastal journey of more than 3000 kmbetween the occurrence of obsidians from the Bismarck Archipelago volcanic province of Papua NewGuinea and the Sunda-Banda Arc volcanic chain, yet obsidian artifacts from the two important PNGsources of Talasea and Lou Island are found at coastal Bukit Tengkorak in eastern Sabah at a imilardistance along with material that has no known source. Timor lies south of the eastern section of theactive volcanic Banda Arc island chain but it is within range of possible rhyolite sources from there.Although there is a continuous chain of around 60 active volcanoes stretching from west Sumatra to theMoluccas most are basaltic to andesitic with few areas likely to produce high silica dacite\u2013rhyolitedeposits. This does not exclude the possibility that the volcanic landscapes may contain obsidian, butwithout detailed survey and chemical analysis of sources from the Sunda-Banda Arc the attribution ofthe Timor obsidian artifacts remains to be demonstrated. Timor may seem to be an unlikely source forthe presence of obsidians as it lacks reports of the silica-rich rhyolite volcanic centers necessary toproduce this material. Despite the absence of detailed survey and analysis of Indonesian obsidiansources, especially from the volcanically active Banda Arc, this paper presents evidence that one of twoobsidian sources is clearly from Timor while the other, with less certainty, is also from an unknown localsource.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 3439038, "asset_id": 426919, "asset_type": "Work",

made important methodological advances over the past decade that have contributed new data on the domestication process, spread and ecology of cultivation. Growing evidence from spikelet bases indicates that non-shattering, domesticated forms evolved gradually in the Yangtze basin and that there were at least two distinct processes around the Middle Yangtze region pre-dating 6000 BC, and the in the Lower Yangtze region between 6000 and 4000 BC. Early rice cultivation in these areas was based on wet field ecologies, in contrast to rainfed rice that is indicated among the earliest systems in India. When rice first spread north it was not entirely suited to shorter temperate summer growth seasons, and we are able to infer from high levels of apparently green-harvested spikelets that genetic adaptations to temperate conditions evolved after 2000 BC.

Melaka then housed an urban population of 100,000, in which eighty different languages were spoken by Malays, Chinese, Arabs, Indians, and other ethnicities. Melaka&amp;#39;s urban form was not anomalous in sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Southeast Asia. Many of the region&amp;#39;s coasts and river valleys housed port cities and capitals with populations of 50,000\u2013100,000 people; population density/square kilometer varied from sparsely peopled hill country to lowland agrarian areas in northern Vietnam and Bali with higher densities than those in contemporary China. 1 The onset of European colonialism in the late eighteenth century reversed this seemingly inexorable trend toward Southeast Asian urbanism, whose roots lay two millennia deep. It is this earlier heritage of Southeast Asian urbanism, and the role of the urban form in promoting and maintaining polity in first\u2013second millennium Southeast Asia, that forms the focus of this chapter. Polity, power, and urbanism were linked in most regions of Southeast Asia, although the timing and nature of urbanization varied greatly across the region. While mainland Southeast Asians built large fortified urban centers, the densely populated island of Java remained largely free of cities until the thirteenth century ce. Disagreement over when the region&amp;#39;s cities first appeared and the forms they took constitute the core of most debates on early Southeast Asian cities. Relatively few scholars, however, have queried the relationship", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 209350038, "first_name": "Miriam", "last_name": "Stark", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MiriamStark2", "display_name": "Miriam Stark", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MiriamStark2?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/209350038/69184277/57579251/s65_miriam.stark.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 261, "name": "Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 277, "name": "Urban Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3290, "name": "Urbanism (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 20436, "name": "Urban And Regional Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_And_Regional_Planning?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 58763, "name": "Early Urbanization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Urbanization?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 270341, "name": "Architecture and Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Urban_Planning?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 420501, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 462496, "name": "Pacific and Island Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_and_Island_Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 508108, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 541823, "name": "Southeast Asian Art and Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_and_Architecture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 599635, "name": "Cambridge University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambridge_University?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1803741, "name": "Angkorian socio-economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkorian_socio-economics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2012519, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology and History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology_and_History?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 77403027, "title": "Adaptation and foraging from the Terminal Pleistocene to the Early Holocene: Excavation at Bubog on Ilin Island, Philippines", "created_at": "2022-04-23T17:32:05.898-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77403027/Adaptation_and_foraging_from_the_Terminal_Pleistocene_to_the_Early_Holocene_Excavation_at_Bubog_on_Ilin_Island_Philippines?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_77403027", "summary": "Abstract The recently discovered human remains from Callao Cave, northern Luzon, Philippines securely date the migration of hominins into the Philippines to ca. 70 kya (thousands of years ago). The direct route to reach Luzon from the Asian mainland is via Borneo, Palawan, through Mindoro and into Luzon. Our research focuses on Mindoro Island as a potential stepping stone to the main Philippine Archipelago. While Palawan and Luzon have produced evidence for early human occupation, no systematic research on the prehistory of Mindoro has been conducted until now. We report on recent archaeological investigations at the Bubog rockshelter sites on the small island of Ilin just off the coast of Mindoro. The excavations produced evidence of stratified sequences of human habitation at the two rockshelter sites in the form of dense shell middens that date to ca. 11 kya onwards. They provide direct evidence on how variability in landscape formation, sea levels, and landmass during the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene influenced the behavior of early human populations. Numerous species of molluscs were recorded and provisional results indicate variations in the invertebrate faunas throughout the stratigraphic sequences, resulting from sea level rise and the establishment of coral reefs between Ilin and Mindoro at the end of the Pleistocene. Our results contribute substantially to our understanding of the processes of human island adaptation, complement ongoing research into Island Southeast Asia\u2019s paleogeography, and enhance current knowledge of prehistoric subsistence strategies across the region.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 648784, "first_name": "Alfred", "last_name": "Pawlik", "domain_name":

This paper traces the historical trajectory of three contemporary monuments of Buddhist affiliation across the Bay of Bengal, namely Nalanda in north India, Borobudur in Central Java, and Nakhon Pathom in Central Thailand to address both their distinctiveness and their interconnectedness. The paper also focuses on the extent to which these shrines reflect the religious theories that prevailed between the sixth and the thirteenth centuries AD and are currently known to us through religious texts. It is not often appreciated that \u2018collections\u2019 of religious texts, as well as the \u2018discovery\u2019 of monuments were mediated through the priorities and practices of European and

However, the scenario of the Neolithization of Europe, which is often simplified, is far from being generalizable to other regions of the world, particularly the intertropical regions. If we take into account the particularities of the very ancient emergence of horticulture in these regions, neolithization seems to correspond to a very gradual evolution, operating by thresholds, rather than a sudden change.

ethnographic importance of the Southeast Asian house and household, an explicitly Southeast Asian \u201chousehold archaeology\u201d is still in its infancy. Never- theless, archaeologists in Southeast Asia have undertaken excavations within habita- tion areas and residential spaces, identifying domestic debris, the partial remains of house structures, and activity areas. As a result, archaeologists of Southeast Asia have addressed many topics of relevance to those who use a household archaeol- ogy approach, including the identification and description of houses and household activities; the domestic economy; domestic ritual; diversity and variability both within houses as related to questions of identity, specifically gender and age, and between houses, especially as related to status; and identification of supra-household communities. In this review, I consider how archaeologists have addressed these themes using examples from a diverse set of geographic locations and time peri- ods in mainland and island Southeast Asia. I conclude with suggestions for future research directions to continue building an archaeology of residential spaces and communities in Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17869, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "AlisonCarter", "display_name": "Alison K Carter", "profile_url": "https://uoregon.academia.edu/AlisonCarter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17869/5981/19917901/s65_alison.carter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22059, "name": "Household Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Household_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 68900628, "title": "Re-evaluating Pleistocene-Holocene occupation of cave sites in north-west Thailand: new radiocarbon and luminescence dating", "created_at": "2022-01-20T17:24:37.008-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68900628/Re_evaluating_Pleistocene_Holocene_occupation_of_cave_sites_in_north_west_Thailand_new_radiocarbon_and_luminescence_dating?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_68900628", "summary": "Established chronologies indicate a long-term &#39;Hoabinhian&#39; hunter-gatherer occupation of Mainland Southeast Asia during the Terminal Pleistocene to Mid-Holocene (45 000-3000 years ago).

Many radiocarbon determinations from bronze-consumption sites in north-east Thailand date the earliest copper-base metallurgy there in the late second millennium BC. By applying kernel density estimation analysis to approximately 100 new AMS radiocarbon dates, the authors conclude that the valley&#39;s first Neolithic millet farmers had settled there by c. 2000 BC, and initial copper mining and rudimentary smelting began in the late second millennium BC. This overlaps with the established dates for Southeast Asian metal-consumption sites, and provides an important new insight into the development of metallurgy in central Thailand and beyond.",

site at Gua Tambun in Perak, Malaysia was first reported in 1959 and was noted for its spectacular collection of rock art with depictions of anthropomorphs, animal figures and abstract shapes. Little scholarly attention was paid to it, however, and much of the interpretations produced thus far on the rock art have been speculative or unverified. The site was revisited by the authors in January 2009 in order to examine, record and study the rock art in detail. During the course of the fieldwork, individual rock art elements were identified and recorded, including a number of \u2018new\u2019 motifs, which are presented in this paper for the first time. The total count now stands at slightly over 500 distinct rock art elements, spread over ten distinct panels, making Gua Tambun one of the largest rock art sites in Malaysia, if not the largest.",

archaeological evidence for a trading settlement dating from the 13th to the mid-16th century ce on an elevated headland in Lamreh village about 30 km east of Banda Aceh, on the northern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. We propose this site was part of historic Lamri, known from documentary sources as an important node in the maritime &amp;quot;silk road&amp;quot; between the 9th to 16th centuries ce. Our landscape archaeological survey revealed large concentrations of ceramics on the headland that span from the early 13th through the mid-16th century, some of them of imperial quality. Several of the Muslim grave markers at this site are of a distinctive type and date across nearly the entire range of the 15th century. Geological evidence suggests low-lying parts of Lamri were destroyed by a major tsunami at the end of the 14th century. However, our data show that activity on the elevated headland continued until the site was abandoned in the mid-16th century. The lack of material culture dating from the 9th to 13th centuries suggests that earlier textual references to Lamri referred more generally to a broad stretch of the north Sumatran coast, with the headland in Lamreh village emerging as the geographic centre of historic Lamri after the turn of the 13th century.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8637445, "first_name":

"work_45581654", "summary": "The millennium between c.100 BCE and c.900 CE saw the growth of long-distance economic and cultural exchange both within and beyond Southeast Asia, processes which contributed to the development of early states and precipitated cultural changes through encounters with Indian and Sinitic cultures. Increasing numbers of people were travelling long distances along established trade routes into, within, through and out of the region, and for many different reasons. Visual representations of people claimed to be \u2018foreigners\u2019 in the art of this period have been identified in several cultural contexts, but have mostly received only cursory mention, often with a simple assertion of their identity. However, they are significant as locally-produced representations because, appropriately interpreted, they may offer new insights into intercultural interactions that have in large part been reconstructed from non-Southeast Asian textual sources and via studies of stylistic relationships and archaeological exotica. This thesis seeks to develop a methodology for the informed interpretation of such images that incorporates an appreciation of the cognitive processes behind the perception and representation of difference, otherness and foreignness in ancient art, in part by drawing on interpretive discussions of this kind of visual material elsewhere in the ancient world. Additional considerations pertinent to Southeast Asian engagement with non-local iconographic traditions are included. The resulting methodology is discussed further in three case studies where figures have been claimed to represent \u2018foreigners\u2019 to highlight the subjectivities, subtleties and sources involved in interpretation. Two of these have geographical foci, in pre-Angkorian Cambodia and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b culture in Central Thailand, and one has a thematic focus, being an apparent association with early representations of horses in the region. In each case, significant new insights result from the attention paid to these figures and their interpretation, showing the methodology to be a productive approach to understanding long-distance connections in Southeast Asia, or indeed elsewhere in the ancient world.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3061289, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Wreyford", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "BenWreyford", "display_name": "Ben Wreyford", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/BenWreyford?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3061289/19573140/19468432/s65_ben.wreyford.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22181, "name": "Representation of Others", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation_of_Others?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 979519, "name": "Archaeology of Horse and Riders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Horse_and_Riders?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1028132, "name": "Pre Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pre_Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1209502, "name": "Dvaravati Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati_Period?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1250015, "name": "Dv\u0101ravat\u012b", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 2668056, "name": "Sambor Prei Kuk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sambor_Prei_Kuk?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 45581633, "title": "The representation of otherness and foreignness in the art of early Southeast Asia c.100 BCE \u2013 c.900 CE", "created_at": "2021-03-19T08:17:37.856-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45581633/The_representation_of_otherness_and_foreignness_in_the_art_of_early_Southeast_Asia_c_100_BCE_c_900_CE?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_45581633", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3061289, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Wreyford", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "BenWreyford", "display_name": "Ben Wreyford", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/BenWreyford?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3061289/19573140/19468432/s65_ben.wreyford.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22181, "name": "Representation of Others", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation_of_Others?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 45145574, "title": "Salt Making and Prehistoric Shell Middens in the Straits of Melaka", "created_at": "2021-02-18T01:25:20.772-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45145574/Salt_Making_and_Prehistoric_Shell_Middens_in_the_Straits_of_Melaka?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_45145574", "summary": "Goto, a Japanese researcher, theorized in the 1970s that salt production might have replaced dried shellfish as an exchange item during the Late (2,500-1,250 BCE) and Final Jomon period (1,250-950/400 BCE), thus leading to the disappearance of large shell mounds (shell middens, or large shell heaps) (Kawashima (2012: 27; Habu et al. 2011: 21).

This is especially the case for late Holocene human occupation of the region when lifestyle and culture in marginal island environments is relatively unknown. Here we report on the archaeology of Jareng Bori rockshelter, a Metal-Age site spanning c. 1800 cal. BP up to the late historic period and situated on the eastern coast of Pantar Island in the Lesser Sunda Islands of eastern Indonesia. We use osteoarchaeological (human and vertebrate remains), invertebrate zooarchaeological (crustacean and molluscan remains), technological (lithics, shell, and pottery) and chemical sourcing (obsidian and metal) datasets to discuss networking, migration, and human subsistence strategies during this recent period of history. While some communities were no doubt living in open village settlements where they were producing pottery, the data indicate that aspects of maritime life-ways continued much as in earlier Pleistocene settlements, with people using rockshelters like Jareng Bori to pursue a range of subsistence activities focused on the shoreline. Shellfishing of rocky and reef intertidal species and fishing for mostly small herbivorous and omnivorous fishes was practised, while domestic animals only appear in the late historic period. Wider regional cultural interactions and networking are epitomized by obsidian exchange, dental modification practices, and pottery decorations, while lithic analyses indicates continuity of stone tool technology up until recent times.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65032231, "asset_id": 44575702, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 371409, "first_name": "Tse Siang", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "TseSiangLim", "display_name": "Tse Siang Lim", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/TseSiangLim?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/371409/99250/34186667/s65_tse_siang.lim.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44448157, "title": "2020 Kambodscha.

Macro-botanical remains were collected by flotation from two sites, Wari-Bateshwar (WB), an Early Historic archaeological site, dating mainly between 400 and 100 BC, with a later seventh century AD temple complex, and Raghurampura Vikrampura (RV), a Buddhist Monastery (vihara) located within the Vikrampura city site complex and dating to the eleventh and sixteenth centuries AD. Despite being a tropical country, with high rainfall and intensive soil processes, our work demonstrates that conventional archaeobotany, the collection of macro-remains through flotation, has much potential towards putting together a history of crops and agricultural systems in Bangladesh. The archaeobotanical assemblage collected from both sites indicates the predominance of rice agriculture, which would have been practiced in summer. Spikelet bases are of domesticated type rice, while grain metrics suggest the majority of rice was probably subspecies japonica. The presence of some wetland weeds suggests at least some of the rice was grown in wet (flooded) systems, but much of it may have been rainfed as inferred from the Southeast Asian weed Acmella paniculata. Other crops include winter cereals, barley and possible oat, and small numbers of summer millets (Pennisetum glaucum, Sorghum bicolor, Setaria italica), a wide diversity of summer and winter pulses (14 spp.), cotton, sesame and mustard seed. Pulse crops included many known from India. Thus, while most crops indicate diffusion of crops from India eastwards, the absence of indica rice could also indicate some diffusion from Southeast Asia. The later site RV also produced evidence of the rice bean (Vigna umbellata), a domesticate of mainland Southeast Asia. These data provide the first empirical evidence for reconstructing past agriculture in Bangladesh and for the role of connections to both India and mainland Southeast Asia in the development of crop diversity in the Ganges delta region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64231003, "asset_id": 43906931, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3208380, "first_name": "Cristina", "last_name": "Castillo", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "CristinaCastillo", "display_name": "Cristina Castillo", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/CristinaCastillo?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3208380/1055062/2048413/s65_cristina.castillo.jpg"}, {"id": 3435283, "first_name": "Mizanur", "last_name": "Rahman", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MizanurRahman", "display_name": "Mizanur Rahman", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MizanurRahman?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3435283/1190206/1491376/s65_mizanur.rahman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13453, "name": "Paleoethnobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleoethnobotany?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43562158, "title": "The Historic Trading Port of Lamri on the North Sumatran Coast", "created_at": "2020-07-09T00:36:37.366-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43562158/The_Historic_Trading_Port_of_Lamri_on_the_North_Sumatran_Coast?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_43562158", "summary": "We present archaeological evidence for a trading settlement dating from the 13th to the mid-16th century ce on an elevated headland in Lamreh village about 30 km east of Banda Aceh, on the northern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia.

Several of the Muslim grave markers at this site are of a distinctive type and date across nearly the entire range of the 15th century. Geological evidence suggests low-lying parts of Lamri were destroyed by a major tsunami at the end of the 14th century. However, our data show that activity on the elevated headland continued until the site was abandoned in the mid-16th century. The lack of material culture dating from the 9th to 13th centuries suggests that earlier textual references to Lamri referred more generally to a broad stretch of the north Sumatran coast, with the headland in Lamreh village emerging as the geographic centre of historic Lamri after the turn of the 13th century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63870169, "asset_id": 43562158, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4543014, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Daly", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "PatrickDaly", "display_name": "Patrick Daly", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/PatrickDaly?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4543014/1880097/11998414/s65_patrick.daly.jpg"}, {"id": 74355, "first_name": "R.

Environment, here, is understood in a wide sense including the climatic, political, and cultural environments of societies. In these environments changes occur over time due to innovations, trade, exchange, conflicts, geobiochemical processes, or disasters which interact with and transform societies and their structures. Looking at these changes from an archaeological perspective means observing them by studying the material remains of past societies which reflect environmental changes and transforming social structures for example through changing styles of ornaments, different imagery, materials, or practices or immediate traces of human behavior like destruction, abandonment, repair, or iconoclasm. The reactions societies show and the transformations in structures give insight into how they deal with times of crises. The panel will discuss environmental change and possible transfers of adaptation and resilience strategies in ancient societies in zones of interaction between Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean by highlighting diverse geographic regions in different times: from ancient Greece, via Gandhara and the Roman empire into the region of the Malay Peninsula and the empires of the Cham and Khmer in nowadays Vietnam and Cambodia.

The ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information (COCI) have engaged in many cultural, arts, and conservation projects, but have not defined a framework or guidelines for ethical practice in Southeast Asian Studies. Whilst some Southeast Asian nations have developed local policies for approaching the past and cultural heritage, there is a lack of shared regional and ethical guidelines for both domestic and foreign researchers. A shared set of ethical principles is important for several reasons. First, through its diversity Southeast Asian nations have a high degree of shared heritage. Second, many of the experts who work on the Southeast Asian past work across borders,-collaborating with researchers and communities in several different countries. A shared regional framework would assist researchers. Third, a standardise ethical guidelines will help lessen tensions between internal and external institutions and nations. Issues such as access and control of research information, the relationship between archaeology and art crime, working with local communities, protocols around the treatment of human remains, valuation and transport of archaeological and materials, relationship between heritage and social media, the co-opting of heritage for nationalistic purposes and the destruction of heritage due to theft and ever increasing urban development make a discussion around ethical practices not only necessary but extremely urgent. We strongly encourage papers founded in the study of the Southeast Asian past from disciplines such as archaeology, anthropology, economics, history, heritage, sociology, and museum studies. We seek a diverse range of views and voices from regional perspectives and a diverse range of cultural, theoretical and pragmatic perspectives. Southeast Asia has a rich and varied past, informed today by its diverse cultural heritage. It is vital that we act now to ensure the preservation of that cultural heritage, to include different voices and perspectives. The aim of this session is to bring together a diverse range of perspectives and expertise to provide a positive roadmap for ethical research into Southeast Asia's shared heritage and history.",

important artifacts in Southeast Asia as they are amongst the earliest objects from South Asia found in the region, and frequently seen as symbols of Indian influence and increasing socio-political complexity. Peter Francis Jr.'s writings regarding the production and exchange of beads in Southeast Asia have been influential to archaeologists who have viewed beads as prestige objects that were traded widely and produced at important urban centers in Southeast Asia. However, the field of beads studies in Southeast Asia has greatly expanded in the past 15 years and benefitted from new excavations and scientific techniques. In this article, I review Peter Francis' hypotheses regarding the production and exchange of beads in Southeast Asia from 500 BCE to the early second millennium CE. I then synthesize recent work by scholars that has transformed our understanding of the manufacture and trade of beads. I argue that this work has largely disproven Francis' model of bead production and interaction between South and Southeast Asia. Instead, there appear to have been multiple phases of bead production and exchange between the two regions, which reflect complex interaction networks between South and Southeast Asia and within Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17869, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "AlisonCarter",

South Asia, were widely exchanged in Southeast Asia during the Iron Age period (500 BCE\u2013500 CE). Recent studies have identified changes in bead types and manufacturing methods over time, as well as evidence for possible local production. In order to understand the broader implications of these developments, geochemical analysis using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was undertaken on 73 beads from 10 Iron Age sites in Cambodia and Thailand and 64 geologic samples from four sites in India, Iran, and Thailand. The results show that many of the beads were produced from raw material derived from the Deccan Traps, India and that there is not yet strong evidence for bead production using a Southeast Asian source. Secondly, we find that there is not yet clear evidence for a change in the different geologic sources used to produce beads over time. This study adds to the growing body of literature highlighting the utility of LA-ICP-MS in differentiating and assigning provenience to agate/carnelian and other silicates.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17869, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "uoregon", "page_name": "AlisonCarter", "display_name": "Alison K Carter", "profile_url": "https://uoregon.academia.edu/AlisonCarter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17869/5981/19917901/s65_alison.carter.jpg"}, {"id": 6788952, "first_name": "Laure", "last_name": "Dussubieux", "domain_name": "fieldmuseum", "page_name": "LaureDussubieux", "display_name": "Laure Dussubieux", "profile_url": "https://fieldmuseum.academia.edu/LaureDussubieux?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50744, "name": "LA-ICP-MS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LA-ICP-MS?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 274081, "name": "Stone beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 347800, "name": "Ancient beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_beads?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 408818, "name": "Thailand archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 21941377, "title": "The Gossamer City: a new inquiry, Museum International 213-214: 23-27", "created_at": "2016-02-14T01:21:22.076-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21941377/The_Gossamer_City_a_new_inquiry_Museum_International_213_214_23_27?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_21941377", "summary": "Fletcher, R., Pottier, C. 2002.

Colonial societies have tended to be perceived through a post-colonial dichotomy of coloniser and the colonised. Identities, historical events and trajectories have been divided into the archetypes of a powerful, violent transgressing Coloniser and a passive agentless group, -the Colonised. The dichotomy of Coloniser and Colonised has been challenged by recent scholarship in cultural studies, anthropology, material culture studies, museumology and heritage studies. While some in archaeology have also begun to question this duality, there has not yet been a systematic study of the phenomena or of the role of small dynamic groups.\nTo address this gap in archaeological research, three case studies from the British Empire; \u2013 Calcutta, The Straits Settlements and Sydney \u2013 are analysed and compared to examine whether the archaeology and materiality of colonial port cities reveals a plurality of groups within colonial contexts. That these case studies are regional and temporal contemporaries also addresses the current lack of historical archaeology in South and South East Asia, as well as the lack of integration of Australian historical archaeology within the wider Asia-Pacific region.\nUsing principles of British and German landscape archaeology enables the contents and spatial relationships of a landscape to be examined as an archaeological site. This approach is complimented by a consideration of smaller scale material and spatial relationships within and amongst buildings. Grounded in an examination of materiality and landscape my aim is to reveal the nature of the plurality of players within a colonial context, and to assess the social operational consequences of these relationships.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3290, "name": "Urbanism (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7275, "name": "South East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12795, "name": "Social Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

In order to evaluate the development of popular contemporary cuisines across Southeast Asia, an understanding of the emergence of their ancient foodways is required. From the past to the present, many foodway activities from food acquisition to consumption are done as a community. Present-day cultural diversity and identity revolve around cuisine, which comprises the preparation and consumption of food. Some ethnographic studies have focused on how local Southeast Asian communities utilize pottery in food preparation and distribution. However, it is not clear how food items were prepared and served in conjunction with pottery that would allow for evaluating the importance of food in maintaining and promoting identity based on shared cuisine in prehistoric Southeast Asia. To address the question of how cuisine and community engagement were possibly experienced by the people living in southern Vietnam during the Neolithic and the Metal Age (3000 BC-AD 500), this study uses a combination of social theory, technofuntional analysis, and biomolecular approaches by analyzing pottery vessels from four settlement sites for technofunctional attributes and organic residues to determine their former usage and food contents.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38356294, "asset_id": 14183409, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 158140, "first_name": "Michelle Sotaridona", "last_name": "Eusebio", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "MichelleSotaridonaEusebio", "display_name": "Michelle Sotaridona Eusebio", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/MichelleSotaridonaEusebio?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/158140/94345/11127910/s65_michelle.eusebio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1740, "name": "Foodways (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foodways_Anthropology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2213, "name": "Pottery (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16394, "name": "Biomolecular archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biomolecular_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25048, "name": "Archaeological Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Chemistry?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 50732, "name": "Community of Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_of_Practice?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 86259, "name": "Pottery technology and function", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pottery_technology_and_function?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 123764, "name": "Cuisine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cuisine?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 158455, "name": "Vietnamese studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnamese_studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 184543, "name": "Cha\u00eene Op\u00e9ratoire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cha%C3%AEne_Op%C3%A9ratoire?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 218712, "name": "Food and Cuisine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Cuisine?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 284519, "name": "Organic Residue Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Residue_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 332512, "name": "Foodways of the Ancient World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foodways_of_the_Ancient_World?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 443367, "name": "Community Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Identity?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 612435, "name": "Organic Residues Analysis of Pottery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Residues_Analysis_of_Pottery?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 856344, "name": "Community Identiy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Identiy?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 14182833, "title": "Potted Histories: Tracking the Plants and Animals in Southeast Asia between Food Acquisition and Consumption", "created_at": "2015-07-18T20:20:41.190-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14182833/Potted_Histories_Tracking_the_Plants_and_Animals_in_Southeast_Asia_between_Food_Acquisition_and_Consumption?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_14182833", "summary": "For more comprehensive account of the early history of plants and animals in Southeast Asia, we should extend from their origins, dispersal, and acquisition to their roles in foodways as well as to other quotidian and ritualistic activities during the past by tracking their micro (e.g., phytoliths, pollen, starches, small bones, and scales) and molecular (e.g., lipids, proteins, and alkaloids) remains in material culture (e.g., lithic blades, pottery vessels, ceramic stoves, and grindstones).

explores the ethics of underwater cultural heritage in Indonesia within the context of the commercial excavation of these sites. Focusing specifically on the 9th century \u2018Belitung\u2019 shipwreck, discovered in 1998, the article argues that underwater cultural heritage sites become objects, in the heritage sense, only at the point of their excavation. Prior to discovery and excavation, the value of the Belitung wreck as a cultural or historical informant is greatly diminished by its invisibility and virtual inaccessibility. The ethics of commercial underwater excavation remain contested, but this does not exclude the notion that the transition, from hidden to discovered to excavated object, can be posited as a turning point in how underwater cultural heritage sites are valued. By permitting commercial excavation, Indonesia has broadened the potentialities for these sites beyond in-situ preservation or exposure to unlicensed \u2018treasure hunters\u2019.  The article ultimately argues that commercial excavation can prompt a reconsideration of how we understand ethics in the context of underwater cultural heritage and attests to the ongoing importance of materiality in heritage considerations.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25162767, "first_name": "Natali", "last_name": "Pearson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name":

This work has been instrumental in addressing regional archaeological questions, such as migration patterns, models of agricultural intensification, and social organisation change. Furthermore, bioarchaeology research in this region has been important in informing universally applied archaeological models of human adaptation, such as the model of health change with agricultural intensification. Although agriculture developed independently in several places around the world, the model of prehistoric health change is based primarily on research in Europe and North America. Recent bioarchaeological work in Southeast Asia challenges this model, where human responses to agriculture are more complex and regionally specific than the model implies. This panel will showcase research in the region that addresses questions of regional and worldwide archaeological significance. The presentations will encompass different methodological approaches such as field anthropology, palaeopathology and palaeodemography, morphometric, and stable isotope analyses. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35484098, "asset_id": 9204676, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 768, "name": "Biological Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2364, "name": "Paleopathology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleopathology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 5971, "name": "Human Anatomy (Biological Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Anatomy_Biological_Anthropology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 5885257, "title": "The Mission Arch\u00e9ologique Fran\u00e7aise au Myanmar: past, present and future", "created_at": "2014-01-29T11:24:06.594-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5885257/The_Mission_Arch%C3%A9ologique_Fran%C3%A7aise_au_Myanmar_past_present_and_future?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_5885257", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6788952, "first_name": "Laure", "last_name": "Dussubieux", "domain_name": "fieldmuseum", "page_name": "LaureDussubieux", "display_name": "Laure Dussubieux", "profile_url": "https://fieldmuseum.academia.edu/LaureDussubieux?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94753, "name": "Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 270775, "name": "Ancient Glass Beads", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Glass_Beads?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9037467, "title": "The bare bones of agriculture", "created_at": "2014-10-30T15:06:32.126-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9037467/The_bare_bones_of_agriculture?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_9037467", "summary": "News highlight in the Otago Daily Times\r\nhttp://www.odt.co.nz/on-campus/university-otago/20589/the-bare-bones-agriculture", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55599240, "asset_id": 9037467, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7432705, "title": "\u042d\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043f\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0445 Anthropology in the Philippines  In: Anthropology in the countries of Asia.

The goal of this project was to determine whether or not the compositional analysis of ceramics could be used to examine the organization of pottery production and exchange relationships in the Bais-Tanjay region of Negros Island. Results indicate that at least five distinct groups of ceramics can be differentiated based on elemental compositions and that pottery production was both a part-time, dispersed endeavor and a full-time, likely centralized, craft. In addition, a number of compositional outliers in the ceramic dataset suggest that interregional trade took place, with pottery made outside the Bais-Tanjay region being imported, especially by upland swidden farmers.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 714314, "first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Niziolek", "domain_name": "fieldmuseum", "page_name": "LisaNiziolek", "display_name": "Lisa Niziolek", "profile_url": "https://fieldmuseum.academia.edu/LisaNiziolek?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/714314/14094616/15102588/s65_lisa.niziolek.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 407, "name": "Geochemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geochemistry?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16007, "name": "Ceramic Analysis (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28903, "name": "Craft production (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Craft_production_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 50743, "name": "Compositional Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Compositional_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 2177420, "title": "Asian Archaeology Group", "created_at": "2012-11-21T17:59:20.138-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2177420/Asian_Archaeology_Group?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_2177420", "summary": "Series of talks held every other Monday during term time around the theme of Asian archaeology.

"work_79280157", "summary": "In several papers published in the 1970s, Donald Brown explored the relationship between rank, ethnic homogeneity and indigenous historiography in Brunei. His main argument is that the hereditarily closed ranking system of Brunei\u2019s dominant ethnic group produced, or at least perpetuated, ethnic diversity and the development of an invented historiography in relation to ethnic origins to support the position of the dominant group. Similar relationships between rank, or status, and origins are found throughout much of the Austronesian-speaking world. In most of these societies origins are of fundamental social and political importance, often expressed through complex traditions that through recourse to origins function to establish social difference between individuals, social or ethnic groups in order to justify claims of precedence: a priority, seniority or superiority that can relate to rights over resources, political offices or the political or ritual ascendancy of one group over another. Drawing on data from the wider Austronesian world, particularly ideas of \u2018origin and precedence\u2019, this chapter presents a comparative analysis of various Brunei origin traditions, supplemented by historical, archaeological and linguistic data. While not uncritical of Brown\u2019s earlier studies, the chapter aims to both build and expand upon his work in understanding the relationship between social structures and history in Brunei.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7540, "name": "Oral Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Traditions?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19267, "name": "Oral Tradition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Tradition?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 48574, "name": "Brunei Darussalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Darussalam?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 247641, "name": "Peoples and Cultures of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peoples_and_Cultures_of_Borneo?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 278481, "name": "history of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Borneo?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 645527, "name": "Sejarah Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Brunei?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 741137, "name": "History of Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Brunei?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1657007, "name": "Brunei Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Studies?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 79185035, "title": "Re-evaluating Pleistocene\u2013Holocene occupation of cave sites in north-west Thailand: new radiocarbon and luminescence dating", "created_at": "2022-05-15T19:23:41.871-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79185035/Re_evaluating_Pleistocene_Holocene_occupation_of_cave_sites_in_north_west_Thailand_new_radiocarbon_and_luminescence_dating?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_79185035", "summary": "Established chronologies indicate a long-term \u2018Hoabinhian\u2019 hunter-gatherer occupation of Mainland Southeast Asia during the Terminal Pleistocene to Mid-Holocene (45 000\u20133000 years ago).

This period is considered the interface between the late prehistoric and early historic periods and is sometimes called the Protohistoric period. Complex polities emerged during this time along the coasts and in the river valleys of mainland Southeast Asia, and it is also likely that many subsistence strategies like hunting and gathering continued into this period. At its early end (i.e., 2500\u20131500 b.p.), some archaeologists have also called this period the \u201cIron Age,\u201d \u201cGeneral Period C,\u201d and the \u201cHigh Metal Age.\u201d The period after a.d. 200 falls into Higham\u2019s \u201cGeneral Period D\u201d and the beginning of regionally specific chronologies. In central Burma, we see the initiation of the Pyu period, and in Central Thailand, we see the origins of the Dvaravati period. In the Khorat plateau/Tonle Sap region, the founding of the Khmer empire signals the end of this period in a.d. 802. In northern and central Vietnam, this is a transitional phase between Bronze Age complex societies and the earliest states.

Understanding the relationship between documentary and archaeological sources has been among the most persistent of these challenges (e.g., Feinman 1997; Kepecs 1997; Stark and Allen 1998). Chapters in this volume use case studies across the Old World to offer original contributions and explore significant, if sometimes intractable issues. Kohl (chapter 10) directly asks whether archaeological and written sources are qualitatively distinct or complementary. Acknowledging that most documentary sources are also archaeological in origin, I examine this relationship between archaeological and historical sources by tacking between my region of specialty in Southeast Asia (Cambodia and the pre-Angkorian Khmer) and chapters in this volume.

It is becoming increasingly apparent that the unique environments of the Indo-Pacific have resulted in an archaeological record that does not necessarily align with those in the northern hemisphere. New, regionally-specific archaeological models are being developed, and biological anthropological research has an important role to play in establishing past human experience within these models. In the Indo-Pacific, research using ancient and modern human tissues is adding insight into global processes of prehistoric settlement and migrations, subsistence change and human biosocial adaptation.

Southeast Asian countries are characterised by varied social, cultural, and political histories, but there are also some broad similarities in terms of poor economic development that limits much local research, and strong nationalism and rigid bureaucratic procedures for research. All have implications for non-local and local bioarchaeological research. Despite the growth in bioarchaeological research, the ethics of the practice of bioarchaeology in this region remain relatively underexplored. This chapter presents some of the main ethical issues of research with human remains in the region focusing on the countries of Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, and the Philippines, from a non-local and local researcher viewpoint. We review a range of ethical issues, including the varied way different cultures respond to bioarchaeological work, local-non-local partnership in research, community archaeology, bioarchaeological methods including post-excavation management, and looting of archaeological sites. With the recent development of local expertise in bioarchaeology in the region, the repatriation of skeletal samples to Thailand, the increase in local training, and partnerships between local and non-local bioarchaeologists, there is much promise for the further development of local research in the field.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 253426, "first_name": "Sian", "last_name": "Halcrow", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SianHalcrow", "display_name": "Sian Halcrow", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SianHalcrow?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/253426/54201/5572274/s65_sian.halcrow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18860, "name": "Human Remains (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Remains_Anthropology_?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1030194, "name": "Springer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Springer?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 77471489, "title": "Updating Asia's Maritime Bead Trade: An introduction", "created_at": "2022-04-24T10:29:56.478-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77471489/Updating_Asias_Maritime_Bead_Trade_An_introduction?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_77471489", "summary": "Abstract In this introduction we offer a brief background on Peter Francis, Jr., Asia&#39;s Maritime Bead Trade , and our motivation for putting together this special issue.

However, it is often difficult to assess the nature of the relationship between a residue and the artefact on which it is found. It is of great importance, therefore, to determine whether residues are use-related or a result of contamination. Here, we conducted experiments with 99 tool replicas made of red jasper, processed 15 different plant taxa and mapped the distribution of residues against the use-wear traces. Our experiments addressed several questions on the spatial relationship between use-wear and use-related residues on stone tools. In the majority of cases the residues were not spatially associated with use-wear. Therefore, it appears that residues should not necessarily be considered as non-related to use because they are not in close proximity to use-wear. On the other hand, our experiments also showed that the problem of contamination should not be underestimated and can be a serious cause for misinterpreting stone tool functions. Finally, our results showed a variability in residue distribution between tools used to process different plant taxa and revealed that the water content in the contact material has an influence on residue distribution.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 648784, "first_name": "Alfred", "last_name": "Pawlik", "domain_name": "ateneo", "page_name": "AlfredPawlik", "display_name": "Alfred Pawlik", "profile_url": "https://ateneo.academia.edu/AlfredPawlik?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/648784/2790331/14706844/s65_alfred.pawlik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 395, "name": "Experimental Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 15328, "name": "Use Wear Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Use_Wear_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 28020, "name": "Residue Analysis (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residue_Analysis_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 35587, "name": "Quaternary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quaternary?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41464, "name": "Traceology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traceology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 51531, "name": "Pergamon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pergamon?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 74033, "name": "Mapping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mapping?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 91632, "name": "Stone tools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone_tools?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 94179, "name": "Rainforests", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rainforests?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 198066, "name": "Contamination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contamination?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 296220, "name": "Residue and use wear analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Residue_and_use_wear_analysis?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 77339209, "title": "Centralized power/decentralized production?

A central feature of the Angkorian economy was the precocious development of sophisticated craft industries. Of the multiple crafts produced in this empire, stoneware production stands out for two reasons: empire transport networks closely articulated with the location of stoneware production complexes best known in central Angkor and on the Khorat plateau northwest of Angkor; and distribution/consumption patterns of Angkorian stoneware map directly onto the empire&#39;s geopolitical extent. As part of a larger geochemical provenancing project concerned with Khmer stoneware production and exchange, we present and discuss results for Cheung Ek, a southern Cambodian provincial complex for production of both stoneware and earthenware. The similarities (shared local resources) and differences in the organization of local production are striking between stoneware and earthenware production. Comparison with previously published Khmer stoneware kiln complexes confirms that each has a unique and readily identifiable geochemical profile. By establishing a geochemical baseline this work highlights the potential of stonewares for developing a deeper understanding of Khmer craft production and distribution dynamics in future comparisons between stoneware production, Khmer settlement and ritual contexts. This elemental baseline will also enable future evaluation of the potential discriminating power of other, field deployable but less sensitive non-destructive analytic techniques such as pXRF and pLIBS, particularly in relation to extending this work to checking production origins of complete Khmer stoneware vessels held in museum collections.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32363485, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Grave", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "PGrave", "display_name": "Peter Grave", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/PGrave?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 407, "name": "Geochemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geochemistry?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 3316, "name": "Archaeological Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Science?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 7275, "name": "South East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 61714, "name": "Production economics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Production_economics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 649066, "name": "Ceramic Analysis Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1131312, "name": "Academic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 77125528, "title": "After Angkor : An Archaeological Perspective on Heritage and Capacity-Building in Cambodia", "created_at": "2022-04-20T18:59:40.792-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77125528/After_Angkor_An_Archaeological_Perspective_on_Heritage_and_Capacity_Building_in_Cambodia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_77125528", "summary": "The 1993 UN-mediated elections signaled Cambodia&amp;#39;s emergence from nearly four decades of political turmoil and civil war, but it took more than five years for the country to subdue insurgencies within its borders.

Of the multiple crafts produced in this empire, stoneware production stands out for two reasons: empire transport networks closely articulated with the location of stoneware production complexes best known in central Angkor and on the Khorat plateau northwest of Angkor; and distribution/consumption patterns of Angkorian stoneware map directly onto the empire\u2019s geopolitical extent.

Within the context of debates about the population history of Island South-East Asia (ISEA), the Kalimantan region remains poorly documented and understood. When authors mention this region it is usually with regard to its strategic location facing the Wallace line on the edge of Sundaland, as a gateway from Sunda to Sahul during the late Pleistocene period, or as part of models of the diffusion of the Neolithic cultural complex from Taiwan and the Philippines and the Malay Peninsula.

It wielded great influence across mainland Southeast Asia and is now one of the most archaeologically visible polities due to its expansive re- ligious building works. This paper presents archaeobotanical evidence from two of the most renowned Angkorian temples largely associated with kings and elites, Angkor Wat and Ta Prohm. But it focuses on the people that dwelt within the temple enclosures, some of whom were involved in the daily functions of the temple. Archaeological work indicates that temple enclosures were areas of habitation within the Angkorian urban core and the temples and their enclosures were ritual, political, social, and economic landscapes.

ceramics along Asian trade routes: Ming Ban 1 (1371-1509), Ming Ban 2 (1521-1529), and Qing Ban (1654-1684). We use ceramics collected during a landscape archaeology survey along 40km of coast in Aceh, Indonesia to show how the three ban periods manifest in the ceramic record of settlements along an important stretch of the maritime silkroad. All three ban periods overlap with reductions in the quantity of Chinese ceramics. Within several decades of the start of Ming Ban 1, people in Aceh began importing ceramics from production centers in Burma and Thailand as a substitute for Chinese ceramics. Following Ming Ban 2, there is an increase in imports from Chinese production centers, albeit from new kilns sites. While brief, the Qing ban resulted in an almost immediate influx of ceramics from Japan and Vietnam, which maint...", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43142145, "first_name": "Yew Seng", "last_name": "Tai", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TaiYewSeng", "display_name": "Yew Seng Tai", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TaiYewSeng?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 12746, "name": "Ming Dynasty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ming_Dynasty?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26850, "name": "Chinese history (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_history_History_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30723, "name": "Maritime Trade Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Trade_Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 93454, "name": "Acehnese history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acehnese_history?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 221325, "name": "Sumatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumatra?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 264277, "name": "Indian Ocean Maritime Trade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Maritime_Trade?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 649066, "name": "Ceramic Analysis Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramic_Analysis_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 1420357, "name": "History of Chinese Ceramics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Chinese_Ceramics?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 60607294, "title": "Archaeogenetic study of prehistoric rice remains from Thailand and India: evidence of early japonica in South and Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2021-10-31T15:57:02.122-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/60607294/Archaeogenetic_study_of_prehistoric_rice_remains_from_Thailand_and_India_evidence_of_early_japonica_in_South_and_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_60607294", "summary": "We report a successful extraction and sequencing of ancient DNA from carbonized rice grains (Oryza sativa) from six archaeological sites, including two from India and four from Thailand, ranging in age from ca. 2500 to 1500 BP.

Following Ming Ban 2, there is an increase in imports from Chinese production centers, albeit from new kilns sites. While brief, the Qing ban resulted in an almost immediate influx of ceramics from Japan and Vietnam, which maintained some market share until the mid-17 th century, after which Chinese ceramics dominate the record until the end of the Qing dynasty. Our data show both the importance of Chinese ceramics within regional trade networks and how those networks and local patterns of consumption adapted to disruptions of supply.",

"summary": "Our recent discovery and excavation of a series of iron smelting furnaces, dated to the eighth and ninth century CE, near upland Rmet villages in northwest Laos, potentially sheds new light on the role of regional upland groups during the immediate pre-Tai period. The oral tradition associated with these furnaces emphasises the role of an ancient population of metallurgists who left the area under pressure from the Rmet. These stories could refer to the actual arrival and departure (immigration and emigration) of a population of metallurgists in that area sometime during the second half of the first millennium CE or they can support the scenario of a dissimilation process. The latter would explain the existence of a Rmet subculture that the locals regard as \u2018Chueang Lavae\u2019 villages, a differentiation that Karl G. Izikowitz had labelled \u2018Upper Lamet\u2019 in the 1930s. Our finds show that archaeology and ethnology can both contribute to a much-needed reformulation of upland Lao history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95882941, "asset_id": 51442729,

develop economies based on rice cultivation, fishing, hunting, and the domestication of animals, especially pigs and dogs. A number of these sites have been excavated in recent years and they are often large mounds that can attain several meters in depth, comprising successive layers of alluvial soil brought in periodically to serve as living floors. The site of An Son is of this type and lies in a small valley immediately north of the Mekong Delta in southern Vietnam. Excavated on five occasions since 1978, and most recently in 2009, it was occupied from the late third into the late second millennium b.c. An Son has produced evidence that attests the domestication of pigs and dogs in all layers apart (perhaps) from the most basal one, which was not investigated in 2009, together with the growing of rice of the subspeci...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68025505, "asset_id": 49796230, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6464737, "first_name": "Dang", "last_name": "Kinh", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DangKinh", "display_name": "Dang Kinh", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DangKinh?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6464737/3930326/55795085/s65_dang.kinh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704, "name": "Bioarchaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioarchaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6474, "name": "Paleodiet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleodiet?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 11199, "name": "Neolithic Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neolithic_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 520053, "name": "Asian Perspectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Perspectives?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 49564791, "title": "Dating the Myanmar Bronze Age: Preliminary 14C Dates from the Oakaie 1 Cemetery Near Nyaung\u2019Gan", "created_at": "2021-07-05T22:44:35.645-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49564791/Dating_the_Myanmar_Bronze_Age_Preliminary_14C_Dates_from_the_Oakaie_1_Cemetery_Near_Nyaung_Gan?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_49564791", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67888782, "asset_id": 49564791, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66645947, "first_name": "frederique", "last_name": "valentin", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "valentinfrederique", "display_name": "frederique valentin", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/valentinfrederique?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/66645947/22239560/21463686/s65_frederique.valentin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 399, "name": "Prehistoric Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13509, "name": "Bronze Age Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bronze_Age_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 47578939, "title": "The impact of Ming and Qing dynasty maritime bans on trade ceramics recovered from coastal settlements in northern Sumatra, Indonesia", "created_at": "2021-04-23T06:12:20.867-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/47578939/The_impact_of_Ming_and_Qing_dynasty_maritime_bans_on_trade_ceramics_recovered_from_coastal_settlements_in_northern_Sumatra_Indonesia?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_47578939", "summary": "We review published literature and historical texts to propose that three periods of official Chinese maritime bans impacted the composition and circulation of trade ceramics along Asian trade routes: Ming Ban 1 (1371-1509), Ming Ban 2 (1521-1529), and Qing Ban (1654-1684). We use ceramics collected during a landscape archaeology survey along 40km of coast in Aceh, Indonesia to show how the three ban periods manifest in the ceramic record of settlements along an important stretch of the maritime silkroad. All three ban periods overlap with reductions in the quantity of Chinese ceramics. Within several decades of the start of Ming Ban 1, people in Aceh began importing ceramics from production centers in Burma and Thailand as a substitute for Chinese ceramics. Following Ming Ban 2, there is an increase in imports from Chinese production centers, albeit from new kilns sites. While brief, the Qing ban resulted in an almost immediate influx of ceramics from Japan and Vietnam, which maintained some market share until the mid-17 th century, after which Chinese ceramics dominate the record until the end of the Qing dynasty. Our data show both the importance of Chinese ceramics within regional trade networks and how those networks and local patterns of consumption adapted to disruptions of supply.",

Through a set of modeling experiments, we show that reduced vegetation and increased dust loads during the Green Sahara termination shifted the Walker circulation eastward and cooled the Indian Ocean, causing a reduction in monsoon rainfall in MSEA. Our results indicate that vegetation-dust climate feedbacks from Sahara drying may have been the catalyst for societal shifts in MSEA via ocean-atmospheric teleconnections.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64261441, "asset_id": 43937553, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3054011, "first_name": "Cyler", "last_name": "Conrad", "domain_name": "lanl", "page_name": "CylerConrad", "display_name": "Cyler Conrad", "profile_url": "https://lanl.academia.edu/CylerConrad?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3054011/1004114/19674279/s65_cyler.conrad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1703, "name": "Stable Isotope Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_Isotope_Analysis?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7959, "name": "Stable Isotope Geochemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_Isotope_Geochemistry?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8980, "name": "Drought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drought?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10225, "name": "Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 11125, "name": "Dust (Astronomy & Astrophysics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dust_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 18912, "name": "Stable isotope paleoclimatology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stable_isotope_paleoclimatology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 22595, "name": "Geochronology & isotope Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geochronology_and_isotope_Geology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 23422, "name": "Paleoclimate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paleoclimate?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30496, "name": "Speleothems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Speleothems?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 40032, "name": "Monsoon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monsoon?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 41578, "name": "Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunter-Gatherer_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 48814, "name": "Indian Ocean", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 78965, "name": "Holocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Holocene?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 106896, "name": "Cave and Karst Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cave_and_Karst_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 138642, "name": "Sahara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sahara?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 40790738, "title": "Metals in Economic Context", "created_at": "2019-10-30T15:00:39.262-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40790738/Metals_in_Economic_Context?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_40790738", "summary": "An examination of interpreting ancient metals from  economic frameworks.

This thesis uses a typology of rock-cut burials to map the distribution of frontier groups located on major and minor southern tributaries of the upper Yangzi, at the interface between lowland and highland. Epigraphic material is integrated with the archaeological evidence, with the latter being, in large part, first-hand material collected via direct personal survey of burial chambers cut in sandstone cliffs. This dataset is articulated particularly carefully in locational terms to produce an extended analysis of large-scale craft production and funerary expression while Han imperial presence declines on its southwest frontier (2nd-3rd century CE). While existing studies have investigated the origin of elite rock-cut tombs under the Western Han (2nd-1st century BCE) in the Central Plains, and the popularity of rock-cut tombs under the Eastern Han (1st-2nd century CE) in the Sichuan basin, they have relied on only a few excavated tombs and historical texts. These studies have not addressed the type of burials identified in this study or the specific environment south of the Yangzi River, which, apart from being an ecological boundary, was also a key political and cultural frontier. The funerary landscape investigated here elucidates the role of frontier groups in times of imperial collapse, and the topographic strategies whereby they constructed their identity. The thesis shows how, in a context of political weakening, secondary trade routes are inhabited by increasingly localized and diversified communities, diverging from funerary practices in the civilisational centres of the plains of Sichuan and the main course of the Yangzi River.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 870857, "first_name": "Lia", "last_name": "Wei", "domain_name": "inalco", "page_name": "LiaWei", "display_name": "Lia Wei", "profile_url": "https://inalco.academia.edu/LiaWei?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/870857/872946/1089569/s65_lia.wei.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8228, "name": "Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8516, "name": "Funerary Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funerary_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 24516, "name": "Chinese archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 26850, "name": "Chinese history (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_history_History_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 29411, "name": "Frontier Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Frontier_Studies?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 57161, "name": "Funerary Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Funerary_Practices?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 59470, "name": "Borders and Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Frontiers?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 139310, "name": "Highlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Highlands?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 275405, "name": "Cultural Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Routes?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 648975, "name": "Trade Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Routes?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 39959980, "title": "IOW-ARCH.

Here we use excavation and chronometric data from three field seasons at Angkor Wat to understand the decline and reorganization of the Angkorian Empire, which was a more protracted and complex process than historians imagined. Excavation data and Bayesian modeling on a corpus of 16 radiocarbon dates in particular demand a revised chronology for the Angkor Wat landscape. It was initially in use from the 11th century CE with subsequent habitation until the 13th century CE. Following this period, there is a gap in our dates, which we hypothesize signifies a change in the use of the occupation mounds during this period. However, Angkor Wat was never completely abandoned, as the dates suggest that the mounds were in use again in the late 14th\u2013early 15th centuries until the 17th or 18th centuries CE. This break in dates points toward a reorganization of Angkor Wat\u2019s enclosure space, but not during the historically recorded 15th century collapse. Our excavation data are consistent with multiple lines of evidence demonstrating the region\u2019s continued ideological importance and residential use, even after the collapse and shift southward of the polity\u2019s capital.

As a discipline that straddles both the humanities and sciences, archaeologists in Southeast Asia should be reflexive of the fact that there may be (and is often the case) an extensive body of research in the local languages. More critically, there is a need to facilitate the sharing of such knowledge across these two worlds. In this regard, I would like to suggest a small but significant change in the way we share our knowledge as a starting effort: by writing titles, abstracts and keywords in both English and the relevant native local language.

Here, we present original analytical data on copper-base artefacts from several Bronze Age and Iron Age sites in Myanmar. Observed microstructures range from as-cast, worked, to fully annealed; compositions include leaded copper, low-tin to high-tin bronzes, and arsenical copper/bronze. Lead isotope analyses indicate that the metal originates from different geological sources, including several that match the lead isotope signatures of known prehistoric copper mines in Thailand and Laos. These archaeometallurgical data, including evidence for secondary copper-base production, more than double those currently available for Myanmar and document the presence of multiple local alloying and working traditions, perhaps chronologically differentiated, as well as identifying possible links to primary mineral sources across the region. Overall, this adds significant new information to the emerging picture of Southeast Asian prehistoric metallurgy at the crossroads of several major ancient cultures.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 95834386, "first_name": "Baptiste", "last_name": "Pradier", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BaptistePradier", "display_name": "Baptiste Pradier", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BaptistePradier?f_ri=13299", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 406, "name": "Geology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Geology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24522, "name": "Archaeometallurgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeometallurgy?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 140516, "name": "Lead Isotope Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lead_Isotope_Analysis?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37376846, "title": "Siamese Jar and Its Significance to Southeast Asian Trade during the 14th to 18th Centuries", "created_at": "2018-09-10T20:06:31.394-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37376846/Siamese_Jar_and_Its_Significance_to_Southeast_Asian_Trade_during_the_14th_to_18th_Centuries?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37376846", "summary": "Siam or Ayutthaya Kingdom was one of important trade centers in Southeast Asia since the 14th century onwards. The capital of kingdom was Ayutthaya located along the Chao Phraya River that linked to the Gulf of Thailand. Ayutthaya expanded boundary of kingdom to every direction and many cities were ruled as its dependent or tributary cities. Most of them also supplied local products to Ayutthaya for sale to either domestic or international market. Based on archaeological research, the ceramics are one kind of famous products of Ayutthaya Kingdom. Unglazed earthenware and glazed stoneware with various styles of decoration were widely produced in the kingdom under the Khmer and Chinese influences. Especially at Bang Pun (Suphan Buri), Si Satchanalai (Sawankhalok), Sukhothai, and Bang Rachan (Singburi or Mae Nam Noi) kilns were operated under Ayutthaya as well as these kilns were usually produced the jar, excepted Sukhothai that was not produced it. According to the in-land and underwater archaeological reports, the jars were found in several archaeological contexts especially in capital Ayutthaya, hinterlands, coastal cities, and shipwrecks specifically Chinese, Southeast Asian and European merchant ships, which all dated between the 14th and 18th centuries. The jars especially found in great temples of cities and shipwrecks with their remains still inside suggest they were used to be a jar burial and a container of other smaller products for shipping.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57339181, "asset_id": 37376846, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 465031, "first_name": "Atthasit", "last_name": "Sukkham", "domain_name": "bu-th", "page_name": "AtthasitSukkham", "display_name": "Atthasit Sukkham", "profile_url": "https://bu-th.academia.edu/AtthasitSukkham?f_ri=13299", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/465031/154096/99826360/s65_atthasit.sukkham.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396, "name": "Maritime Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=13299", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24827, "name": "Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 30723, "name": "Maritime Trade Ceramics (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_Trade_Ceramics_Archaeology_?f_ri=13299"}, {"id": 243291, "name": "Ancient Maritime Trade Routes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ancient_Maritime_Trade_Routes?f_ri=13299"}]}, {"id": 37176702, "title": "Smithsonian.com An 800-Year-Old Shipwreck Helps Archaeologists Piece Together Asia's Maritime Trade (Lorraine Boissoneault)", "created_at": "2018-08-03T09:45:36.725-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37176702/Smithsonian_com_An_800_Year_Old_Shipwreck_Helps_Archaeologists_Piece_Together_Asias_Maritime_Trade_Lorraine_Boissoneault_?f_ri=13299", "dom_id": "work_37176702", "summary": "Among the more than 7,500 fragments from the Java Sea shipwreck that reside in Chicago's Field Museum are corroded lumps of iron, exported from China for use as weapons or agricultural tools in Southeast Asia; button-like weights used on merchants' scales; barnacle encrusted chunks of aromatic resin and crumbling ivory; and thousands upon thousands of ceramic wares.
