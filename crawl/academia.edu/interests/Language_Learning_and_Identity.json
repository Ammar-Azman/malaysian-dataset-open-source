Following the poststructuralist paradigm, in contrast to essentialist and structuralist perspectives, identity is seen as a dynamic process, constructed discursively in language use (De Fina et al. 2006). Since identity and language are inseparable (Tabouret-Keller 2000), studying speakers\u2019 identity in second language learning is of great significance, especially in the case of heritage language. Not only does knowing another language change the speakers\u2019 view of the world (Burck 2008), in case of heritage language it also has a specific influence on constructing individual and group identity/ies. In this paper I will discuss the relationship between language competence and identity construction of heritage learners and speakers of Croatian. Heritage language learners differ greatly from other language learners in terms of their language needs and motivation (Cviki\u0107 et al. 2010). Hence studying the fragmented, complex, and dynamic quality of identity is crucial for understanding the process of language learning and identity construction of heritage language learners, as well as understanding the fluidity of personal and group identity/ies, positioning, and belonging. \nKey words:  identity, heritage language, identity construction, Croatian as a heritage language\n\nUnazad dvadesetak godina, identitet se u primijenjenoj lingvistici po\u010deo promatrati kao jedan od klju\u010dnih konstrukta i kao takav je zauzeo va\u017eno mjesto u razli\u010ditim kontekstima u\u010denja stranog jezika (Block 2007). Slijede\u0107i poststrukturalitsi\u010dku paradigmu, za razliku od esencijalisti\u010dke i strukturalisti\u010dke perspektive, identitet se poima kao dinami\u010dan proces uvijek nanovo diskurzivno konstruiran u jezi\u010dnoj uporabi (De Fina et al. 2006). Budu\u0107i da su identitet i jezik neodvojivi (Tabouret-Keller 2000), u kontekstu ovladavanja drugim ili stranim jezikom prou\u010davanje je identiteta govornika neizostavno, a osobito je to va\u017eno u slu\u010daju nasljednog jezika. Osim \u0161to ovladavanje novim jezikom utje\u010de na poimanje svijeta (Burck 2008), u slu\u010daju nasljednog jezika ono na specifi\u010dan na\u010din utje\u010de i na konstrukciju individualnog/ih i grupnog/ih identiteta. U ovom radu bavim se pitanjem utjecaja razine jezi\u010dne kompetencije na konstruiranje identiteta nasljednih govornika hrvatskog jezika. Nasljedni govornici ili u\u010denici nasljednog jezika po svojim se specifi\u010dnim jezi\u010dnim potrebama i motivaciji razlikuju od ostalih u\u010denika stranih jezika (Cviki\u0107 et al. 2010) stoga je prou\u010davanje rascjepkanosti, slo\u017eenosti i dinami\u010dnosti identiteta klju\u010dno za razumijevanje procesa u\u010denja nasljednog jezika i konstruiranja identiteta nasljednih govornika, kao i za shva\u0107anje fluidnosti osobnog/ih i grupnog/ih identiteta, pozicioniranja i osje\u0107aja pripadnosti.\nKlju\u010dne rije\u010di: nasljedni jezik, identitet, konstruiranje

superdiverse societies today. We opt for a realistic, anti-essentialist approach to studying identity practices as discursive orientations towards sets of features that are (or can be) seen as emblematic of particular identities. We draw on the theory of identity in a context of superdiversity proposed by Blommaert and Varis (2013, 2015) to answer the question how authenticity is manufactured by blending a variety of semiotic resources, some of which are sufficient ('enough') to produce a particular targeted authentic identity, and consequently enable others to identify us as 'real', 'authentic' members of social groups. We do so by looking into experiences of foreign language teachers teaching abroad (FLTTA) a specific type of glomads or professionals who live and work abroad, frequently transgressing social, linguistic, and cultural spaces and borders (Podboj & Luji\u0107, 2020). We build on our previous research about Croatian and French FLTTAs, where we investigated how various ideologies and other social aspects of the fragmented spaces they navigate affect their agency and their positioning as multilingual teachers, speakers and learners of certain languages. We expand our findings by looking into the dynamic nature of the concept of enoughness. Our data consists of two segments: personal narratives about FLTTAs professional identity experiences elicited via semi-structured interviews, and open-ended questionnaires, where we specifically focused on the concept of enoughness. The data is analyzed qualitatively and presented as several mini case-studies, with illustrative examples that are thematically related to enoughess. The aim of our analysis was to identify features for \u2018being admitted into and being recognized as\u2019 a FLTTA. More specifically, what makes these individuals being perceived as \u2018having enough\u2019 of FLTTAs\u2019 features, or recognized as \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018authentic\u2019 members of this social group?

There is a common belief that learning an additional language (L2) while surrounded by the L2 in a naturalistic setting is best. Theories of identity and language learning have destabilized this notion, pointing to the effects of ongoing identity construction on learning. While forming identities in the L2, a learner invests in certain groups of speakers (often imagined communities), leading them to seek out such speakers.

These dimensions concern linguistic recognition, communicability, sustainability and integration. \r\n\r\nWhile accepting the utility of having an inter-national language, the keystone of the system is clearly that it must ensure the linguistic sustainability of each group.

(2018). Constructing identities and negotiating ideologies with Chinese popular culture in adult Mandarin learning. Global Chinese, 4(1), 37-61.\n\nDespite the emergence of Chinese as a global language, little research has been done to explore how learners of Chinese as an Additional Language (CAL), and Mandarin specifically, utilize semiotic resources in Chinese popular culture to negotiate their own and others' language ideologies and identities. Based on Luke (2005), Blommaert (2006), and others' work, this study argues that popular culture is a rich site for ideological and identity work in which four sorts of questions can be explored: (1) Which language(s)? (2) Whose language? (3) Which texts and discourses? (4) What social implications? Employing this framework, this study draws on three focal adult participants' reported experiences of engaging with Chinese popular culture as a means of improving their Mandarin proficiency. We discuss such themes as gender and heritage learner identity, and political ideologies and dispositions arising from the study. We conclude, briefly, with some implications for Chinese language education and for future research on this topic.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57346468, "asset_id": 31739911, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23152685, "first_name": "Patricia (Patsy)", "last_name": "Duff", "domain_name": "ubc", "page_name": "PatriciaDuff", "display_name": "Patricia (Patsy) Duff", "profile_url": "https://ubc.academia.edu/PatriciaDuff?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23152685/6287841/7118633/s65_patricia.duff.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9801, "name": "Chinese Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language_and_Culture?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21475, "name": "Foreign language teaching and learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_language_teaching_and_learning?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 39095, "name": "Chinese Language Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Language_Teaching?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 407803, "name": "Teaching and Learning of Chinese as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_and_Learning_of_Chinese_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 28644067, "title": "RELIGIOUS EDUCATION AND CHARACTER FORMATION: AN INDONESIAN CONTEXT", "created_at": "2016-09-21T07:52:51.921-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28644067/RELIGIOUS_EDUCATION_AND_CHARACTER_FORMATION_AN_INDONESIAN_CONTEXT?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_28644067", "summary": "The Second Vatican Council cautioned regarding the increasing secularization of Western societies that the greatest error of our age is the separation between faith and life. Through its history of the kingdoms of Buddhism and Hinduism, 350 years o f Western colonization and growth o f Islam, Indonesia claims to place religion in high regard. Citizens are obligated to proclaim one of the six recognized religions. All schools allocate four hours o f religious teaching weekly. Critics doubt that the teaching of religion in schools will help solve problems. Corruption is rampant and ethnic-religious conflicts are increasing despite the people's claim as a religious nation. The challenge, then, is to integrate religious and character education into the core as well as hidden curriculum and teach students to nurture their faith and moral sense throughout their schooling. This essay explores how religious and character education in the school curriculum endeavors to prepare young people to enhance their intellectual capabilities and form them to be people o f faith and character. INDONESIA AT A CROSSROADS T wenty-five years is a brief time in the history of human civilization. Yet, as the Journal o f Interdisciplinary Studies finds it worthy to be thinking of the next 25 years, for Indonesia, too, the next 25 years are crucial. This is a critical period to stand at the right time in history as Indonesia approaches its centenary in 2045, preparing to play a stronger global role economically and politically, and providing a model of harmony between Islam and democracy. With income per capita expected to reach $5,000 by 2014 (ca. $10,000 by 2020), a model for democracy and moderate Islam, an annual U.S. $60 billion rate of economic growth, and more important, a foreign policy that promotes stability, prosperity, and justice,", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49013846, "asset_id": 28644067, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53768381, "first_name": "Prof. Anita", "last_name": "Lie, MA., Ed.D.", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ProfAnitaLieMAEdD", "display_name": "Prof. Anita Lie, MA., Ed.D.", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ProfAnitaLieMAEdD?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/53768381/38801748/32334124/s65_prof._anita.lie_ma._ed.d..jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31686, "name": "Curriculum and Instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_and_Instruction?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34229, "name": "Teacher professional development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_professional_development?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51126, "name": "English Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Education?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11892540, "title": "Learning to become a second language teacher: Identities in practice.

My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

Stressing that critical pedagogy seeks not only to promote agency but also to contribute to social justice outside of the classroom, we next describe our model melding HL education with community language activism. The program, in which HL and L2 university students of Spanish teach an after-school class for young HL speakers at a local elementary school, builds upon HL speakers\u2019 classroom-based learning of critical language awareness by providing community-based opportunities to enact and strengthen identities as language experts and to contribute to positive social change.

The article examines the trajectory of Bonny Norton's research on identity and language learning, highlighting her construct of investment, developed as a sociological complement to the psychological construct of motivation (Norton, 2013). An important focus of the paper is the expanded 2015 model of investment (Darvin & Norton, 2015), which responds to the changing communicative landscape of an increasingly digital world, and locates investment at the intersection of identity, capital, and ideology. Norton exemplifies her theories with data drawn from her collaborative research on English language learning in Canada, Pakistan, Uganda, and Iran. With reference to digital storytelling as a promising classroom practice, she argues that the challenge for English language teachers internationally is to promote learner investment in the language and literacy practices of classrooms by increasing the range of identities available to English language learners.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46181233, "asset_id": 25815304, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49587274, "first_name": "Bonny", "last_name": "Norton", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BonnyNorton", "display_name": "Bonny Norton", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BonnyNorton?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49587274/15664524/40227408/s65_bonny.norton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 462267, "title": "Seeing and Saying Things In English", "created_at": "2011-03-03T08:31:49.233-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/462267/Seeing_and_Saying_Things_In_English?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_462267", "summary": "How to teach the relativity of the concept of 'English', the relationship between language and 'thought', and strategies for adapting one's 'English' to the mind set of one's interlocutor. \r\n\r\nLa relativit\u00e0 del concetto di \"inglese\", il rapporto tra linguaggio e \"pensiero\", nonch\u00e9, in virt\u00f9 di ci\u00f2, le strategie per meglio adattare ai propri interlocutori il proprio modo di parlare in inglese.\r\n.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 2139350, "asset_id": 462267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 349448, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "Boylan", "domain_name": "uniroma3", "page_name": "PatrickBoylan", "display_name": "Patrick Boylan", "profile_url": "https://uniroma3.academia.edu/PatrickBoylan?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/349448/94570/106209/s65_patrick.boylan.gif"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 930, "name": "Intercultural Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Communication?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1417, "name": "Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Acquisition?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11834, "name": "Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Culture?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12563, "name": "Language Learning Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_Strategies?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 19513, "name": "Language Across Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Across_Culture?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 21475, "name": "Foreign language teaching and learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_language_teaching_and_learning?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 27429, "name": "Culture and Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_and_Language?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 31480, "name": "Cross-Cultural Communicaiton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Communicaiton?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 33323, "name": "Intercultural Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Competence?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 36495, "name": "Cross-Cultural Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Communication?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 40977, "name": "Second Language Learner Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Learner_Self_and_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 59891, "name": "Language and Culture, Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Culture_Language_and_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 62937, "name": "Teaching culture in foreign languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_culture_in_foreign_languages?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 36127058, "title": "Gatekeeping and Meaning: Tensions in Teaching Standardized English Language Conventions", "created_at": "2018-03-10T11:25:21.629-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36127058/Gatekeeping_and_Meaning_Tensions_in_Teaching_Standardized_English_Language_Conventions?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_36127058", "summary": "Standardized English language conventions often serve as gatekeepers in classrooms, preventing many students -- particularly language minoritized students -- from constructing identities as writers.

We rely on a sociocultural understandings of language, literacy, and literacy instruction in order to map classroom Discourse regarding conventions, drawing on interviews with Mr. Branson and his students, as well as transcripts of classroom-based teaching and learning.

in Erst- und Familiensprachen darstellen, welche Haltungen und Ziele sie mit dem Erwerb dieser Sprachen verbinden und wie der relative Status einer Sprache (Unterrichtsprache, Familiensprache,

These strategies are, therefore, related to some other social variables which are central to pragmatic development such as L2 social identity. Because of the importance of the IPLS and the rarity of research about the relationship between IPLS and with L2 social identity as a highly pragmatic-oriented variable, the current study tried to investigate the contribution of various forms of IPLS to L2 social identity among a randomly selected sample of 125 upper-intermediate to advanced EFL learners at a state university in Iran. During the two-phased data collection procedure, first, the participants filled out Locastro's (2001) L2 social identity questionnaire, and then Malmir and Tajeddin's (2015) IPLS inventory in two subsequent sessions. Data analysis using multiple regression revealed that all types of IPLS were significant contributors to L2 social identity except for the memory IPLS. Among the other five types of IPLS, social IPLS was a significant and strong contributor to L2 social identity. Affective and compensatory IPLS were significant moderate contributors to L2 social identity; however, metacognitive and cognitive interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies were weak albeit significant predictors of Iranian EFL learners' social identity in English as an L2. The results of this study imply that L2 teachers can enhance social identity among the learners by fostering the knowledge of various forms of IPLS.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65775120, "asset_id": 45187522, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 536735, "first_name": "Ali", "last_name": "Malmir", "domain_name": "ikiu", "page_name": "AliMalmir", "display_name": "Ali  Malmir", "profile_url": "https://ikiu.academia.edu/AliMalmir?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/536735/191886/10332414/s65_ali.malmir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2238, "name": "Pragmatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pragmatics?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37254, "name": "Language And Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_And_Social_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40868, "name": "Speech acts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Speech_acts?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 41766, "name": "Experimental Pragmatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Pragmatics?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 44436, "name": "Interlanguage Pragmatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interlanguage_Pragmatics?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 468222, "name": "L2 Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/L2_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 958649, "name": "Theory of Speech Acts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theory_of_Speech_Acts?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 978173, "name": "The Speech Acts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Speech_Acts?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 983083, "name": "Language and Identity Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity_Studies?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3370787, "name": "Pragmatic Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pragmatic_Strategies?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3901598, "name": "Interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interlanguage_pragmatic_learning_strategies?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3901599, "name": "Interlanguage pragmatic learning strategies (IPLS) ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interlanguage_pragmatic_learning_strategies_IPLS_?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3901600, "name": "Interlanguage Pragmatic Learning Strategies (IPLS) ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interlanguage_Pragmatic_Learning_Strategies_IPLS_-1?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3901601, "name": "IPLS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IPLS?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3901602, "name": "pragmatic learning strategies ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/pragmatic_learning_strategies?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 3901603, "name": "L2 social identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/L2_social_identity?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 14328389, "title": "\u201cI Wanted to Fit In\u201d: A Young Filipino Immigrant\u2019s Story\u2028 of Transitioning and Identity Positioning in his New Communities", "created_at": "2015-07-23T04:55:59.003-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14328389/_I_Wanted_to_Fit_In_A_Young_Filipino_Immigrant_s_Story_of_Transitioning_and_Identity_Positioning_in_his_New_Communities?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_14328389", "summary": "Narrative analysis in applied linguistics has been a useful tool in looking at how immigrants (re)negotiate and (re)construct their identities in the new environment in which they navigate themselves (Pavlenko, 2007). The main goal of this paper is to report on a positioning analysis of a young Filipino immigrant\u2019s stories of transitioning in his new communities in Hawaii. As Bamberg (2001) espoused, positioning analysis is done by looking at the content and characters in the story, how the storyteller positions himself to the audience or the storytelling world, and how the narrator positions himself in and is positioned by the bigger discourses or the macro-context. The analysis reveals that KC, the participant interviewee, being an immigrant, consistently positioned himself as a newcomer, a reticent student, and a fairly competent (or illegitimate) user of the English language. At the same time, KC demonstrates agency by becoming \u2018investigator\u2019 in his attempt to comprehend his classmates\u2019 behavior of \u2018othering\u2019 him once they knew he was immigrant. Inadvertently, my identity as Filipino researcher-interviewer also helped KC\u2019s identity (re)construction. In other words, my questions and different roles as a supporter, listener, and sympathizer, helped KC\u2019s own sense making of his own life history. The analysis also reveals that KC\u2019s identity as a young Filipino immigrant positions him within the greater discourse of Filipino immigration in Hawaii, one which is enmeshed in Hawaii\u2019s long history of uneducated, abused, and unskilled Filipino plantation workers (Jubilado, 2013). Because of these marginalizing discourses, KC shows great investment in the English language and perceives high proficiency in it as his ticket towards asserting (or maintaining) legitimate membership in his new communities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38269344, "asset_id": 14328389, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1272192, "first_name": "Jayson", "last_name": "Parba", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "JParba", "display_name": "Jayson Parba", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/JParba?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1272192/467372/50884573/s65_jayson.parba.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42654570, "title": "EFL and Local Identities", "created_at": "2020-04-07T09:59:40.380-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42654570/EFL_and_Local_Identities?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_42654570", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62861500, "asset_id": 42654570, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59033364, "first_name": "Joshua James", "last_name": "Zwisler", "domain_name": "ut-co", "page_name": "JoshuaJamesZwisler", "display_name": "Joshua James  Zwisler", "profile_url": "https://ut-co.academia.edu/JoshuaJamesZwisler?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/59033364/15700664/93385513/s65_joshua_james.zwisler.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1354857, "name": "Foreign Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37981132, "title": "Gender, neoliberalism and distinction through linguistic capital: Taiwanese narratives of struggle and strategy", "created_at": "2018-12-14T20:34:39.921-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37981132/Gender_neoliberalism_and_distinction_through_linguistic_capital_Taiwanese_narratives_of_struggle_and_strategy?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_37981132", "summary": "This book presents the narratives of four Taiwanese young women, all proficient in English, set against the background of the dynamics of multilingualism in Taiwan.

The \u201ceveryday\u201d activity of cooking is examined using field notes gathered through participant observations, diary entries, and semistructured inter- views with child and adult participants. The fieldwork sample included 18 participants age 9 to 11 years and two adult participants. The sociocultural nature of the children\u2019s learning during cooking practices was tracked over a 14-week period. Observed incidences of situated learning, legitimate peripheral participation, and guided participation were tracked throughout the fieldwork period. The analysis identifies the processes through which participants are able to contribute to and distribute shared knowledge. Through tracking the collaborative learning processes and the contrasting pedagogical practices, the research identified the learning trajectory of the \u201cnewbies\u201d via legitimate peripheral participation (as observers and silent contributors), and explored how, through fractionally increasing participa- tion, the newbies become main members (masters) of this community of practice. The findings confirm children\u2019s collaborative cooking practices as a lens through which social interaction and collaboration can be examined, while also highlighting the complexity of opposing pedagogical practices.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56453470, "asset_id": 36534121, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81179119, "first_name": "Caroline", "last_name": "Bligh", "domain_name": "leedsbeckett", "page_name": "CarolineBligh", "display_name": "Caroline Bligh", "profile_url": "https://leedsbeckett.academia.edu/CarolineBligh?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81179119/27689793/25996073/s65_caroline.bligh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7915, "name": "Silence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silence?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11834, "name": "Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Culture?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 107846, "name": "Selective Mutism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Selective_Mutism?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 941914, "name": "English As An Additional Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_As_An_Additional_Language?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 1007166, "name": "Sociocultural Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociocultural_Analysis?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 35337627, "title": "Fostering Academic and Social Growth in a Primary Literacy Workshop Classroom: \"Restorying\" Students with Negative Reputations", "created_at": "2017-12-04T13:39:14.747-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35337627/Fostering_Academic_and_Social_Growth_in_a_Primary_Literacy_Workshop_Classroom_Restorying_Students_with_Negative_Reputations?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_35337627", "summary": "In most classrooms, there are students who have academic,\r\nbehavioral, and/or interpersonal challenges that\r\ncan disrupt the classroom community.

Although there is some evidence of reflective writing within the field of English for academic purposes (Granville & Dison, 2005) there is still much room for research into understanding the benefits of reflective writing in EAP regarding learner identity and transition. Reflective writing can be \u2018treated as part of the writing process\u2019 (Felix, 2011:46) rather than extraneous, and reflective writing can, over time, evidence to learners and teaching staff the development of the learners\u2019 learner identity from a course\u2019s start to finish while developing their metacognitive abilities (Moon, 2006). Reflective writing can also help learners improve their understanding of who they are as learners by developing a consciousness of their identity through their own voices (Moon, 2006), which in the context of EAP, can empower learners in transitioning from, for example, a learner on a pre-sessional or pre-Masters course to one on an undergraduate or masters-level course. Finally, reflective writing can allow learners to construct a common ground informed by their personal, lived experiences. Some of these are likely shared with their peer \u2018novice-learners\u2019 (Wenger, 1998), and other experiences are likely to assist learners in supporting each other\u2019s learning and transitioning. In this process, tutors act as \u2018expert-learners\u2019 (Wenger, 1998) who engage with the learners\u2019 narratives to encourage learners to analyse their reflections to approximate a deeper understanding of themselves as learners and their feelings regarding their performance on a course (Felix, 2011:46) in order to engage better within a community of practice (the academy) and become a member thereof.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50597301, "asset_id": 30139483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 171458, "first_name": "Dustin", "last_name": "Hosseini", "domain_name": "glasgow", "page_name": "DustinHosseini", "display_name": "Dustin Hosseini", "profile_url": "https://glasgow.academia.edu/DustinHosseini?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/171458/43029/19244654/s65_dustin.hosseini.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29169, "name": "Reflection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reflection?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33256, "name": "Community Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Learning?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50732, "name": "Community of Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_of_Practice?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 326026, "name": "Learner Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learner_Identity?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 2462853, "title": "\u201eDer franz\u00f6sischen Sprache m\u00e4chtig\u201c.

The data was\ncompiled using two research methods \u2013 a questionnaire completed by\nthe students and an interview done with their English teachers. The\nstudy incorporated 158 third- and fourth-grade students from the Sixth\nand Fifth Belgrade High School and three teachers. The analysis of the\nresponses confirms the hypotheses, with special emphasis on the fact\nthat the teachers are responsible for the formation of the students\u2019\nidentities. However, the data also reveals the existence of a small but\ndistinct and vociferous minority of students who identify themselves\nwith the English speech community. Therefore, not only should ELT\npractitioners in Serbia work on developing the learners\u2019 critical thinking\nskills and introducing world Englishes into the classroom, but they\nshould also attune their approach to students with both instrumental\nand integrative motivation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84328689, "asset_id": 76715336, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 180725774, "first_name": "Tamara", "last_name": "To\u0161i\u0107", "domain_name": "filoloskibg", "page_name": "TamaraTo\u0161i\u0107", "display_name": "Tamara To\u0161i\u0107", "profile_url": "https://filoloskibg.academia.edu/TamaraTo%C5%A1i%C4%87?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/180725774/78882169/67440539/s65_tamara.to_i_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10632, "name": "World Englishes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Englishes?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46956, "name": "Language Learning motivation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_motivation?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126788, "name": "English Language Teaching (ELT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_Teaching_ELT_?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 366971, "name": "Belgrade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belgrade?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 57524182, "title": "Identity and Language Learning: Extending the Conversation (2nd ed.). by Bonny Norton", "created_at": "2021-10-13T06:46:43.580-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/57524182/Identity_and_Language_Learning_Extending_the_Conversation_2nd_ed_by_Bonny_Norton?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_57524182", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72385679, "asset_id": 57524182, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49587274, "first_name": "Bonny", "last_name": "Norton", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BonnyNorton", "display_name": "Bonny Norton", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BonnyNorton?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49587274/15664524/40227408/s65_bonny.norton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50569, "name": "Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 237346, "name": "Bilingual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 508371, "name": "Curriculum and Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_and_Pedagogy?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 43560215, "title": "Linguagens, Identidades e Sociedade", "created_at": "2020-07-08T17:52:09.490-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43560215/Linguagens_Identidades_e_Sociedade?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_43560215", "summary": "Os seis artigos que apresentamos neste n\u00famero especial da revista Cadernos de Linguagem e Sociedade (v.21, n.1) -

The group also partners with other organizations in various countries to operate study-abroad and other foreign exchange programs. Hippo's primary activity, though, is the self-directed study of multiple foreign languages. The organization sells audio recordings that relate stories in multiple languages. Club members believe that by listening to these stories and repeating their content, attending weekly chapter meetings where they practice speaking, and participating with the club's exchange programs they can acquire the ability to speak many foreign languages.\n\nThis dissertation presents an ethnographic study of Hippo Family Club practices in Japan and the United States. The analysis presented here is based on ethnographic field work in several sites, including Osaka and Kanagawa prefectures in Japan and Massachusetts in the United States, between 2005 and 2009. During this time I participated as a member of Karagoku Family, a Hippo Family Club chapter in Osaka prefecture. I also participated on various occasions with several other chapters, interviewed members of the various chapters, and recorded interactions at weekly meetings. The study combines ethnography with discourse analysis.\n\nI argue that club members in Japan and the USA view the learning of multiple languages as a means to build a form of cosmopolitan citizenship. Cosmopolitan citizenship is a view of personal identity formed not within the nation-state but as a member of a transnational group. Club members view themselves as part of a global community of fellow club members and language learners. This view of identity freed from national or ethnic groups and instead tied to an international organization is seen as a break from Japanese tradition. In contrast, even though club chapters in the United States use the same learning materials and express ideas about language learning that appear very similar to those expressed in Japan, American members do not experience the same break from tradition.  Given the differences in US and Japanese ideologies of language learning, American members view Hippo as an addition to traditional practices.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 868082, "asset_id":

Through these various channels it becomes clear that perception of a potentially vast reading public wields a subtle but important influence, and experiences with the Wikipedia community also play a role, motivating some participants to think deeply about their writing and prompting them to invest in writer identities online and in their local context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50929112, "asset_id": 11475012, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 89923, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "King", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "BrianKing", "display_name": "Brian W King", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/BrianKing?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/89923/25017/6805471/s65_brian.king.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1009, "name": "Computer Assisted Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Assisted_Language_Learning?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5401, "name": "Computer-Mediated Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer-Mediated_Communication?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9609, "name": "Second Language Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Writing?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13382, "name": "Communities of practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communities_of_practice?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 15439, "name": "Teaching English As A Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_As_A_Foreign_Language?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 22085, "name": "Language socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_socialization?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 28054, "name": "Online Communities of Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Communities_of_Practice?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 35049, "name": "Wikipedia Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wikipedia_Studies?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 46956, "name": "Language Learning motivation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_motivation?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 50569, "name": "Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 113295, "name": "teaching academic writing to ESL or L2 students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/teaching_academic_writing_to_ESL_or_L2_students?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 202887, "name": "ICT in teaching  and learning English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICT_in_teaching_and_learning_English_language?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 220694, "name": "Publics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Publics?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 772391, "name": "Writer identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Writer_identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 1019264, "name": "Technology In Second Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_In_Second_Language_Learning?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 8446500, "title": "CAES International Conference Faces of English: Theory, Practice And Pedagogy", "created_at": "2014-09-22T17:42:35.813-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8446500/CAES_International_Conference_Faces_of_English_Theory_Practice_And_Pedagogy?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_8446500", "summary": "As \u201cAsia\u2019s World City\u201d, Hong Kong is a place where \u2018faces\u2019 from all parts of the globe come to work, study, and play together, and HKU is its most international university.

language learners. Gumbrecht (2004) suggested that blogging provides the writer with more control over the communication episode and is therefore the preferred mode of interaction for some people. This study investigates the suitability of this concept for language learning. The discussion is based on the experience of 15 language learners who used a blog for self-reflection and\npeer-to-peer interaction as part of a tertiary German language course. The experience of these learners shows that blogging can provide language learners with a personal space in which they feel safe to express themselves and to interact with other learners. Blogging can therefore have a positive effect on their willingness to communicate, which is one of the main objectives in second language education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 817500,

"This article reports the results of an exploratory study on how third-generation American-born Africans (ABAs) (i.e., descendants of African immigrants born and raised in the United States) construct their identities in and through learning African languages as heritage languages. Drawing from qualitative data in the form of in-depth interviews, the article argues that while ABAs contest and negotiate their identities through learning African languages and through other, multimodal semiotic practices such as clothing, there is a prevalent valorization of African identity indexed by proficiency in an African language irrespective of whether this is a heritage language. The impetus for this valorization of heritage identity is feelings of dislocation and delocalization resulting from erasure of ABAs\u2019 English native-speakerhood and constant misidentification as non-Americans by the dominant culture. Learning heritage languages fosters a sense of belonging and connection with an \u201cimagined\u201d home located \u201cthere\u201d as distinct from \u201chere.\u201d Thus, through heritage language learning, ABAs construct an \u201cidentity of resistance.\u201d The article concludes by pointing out how positive heritage identity metamorphoses into an awareness of not only the cultural and symbolic value of heritage languages but also the potential of translating proficiency in one\u2019s heritage language(s) into economic capital in the global market.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56475808, "asset_id": 36550934, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51768987, "first_name": "Busi", "last_name": "Makoni", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BusiMakoni", "display_name": "Busi  Makoni", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BusiMakoni?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51768987/14118037/48253284/s65_busi.makoni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 12420729, "title": "The cultural component in the first Language (L1) teaching: cultural heritage, identity and motivation in language learning", "created_at": "2015-05-17T01:52:53.737-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12420729/The_cultural_component_in_the_first_Language_L1_teaching_cultural_heritage_identity_and_motivation_in_language_learning?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_12420729", "summary": "After almost three decades since the insertion of Catalan (Valencian) within the Valencian education system, its use hasn\u2019t spread through all of the geographical domains and social scopes.

For a start we take into consideration a hipothesis defending that even though a comprehension of the goal culture in L2 is not just necessary for a significant use of the language within its society, we also have to realise the importance of the cultural import when using L1. We\u2019ve framed our working field within some research projects which focus on the value of cultural imput in L1 and L2 teaching-learning areas (Kramsch, 1996, Rusell, 1999, Areitzaga, 2005). Another important approach for us is the collective dimension of motivation and attitude as notions traditionally associated with personal factors (Cambra, 2003). We aim at researching in a language representation basis in order to be able to understand the lecturer's approach to linguistic representations on the cultural imput when teaching a language (Moore, 2001, Cambra & Palou, 2007). We aply an ethnographic field work based on questionnaires conducted by lecturers from two education centres within Valencian central shires where students show a higher level of learning and usage of Valencian. These centres then propose crucial cross-cutting projects, where the own culture and language have a significant weight, focusing on the relationship between cultural heritage, land and identity.

However, it has been widely contested to what degree developments in autonomy and identity can be induced in the formal institutional foreign language (FL) context. As complex constructs with their own integrity, autonomy and identity have rarely been studied together, despite assumptions about their interrelatedness.\n\nThis longitudinal narrative research derives from an inquiring English as a foreign language (EFL) teacher\u2019s (the author of this dissertation) desire to deepen his understanding of language learning and teaching in a general upper secondary school for adults (GUSSA). In particular, this research is concerned with investigating the FL students\u2019 growth towards autonomy through the lens of FL identity which has been adopted here to refer to any aspect of the person\u2019s identity that is connected to their knowledge or use of the target language (TL).\n\nThe research questions are as follows:\n\n1. What is the language learning process like for a general adult upper secondary student?\na) To what extent are developments in FL identity manifest?\nb) What is essential in the FL teaching framing the students\u2019 language learning?\n2. What is autonomy in (relation to) FL learning in the general adult upper secondary context?\n3. How can autonomy and identity be fostered through FL education?\n\nIn addition to the EFL teacher, the research participants included 34 Finnish-speaking FL students who attended the teacher\u2019s EFL courses in the local GUSSA between spring 2009 and autumn 2012. Due to ethical, epistemological and practical reasons, exploratory practice was adopted as the data collection method to gather a body of narrative research data consisting of the students\u2019 language learning journals, their reflective essay tasks and self-assessments, audio-recorded material from the annual counselling sessions between the students and the teacher, and the teacher\u2019s teaching journal.\n\nThese data contained narrative elements and parts termed language narratives (LaNa). This notion was adopted to refer to culturally rooted and socially constituted, storied experiences of language learning, language use and participation in different TL-related life settings. In this study, these LaNas were examined as contextually anchored spaces for identity construction, in which the language learners gave meaning to their TL-related experiences, made sense of themselves in relation to the TL, and positioned and performed themselves as language learners, communicators, participants and persons over time.\n\nAs to investigating FL learning, five language learning GUSSA students were selected for analysis. Moreover, a sixth student profile consisting of a compilation of eleven EFL students was crafted to be added into the analysis to provide a more comprehensive picture of the GUSSA students in the English courses.\n\nA three-part analysis was conducted on the data gathered from these students and their EFL teacher. In the holistic analysis of narrative form, the six students\u2019 language learning processes were depicted on the basis of their LaNas by graphing the overall development of their English-related subject positions over time. This analysis also involved the identification of key episodes and turning points occurring as part of the students\u2019 language learning processes. The holistic analysis of narrative content consisted of identifying the constituent thematic elements (powerful storylines) in the students\u2019 language learning processes and following their progression over time. On the basis of the key discoveries, the students\u2019 journeys were then transformed (emplotted) into storied, developmental accounts, emplotments, in the third part of the analysis. The emplotments depict the students\u2019 language learning processes in the form of multivoiced narratives.\n\nTo contextualise the FL students\u2019 language learning processes, a similar analysis was conducted on FL teaching in the local GUSSA. First, the collectively experienced meaningfulness of the FL teaching was graphed over time, and the key episodes and turning points of the narrative structure were identified in the holistic analysis of narrative form. Second, the recurrent constituent themes, powerful storylines, embedded in this teaching were identified and the development of these storylines chronologically followed in the holistic analysis of narrative content. Finally, a multivoiced emplotment of this teaching was configured by synthesising the most essential events, actions and experiences into a storied developmental account.\n\nThe analysis of the LaNas revealed the uniqueness and diversity of each student\u2019s experiences. It also enabled a conceptualisation of FL learning through the constructs of FL identity, agency and affordance. The uniqueness and diversity embedded in the processes of FL learning were also reflected in the meanings that the students attributed to their experiences of participating in GUSSA FL teaching. Analysing these meanings promoted a conception of this FL teaching in terms of autonomy, authenticity and affordance.\n\nThis research makes the following claims in answer to research questions 1a and 1b: Despite the uniqueness of the critical experiences triggering identity development, FL identity can be adopted as a framework to capture the language learning processes and outcomes in the FL context of the GUSSA. The identity work underlying the development of FL identity is essentially narrative and involves the potential to expand from one context to another, with the FL context representing an integral though by no means unique site for this process. Empowering reconstructions of FL identity are closely related to the development of personal autonomy. FL identity is manifested through agency in language learning and agency beyond language learning purposes, the development and integration of which will promote the perception of affordances for language learning, use and participation. FL teaching in the local GUSSA can be examined as a pedagogy for co-directed autonomy that fosters social agents capable and willing to use their voice in the TL and exercise their agency flexibly in different sociolinguistic and -cultural contexts. This FL teaching is oriented to fostering the language learning individual\u2019s authentic growth and guiding his/her perceptions towards personally engaging affordances in a complex ecology of TL learning, TL use and participation that extends beyond the formal institutional FL context. In this FL teaching, narrativity plays a more or less central role.\n\nRegarding research question 2, autonomy was conceptualised as the capacity to exercise flexible, authentic control over the different TL-related aspects of the ecology that one inhabits. The core of this autonomy lies in the capacity to control one\u2019s life through the TL. This core is situated across an open, complex ecology where interacting forces influence the person\u2019s capacity to assume this control. Autonomy in this sense involves dependencies (on people, communities, contexts and ideologies) that build an intricate network of belongings, affiliations and relationships providing the language learning person with a range of interrelational spaces for autonomy. Autonomy manifests itself as a dynamic construct that develops temporally, is anchored in place and time, and regulated flexibly. Moreover, the construct is intimately linked to the authenticity of the person engaged with the TL, both in and beyond the institutional FL context.\n\nAs to fostering autonomy and identity through FL education (research question 3), this study implies the need for pedagogies for autonomy to extend beyond learner autonomy and embrace a broad conception of autonomy as a means to foster personal agency, authentic growth and human well-being. The reflective narrativity embedded in the teaching is needed to provide the students with opportunities for on-going self-interpretation, which involves the potential for meaningful identity work. Fostering autonomy and identity presupposes an ecological perspective that views FL learning as a complex enterprise spreading across contexts. As for implications for teacher education, the importance of understanding the full potential of autonomy and identity in FL education is pointed out. From the perspective of educational policy, FL teaching in the GUSSA should be re-organised so that the holistic and processual nature of language learning could be taken into account. Concerning the ethos of the Finnish GUSSA, the GUSSA students should be viewed as individuals learning languages in communities rather than by themselves in isolation from others.\n\nFinally, this research suggests a theoretical model interrelating agency, autonomy and identity in FL education. On the basis of the findings, the three notions can be examined as distinct but closely related constructs in the processes of FL learning. Autonomy and identity develop in a complex, on-going and reciprocal process, in which one influences the other. As an expression of autonomy and identity, personal agency becomes the mediating force between the two constructs, situating them spatially and temporally across the TL-related spheres of life. On the other hand, autonomy and identity development are also fuelled by this agency, the expansion of which beyond language learning is an essential trigger for personal growth.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 447116, "first_name": "Tero", "last_name": "Korhonen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TeroKorhonen", "display_name": "Tero  Korhonen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TeroKorhonen?f_ri=18093", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/447116/144827/10779506/s65_tero.korhonen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 998, "name": "Language Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Education?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1590, "name": "Adult Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adult_Education?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5956, "name": "Learner Autonomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learner_Autonomy?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=18093", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14831, "name": "Narrative and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_and_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 18880, "name": "Narrative Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Analysis?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 21475, "name": "Foreign language teaching and learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_language_teaching_and_learning?f_ri=18093"}, {"id": 50433, "name": "Narrative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Research?f_ri=18093"}]}, {"id": 26395558, "title": "Slaves of sex, money and alcohol: (Re-)Locating the target culture of TESOL", "created_at": "2016-06-21T23:24:27.173-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26395558/Slaves_of_sex_money_and_alcohol_Re_Locating_the_target_culture_of_TESOL?f_ri=18093", "dom_id": "work_26395558", "summary": "In today\u2019s shrinking world, rapidly transforming into a global village, there is a pressing need to appreciate the richness of cultural diversity while maintaining one\u2019s own identity.

She argues that even within a single-language-use setting, especially with a dominant world language such as English, there can be multiple linguistic and identity formations. She frames her argument with Pennycook\u2019s (2010) understanding of language as a dynamic, socially constructed and locally specific form of human interaction. Building on the work of Nunan and Choi (2010) and Rivers and Houghton (2013), she draws parallels between language and communication styles. With examples of gendered speech in the workplace ( Llamas and Watt 2009) and a more contemporary context internet communications ( Nakamura, Chow-White, and Nelson 2011), Rajakumar makes a passionate case for educators to open the communicative space of academic settings to these diverse cultural experiences.
