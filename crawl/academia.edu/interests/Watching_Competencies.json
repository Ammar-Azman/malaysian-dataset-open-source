It is clear that one of the platforms through which to articulate modernity in contemporary Malaysia is the consumption of popular culture. Promoted at first as an appropriate television genre to strengthen the agenda of Malaysian modernity, Asian soap opera has not been without its tensions. Some authorities have expressed anxiety over what they consider to be the negative influences of foreign issues of morality, which they believe might undermine the standards of Malay woman- hood and compromise Malay cultural and national boundaries. Against this perception, however, we propose that urban Malay women negotiate their cultural re- sources to establish specific watching competencies with which to intelligently and adeptly engage foreign lifestyles in Asian soap operas imported to Malaysia. Watching competencies involve an active mobilization of those resources through which Malay women watch these soaps and measure their adherence to tradition. This paper will focus on how selected urban Malay women exercise their cultural resources, particularly those of adat (the traditional Malay custom as practiced by the Malays in Malaysia) and Islam, to form specific watching competencies for engaging with the depictions of complex inappropriate foreign lifestyles portrayed in Asian soap operas.\r\n\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

"work_3588446", "summary": "Soap opera is a potent cultural site for Malay women to imagine the meanings of modernity. Initially the Malaysian government promoted non-Western soap operas to circulate the state\u2019s vision of alternative Asian-style modernities. Now the authorities have voiced a concern that some images and discourses of transnational modernity articulated even in non-Western soaps pose a threat to the cultural integrity of Malay women. This paper studies the significance of non-Western soaps to an understanding of gendered expectations and the progressive re-territorialization of the socio-political order in the context of an ethos of mediatized cultural globalization. Our referent is patriarchal Islamist state Malaysia. We conduct an empirical case study exploring Malay Muslim women\u2019s negotiation and understanding of non-Western soap operas in Malaysia. Results from a series of guided in-depth interviews with 12 rural and urban Malay women enable us to understand how they negotiate their position as viewers of these non-Western soaps, given the criticism about the supposed immorality of these programs. We argue that Malay women act as strategic audiences who mobilize sophisticated viewing tactics that we call \u2018watching competencies\u2019 to negotiate the pleasures and potential conflicts of their access to non-Western soaps. This research indicates that Malay women are neither passive, vulnerable consumers of foreign soap, nor easily manipulated by those who claim authority; rather, they confidently assert their autonomy as consumer-citizens of a modern Islamic state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31597503, "asset_id": 3588446, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

operas with their spectacular representation of consumer culture, have emerged as the most popular television genre among Malay women audiences. This has caused a certain degree of anxiety amongst the local authorities who fear that consumerism has a corruptive effect on the cultural integrity of Malay womanhood. We conducted interviews with rural Malay women, to investigate how women engaged with the images of consumerist modernity depicted in these soaps. In this paper, we want to argue that Malay women do not passively submit to the lures of consumerism, as the authorities allege. Instead, Malay women are discerning viewers who engage critically with the elements of consumer culture in Asian soaps through a worldview formed by Malay cultural values. We elaborate three tactics of such a process of negotiation with relation to the consumerist images of presentation of self: perceiving image as a distant spectacle, observing Islamic injunctions regarding female and exercising personal judgment.
