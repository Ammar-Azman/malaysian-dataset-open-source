Especially in the European context, young German, French or British Muslims are assumed to live a life entirely devoted to religion or to be secular and to consume European youth culture. In the 2000s, however, a new trend has emerged that combines Western forms of pop culture with Islamic substance, e.g. religious hip-hop, sports wear with Islamic slogans or media catering for \"cool\" religious Muslim youths.\n\nThe empirical basis of this research are qualitative data collected in Germany, France and Britain in 2008-2009, comprising in-depth interviews with producers of Islamic youth culture and ethnographies investigating the consumer side. The results will be discussed in light of the societal context of the movement and the tools for grasping it from a subcultural point of view.\n\nThe data suggest that there are five main types of motivation among the producers of Islamic youth culture: political, social, proselytising, artistic and (perhaps) business motives. Young Muslims are negotiating their having a say, confounding their own community by innovative forms of expression and bewildering subcultural scenes by strong moralistic values \u2013 which is why they could be referred to as a \"conservative avant-garde\".", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 3569515, "asset_id": 648926, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10929, "first_name": "Maruta", "last_name": "Herding", "domain_name": "dji", "page_name": "MarutaHerding", "display_name": "Maruta  Herding", "profile_url": "https://dji.academia.edu/MarutaHerding?f_ri=111511", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10929/3673/19957105/s65_maruta.herding.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3351, "name": "Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subcultures?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7419, "name": "Islam in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Europe?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8002, "name": "Youth Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Culture?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15305, "name": "Globalisation and \"global cultural flows\"", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_global_cultural_flows_?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 28733, "name": "Religious Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Subcultures?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 100958, "name": "Youth and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_and_Religion?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 111511, "name": "Young Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_Muslims?f_ri=111511"}]}, {"id": 49193219, "title": "Priority Factors of Online Food Purchasing By Young Muslims", "created_at": "2021-06-09T19:46:23.621-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49193219/Priority_Factors_of_Online_Food_Purchasing_By_Young_Muslims?f_ri=111511", "dom_id": "work_49193219", "summary": "This research is purposed to determine the factors that influence online food purchase decision making, by classifying them into certain classifications, namely primary dish, snack, and beverage, and emphasizing on purchase made online by Universitas Islam Indonesia (UII) Yogyakarta students.

Adopting Shahab Ahmed's (2016) understanding of Islamic in its plenitude and complexity, I ask how Islamic their texts are. The participants, Neda and Mohammed (both pseudonyms), grew up in Islamic countries where they were socialised in faith literacy practices, including practices around sacred and devotional texts, before moving to Norway in their teens. The data used for this article were collected during two linguistic ethnographies and include poems written in and outside of school, fieldnotes from classroom observations and transcripts from multiple semi-structured interviews. The interview questions concerned their poems and writing in general as well as their observations about living as Muslims in Norway. Although their poems include few or no explicit Islamic references, the findings support an argument that an Islamic lens gives meaning to the poems in terms of Islam as they engage with rather differe nt Islamic norms and discourses. Whereas Mohammed's texts are characterised by more prescriptive discourses leaving little room for alternative interpretations, Neda's texts contain more wonder and perplexity and are thus in line with non-prescriptive discourses. I conclude by arguing that 1) the meanings of the poems are enriched in terms of Islam by viewing them through an Islamic lens and that 2) schools should provide safe spaces for young Muslims to develop their meaning-making and writing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62621432, "asset_id": 42449284, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12274643, "first_name": "Joke", "last_name": "Dewilde", "domain_name": "uio", "page_name": "JokeDewilde", "display_name": "Joke Dewilde", "profile_url": "https://uio.academia.edu/JokeDewilde?f_ri=111511", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12274643/3522583/98804458/s65_joke.dewilde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8916, "name": "Islamic Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Art?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111511, "name": "Young Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_Muslims?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1556300, "name": "Self Exploration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Exploration?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1708704, "name": "Islamic Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Poetry?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3605005, "name": "faith literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/faith_literacy?f_ri=111511"}]}, {"id": 3540008, "title": "Redefining \"Malayness\": Expectations of Young-Adult Malaysian Muslims", "created_at": "2013-05-15T12:08:16.425-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3540008/Redefining_Malayness_Expectations_of_Young_Adult_Malaysian_Muslims?f_ri=111511", "dom_id": "work_3540008", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 652821, "first_name": "Dahlia", "last_name": "Martin", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "DahliaMartin", "display_name": "Dahlia Martin", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/DahliaMartin?f_ri=111511", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/652821/226109/752320/s65_dahlia.martin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5815, "name": "Identity politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_politics?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111511, "name": "Young Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_Muslims?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15803088, "title": "A Moment of Persuasion: Travelling Preachers and Islamic Pedagogy in the Netherlands", "created_at": "2015-09-17T05:09:00.977-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15803088/A_Moment_of_Persuasion_Travelling_Preachers_and_Islamic_Pedagogy_in_the_Netherlands?f_ri=111511", "dom_id": "work_15803088", "summary": "In this article, I examine the discursive as well as embodied and sensorial forms of persuasion that undergird the formation of religious authority, Islamic authority in the Netherlands more specifically. I argue that particular momentary occasions can play important roles in facilitating the mobilization of these discursive and non-discursive forms of persuasion. Based on a close reading of an event I participated in during my fieldwork among young Muslims in the Netherlands, the analysis focuses on such a key moment of persuasion, paradoxically characterised by a preacher\u2019s apparently failed attempt at conversion. Despite this failure, this preacher can be seen to have succeeded in offering his young Muslim audience a model of how to be a Muslim and of how to represent Islam to non-Muslims. Apart from contributing to anthropological debates on Islamic authority in Europe and religious persuasion more generally, I discuss an important new type of Islamic leaders \u2013 referred to here as \u2018travelling preachers\u2019 \u2013 and the new kinds of youth-centred settings of religious learning in which they operate.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38799234, "asset_id": 15803088, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1045443, "first_name": "Daan", "last_name": "Beekers", "domain_name": "scp", "page_name": "DaanBeekers", "display_name": "Daan Beekers", "profile_url": "https://scp.academia.edu/DaanBeekers?f_ri=111511", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1045443/360611/10932355/s65_daan.beekers.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 808, "name": "Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7419, "name": "Islam in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Europe?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12388, "name": "Problem of Religious Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Problem_of_Religious_Authority?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=111511", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17818, "name": "Anthropology of Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Europe?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 19635, "name": "Anthropology of the Senses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_the_Senses?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 20153, "name": "Persuasion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persuasion?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 88513, "name": "Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salafism?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 107947, "name": "Anthropology of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Islam?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 111511, "name": "Young Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_Muslims?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 168328, "name": "Islam in the Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Netherlands?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 169804, "name": "The Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Netherlands?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 178041, "name": "Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authority?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 180794, "name": "Islamic preachers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_preachers?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 252358, "name": "Islamic Religious Authority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Religious_Authority?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 252364, "name": "Contemporary Salafism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Salafism?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 546271, "name": "Islamic pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_pedagogy?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 699742, "name": "Religious Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Aesthetics?f_ri=111511"}, {"id": 906981, "name": "Religious Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Leadership?f_ri=111511"}]}, {"id": 76110799, "title": "How Islamic are young Muslim people\u2019s poems?", "created_at": "2022-04-11T05:34:33.211-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76110799/How_Islamic_are_young_Muslim_people_s_poems?f_ri=111511", "dom_id": "work_76110799", "summary": "In this article, I investigate poetry written by two young Muslim people during their spare time. Adopting Shahab Ahmed\u2019s (2016) understanding of Islamic in its plenitude and complexity, I ask how Islamic their texts are. The participants, Neda and Mohammed (both pseudonyms), grew up in Islamic countries where they were socialised in faith literacy practices, including practices around sacred and devotional texts, before moving to Norway in their teens. The data used for this article were collected during two linguistic ethnographies and include poems written in and outside of school, fieldnotes from classroom observations and transcripts from multiple semi-structured interviews. The interview questions concerned their poems and writing in general as well as their observations about living as Muslims in Norway.
