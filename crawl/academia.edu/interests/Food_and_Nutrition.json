However, the senses of smell, touch, sight, hearing, and taste are appealed to when we deal with the production of foods for consumption. The use of the senses, which is quotidian, but equally ephemeral, seems to be outside of the written scholarship produced by historians. The creation, by elites, of taste, of fashion, of \" bon gout \" , are familiar areas of discussion today. This symposium, which will be presented for the 30th anniversary of ICREFH, proposes moving forward in our analysis of this area by drawing on recent research. Each sense can be a separate topic of historical research. However, separating each sense activated by food presents a somewhat impoverished image. In fact, all the senses are at work when we are eating. Thus, let us take them as a whole so as to seize a \" balance of the senses \" (Corbin), a rapport among them which can appear in the form of a hierarchy or of a balance. This ensemble is produced, it grows, it transforms, and then it sometimes disappears. Actually, the enhancement of taste indicates a constructed and deliberate hierarchical organization. In the same way, a crunch activates our sense of hearing initially, with the other senses staying in the background. All of this remains to be explored in order to evaluate and historicise the place accorded to the senses vis-\u00e0-vis food by 19th and 20th century society. We shall approach the history of food and the senses by means of an event, a product, a particular source (a family journal, a cookery book...), prohibitions, speeches\u2026 On the basis of already familiar archives or by utilising lesser known sources is it possible to generate new avenues of research or to reinterpret previous research? Three main themes have been adopted, but the organizing committee is open to other proposals: 1 \u2013 An analysis of the hierarchy of the senses in the 19th and 20th centuries, and their transformations: these can be produced in various ways: \u2022 By vocabulary: In this time period how was specific vocabulary constructed (e.g., for wine), how were words for food and the senses created? Some words disappear or change their meaning. \u2022 Can we observe geographical food distinctions that arose from the senses? Did the combination of the senses and food play a part in the creation of nations or of nationalism (national dishes and the senses that are particularly connected to them). Can we distinguish between the senses developed at home, and those developed outside of the home? Do there exist places of intensity for the senses (the kitchen, for example)? Seasons? \u2022 Is the appeal of the senses a function of social group, stages in life, type, body type (fat or thin, small or large, healthy?). The analogy between body odours or social position and certain dishes and their odours should perhaps be explored: foot odour/ cheese; poverty/cabbage smell; wealth/gameyness. \u2022 The industrialization of the senses: a new hierarchy? 2 \u2013 Production and construction of norms Are there rules, and how are they applied when it is a question of combining colours, forms, tastes, and odours? We can envisage the roles of regulations, European or national, of specific trades (doctors, cooks\u2026), hygiene and the senses, the media: the press, radio, books, religion\u2026", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56249213, "asset_id": 36341112, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13941, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Scholliers", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PScholliers", "display_name": "Peter Scholliers", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PScholliers?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13941/4680/4872108/s65_peter.scholliers.jp2"}, {"id": 32500029, "first_name": "Sylvie", "last_name": "Vabre", "domain_name": "univ-tlse2", "page_name": "SVabre", "display_name": "Sylvie Vabre", "profile_url": "https://univ-tlse2.academia.edu/SVabre?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32500029/19452282/19369964/s65_sylvie.vabre.png"}, {"id": 2722478, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Atkins", "domain_name": "durham", "page_name": "PeterAtkins", "display_name": "Peter Atkins", "profile_url": "https://durham.academia.edu/PeterAtkins?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2722478/1208574/1512881/s65_pete.pete_atkins.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1081, "name": "Food Safety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Safety?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4000, "name": "Anthropology of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4468, "name": "Food Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Engineering?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5130, "name": "History of the Senses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Senses?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 6858, "name": "Food History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_History?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 22251, "name": "Agriculture and Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture_and_Food_Studies?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 31630, "name": "Food Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Processing?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 38360, "name": "Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 114660, "name": "Sociology of Taste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Taste?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 165437, "name": "Taste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taste?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 217497, "name": "Food and Beverage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Beverage?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 359994, "name": "Aesthetics of Taste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics_of_Taste?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 21468972, "title": "WINE TASTING AND CRITIQUE: BIAS, ERRORS, MISCONCEPTIONS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THE MARKET", "created_at": "2016-02-02T10:31:19.772-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21468972/WINE_TASTING_AND_CRITIQUE_BIAS_ERRORS_MISCONCEPTIONS_AND_THEIR_INFLUENCE_ON_THE_MARKET?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_21468972", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41895408, "asset_id": 21468972, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42547982, "first_name": "Jos\u00e9 Luiz", "last_name": "Borges", "domain_name": "hospitalsiriolibanes", "page_name": "Jos\u00e9LuizBorges", "display_name": "Jos\u00e9 Luiz  Borges", "profile_url": "https://hospitalsiriolibanes.academia.edu/Jos%C3%A9LuizBorges?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 161, "name": "Neuroscience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neuroscience?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 16595256, "title": "The Azolla Cooking and Cultivation Project", "created_at": "2015-10-09T04:43:37.498-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16595256/The_Azolla_Cooking_and_Cultivation_Project?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_16595256", "summary": "In \"The Azolla Cooking and Cultivation Project\", artists, researchers, farmers, gardeners, chefs and scientists experiment with cooking and cultivating the water fern Azolla.

Consumption of seafood represents one major pathway for the exposure of human to microplastic. Microplastics may pass up to higher levels in food chain. Three likely toxic effects of plastic particles have been put forward: the release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) adsorbed to the plastics, leaching of plastic additives, and plastic particles themselves. Chemical additives such as bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), bisphenol S (BPS), etc., used in plastic production pose several health risks to both humans and animals. Due to the use of some chemical additives during production of plastics, plastics have potentially risk and harmful effects that could be carcinogenic or encourage endocrine disruption. Some of the chemical additives are used as phthalate plasticizers (phthalates) and brominated flame retardants. By biomonitoring, chemicals in plastics, such as phthalates and BPA, have been identified in human population. Humans are exposed to the chemicals through the skin, nose, or mouth. Bisphenol A (BPA) can disrupt normal, regular physiological levels of sex hormones. Recent studies suggest that BPS also has endocrine disrupting properties, just like BPA. The presence of a hydroxy group on the benzene ring makes bisphenol S and bisphenol A endocrine disruptors. A widespread concern about phthalate exposure is the possibility that it is the cause of a drop in male fertility. Some recent studies suggest that tetrabromobisphenol A may be an endocrine disruptor and immunotoxicant. As an endocrine disruptor, tetrabromobisphenol A may interfere with both estrogens and androgens. There is also growing concern that PBDEs share the environmental long life and bioaccumulation properties of polychlorinated dibenzodioxins. It is not known if PBDEs can cause cancer in people, although liver tumors developed in rats and mice that ate extremely large amounts of decaBDE throughout their lifetime. The use of biodegradable plastics, policymaking, institutional arrangements, plastic waste collection, promotion of non-usage and lessening usage, incineration, use of the enzyme PETase, and creating awareness, in addition to banning have been the active ways for the management of plastic pollution.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61577846, "asset_id": 41383823, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 70707312, "first_name": "Chinaza", "last_name": "Awuchi", "domain_name": "kiu-ug", "page_name": "ChinazaAwuchi", "display_name": "Chinaza G Awuchi", "profile_url": "https://kiu-ug.academia.edu/ChinazaAwuchi?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/70707312/18522146/42710628/s65_chinaza.awuchi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 154, "name": "Endocrinology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endocrinology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 586, "name": "Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Sciences?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25630, "name": "Endocrinology & Metabolism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endocrinology_and_Metabolism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 53714, "name": "Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plastic_and_Reconstructive_Surgery?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 289282, "name": "Reproductive Histology and Endocrinology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reproductive_Histology_and_Endocrinology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 477086, "name": "The Endocrine System Function", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Endocrine_System_Function?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 722106, "name": "Plastic waste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plastic_waste?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 77702506, "title": "What is Keto Diet and Best Keto Meal Plan", "created_at": "2022-04-26T11:48:43.003-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77702506/What_is_Keto_Diet_and_Best_Keto_Meal_Plan?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_77702506", "summary": "A lot of people especially women above 40 has been wondering about if KETO would really be helpful for them.

This has led to a number of scientific studies identifying food and food components that have specific health benefits. Functional foods are defined as foods that, in addition to nutrients, supply the organism with components that contribute to the cure of diseases, or to reduce the risk of developing them. One of the first countries in the world to recognize the concept of functional foods was Japan. The Japanese government defines FOSHU (Foods for Specific Health Use) as Foods which are expected to have certain health benefits, and have been\nlicensed to bear a label in the product claiming the health effect (Sanders, 1998).\nThe establishment of a microflora rich in bifidobacteria poses an advantage with respect to maintaining and improving health. In the past two to three decades, one of the main targets of the functional food industry has been the development of products aimed at improving gut health. The idea of manipulating the intestinal microflora in order to prolong life can be tracked down to the early part of the twentieth century. In 1907, the Nobel Prize winner Eli Metchnikoff published his book The Prolongation of Life, where he postulated that the long life span of Bulgarian people was due to the consumption of fermented milks that contained the microorganism Bacillus bulgaricus, currently known as Lactobacillus delbrueckii. According to Metchnikoff, the consumption of these bacteria would have the effect of eliminating putrefactive bacteria in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In the same period, the French pediatrician Henry Tissier discovered the predominance of bifidobacteria in the feces of The establishment of a microflora rich in bifidobacteria poses an advantage with respect to maintaining and improving health.

Later, Parker (1974, pp. 366)\nchanged this definition to \u201corganisms and substances that contribute to intestinal balance.\u201d\nFuller (1989, pp. 366) eliminated the concept of substances from the definition\nof probiotics, and substituted it for \u201clive microbial feed supplements which beneficially\naffect the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance.\u201d This definition\nwas later extended to include a viable mono or mixed culture of bacteria that\nwill beneficially affect the host when applied to human or animals by improving the\nproperties of the indigenous microflora. Contrarily, Salminen et al. (1999, pp. 109)\nstated that there are documented health effects of nonviable probiotics and even the\ncell wall components on some probiotic microbes. This led to the establishment of\nthe following definition: \u201cProbiotics are microbial cell preparations or components of\nmicrobial cells that have a beneficial effect on the health and well-being of the host.\u201d\nThis definition introduces a second novelty with respect to the one proposed by Fuller,\nand it is the beneficial effect of probiotics on human health in general rather than\nspecifically on intestinal health. The most accepted definition nowadays is that given\nby the World Health Organization as \u201clive microorganisms that, when administered\nin adequate amounts confer a health benefit to the host\u201d (Araya et al., 2002, pp. 8).\nPrebiotics have been defined as nondigestible food ingredients beneficially affecting\nthe host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of a limited number\nof bacteria in the colon and thus improving the host health (Gibson et al., 2004b).\nProbiotics and prebiotics can be combined in symbiotic preparations (symbiotics).\nThese mixtures beneficially affect the host in different ways. For instance, by improving\nthe survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the GIT;\nby selectively stimulating the growth and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a\nlimited number of health-promoting bacteria, and thus improving the host well-being\n(Hamilton-Miller, 2003).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56252544, "asset_id": 36344212, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7194473, "first_name": "Ernesto", "last_name": "Hernandez", "domain_name": "canterbury", "page_name": "ErnestoHernandez", "display_name": "Ernesto Hernandez", "profile_url": "https://canterbury.academia.edu/ErnestoHernandez?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7194473/9839114/19342008/s65_ernesto.hernandez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4468, "name": "Food Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Engineering?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4542, "name": "Probiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Probiotics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 16137, "name": "Food Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Chemistry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 18329, "name": "Prebiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prebiotics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 30617, "name": "Food Process Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Process_Engineering?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 31630, "name": "Food Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Processing?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 39717, "name": "Food Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 51369, "name": "Functional Foods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Functional_Foods?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 122472, "name": "Probiotics and Prebiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Probiotics_and_Prebiotics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 144369, "name": "Probiotic Bacteria, breakfast cereals, microencapsulatio", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Probiotic_Bacteria_breakfast_cereals_microencapsulatio?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 573653, "name": "Food Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Sciences?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 618910, "name": "Food Sciences and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Sciences_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 654268, "name": "Food sciences and nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_sciences_and_nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1184703, "name": "Food Science and Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Chemistry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1362497, "name": "Food Science and Human Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Human_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1574944, "name": "Food Science and Technology (Production of wines from fruit juices)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology_Production_of_wines_from_fruit_juices_?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1633635, "name": "Food Science and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 45604775, "title": "Protocole National de Prise en Charge de la Malnutrition Aigue en Republique Democratique du Congo \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde9, PCIMA,RDC 2016", "created_at": "2021-03-24T00:58:41.416-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45604775/Protocole_National_de_Prise_en_Charge_de_la_Malnutrition_Aigue_en_Republique_Democratique_du_Congo_PCIMA_RDC_2016?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_45604775", "summary": "Au regard des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts majeurs engendr\u00e9s par la malnutrition aigu\u00eb, le Minist\u00e8re de la sant\u00e9 \npublique n\u2019am\u00e9nage aucun effort pour identifier des approches les mieux adapt\u00e9es pour lutter de mani\u00e8re efficace et efficiente devant cette pathologie.

Taste of Art offers a sample of scholarly essays that examine the use of food in Western contemporary art practices. The contributors are scholars from a range of disciplines, such as art history and philosophy, film studies and history. As a whole, the volume shows how artists engage with food as matter and process, in order to explore alternative aesthetic strategies and indicate countercultural shifts in society. \nIn the first section, the reader will find papers that explore the theoretical intersections of art and food, Food art\u2019s historical root of Futurism, and the ways in which food carries gendered meaning in popular film. The following sections analyze how artists challenge mainstream ideas through food in a variety of scenarios. Starting from a focus on the body and subjectivity, the authors zoom out to look at the domestic sphere, and finally examine the role of the public sphere. \nThe papers included in The Taste of Art consider numerous case studies, by devoting particular attention to artists like, among others: Daniel Spoerri, Dieter Roth, Joseph Beuys, Al Ruppersberg, Alison Knowles, Martha Rosler, Paul McCarthy, Luciano Fabro, Carries Mae Weems, Peter Fischli and David Weiss, Janine Antoni, Liza Lou, and Natalie Jeremijenko.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52271728, "asset_id": 28230922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3486364, "first_name": "Silvia", "last_name": "Bottinelli", "domain_name": "tufts", "page_name": "SilviaBottinelli", "display_name": "Silvia  Bottinelli", "profile_url": "https://tufts.academia.edu/SilviaBottinelli?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3486364/1186353/27598724/s65_silvia.bottinelli.png"}, {"id": 2754165, "first_name": "Margherita", "last_name": "d'Ayala Valva", "domain_name": "sns", "page_name": "MargheritadAyalaValva", "display_name": "Margherita d'Ayala Valva", "profile_url": "https://sns.academia.edu/MargheritadAyalaValva?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2754165/893905/8080354/s65_margherita.d_ayala_valva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7261, "name": "Domesticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Domesticity?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8102, "name": "Futurism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Futurism?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43678, "name": "Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Studies?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 51118, "name": "Culinary Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culinary_Arts?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 157702, "name": "Participatory and Relational Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_and_Relational_Arts?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 307948, "name": "Eat Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eat_Art?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 367289, "name": "Daniel Spoerri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Daniel_Spoerri?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 628631, "name": "Joseph Beuys Social Sculpture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joseph_Beuys_Social_Sculpture?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 653244, "name": "Martha Rosler", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Martha_Rosler?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 686458, "name": "Janine Antoni", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Janine_Antoni?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 741403, "name": "Carl Friedrich Von Rumohr", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carl_Friedrich_Von_Rumohr?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 833143, "name": "Dieter Roth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dieter_Roth?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1204285, "name": "Luciano Fabro", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Luciano_Fabro?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1439309, "name": "Alison Knowles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alison_Knowles?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 62948233, "title": "Phytonutrients and Antioxidant Activity of Extracts from Five Edible Flowers Used in Culinary", "created_at": "2021-12-02T01:41:31.179-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62948233/Phytonutrients_and_Antioxidant_Activity_of_Extracts_from_Five_Edible_Flowers_Used_in_Culinary?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_62948233", "summary": "The aim of the current study was to evaluate the natural pigments (chlorophylls, carotenoids and antho-cyanins), phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of water and 95% ethanol extracts from five edible flowers-snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), carnation (Dianthus plumarius), garden geranium (Pelargonium hortorum), petunia (Petunia integrifolia) and dahlia (Dahlia decorative). It was found that water extracts gave higher extractive yields. The highest carotenoids and total anthocyanins content were detected in snapdragon and dahlia flowers. The total phenolic content dominated in water extracts of petunia, garden geranium, carnation and snapdragon-above 30 mg GAE/g of dry extract. Sinapic acid was detected in all edible flowers.

The required storage conditions of the pasteurized foods, either at ambient temperature, or refrigerated (4 - 7 \u00b0C), are indicated.\r\n* Section 3 shows a decision scheme: should a particular food be pasteurized or sterilized? This depends on the intended storage temperature (refrigerated or ambient) after heating, the required shelf life (7 days to 4 years), the food pH (high acid, acid, or low acid), the food water activity aW, and on the presence of preservatives such as nitrite (E250) mixed with salt NaCl, or nisin.\r\n* In Section 4, two worked examples are presented on how to use an F value when calculating the actual sterilization time Pt: \r\n- C.R. Stumbo\u2019s (1973) calculation method has been manually applied, verified by computer program STUMBO.exe, to find the sterilization time and the thiamine retention of bottled liquid milk in a rotating steam retort;\r\n - O.T. Pham\u2019s (1987; 1990) formula method,  incorporated in Excel program \u201cHeat Process calculations according to Pham.xls\u201d, has been used  to find the sterilization time and the nutrient retention of canned carrot pur\u00e9e in a still steam retort.\r\n* The worked example in Section 5 illustrates the use of the pasteurization value F of apple juice, in calculating the required (average) residence time in the holding tube of a heat exchanger. The Excel program Build-Heat-Exchanger.xls next calculates the juice\u2019s spoilage rate by a mold, a yeast and an enzyme, and the nutrient retention of vitamins C and folic acid in the pasteurized juice.\r\n* Section 6 explains how F values can be calculated when a microbial analysis of the food is available. The actual pasteurization or sterilization time calculations should be based on all micro-organisms of concern present, and rather NOT on the highest F value only!\r\nAn example calculation shows that the required F value for a food, to be sold in a moderate climate country, usually differs considerably from the F, required  for the same food, to be sold in tropical areas.",

and preserve\nthe biodiversity of our planet are among the major challenges of our\nimmediate future. These challenges are essentially addressed to the agricultural\nworld, which is constantly evolving to satisfy the most basic needs\nof humankind. The approaches and the possible answers to these big\nchallenges are many and, even if partial, each sustainable solution or innovation\ncan contribute to improve the quality of our life.\nAmong the different crop production sectors, the vegetable sector is most\nlikely the one expressing the greatest agro-biodiversity. Beyond the agroecosystems\ndiversity, the richness of species, varieties and products, the\nbiodiversity of the vegetable crops, is also expressed by the use for edible\npurpose of different plant portions, even within the same species: in other\nterms, all the organs that constitute a plant, often metamorphosed, can be\nused as vegetables.\nIn this book, funded by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry,\nwe describe what can be considered the result of the latest evolution of the\nconcept of vegetables, which has led to the definition of a new category of\nvegetable products, called microgreens.\nBesides promoting the knowledge of this new category of vegetable products,\nattempting to reach a wide audience, this publication aims to increase the\npublic awareness on the major challenges previously mentioned, showing\nalso how, in their own small way, microgreens can give a concrete answer\nto these challenges. In the book we discuss how microgreens can contribute,\ndirectly or indirectly, to preserve and valorize the biodiversity, improve the\nenvironmental sustainability, increase food and nutritional security, and\nhow, taking advantage of their beauty and simplicity, microgreens may be\nalso used as an educational tool. Finally, the book provides the basic information\nto grow microgreens and some suggestion for their culinary use.\nMicrogreens may be considered an innovation of the concept of vegetables\nand of the vegetable industry, just like that of the fresh cut and the precooked\nready to eat products, or that of the soilless vegetable production\nsystems, for example. These are innovations that contribute to transform\nthe whole concept of agriculture.\nMicrogreens, with the large variety of colors, shapes and flavors described\nin this book, should not be necessarily seen as substitute of their relative\nstandard vegetables. They should be discovered and placed inside our own\nimagination, considering some of the keywords that characterize microgreens\nand modern agriculture, and that are highlighted in this book: agrobiodiversity,\nsustainability, beauty, food and nutrition security, education,\nhealth, and wellness.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39698375, "asset_id": 17767345, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4400518, "first_name": "Francesco", "last_name": "Di Gioia", "domain_name": "florida", "page_name": "FrancescoDiGioia", "display_name": "Francesco Di Gioia", "profile_url": "https://florida.academia.edu/FrancescoDiGioia?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3534, "name": "Agrobiodiversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agrobiodiversity?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19304, "name": "Vegetable Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vegetable_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 824637, "name": "Fresh-cut fruit and vegetable quality and shelf-life extension", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fresh-cut_fruit_and_vegetable_quality_and_shelf-life_extension?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4890452, "title": "We Ra\u00edame Go\u00b4ame.

Heavy metals have toxic properties, cannot be overhauled or destroyed by living organisms, can accumulate in the body of organisms including humans, either directly or indirectly. Heavy metal Hg, Cd, Cr is a very toxic metals (can result in death or health problems that are not recovered in a short time), while heavy metal Co, Pb, Cu toxicity is moderate (can lead to both recoverable and non-recoverable health problems in a relatively long time). Hence the heavy metal contaminating the food must be eliminated or reduced to a safe level. One effort was use coriander leaves to reduce the contamination of heavy metals in fish/shellfish. The objective of the research was to prove the extract of coriander leaves can reduce heavy metal contamination of Pb, Hg and Cu in rod shellfish (lorjuk). The treatment of this research was long soaking in coriander leaves extract that were 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes. The results showed that the longer time of soaking can decrease Pb level from 4.4 \u00b1 0.424 ppb to 1.7 \u00b1 0.5 ppb, Hg level from 4.11\u00b1 0.07 to 1.12\u00b1 0.6 ppb, and Cu level from 433.7 \u00b1 0.1 ppb to 117 \u00b1 0.78 ppb.

Introduction Contamination of heavy metals in food at a certain level can interfere with human health. The problem posed by heavy metals is quite complicated, because heavy metals have toxic properties [1] , cannot be overhauled or destroyed by living things, can accumulate in the body of organisms including humans, either directly or indirectly. Heavy metals Hg, Cd, Cr, Pb are highly toxic metals (can result in death or health problems that are not recovered in a short time) [2] medium Co coat is moderate toxicity (can cause both recoverable and non-recoverable health problems in a relatively long time) [3]. Heavy metals become toxic when they are not metabolized by the body and accumulate in tissues [4]. Heavy metals are dangerous because they tend to accumulate in living organisms [5]. As trace elements, some heavy metals are essential to maintain the metabolism of human body. However, at higher concentrations they can lead to poisoning. Some heavy metals like mercury, cadmium and lead are highly toxic in nature [6] ; [7]. The content of heavy metals, namely cuprum (Cu), mercury (Hg), copper (Cr), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), has piled-pile settled and inundated Kenjeran Beach's water.

Our Cookery Book, written by Flora Pell and first published in Victoria in 1916, was reprinted more than 24 times until the 1950s. A study of the cookbook and the life of its author reveals much about the education of girls, the changing role of women in society, nutrition, nation-building and the power of the temperance movement in early twentieth-century Australia. Flora Pell was a living contradiction who espoused a woman's 'heaven-appointed mission' as a 'wife and homemaker' while forging a career for herself in the Victorian Education Department. Her recipes and 'valuable home hints' were in the press, on the airwaves and in print. She may well have been Australia's first celebrity chef. The authors, a curator and a historian, have tackled the subject from complementary perspectives and offer different interpretations of the cookbook as object and historical text. They conclude with an examination of how this seemingly innocuous, but highly controversial and influential cookbook can be interpreted for a museum audience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Silica/CHN Film was mainly effectual for the polyphenol contents (0.39 g kg\u22121 ) and antioxidant activities (78.14% and 71.09%) for DPPH and ABTS+ radical scavenging activities, respectively. The results reported that Silica/CHN Film induced the highest (catalase and ascorbate peroxidase) activities, while Titanium/CHN Film recorded the highest (peroxidase and superoxide dismutase) activities of antioxidant enzymes. Besides, Titanium/CHN Film preserved relatively lower contents of hydrogen peroxide (22.40 \u00b5mol g\u22121 ) and hydroxyl radical (0.16 \u00b5mol g\u22121 ).

Some studies have reported that there was no change in the homeostatic aspects of energy balance, despite the increased nutrient intake, and in this case, the hedonic aspects may be effective. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of hedonic hunger with sleep quality and duration among university students. This cross-sectional study was carried out on university students. An online questionnaire was applied in the study, in which 1144 participants were included. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality and duration, and the Power of Food Scale (PFS) and Palatable Eating Motives Scale (PEMS) for detecting hedonic hunger states. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between sleep quality and duration and hedonic hunger by modelling. Total PFS and PEMS scores were positively associated with PSQI scores after controlling for all possible confounding factors [\u03b2 (95%CI) = 0.04 (0.03\u20130.05), p < 0.05; 0.06 (0.05\u20130.07), p < 0.05, respectively). The relationship between the subdimensions of the PFS, PEMS and PSQI remained statistically significant, except for food availability (PFS) and social motive (PEMS).After fully adjusting, the odds of having a high PEMS score increased in individuals with short or long sleep duration, but not PFS score [OR (95%CI) = 1.40 (1.09\u20131.83), p = 0.012; 0.98 (0.70\u20131.21), p = 0.878, respectively]. While a positive relationship was found between increased hedonic hunger and poor sleep quality, an inverse relationship was observed between ideal sleep duration and hedonic hunger. The findings suggest that improving sleep quality and duration can help reduce hedonic hunger, which increases the tendency to unhealthy and delicious foods and plays a role in weight gain.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80793443, "asset_id": 44950684, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81586325, "first_name": "Murat", "last_name": "A\u00e7\u0131k", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MuratA\u00e7\u0131k", "display_name": "Murat A\u00e7\u0131k", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MuratA%C3%A7%C4%B1k?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 24243158, "first_name": "Ay\u015fe Nur", "last_name": "Song\u00fcr Bozda\u011f", "domain_name": "ortamnedio", "page_name": "Ay\u015feNurSong\u00fcr", "display_name": "Ay\u015fe Nur Song\u00fcr Bozda\u011f", "profile_url": "https://ortamnedio.academia.edu/Ay%C5%9FeNurSong%C3%BCr?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24243158/10871515/32008106/s65_ay_e_nur.song_r.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 71225, "name": "Sleep Quality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sleep_Quality?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2756661, "name": "sleep duration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/sleep_duration?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3864769, "name": "Hedonic Hunger", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hedonic_Hunger?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 43701805, "title": "PROXIMATE COMPOSITION OF Pseudocanthotermes grandiceps (Isoptera: Termitidea) IN WESTERN KENYA: COMPARISON WITH NILE PERCH FISH AND RED MEAT", "created_at": "2020-07-24T01:55:29.732-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43701805/PROXIMATE_COMPOSITION_OF_Pseudocanthotermes_grandiceps_Isoptera_Termitidea_IN_WESTERN_KENYA_COMPARISON_WITH_NILE_PERCH_FISH_AND_RED_MEAT?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_43701805", "summary": "Food insecurity is a major problem facing the Kenyan populace. There are acute food shortages that do not satisfy the increasing population as traditional food stocks continue to be depleted as a result of environmental changes and increasing population. Faced with problems of food insecurity, increasing food prices and over-reliance on the traditional food items, there is an urgent need for Kenyans to diversify their food sources. In western Kenya, the termites have a long history of consumption as a delicacy during the rainy seasons. A major problem is that they are varied in species and may not all contain the ingredients required by humans for nutrition. There are also very few studies that have attempted to evaluate the totality of white ants in Kenya. The aim of this study was to determine the proximate composition of the termites in Western Kenya. This was done with an overall aim of determining whether termites can be declared as an alternative food source in Kenya. Data were collected and analyzed for proximate composition of moisture, protein, lipids, crude fiber. Essential Amino Acid (EAA) profiles were evaluated to determine protein composition. Food value of the different species was analyzed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results indicated that termites have high levels of moisture content of 90.2% crude protein (64%), crude lipids (9.35%), crude fibre (9.53), gross energy of 4.99 kcal and the essential amino acids at 31.5g/100g. Due to the conditions of families in Kenya this can be a substitute for the sources of protein substitute for red meat and Tilapia fish meals preferred by many households. The profile of Essential Amino Acid in the current study was found to be high and therefore white ants formed a very good source of essential amino acid to the local people. This study therefore concludes that white ants are suitable alternative food source to replace major rotein food and nutritionists should start a campaign of making the white ants a delicacy. Given that white ants are neglected food in Kenya, it is recommended that the food items should be consumed as one of the food in the traditional diets in areas where the species occur.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64006729, "asset_id": 43701805, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 104681849, "first_name": "Florence", "last_name": "Gakuo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FlorenceGakuo", "display_name": "Florence Gakuo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/FlorenceGakuo?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/104681849/23594576/22638069/s65_florence.gakuo.jpg"}, {"id": 164441394, "first_name": "Jacob", "last_name": "Makila", "domain_name": "kibabiiuniversity", "page_name": "JacobMakila", "display_name": "Jacob Makila", "profile_url": "https://kibabiiuniversity.academia.edu/JacobMakila?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/164441394/46189665/35771595/s65_jacob.makila.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 173, "name": "Zoology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zoology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22498, "name": "Invertebrate Zoology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Invertebrate_Zoology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 206502, "name": "General Zoology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/General_Zoology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 674985, "name": "Zoology/Entomology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zoology_Entomology?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 41231294, "title": "\u05e2\u05dc \u05e7\u05e4\u05d4 \u05d5\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05db\u05ea\u05d1\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 2019", "created_at": "2019-12-09T00:36:47.025-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41231294/%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%94_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5_2019?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_41231294", "summary": " \u05d0\u05d9\u05da \u05d4\u05e4\u05da \u05d4\u05e7\u05e4\u05d4 \u05de\u05de\u05e9\u05e7\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05db\u05d5\u05e1 \u05d7\u05d3 \u05e4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05e9\u05e7\u05dc \u05ea\u05e9\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05db\u05d6\u05d4 \u05e9\u05e0\u05de\u05db\u05e8 \u05d1\u05de\u05db\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05e4\u05d5\u05de\u05d1\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05dc \u05dc\u05d4\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e8 \u05dc-50 \u05e9\u05e7\u05dc \u05dc\u05e1\u05e4\u05dc?

The aim of this study was to assess the risk factors of osteoporosis among working women, and develop health educational guidelines to prevent/reduce osteoporosis at Benha City. Research design: A descriptive correlation research design was utilized to conduct the study. Setting: The study was conducted at two Toshiba Elaraby Factories, they named; Benha Toshiba Elaraby' factory at Qaluobia Governorate, and Quesna Toshiba Elaraby' factory at Elminofyia Governorate. The sample included 10% from 3650 working women (365) working women they were selected as randomly from the above mentioned setting. Tools: One tool was developed by the researchers: Osteoporosis structured interviewing questionnaire: It consisted of six parts: Part I: Concerned with socio-demographic characteristics of the working women. Part II: Concerned with the obstetric history Part III: history of osteoporosis. Part IV: Medical and family history Part V: assess the Women's' knowledge about osteoporosis disease Part VI: risk factors of osteoporosis and life style: Results of this study showed; the highest percentages of women were found within age groups from 40-49 years (36.4%). Postgraduate's education represented the highest percentage (34.8%), only 7.7 were continuous movement. and 75.3% are from rural area. 63.3% of working women had good total knowledge score. 77.8% of the study subjects are suffering from osteoporosis. 63.3% had family history of osteoporosis. This study concluded that the common risk factors identified were; family history, lack of exercises, irregular exposure to sunlight, and insufficient taken protein and vitamin D. Also; osteoporosis health guideline were needed for prevention/ reduction of osteoporosis. The study recommended community based health programs on osteoporosis that targeted a wide audience should be implemented. 3-further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of osteoporosis health guideline in the prevention of osteoporosis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56096704, "asset_id": 36195510, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3594081, "first_name": "sciepub.com", "last_name": "SciEP", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "sciepubcomSciEP", "display_name": "sciepub.com SciEP", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/sciepubcomSciEP?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3594081/1252134/2954326/s65_sciepub.com.sciep.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 140, "name": "Pharmacology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 586, "name": "Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Sciences?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 656, "name": "Pharmacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1085, "name": "Epidemiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epidemiology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 35393076, "title": "Prenetaion (4)", "created_at": "2017-12-10T08:55:20.319-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35393076/Prenetaion_4_?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35393076", "summary": "Presentation\u200b \u200b Rationale Purpose-\u200b \u200b The\u200b \u200b purpose\u200b \u200b of\u200b \u200b this\u200b \u200b presentation\u200b \u200b is\u200b \u200b to\u200b \u200b create\u200b \u200b awareness\u200b \u200b amongst\u200b \u200b my\u200b \u200b audience\u200b \u200b about increasing\u200b \u200b childhood\u200b \u200b obesity\u200b \u200b in\u200b \u200b US\u200b \u200b children.\u200b \u200b I\u200b \u200b also\u200b \u200b want\u200b \u200b my\u200b \u200b audience\u200b \u200b to\u200b \u200b know\u200b \u200b that\u200b \u200b current\u200b \u200b eating and\u200b \u200b exercise\u200b \u200b habits\u200b \u200b are\u200b \u200b not\u200b \u200b effective\u200b \u200b in\u200b \u200b prevention\u200b \u200b of\u200b \u200b childhood\u200b \u200b obesity.\u200b \u200b I\u200b \u200b want\u200b \u200b to\u200b \u200b teach\u200b \u200b my audience\u200b \u200b some\u200b \u200b good\u200b \u200b diet\u200b \u200b and\u200b \u200b exercise\u200b \u200b changes\u200b \u200b that\u200b \u200b can\u200b \u200b be\u200b \u200b implemented\u200b \u200b at\u200b \u200b home\u200b \u200b and\u200b \u200b in\u200b \u200b schools.

However, at sectoral-level, it has still failed to provide any obvious empirical evidence regarding any direct link between patents and productivity. The chief contribution of this research paper is to provide empirical evidence on how chemistry patents relate to productivity growth in the case of a low-tech intensive industry (Food, Beverage and Tobacco). In order to support both the theoretical and empirical findings of the literature a dynamic regression model is tested and found a valid representation of the negative relationship between food chemistry patents granted and productivity growth in the long run. Subsequently, some conclusions and policy implications are suggested in order to support the enhanced productivity growth performance of these food industries, highlighting the importance of changes in current property protection systems", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82136990, "asset_id": 73730848, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74329719, "first_name": "Judit", "last_name": "OL\u00c1H", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OL\u00c1HJudit", "display_name": "Judit OL\u00c1H", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OL%C3%81HJudit?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 523, "name": "Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2961, "name": "Property Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Property_Rights?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7682, "name": "Patents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patents?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7683, "name": "Trademarks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trademarks?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8968, "name": "Productivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Productivity?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 531082, "name": "Sectoral growth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sectoral_growth?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 73695516, "title": "DWARF MINKE WHALES: MORPHOLOGY, GROWTH AND LIFE HISTORY BASED ON SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM THE HIGHER LATITUDES IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE", "created_at": "2022-03-13T18:13:11.275-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73695516/DWARF_MINKE_WHALES_MORPHOLOGY_GROWTH_AND_LIFE_HISTORY_BASED_ON_SAMPLES_COLLECTED_FROM_THE_HIGHER_LATITUDES_IN_THE_SOUTHERN_HEMISPHERE?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_73695516", "summary": "This study examined the morphology, growth and life history of dwarf minke whales to identify and confirm any differences from other minke whale species and subspecies. The study was based on biological samples and data obtained from 16 whales (3 males and 13 females) collected through the 1987/88 to 1992/93 austral summer seasons by the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic (JARPA). The whales were collected between latitudes 58\u00b023\u2032S and 65\u00b004\u2032S in the Antarctic area between 90\u00b0E and 180\u00b0. Mean body length at physical maturity was estimated to be 7.16 m for females, approximately 1.5 m to 2.0 m smaller than equivalent values of Antarctic minke whales and North Pacific common minke whales. The characteristic feature of a white shoulder/flipper patch was confirmed and some variations in the overall color pattern was found. Skeletal observations confirmed the previously reported characteristic features on the vertex of the skull. In addition, this study found a longer rostrum, deeply curved mandible, and narrower nasal bone in dwarf minke whales in comparison with other minke whales. All pregnant females had conceived in mid-austral winter (middle of June to early August). Females are likely to attain sexual maturation at 6-6.5 m and at around 7-10 years of age. Stomach contents indicated that dwarf minke whales mainly fed on lantern fishes around the Antarctic Convergence in summer. Analyses by ANCOV revealed significant differences in both external body and skull morphology among different species and subspecies. Furthermore, cluster analyses on the skull morphology revealed differentiation between dwarf minke whales and other common minke whales but they are more closely related to North Atlantic common minke whales. These analyses concurred with previous genetic analyses results. The results of this study provided support for the proposed subspecific status of dwarf minke whales.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82115881, "asset_id": 73695516, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62491166, "first_name": "Hidehiro", "last_name": "Kato", "domain_name": "kaiyodai", "page_name": "HidehiroKato", "display_name": "Hidehiro Kato", "profile_url": "https://kaiyodai.academia.edu/HidehiroKato?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62491166/66022104/54367766/s65_hidehiro.kato.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7666, "name": "Life history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Life_history?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10866, "name": "Morphology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Morphology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54433, "name": "Phylogeny", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phylogeny?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54961, "name": "Growth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Growth?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 104901, "name": "Age Determination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Age_Determination?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 255106, "name": "Cetacean biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cetacean_biology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 399309, "name": "Minke whale", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minke_whale?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 847079, "name": "Taxnomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taxnomy?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1220068, "name": "Dwarf Minke Whales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dwarf_Minke_Whales?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 68719407, "title": "Antioxidant Capacity and Bioaccessibility of Synergic Mango (cv.

A growing interest has been seen in the use of dietary supplements and natural products for the treatment and prevention of periodontitis. Vitamin E consists of two major groups, namely tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are botanical lipophilic compounds with excellent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Highlight: This review aimed to summarize the preclinical and clinical findings on the effects of vitamin E on periodontitis. The current literature suggests that vitamin E could improve the periodontal status by correcting redox status imbalance, reducing inflammatory responses, and promoting wound healing, thus highlighting the potential of vitamin E in the management of periodontitis. Conclusion: Direct evidence for the use of vitamin E supplementation or treatment of periodontitis in humans is still limited. More well-designed and controlled studies are required to ascertain its effectiveness. \u00a9 2021 Japanese Association for Oral Biology", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67712372, "asset_id": 49337948, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 159089441, "first_name": "Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia", "last_name": "Dental Science Research", "domain_name": "ukm-my", "page_name": "UKMDentalScienceResearch", "display_name": "Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Dental Science Research", "profile_url": "https://ukm-my.academia.edu/UKMDentalScienceResearch?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/159089441/45345288/36247073/s65_universiti_kebangsaan_malaysia.dental_science_research.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 596, "name": "Dentistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dentistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1290, "name": "Immunology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immunology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 43123532, "title": "Everything You Wanted to Know About CHILL N GRILL", "created_at": "2020-05-21T00:38:21.194-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43123532/Everything_You_Wanted_to_Know_About_CHILL_N_GRILL?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_43123532", "summary": "Chill N Grill captures the authentic flavours of India and the world.

Consumers enjoy baked sweet potatoes because they have good taste and pleasant flavor. The understanding of the influence of baking treatment on sweet potatoes is important for assisting manufacturers in improving the quality of baked sweet potatoes. Baking treatment resulted in gelatinization of starch granules and a significant color change. In this study, the morphology of sweet potato starch was shown by using an electron microscope. On the other hand, the color change of sweet potato caused by the baking treatment was measured by using the chroma meter. Baking temperature and time were two major factors that affected the baking treatment results. The granule size of the fresh sweet potato starch was less than 25 \u00b5m. When the baking temperature was increased, starch granules began to gelatinize. When the baking temperature was higher than 150\u00b0C, almost no starch granule could be found. The color measurement of baked sweet potatoes was expressed as L*, a*, and b* values. Color brightness (L*) of baked sweet potatoes was significantly lower with increasing the baking temperature. When the baking temperature was higher than 100\u00b0C, b* values were reduced. As a result, the color of baked sweet potatoes became orange. Based on the electron micrographs and color measurement results, the recommended baking temperature and time were 200\u00b0C and 30 min. After baking at 200\u00b0C for 30 min, all sweet potato starch granules gelatinized and the baked sweet potatoes had brownish orange surface color.\nLink of the (Abstract) Paper: https://www.wflpublisher.com/Abstract/4669\n\nLink of the website: https://www.wflpublisher.com/", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57635361, "asset_id": 37649405, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 87236435, "first_name": "JFAE Journal", "last_name": "Administration", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OmarFaruk244", "display_name": "JFAE Journal  Administration", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OmarFaruk244?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/87236435/20097421/19855898/s65_omar.faruk_administrator_.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35383963, "title": "Urban Food Policies : Decentralized Cooperation and African  Cities", "created_at": "2017-12-09T01:32:47.730-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35383963/Urban_Food_Policies_Decentralized_Cooperation_and_African_Cities?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35383963", "summary": "The article introduces Urban Food Policies (UFP) in the field of decentralized \r\ncooperation as a relatively new field of work, exchange and action-oriented \r\nresearch within and between cities, and local authorities in the global North \r\nand South.

The trend for the decreasing concentration of elements determined in the gum sample is Mg > Ca > Mn > Zn > Fe > Ni > Zn > Cu > Cd > Pb. Rheological properties of the gums have been adequately modeled using Huggins, Kraemer, Arrhenius, Tanglertpaibul and Rao theories. The results indicated that the viscosity of the gum increases with increasing pH and concentration but decreases with increase in temperature. Values of intrinsic viscosity obtained from Huggins and Kraemer plots were similar (11.197). The value of activation energy (E vis) of the gum studied was found to be 1.915 kJ/mol. The low E vis values obtained suggests the existence of few inter and intra-interactions between the molecules of the gums within the investigated temperature. F. glumosa gum exudate hence, possesses the potentials to be used as an additive in food and other industries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50673448, "asset_id": 30214500, "asset_type":

Algunos de los textos publicados en este libro nacen directamente de este proyecto, mientras que algunos otros, de car\u00e1cter claramente complementario, han sido invitados a participar y a dialogar en la misma obra. De este modo, el libro que aqu\u00ed se inicia responde a distintas necesidades y objetivos. Por un lado, es una de las muy pocas obras en lengua castellana que se dedican espec\u00edficamente al an\u00e1lisis de las culturas alimentarias en situaci\u00f3n de migraci\u00f3n, cubriendo as\u00ed un hueco necesario en la bibliograf\u00eda existente. Por otro lado, este libro intenta reunir en un mismo espacio y de manera dialogante los trabajos de distintos especialistas que se han dedicado al tema de la alimentaci\u00f3n y las migraciones desde diferentes puntos de vista; trabajos que en muy pocas ocasiones han visto la posibilidad de situarse en un mismo contexto y en una situaci\u00f3n que permita una revisi\u00f3n y una comparaci\u00f3n conjuntas. Igualmente, a partir de esta situaci\u00f3n, podemos articular tambi\u00e9n la detecci\u00f3n de determinados ejes tem\u00e1ticos que aparecen vinculados a las distintas visiones de los diferentes investigadores, en distintos territorios y posiblemente con distintos intereses: permanencias y rupturas en los h\u00e1bitos alimentarios, fronteras alimentarias, aprovisionamiento, etnicidad, nostalgia, restauraci\u00f3n?

Principal component analysis and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis showed that Eucheuma reduced the release of amino acids and fatty acids. The released glucose from the EP20 sample (20% replacement of flour with Eucheuma) decreased by 35.4% in intestinal phases compared with the control cake. Eucheuma\u2019s in vitro effects on sponge cake digestion mainly reflected altered flow behaviour index.

However, few methods for determination of clothianidin in garlic samples have been published so far. In this study, a rapid, sensitive, and environmental-friendly residue determination method based on QuEChERS for analysis of clothianidin residues in garlic was investigated. The analytes were extracted from the samples using acetonitrile combined with homogenization, purified by dispersion solid phase matrix extraction using ODS-C18, PSA and florisil. Then samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS with multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) directly. The content was determined by external standard method. A good linear calibration curve was exhibited over a concentration range of 1.0 to 100 \u00b5g/L for clothianidin with a correlation coefficient of 0.9995. Average recoveries for clothianidin in garlic were 95.7%~100.7% with a relative standard deviations (RSD) of 0.7%~4.3% at spiked levels of 5~50 \u00b5g/kg. For clothianidin, the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 1.55 \u00b5g/kg and the limit of detection (LOD) 0.47 \u00b5g/kg. Then dissipation of clothianidin was studied by the method above at two dosage of 750 g a.i./ha (the recommended dosage) and 1500 g a.i./ha. In the garlic samples, the concentrations of clothianidin were 0.037 and 0.078 mg/kg, respectively, 7 days after treatment and then decreased rapidly, reached 0.009 and 0.015 mg/kg after 14 days (d). The residues in garlic bulb only 21 days after treatment were 0.003 and 0.011 mg/kg, respectively, less than the MRLs (0.02 mg/kg in garlic) set by Japan\u2019s \u201cPositive List System\u201d. \nLink of the (Abstract) Paper:  https://www.wflpublisher.com/Abstract/3358\n\nLink of the website: https://www.wflpublisher.com\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57486472, "asset_id": 37513855, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 87236435, "first_name": "JFAE Journal", "last_name": "Administration", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OmarFaruk244", "display_name": "JFAE Journal  Administration", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OmarFaruk244?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/87236435/20097421/19855898/s65_omar.faruk_administrator_.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36849012, "title": "H\u00e1bitos Alimentares da Comunidade IPG", "created_at": "2018-06-15T06:26:29.717-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36849012/H%C3%A1bitos_Alimentares_da_Comunidade_IPG?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_36849012", "summary": "Os h\u00e1bitos alimentares possuem um papel fundamental na vida de um ser humano.

The aim of this study was to examine body weight variation during KD feeding for 6 wk of Wistar rats; fat mass and adipocyte cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activity were also observed. PEPCK activity was determined based on the [H14CO3\u2013]-oxaloacetate exchange reaction. KD-fed rats gained weight at a less rapid rate than normal-fed rats, but with a significant increment in fat mass. The fat mass/body weight ratio already differed between ketogenic and control rats after the first week of treatment, and was 2.4\u00d7higher in ketogenic rats. The visceral lipogenesis was supported by an increment in adipocyte PEPCK, aiming to provide glycerol 3-phosphate to triacylglycerol synthesis and this fat accumulation was accompanied by glucose intolerance. These data contribute to our understanding of the metabolic effects of the KD in adipose tissue and liver and suggest some potential risks of this diet, particularly visceral fat accumulation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49295935, "asset_id": 5430638, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7599130, "first_name": "Leticia", "last_name": "Ribeiro", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LeticiaRibeiro", "display_name": "Leticia Ribeiro", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LeticiaRibeiro?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7599130/3878111/4535693/s65_leticia.ribeiro.jpg_oh_24a0c647267ee85b0d0f134e20820ff6_oe_543f2ff7___gda___1413268753_c22034987f28f11203fb9adf6109828f"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7648, "name": "Epilepsy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Epilepsy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52489, "name": "Adipose tissue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adipose_tissue?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64568, "name": "Humans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humans?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 64933, "name": "Child", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 89805, "name": "Weight Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Weight_Loss?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 90514, "name": "Cholesterol", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cholesterol?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 99234, "name": "Animals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Animals?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 111545, "name": "Male", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Male?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 227299, "name": "Triglycerides", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Triglycerides?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 353163, "name": "Fat Mass", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fat_Mass?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 375054, "name": "Rats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rats?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 417494, "name": "Rat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rat?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 564879, "name": "Wistar Rats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wistar_Rats?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 573653, "name": "Food Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Sciences?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1893820, "name": "Ketogenic diet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ketogenic_diet?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2484389, "name": "PEPCK", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PEPCK?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 28107001, "title": "Longitudinal Study of Breastfeeding Structure and Women's Work in the Brazilian Amazon", "created_at": "2016-08-29T18:00:08.781-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28107001/Longitudinal_Study_of_Breastfeeding_Structure_and_Womens_Work_in_the_Brazilian_Amazon?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_28107001", "summary": "It is well established that breast milk is the ideal food for infants and that breastfeeding has short-and long-term health benefits for the mother and child. However, there is variation in breastfeeding patterns between populations. Women's work is thought to influence breastfeeding patterns and timing of supplementa-tion and it is often assumed that women in subsistence-oriented societies can more easily integrate their productive and reproductive activities. This article reports longitudinal data, collected in three rounds (resguardo [<40 days], peak [2\u20134 months], and late [14\u201316 months] lacta-tion), on breastfeeding structure, infant care, and work patterns of 17 rural Amazonian women in an effort to understand how breastfeeding structure and maternal time allocation changed over time, as well as the strategies women used to integrate their productive and reproductive roles. Women breastfed 10.6 6 3.1, 9.4 6 3.4, and 9.6 6 5.5 times per 9-h period in the three rounds, respectively. Breastfeeding structure, specifically session duration , changed over time (P < 0.05). As lactation progressed , women spent less time breastfeeding and in infant care and more time in subsistence work. In peak lactation, subsistence work was negatively correlated with infant care (r 5 20.4, P 5 0.01), breastfeeding (r 5 20.29, P 5 0.05) and session duration (r 5 20.39, P < 0.01) and in late lactation was negatively correlated with time spent breastfeeding (r 5 20.39, P < 0.01) and in infant care (r 5 20.50, P < 0.01) and positively correlated with inter-session interval (r 5 0.40, P < 0.01). Generally, women reduced time in subsistence work when breast-feeding was more intense and returned to normal activity patterns once infants were being supplemented. The costs and benefits associated with women's strategies are discussed. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:226\u2013237, 2011.

Intake of flavonoids may be associated with decreased risk of cancer, cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases in humans. Vegetables are one source for flavonoid compounds in the diet. USDA's Nutrient Data Laboratory evaluated the quality of existing literature values for flavonoids from sources around the world and compiled a database containing five subclasses (flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanidins) of flavonoids. Fifty-eight different vegetables, 28 herbs and edible leaves, and 4 vegetable recipes were included as part of the development of the USDA Flavonoid Database for Foods (http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp). Many vegetables, including onions, hot peppers, broccoli, snap beans, kale, and lettuce contain flavonol compounds quercetin and kaempferol. Onions, followed by lettuce are the major vegetable contributors of quercetin to the diet, while broccoli is the major contributor of kaempferol. Broadbeans and marrowfat peas provide catechins, the flavan-3-ols. Parsley, rutabagas and celery provide high levels of apigenin, a flavone. Parsley, followed by celery are the major vegetable contributors of apigenin to the diet. In compiling the database, analytically valid data were assigned confidence codes (A=most confidence, D=least confidence) based on the quality of the sampling procedures, sample handling, analytical methods, and analytical quality control. While there were no A quality data for any flavonoid values for vegetables in the database, most vegetables had B or C quality data. This database is the first step in evaluating the need and directing research for obtaining new analytical data on the flavonoid content of vegetables.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54252304, "asset_id": 34361999, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 67619322, "first_name": "Physio", "last_name": "7a", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AntoniS4", "display_name": "Physio 7a", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AntoniS4?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/67619322/102576297/91743971/s65_physio.7a.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7511177, "title": "Formalizing Insect Rearing and Artificial Diet Technology", "created_at": "2014-06-30T12:54:17.394-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7511177/Formalizing_Insect_Rearing_and_Artificial_Diet_Technology?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_7511177", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34077927, "asset_id": 7511177, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13440603, "first_name": "Ezequias", "last_name": "Te\u00f3filo", "domain_name": "ufscar", "page_name": "EzequiasTe\u00f3filo", "display_name": "Ezequias Te\u00f3filo", "profile_url": "https://ufscar.academia.edu/EzequiasTe%C3%B3filo?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13440603/14244783/15206948/s65_ezequias.te_filo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1037, "name": "Agronomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agronomy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10225, "name": "Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 73031600, "title": "Measurement: Food", "created_at": "2022-03-04T07:36:48.694-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73031600/Measurement_Food?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_73031600", "summary": "Gamma radiation is used in many countries due to combating microorganisms in food. Honey is considered as a reservoir of microbes; hence the purpose of this study was to sterilize honey by applying radiation and evaluate the antioxidant and antibacterial potential of honey after radiation processing. Three types of Bangladeshi origin unifloral honey: mustard (Brassica juncea), Black seed (Nigella sativa) and Lychee (Litchi chinensis) were selected. The raw (unirradiated) black seed honey possessed the highest content of total phenolic and vitamin C contents, accordingly showed significantly higher (p < 0.01) free radical scavenging activity compared to others. Radiation processing was found to achieve microbial destruction in honey completely. Significant enhancement of phenolic compound as well as antioxidant activity was observed in the irradiated honey. Moreover, antibacterial potential of all the honeys has been conserved after radiation processing. The statistics showed significant positive correlation among phenolic (R 2 = 0.95) and vitamin C (R 2 = 0.72) content in relation to free radical scavenging activity of honey. FTIR spectroscopy showed no distinct changes in the vibrational intensity of functional groups (-OH, C = H, C = O) indicating nonsignificant changes in the chemistry of the sugar components of honey. Thus, radiation processing of honey could be a useful technique to preserve honey free from microbes and improved beneficial for health compared to unirradiated honey.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81715470, "asset_id": 73031600, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12945999, "first_name": "Md", "last_name": "Shahjalal", "domain_name": "baec", "page_name": "ShahJalal", "display_name": "Md Shahjalal", "profile_url": "https://baec.academia.edu/ShahJalal?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12945999/6350148/7185440/s65_shah.jalal.jpg_oh_008afc426824b3b83932f660d85f711c_oe_55063a3d___gda___1426644280_dfde9fbc0a96e2e7ab1ac790bd992b9b"}, {"id": 217391585, "first_name": "Mst.

In fact, studies have shown that with diet and exercise alone, nearly 95% of obese patients will gain all the lost weight back within 5 years. Studies show that most patients that undergo weight-loss surgery will lose between 50-70% of their excess body weight within the first three years following their procedure. Those that undergo gastric bypass surgery will lose excess body weight more rapidly in the first 12 months than those that choose LAP-BAND surgery. However, gastric bypass patients typically experience a greater number of complications and side effects than LAP-BAND patients, as the LAP-BAND procedure allows for more gradual and natural long-term weight loss. &lt;strong&gt;From a clinical perspective, a weight-loss surgery&lt;/strong&gt; is considered Kirstie Alley Diet successful when the patient loses at least 50% of their excess body weight and keeps the weight off for at least five years. While important lifestyle changes need to be made to ensure that the weight loss is maintained in the long term, studies have shown that most weight loss surgery patients are able to maintain a 50-60% loss of excess body weight 10 years after the surgical procedure. While patients will certainly look and feel better after weight-loss Kirstie Alley Diet surgery, there are also numerous health benefits associated with successful weight loss. In most cases, health conditions that develop as a result of excessive body weight or are worsened by obesity can be improved upon or, in some cases, remedied by weight-loss surgery. &lt;strong&gt;But there are other ways to measuring success with weight-loss&lt;/strong&gt; surgery, like the Kirstie Alley Diet LAP-BAND System.

In this study, effect of three drying methods (sun drying and drying at 20 and 30\u00b0C) and four maturity stage (harvested weekly from 15 days after initiation of browning of packing tissue around the kernels until hull dehiscence) were tested on quality of two walnut cultivars (\u2018Chandler\u2019 and \u2018Jamal\u2019). Our results revealed that the walnut kernels dried at 20\u00b0C have notably higher content of protein (13.1 gr/100 gr), saturated (palmitic [6.62%] and stearic acid [3.98%]) and polyunsaturated (linoleic [62%] and linolenic acid [14.59%]) fatty acids, higher walnut kernel color (85.33%) and lower walnut kernel shrivel (16.38%). Drying at 20\u00b0C also caused the lowest peroxide value (0.33 meq/ kg oil). Kernels of the Persian walnuts harvested later had a meaningful higher protein (14.49 gr/100 gr), oil (54.53%), saturated (9.37%) and unsaturated (96.36) fatty acid content, and lower shrivel index (13.46%) but with darker walnut kernel color (37.83%) and higher peroxide value (1.33 meq/kg oil) in comparison with the walnut kernels harvested earlier. Practical applications Nutritional and sensory quality of walnut kernel during postharvest life is determined by various factors. According to our results, from sensory and nutritional quality viewpoint, \u2018Chandler\u2019 is considered to be a more suitable cultivar than \u2018Jamal\u2019 and drying walnut kernels at 20\u00b0C better preserved its sensory and nutritional quality than\tdrying\tat\t30\u00b0C\tand\tsun\tdrying\tmethod.\tMoreover,\ta\tpositive\tcorrelation\tof\twalnut kernels color index and polyunsaturated fatty acid plus a negative correlation between shrivel index and nutraceutical properties of walnut kernels indicates that walnut kernel color and shrivel can simply reflect the nutritional quality of walnut kernels.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68385114, "asset_id": 50369635, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 302023, "first_name": "Kourosh", "last_name": "Vahdati", "domain_name": "tehran", "page_name": "ProfKouroshVahdati", "display_name": "Kourosh Vahdati", "profile_url": "https://tehran.academia.edu/ProfKouroshVahdati?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/302023/1789014/32189740/s65_kourosh.vahdati.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 145, "name": "Biochemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biochemistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4188, "name": "Drying Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drying_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10159, "name": "Sensory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensory?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 21299, "name": "Fruits and Nuts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fruits_and_Nuts?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 129404, "name": "Omega Fatty Acids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Omega_Fatty_Acids?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 179441, "name": "Nutrici\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrici%C3%B3n?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 191487, "name": "Kernel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kernel?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 261282, "name": "Nutraceuticals and phytochemicals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutraceuticals_and_phytochemicals?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 268788, "name": "Human health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_health?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 347949, "name": "Phenolic Compounds", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenolic_Compounds?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 359487, "name": "Nutritional Quality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutritional_Quality?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 707495, "name": "Fatty Acid Compositions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fatty_Acid_Compositions?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 799973, "name": "Walnuts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Walnuts?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 891673, "name": "Food Science and Post Harvest Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Post_Harvest_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1633635, "name": "Food Science and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1766828, "name": "Peroxide value", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peroxide_value?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2526583, "name": "oil content", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/oil_content?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 50001577, "title": "Natural Weight Loss Supplements for Women", "created_at": "2021-07-16T18:37:15.533-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50001577/Natural_Weight_Loss_Supplements_for_Women?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_50001577", "summary": "Today, more women are turning to weight loss supplements for help in order to lose weight easily.

Objective: To find out the nutritional status among the Rohingya children under 5 years of age living in a human induced emergency situation in Bangladesh. \uf0d8 Methodology: This is a cross sectional survey, conducted in two refugee camps in Southern Bangladesh where children aged between 1 to 5 years. \uf0d8 Result: The result shows among children 40.5% (n=100) were female and 59.5% (n=147) were male. The prevalence of hindering per height for age z-score (HAZ) was 74.5%, wasting per weight for height z-score (WHZ) was 7.7% and underweight per weight-forage z-score (WAZ) was 30.4%. Besides that, the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) per WHZ was 7.7% (n=19), which is under the WHO threshold of 5-9%, labeled as \"poor\". Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) represents 2.8% (n=7) and 4.9% (n=12) respectively. In terms of age segregation, 4 and 5 years hold a higher percentage of GAM and the lowest percentage belongs to 3 years' age group (3%). \uf0d8 Conclusion: The mortality is especially high in crisis influenced populaces due to the synergy of a high rises of unhealthiness and expanded rate of transmittable and irresistible infections.

No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. \u00e2\u20acoeI did what I always do when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m confused, lonely, or frightened,\u00e2\u20ac? she writes. \u00e2\u20acoeI disappeared into the kitchen.\u00e2\u20ac? My Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons\u00e2\u20ac \" and Reichl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emotions\u00e2\u20ac \" as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would \u00e2\u20acoethrow quick meals together\u00e2\u20ac? for her family and friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Imagine kale, leaves dark and inviting, saut\u00c3\u00a9ed with chiles and garlic; summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler; fresh oysters chilling in a box of snow; plump chickens and earthy mushrooms, fricasseed with cream. Over the course of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things. The 136 recipes collected here represent a life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring. Here, too, is Reichl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enlivening dialogue with her Twitter followers, who become her culinary supporters and lively confidants. Part cookbook, part memoir, part paean to the household gods, My Kitchen Year may be Ruth Reichl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most stirring book yet\u00e2\u20ac \" one that reveals a refreshingly vulnerable side of the world s most famous food editor as she shares treasured recipes to be returned to again and again and again.Praise for My Kitchen Year \u00e2\u20acoeRuth is one of our greatest storytellers today, which you will feel from the moment you open this book and begin to read: No one writes as warmly and engagingly about the all-important intersection of food, life, love, and loss. This book is a lyrical and deeply intimate journey told through recipes, as only Ruth can do.\u00e2\u20ac?\u00e2\u20ac \" Alice Waters\u00e2\u20acoeWhat will send this book to the top of bestseller lists is the lovely way Reichl describes how dishes come together, like the Greek chicken soup with lemon and egg known as avgolemono, and her talent for assembling a collection of recipes her legions of former Gourmet fans will want to make themselves.\u00e2\u20ac?\u00e2\u20ac \" The Washington Post \u00e2\u20acoeThe recipes make for lovely", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51740604,

Methods: Evaluation of the validity of the tool involved 2 steps. Step 1 was conducted with 4 subject matter experts to evaluate content validity. Step 2 used an iterative cognitive testing process with 4 rounds and 16 SNAP-Ed staff and community partners to evaluate face validity. Results: Subject matter experts found that survey items appropriately matched the content area indicated and adequately covered collective efficacy, change efficacy, and readiness. Cognitive testing with SNAP-Ed staff and partners informed modifications and resulted in adequate face validity. Conclusions and Implications: The ability to measure collaboration readiness will allow agencies and community partners that implement SNAP-Ed to target areas that facilitate collaboration efforts needed for policy, systems, and environment change and collective efficacy. Further cognitive testing of the tool with other populations is needed to ensure its applicability and usefulness. Evaluation of the reliability of the tool with a broad range of SNAP-Ed programs and community agencies is also recommended.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57210510, "asset_id": 37257575, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2609170, "first_name": "Jinan", "last_name": "Banna", "domain_name": "manoa-hawaii", "page_name": "JinanBanna", "display_name": "Jinan Banna", "profile_url": "https://manoa-hawaii.academia.edu/JinanBanna?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2609170/824201/1024545/s65_jinan.banna.jpg"}, {"id": 32578680, "first_name": "Rachel", "last_name": "Novotny", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RachelNovotny", "display_name": "Rachel Novotny", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RachelNovotny?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 88883054, "first_name": "Laura", "last_name": "Stephenson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LauraStephenson8", "display_name": "Laura Stephenson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LauraStephenson8?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 156715, "name": "Nutrition Education and Promotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_Education_and_Promotion?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 168607, "name": "Low-Income Populations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Low-Income_Populations?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27573838, "title": "Determinants of Street Food Consumption in Low Income Residential Suburbs: The Perspectives of Patrons of KwaMereki in Harare, Zimbabwe", "created_at": "2016-08-05T21:03:51.702-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27573838/Determinants_of_Street_Food_Consumption_in_Low_Income_Residential_Suburbs_The_Perspectives_of_Patrons_of_KwaMereki_in_Harare_Zimbabwe?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_27573838", "summary": "The study sought to investigate the determinants of street food consumption in low income residential areas in Harare, Zimbabwe. This study was motivated by an observation that open eating spots in the low income residential townships are popular with patrons of seemingly high social standing. The study also sought to establish strategies for improving such places, from the perspective of both the clients and the vendors. The study was carried out using qualitative methods of collecting data, namely interviews and observations. The data was analyzed using a thematic approach. The major findings were that the high consumption of street-prepared food was due to the quest for cultural identity expressed in consuming traditional dishes, the desire to fulfill psychological needs such as self esteem, love and sense of belonging, social recognition as expressed in material possessions and the relaxation provided by the setting, flexibility and convenience. With regards to strategies on improving the facility, vendors suggested that the practice of food vending be legalized, while patrons suggested that the general hygiene and cleanliness of the place should be enhanced. Since food is a key component of the tourism industry, the findings of the study were used to design a framework which can be used to guide the development of street food vending, so that mutual benefits could accrue to the vendors as well as the tourism and hospitality industry at large.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47829570, "asset_id": 27573838, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2594470, "first_name": "IOSR", "last_name": "Journals", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "iosrjournals", "display_name": "IOSR Journals", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/iosrjournals?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2594470/1482486/33690215/s65_iosr.journals.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43883, "name": "Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 30871071, "title": "A Study on Development of Spice Flavoured Herb (Phyllanthus Niruri) Tea for Healthy Immune System", "created_at": "2017-01-11T01:41:03.767-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30871071/A_Study_on_Development_of_Spice_Flavoured_Herb_Phyllanthus_Niruri_Tea_for_Healthy_Immune_System?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_30871071", "summary": "Advancement in Technology has paved way for many Industries to develop and provide ample opportunities to the people around the world. People are addicted to live a luxurious life hence the living style changed rapidly which resulted in many health issues. Major reason for the health issues are related to the food they consume and the water they drink. To reduce the ill effects faced by humans because of their food habits many NGO started creating awareness among the people about the health benefits derived from natural products. In recent times, there is a growing interest in the development and evaluation of natural bioactive and antioxidant active products from plant materials. Tea in general and green tea in particular, are gaining consumer attention due to a growing awareness about the health benefits derived. However the research and development of spice flavoured herb tea is very limited. The leaves of Phyllanthus niruri is reported to have good medicinal value such as hepato protective properties, anti-inflammatory agent, pharmaceutical drugs, antiviral ,antibacterial, lipid lower activity anti-hyperglycemic, antidiabetic activity. However the extract of the plant is very bitter, this constitutes a challenge in formulating an acceptable herb tea. This study was carried out to develop an antioxidant rich tea with different spice flavour. Spice flavoured Phyllanthus niruri tea was prepared in six formulations with control, SFHT1, SFHT2, SFHT3, SFHT4 & SFHT5. Each formulation flavoured with pepper, cardamom, coriander seed, ginger, mint respectively. The ingredients were sorted, cleaned / washed, dried at 250o c for 8 hours (cabinet drier) and milled into powder form. SFHT1 was the most preferred in colour, flavour, overall acceptability sensory properties while the control made up of 100% Phyllanthus niruri brewed the least preferred herb tea in most of the sensory attributes. The result revealed that the spice flavoured herbal tea can be considered as powerful antioxidant sources.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51297509, "asset_id": 30871071, "asset_type": "Work",

Recent nutritional ecology theories predict that an organism feeding on a single, highly predictable food should lack the typical active regulation of nutrient balance observed in all other organisms studied so far. It could instead limit itself to controlling the amount of food eaten alone. Such an animal would however be strongly affected by nutrient imbalances.\n2. Termites are an ideal model animal to test those predictions, because they are\nextreme food specialists.\n3.We investigated how the nutritional content of food affected termites\u2019 intake and performance by constraining groups of Nasutitermes exitiosus to artificial diets varying in their macronutrient ratios.\n4. We showed that (1) termites, contrary to other insects, did not compensate for nutrient imbalance by adjusting food collection (2) longevity in workers was strongly influenced by carbohydrate intake, while in soldiers it depended almost entirely on the number of workers remaining to feed them (3) tunnelling activity increased with the quantity of food collected and (4) intake had very little influence on lipid and protein termite body contents.\n5. We provide evidence that extreme food specialists might have lost the ability to regulate macronutrient intake. Our results highlight the importance of life history and ecology in the evolution of nutrient balancing strategies.\nKeywords: caste, longevity, macronutrients, nutrition, termites, tunnelling.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57450927, "asset_id": 37481557, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1012544, "first_name": "Poissonnier", "last_name": "Laure-Anne", "domain_name": "adelaide", "page_name": "PoissonnierLaureAnne", "display_name": "Poissonnier Laure-Anne", "profile_url": "https://adelaide.academia.edu/PoissonnierLaureAnne?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1012544/6198216/7022424/s65_poissonnier.laure-anne.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 93062, "name": "Nutritional Ecology, Feeding Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutritional_Ecology_Feeding_Biology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 173317, "name": "Termites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Termites?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 212750, "name": "Ecology of Termites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology_of_Termites?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36796673, "title": "Extraction and purification of \u00dfeta-galactosidase from a Local Almond seeds(Prunusamygdalus", "created_at": "2018-06-06T22:06:16.069-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36796673/Extraction_and_purification_of_%C3%9Feta_galactosidase_from_a_Local_Almond_seeds_Prunusamygdalus?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_36796673", "summary": "\u00dfeta-galactosidaseenzyme is greatly dispersed in plant tissues and it's known to be implicated in hydrolyzing terminal non reducing\u00df.D.Galactosyl residues from polysaccharides.

The Pathogen Modeling Program, a Predictive Microbiology tool, was applied to determine the hazardous threshold or growth boundary in hours to reach the maximum concentration permitted which the Argentine Food Code prescribed as 100UFC/g. Lag phase duration, generation time and growth rate values were also obtained. Parameters of temperature (14\u00b0C), pH (6,5), and consumption time (36hours) were the same for the two samples. The results for the low-sodium concentration sample showed that under said conditions, S. aureus would reach a concentration of 100UFC/g in 62.2 hours; while the time needed for the bacterium in sample 2 would be 90,6 hours. Also, it was determined that the critical transportation and distribution temperature for reaching a concentration of 100UFC in 36 hours was 17\u00aaC.  Finally, it was concluded that the low-sodium product would not pose a risk to health since it is consumed within 36 hours far below the time required for reaching the maximum bacterium concentration permitted. \nKeywords:  S. aureus, Predictive Microbiology; low-sodium, hazardous threshold \n1)\tTrabajo Pr\u00e1ctico Final para la materia Bromatolog\u00eda y Tecnolog\u00eda de los Alimentos, Carrera de Nutrici\u00f3n a Distancia, Facultad de Medicina, Fundaci\u00f3n Barcel\u00f3.

For example, to prevent weakness in the uterine bleeding, foods are recommended that some have the astringent property and some require astringent add-ons, like egg yolk which, in addition to the high nutritional value and good chymus (salih al-kimus), has also the astringent property, which is not mentioned in the text of the above article.

Such a size-contrast illusion would not, however, be operating when one serves from a common serving bowl. Exploring if and how serving bowls might bias intake offers the potential to uncover other mechanisms through which environmental cues influence behavior.\nMethods: In this between-subjects experiment, eighty six participants served themselves pasta either from a large serving bowl (about 6.9 liter capacity) or from a medium-sized serving bowl (about 3.8 liter capacity). After eating their fill, they completed a questionnaire, and their remaining pasta was weighted.\nResults: When given a larger serving bowl, diners served 78% more pasta (425.9 versus 283.9, p< 0.001), even though they did not rate the food as any tastier, or otherwise notable (all ps>0.24). In contrast to studies involving large-sized plates and spoons, people serving from larger bowls appeared to realize they served more and rated themselves as marginally more full afterwards.\nDiscussion: These findings again highlight the role that external cues play in food consumption and show the importance of considering the size of serving bowls containing multiple portions in relation to nutrition education on weight loss and maintenance. Instead of a size-contrast illusion driving the results, a different mechanism, such as consumption norms may operate on such occasions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42153802, "asset_id": 21593513, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40496048, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Wansink", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "BrianWansink", "display_name": "Brian Wansink", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/BrianWansink?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40496048/11048813/93556953/s65_brian.wansink.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 241044, "name": "Food intake", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_intake?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 699122, "name": "Food Portions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Portions?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2347055, "name": "External Cues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/External_Cues?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43522531, "title": "Fertilizer consumption trend in developing countries vs. developed countries", "created_at": "2020-07-05T06:03:48.771-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43522531/Fertilizer_consumption_trend_in_developing_countries_vs_developed_countries?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_43522531", "summary": "The study of the chemical fertilizer consumption in different countries provides basal data for the decision-making of fertilizer production and for the environmental impact assessment of fertilizer application. Hence, the aim of this research was to study and compare the trend of the chemical fertilizer consumption from 1980 to 2012 in Iran, Turkey, Japan, Germany, France, and the USA. For this purpose, various indices such as application rates (kg ha \u22121) of N, P, and K, arable land, and total fertilizer consumption were analysed. Results showed that the application rates of nutrients (N-P 2 O 5-K 2 O) in Iran, Turkey, Japan, Germany, France, and the USA in 2012 were 100-42-7, 100-42-7, 100-94-60, 100-17-25, 100-13-38, and 100-33-35, respectively. The lowest and highest area under production were observed in Japan with 4.0 million ha (0.033 ha/person) and in the USA with 155.0 million ha (0.51 ha/person) during 2008-2015, respectively.

Her many surprising discoveries paint a new picture of this institution so emblematic of Parisian life, a vibrant symbol of our heritage that Groupe Barri\u00e8re so brilliantly keeps alive today.\nAs part of her investigations, the historian examined seven public and private archives (eight linear meters of documents), viewed and classified 2,700 photos, read 14,000 pages of documents and interviewed direct witnesses for original testimony.\nThrough her approach, she found a different way of looking at the establishment\u2019s unique personality, based on three different facets: Building Fouquet\u2019s, Cooking at Fou- quet\u2019s, and Dining at Fouquet\u2019s.\nIn each area, she highlights the work and the foresight of the men who built Fouquet\u2019s reputation as an important address in Parisian society. Through prominent figures such as Joseph Thome, who built the walls, Louis Fouquet, who installed a cocktail bar, and L\u00e9opold Mourier, who created the gourmet restaurant, you\u2019ll learn about more than a hundred years of life on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es through the eyes of its most iconic de- nizen.

The biotechnological potential of microbial naringinase has drawn great attention from scientists worldwide for enzymatic debittering of citrus fruit juices. The novel yeast isolate Clavispora lusitaniae mutant has been isolated and characterized moleculary and biochemically in the Department of Microbiology, Punjab Agricultural University. Yeast produces naringinase, mixture containing \u03b1-L-rhamnosidase and \u03b2-D-glucosidase. Naringin is hydrolyzed by \u03b1-L-rhamnosidase to rhamnose and prunin then by \u03b2-glucosidase to glucose and naringenin. Bitterness of prunin is 1/3rd of that of naringin. Thus it is a reliable, controllable, reproducible technology, and especially safeguards the interest of horticulturists during seasonal glut of the fruits. The freshly prepared fermented W.Murcott (Citrus reticulata) beverage had TSS 14\u00b0B, pH 4.4, acidity 0.25%, Brix acid ratio 56.0, total sugars 10.4%, reducing sugars 3.24%, ascorbic acid 25.60 mg/100 ml, naringin 410.5 ppm, alcohol 0.00% (v/v), CO2 0.00 bar and total yeast count 5.70 (Log no. of cells/ml). Physicochemical changes recorded after three months of storage at refrigerated temperature revealed TSS 11.0\u00b0B, pH 3.95, acidity 0.53%, Brix acid ratio 21.75, total sugars 8.5%, reducing sugars 2.64%, ascorbic acid 20.04 mg/100 ml, naringin 164.30 ppm, alcohol 0.91% (v/v), CO2 1.35 bar and total yeast count 8.93 (Log no. of cells/ml).

It is native to Southeast Asia, and requires temperatures between 20 and 30 \u00b0C (68-86 \u00b0F) and a considerable amount of annual rainfall to thrive. Plants are gathered annually for their rhizomes and propagated from some of those rhizomes in the following season. Belonging to the ginger family, turmeric has been used in East India and the Middle East for thousands of years, and is now one of the most highly-prized spices in the world. Vitiligo is a skin disorder where the skin pigment is lost in certain regions and discolored or white patches remain on the skin. It occurs when skin cells are unable to function appropriately or when they die. Though many causes for vitiligo progression have been suggested, its exact mechanism of pathogenesis is still unclear. The beneficial effects of turmeric are traditionally achieved through dietary consumption, even at low levels, over long periods of time. Vitiligo is a skin disease that is prevented by turmeric, because turmeric has high antioxidant and high anti-inflammatory activity, that cure vitiligo and also helps to synthesis of melanin formation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66051732, "asset_id": 45575577, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 104222638, "first_name": "Kaustubh", "last_name": "Singh", "domain_name": "bbau", "page_name": "KaustubhSingh", "display_name": "Kaustubh Singh", "profile_url": "https://bbau.academia.edu/KaustubhSingh?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/104222638/23331322/22411668/s65_kaustubh.pranshuv.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 140, "name": "Pharmacology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 656, "name": "Pharmacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 26026884, "title": "Qualitative and Quantitative Spectro-Chemical Analysis of Dates Using UV-Pulsed Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry", "created_at": "2016-06-09T14:26:54.472-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26026884/Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Spectro_Chemical_Analysis_of_Dates_Using_UV_Pulsed_Laser_Induced_Breakdown_Spectroscopy_and_Inductively_Coupled_Plasma_Mass_Spectrometry?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_26026884", "summary": "Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is demonstrated for the spectral analysis of nutritional and toxic elements present in several varieties of date fruit samples available in the Saudi Arabia market. The method analyzes the optical emission of a test sample when subjected to pulsed laser ablation. In this demonstration, our primary focus is on calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), as nutritional elements, and on chromium (Cr), as a toxic element. The local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) condition was confirmed prior to the elemental characterization of date samples to ensure accuracy of the LIBS analysis. This was achieved by measuring parameters associated with the plasma, such as the electron temperature and the electron number density. These plasma parameters aid interpretation of processes such as ionization, disso-ciation, and excitation occurring in the plasma plume formed by ablating the date palm sample. The minimum detection limit was established from calibration curves that involved plotting the LIBS signal intensity as a function of standard date samples with known concentrations. The concentration of Ca and Mg detected in different varieties of date samples was between 187 and 515 and 35\u2013196 mg L \u22121 respectively, while Cr concentration measured between 1.72 and 7.76 mg L \u22121. In order to optimize our LIBS system, we have studied how the LIBS signal intensity depends on the incident laser energy and the delay time. In order to validate our LIBS analysis results, standard techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were also applied on an identical (duplicate) date samples as those used for the LIBS analysis. The LIBS results exhibit remarkable agreement with those obtained from the ICP-MS analysis. In addition, the finger print wavelengths of other elements present in date samples were also identified and are reported here, which has not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge.",

malnutrition continues to be major public health problems. Diets lack in macro and micro nutrients so strategies are needed to emphasize an increase in total food intake, in addition to add greater variety. Hence present study was designed to formulate Cereal Pulse Based Blended Flours. Two flours were developed by using roasting method: Wheat-Moong Blend (WMU) and Wheat-Moth Blend (WMO). The moisture content of WMU and WMO was 3% and 6.16%, ash and protein content was more in WMU 3.3g and 14.23g respectively. Fat was estimated to be 4.46 g in WMU and 4.61g in WMO, crude fiber was estimated to be 5.48g in WMU and 4.50g in WMO samples respectively. The anti-nutrients composition of WMU and WMO was found to be oxalic acid being 9.2 mg in WMU and 7.3 mg in WMO, phytic acid content was 75 mg in WMU and 85.2 mg in WMO. For organoleptic sensory evaluation and acceptability trail, six standardized recipes (Halwa, Cheela, Appe, Muffins, Attaladoo and Handwa) were developed by using both the Flours which were further compared with the control recipes. Results reported that Halwa, Cheela, Atta-Ladoo and Muffins prepared from WMU blend were found to be more acceptable, where as Handwa and Appe prepared from WMO blend were more acceptable.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68913938, "asset_id": 51050973, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 201750527, "first_name": "Swati", "last_name": "Vyas", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SwatiVyas12", "display_name": "Swati Vyas", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SwatiVyas12?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49079734, "title": "Development of bambangan (Mangifera pajang) carbonated drink", "created_at": "2021-05-31T07:01:03.168-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49079734/Development_of_bambangan_Mangifera_pajang_carbonated_drink?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_49079734", "summary": "Mangifera pajang Kostermans or bambangan is a popular fruit among Sabahan due to its health and economic values.

Thus, development of bambangan fruit into carbonated drink was conducted to produce new product concept. The objectives of this study were to conceptualize, formulate, evaluate consumer acceptance, and determine physicochemical properties and nutritional composition of the accepted product. Method used in conceptualising the product was based on questionnaire. The consumer acceptance was evaluated based on descriptive and affective tests with four product formulations tested. The physicochemical properties on carbon dioxide volume, colour, pH, total acidity, total soluble solid (TSS) and viscosity were highlighted, meanwhile nutritional composition on fat, protein, carbohydrates and energy content were determined. About 77% respondents gave positive feedback, and 69% respondents decided this product is within their budget. The formulation of 5% bambangan pulp, 70% water, 25% sugar and 0.2% citric acid was highly accepted in descriptive and affective tests with 4.4 and 6.39 mean scores, respectively. The physicochemical properties and nutritional composition of the acceptance product were in optimum value except for colour, total acidity and TSS.

In vitro antioxidant activity of HEAo and JAo was evaluated through the 2,2-diphenyl-1-pricylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging method. The in vivo gastroprotective capacity was assessed in acute gastric ulcer models induced by absolute ethanol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). HEAo and JAo presented antioxidant capacity in vitro. In absolute ethanol-induced gastric lesions, HEAo (200 mg/kg) reduced the ulcerative lesion index by 76.83%, and JAo (50 and 100%) reduced the ulcerative lesion by 98.55% and 67.64%, respectively, compared to the injured control (IC) group. In the indomethacin-induced gastric lesions, the results showed that HEAo (100 and 200 mg/kg) reduced the area of the ulcerative lesion by 82.24% and 93.03%, respectively, and JAo (25, 50 and 100%) reduced it by 97.39%, 94.67% and 98.24%, respectively, compared to the injured control.

Possibilities of drying cassava tapioca by firewood and gas flaring as practiced by the indigenes of Agbahar-Otor, have the potential of causing contamination. Results from these findings reveal that there is no significant difference in the proximate content, but the core heavy metals that could be toxic to health were not detected with the exception of Pb and Cd which recorded values of 0.02 mg/10g and 0.01 mg/100g with the use of firewood for drying, which is still within the WHO permissible limit. Thus the process involved in the drying of cassava tapioca as practiced by the indigenes of Agbaha-Otor is safe with caution placed on the use of firewood drying technique as a possible route to heavy metal contamination which could accumulate over time resulting to a serious health concern.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61023260, "asset_id": 40738917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49180003, "first_name": "Otache", "last_name": "Monday", "domain_name": "mciu-ng", "page_name": "OtacheMonday", "display_name": "Otache Monday", "profile_url": "https://mciu-ng.academia.edu/OtacheMonday?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49180003/18443214/18393840/s65_otache.monday.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 498, "name": "Physics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 523, "name": "Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7710, "name": "Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 39310849, "title": "Demissie Negash* A Review of Aflatoxin: Occurrence, Prevention, and Gaps in Both Food and Feed Safety", "created_at": "2019-05-30T02:00:41.817-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39310849/Demissie_Negash_A_Review_of_Aflatoxin_Occurrence_Prevention_and_Gaps_in_Both_Food_and_Feed_Safety?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_39310849", "summary": "This review was conducted to investigate on Aflatoxin: occurrence, prevention and gaps in both food and feed safety. Risk of aflatoxin contamination\nof commodities in the world, especially in Africa is increasing. Aflatoxin can occur in a wide range of important commodities, including cereals, nuts,\nspices, figs and dried fruit. AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG1, AFM1 and AFM2 are the most common type of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin contamination of agricultural\ncommodities poses considerable risk to human and livestock health and economic losses. Exposure to aflatoxin leads to several health-related conditions\nin human including acute and chronic aflatoxicosis, immune suppression, liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, stunted growth in children and many others.\nAflatoxins are detected from several crops especially from maize and groundnut. Several researches show that AFB1 is the most common aflatoxin in\nthe world from most commodities at a very much higher level. AFM1 was also detected greater than the standard from milk and milk products. This\nindicates that a lot of developing countries people are at danger of aflatoxin contamination. Lack of awareness on aflatoxin contamination increases the\nrisk of damage to human and animals. High economic losses due to aflatoxin occur in the country crops and animals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59449032, "asset_id": 39310849, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 97297159, "first_name": "Crimson Publishers", "last_name": "NTNF", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CrimsonPublishersNTNF", "display_name": "Crimson Publishers NTNF", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CrimsonPublishersNTNF?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/97297159/21424782/20816410/s65_crimson_publishers.ntnf.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2086, "name": "Public Health Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4468, "name": "Food Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Engineering?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31632, "name": "Food Microbiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Microbiology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217497, "name": "Food and Beverage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Beverage?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 37823650, "title": "Colloque international interdisciplinaire: L'ALIMENTATION EN SAVOIRS.

Though many epidemiological studies found that coffee drinking is associated with a lower risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), Caffeine present in the Coffee, impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. So, controversy still persists whether coffee is beneficial or troublesome for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We studied the influence of moderate Bunna (Ethiopian coffee preparation) consumption (6 \u2013 8 cups/ Day) on Type 2 DM in a sample of 60 healthy adult Type 2 DM populations associated with physical activity or sedentary life style. The present study reveals that moderate Bunna intake is favourably associated to control Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the population involved in moderate physical activity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47158502, "asset_id": 26894402, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50898355, "first_name": "IJRD", "last_name": "SUBMISSION DESK", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DebabrataPal3", "display_name": "IJRD  SUBMISSION DESK", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DebabrataPal3?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 23261228, "title": "Age Variation In Bitter Taste Perception In Relation To The Tas2r38 Taste Receptor Phenotype", "created_at": "2016-03-14T23:35:03.878-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/23261228/Age_Variation_In_Bitter_Taste_Perception_In_Relation_To_The_Tas2r38_Taste_Receptor_Phenotype?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_23261228", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43738281, "asset_id": 23261228, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45133593, "first_name": "Andrea", "last_name": "Smarrazzo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AndreaSmarrazzo", "display_name": "Andrea Smarrazzo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AndreaSmarrazzo?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 36504539, "first_name": "Martina", "last_name": "Galatola", "domain_name": "unina", "page_name": "MartinaGalatola", "display_name": "Martina Galatola", "profile_url": "https://unina.academia.edu/MartinaGalatola?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36504539/12071393/13447463/s65_martina.galatola.jpg_oh_b08e44f991317b22cddfae894f9e889c_oe_574cb3db"}, {"id": 45859675, "first_name": "paola", "last_name": "iaccarino idelson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "iaccarinopaola", "display_name": "paola  iaccarino idelson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/iaccarinopaola?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 156, "name": "Genetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19393, "name": "Sensory Analysis and Sensometrics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensory_Analysis_and_Sensometrics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 17263812, "title": "Dental caries Strategies to control this preventable disease", "created_at": "2015-10-24T21:02:08.175-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17263812/Dental_caries_Strategies_to_control_this_preventable_disease?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_17263812", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39406705, "asset_id": 17263812, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36895867, "first_name": "Jeronimo", "last_name": "Rubio", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JeronimoRubio", "display_name": "Jeronimo Rubio", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JeronimoRubio?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36895867/16148128/16592383/s65_jeronimo.rubio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 15066401, "title": "Kiwifruit-derived supplements increase stool frequency in health adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study", "created_at": "2015-08-20T21:33:49.303-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15066401/Kiwifruit_derived_supplements_increase_stool_frequency_in_health_adults_a_randomized_double_blind_placebo_controlled_study?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_15066401", "summary": "The worldwide growth in the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders has created an immediate need to identify safe and effective interventions.

Using a crossover design, all participants consumed all 4 dietary interventions (Placebo, Actazin low dose [Actazin-L] [600 mg/day], Actazin high dose [Actazin-H] [2400 mg/day], and Gold [2400 mg/day]). Each intervention was taken for 28 days followed by a 14-day washout period between interventions. Participants recorded their daily bowel movements and well-being parameters in daily questionnaires. In the healthy cohort (n = 19), the Actazin-H (P = .014) and Gold (P = .009) interventions significantly increased the mean daily bowel movements compared with the washout. No significant differences were\nobserved in stool form as determined by use of the Bristol stool scale. In a subgroup analysis of responders in the healthy cohort, Actazin-L (P = .005), Actazin-H (P < .001), and Gold (P =\n.001) consumption significantly increased the number of daily bowel movements by greater than 1 bowel movement per week. In the functionally constipated cohort (n = 9), there were\nno significant differences between interventions for bowel movements and the Bristol stool scale values or in the subsequent subgroup analysis of responders.

Nevertheless, plants do thrive in solutions that have lower nutrient levels than &quot; standard &quot; hydroponic solutions. This is especially true for green leafy vegetables that rarely need additional nutritional supplementation. It is concluded that in the highly complex system of aquaponics, special care has to be taken, via continuous monitoring of the chemical composition of the circulating water, to provide adequate concentrations and ratios of nutrients, and special attention has to be paid to the potentially toxic component, ammonium.

The study aimed to analyze the household dietary diversity of beneficiary and non-beneficiary households of Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) in selected barangays in San Pablo City, Laguna, Philippines and determine the nutritional status of children (6-60 months old) within these households. Methods. Household dietary diversity score (HDDS) was used as an indicator for the households\u2019 dietary diversity. The nutritional status of children was determined using anthropometric data from the Barangay Health Centers. A total of 270 households was randomly selected through stratified random sampling with equal allocation. Results.

The current commission of the IUAES, the International Commission on the Anthropology of Food and Nutrition (ICAF), initiated in 1977 by Mary Douglas and Ravindra Khare, has played a significant role in this increase, especially in Europe. The present Commissioner of ICAF is Igor de Garine (garine@wanadoo.fr) and the General Secretary is Annie Hubert (anahubert@club-internet.fr). For further information on officers see ICAF\u2019s website, www.icafood.eu. Although food and nutrition correspond to a primary human need, anthropologists rarely focused on aspects of food until the 1930s. Collaboration between anthropologists and nutritionists was first achieved by Richards and Widdowson (1936), and was developed further in the British Colonial Office and in the Organisation de Recherche sur l\u2019Alimentation et la Nutrition Africaines (ORANA). Interest in anthropological perspectives on food grew during the Second World War and the post-war conditions (Guthe and Mead 1945) and among members of the culture and personality school (Kardiner et al. 1945). In the area of applied nutrition, information from anthropologists was sought and this brought an anthropological contribution to the understanding of food scarcity and malnutrition. Agencies of the United Nations, such as the International Children\u2019s Centre, WHO and FAO included anthropological perspectives in their programmes on food and nutrition, and in 1966 a Food Habits Section was created within the FAO. In 1964, the International Biological Programme (IBP) included food and nutrition as a component in its Human Adaptability Section, allowing collaboration at a worldwide level between specialists from the biological and sociocultural sciences, including anthropologists. Meanwhile, Rappaport (1968) and Lee (1979) created a distinction between their \u2018human ecology\u2019 and the \u2018cultural ecology\u2019 of anthropologists, such as Steward, and Harris and Ross (1987) could be described as \u2018cultural materialists\u2019, all bringing food into their analyses. Following Levi-Strauss (1965), members of the structuralist school focused on the subject matter of food from yet a different perspective. Within the IUAES, the first relevant working group was on food symbolism in 1960, at the Sixth ICAES, and in 1968, at the Eighth ICAES, the International Committee for the Anthropology of Food and Food Habits was set up. This led to the inauguration of ICAF. The aims of ICAF are to: \u2022 assist anthropologists worldwide in basic and applied research on food; \u2022 encourage collaboration between biological and social anthropologists, and between these and institutions and individual experts from related fields of study; \u2022 stimulate education and training, scientific meetings and publications on the anthropology of food and nutrition; \u2022 promote indigenous expertise in less developed countries in regard to food problems and nutrition.

To address this gap, this study employs the concept of cultural schemas. Drawing from qualitative interviews and observations of 34 primary cooks in families, i identify the ubiquity of a \"cooking by our mother's side\" schema. This schema privileges culinary knowledge acquired during childhood through the social reproductive work of mothers. i argue, first, that this schema reproduces gendered inequalities over generations by reinforcing women as primary transmitters of cooking knowledge. second, it presents an overly uniform picture of food learning that obscures diversity, especially by overemphasizing the importance of childhood and masking the learning that occurs later in life. identifying and analyzing this schema offers opportunities to reconsider predominant approaches to food learning to challenge gendered inequalities in domestic foodwork.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58796761, "asset_id": 38713116, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 490988, "first_name": "Merin", "last_name": "Oleschuk", "domain_name": "illinois", "page_name": "MerinOleschuk", "display_name": "Merin Oleschuk", "profile_url": "https://illinois.academia.edu/MerinOleschuk?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/490988/167647/17299505/s65_merin.oleschuk.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8031, "name": "Socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialization?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13846, "name": "Division of Domestic Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Division_of_Domestic_Labour?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36342, "name": "Schema Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Schema_Theory?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 69180, "name": "Social reproduction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_reproduction?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 96097, "name": "Motherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Motherhood?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 106149, "name": "Gender inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_inequality?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1296864, "name": "Food Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Learning?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1492320, "name": "Family foodwork", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_foodwork?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2703055, "name": "Home Cooking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Cooking?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 6077717, "title": "Rice kernel phenolic content and its relationship with antiradical efficiency", "created_at": "2014-02-14T09:09:50.546-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6077717/Rice_kernel_phenolic_content_and_its_relationship_with_antiradical_efficiency?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_6077717", "summary": "Plant phenolics exert beneficial effects on human health and may also prevent oxidative deterioration of food. Two field experiments were carried out for characterising phenolics in rice. The first assay was conducted in 1999 and 2000 in Beaumont, TX and included five light-brown, two purple and 10 red pericarp coloured cultivars. \u2018Bran colour\u2019 was highly statistically significant for both bran phenolic concentration and antiradical efficiency (p < 0.001). \u2018Year\u2019 and its interaction with bran colour were not significant for the analysed traits, suggesting that seasonal differences and their interactions may not affect phenolic content or antiradical efficiency. The accessions ranged from 3.1 to 45.4 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) g\u22121 bran and from 10.0 to 345.3 \u00b5M trolox equivalents (TE) g\u22121 bran for total phenolic content and antiradical efficiency respectively. The light-brown bran genotypes exhibited the lowest values for phenolic content and antiradical efficiency, whereas red bran ones displayed ca 10 times higher total phenolic content and more than 50 times higher tannin content than light-brown ones. The two purple lines showed either low or high values for the studied traits. Antiradical efficiency of rice bran extracts was highly positively correlated with total phenolic content (r = 0.99***), suggesting that phenolics are the main compounds responsible for the free radical-scavenging activity in rice bran extracts. In the second field experiment (Stuttgart, AR, 2001 and Beaumont, TX, 2000), 133 coloured rice cultivars were analysed for total phenolic content in whole grain. The accessions showed a large variation for total phenolics, ranging from 0.69 to 2.74 mg GAE g\u22121 grain. The data confirmed previous results suggesting bran colour as the main factor affecting phenolic concentration in rice kernel and seasonal effects and their interactions as not significant. The results also confirm that within red and purple bran groups can be found the highest phenolic concentrations in rice kernel.

commitment to healthy family foodways is a means of demonstrating responsible individualism and self-care. In the current UK foodscape \u201cgood\u201d food is usually \u201chealthy\u201d and feeding the family \u201chealthy\u201d food has high symbolic and cultural value. In this article I examine the implications of such rigid conceptualizations of appropriate feeding practices and feeding healthy food as a means of doing \u201cgood\u201d mothering. I conducted a qualitative study over nine months in early 2011, inviting respondents to document their life histories around food through a series of asynchronous in depth on line interviews. There were two interrelated purposes, firstly to explore the food memories of others, and secondly to critically examine the social and cultural milieu in which these were articulated. Three quarters of respondents were parents and some considered food important for health and a source of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). This meant a commitment to the hyper surveillance of dietary practices in the interests of controlling health and/or illness, either theirs or others (children, partners, families). For one family this meant that they were forced to use \u201cunhealthy\u201d food in order to treat their child\u2019s drug resistant epilepsy. The diet was highly successful, yet potentially problematic for maternal identity. How can a \u201cgood\u201d mother feed her family \u201cbad\u201d food? I argue that one way of transcending this dualistic and absolutist approach to feeding is by engaging in intensive mothering.\r\n\r\nAvailable at:

The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional value of selected designed dishes, grilled chicken salad and spaghetti with tomatoes and parmesan.\r\nThe examined material was analysed for contents of protein, fat, fibre, and dry matter according to respective standards. Energetic value was calculated using Atwater factors.\r\nThe energy value of spaghetti with tomatoes and parmesan cheese amounted to 81.1 kcal/100 g and was statistically significantly higher (P<0.001) than that of the grilled chicken salad (67.0 kcal/100 g of product), which was associated with a significantly higher content of total carbohydrates (15.54 vs. 2.77 g/100 g), and significantly lower contents of protein (3.83 vs. 7.25 g/100 g) and fat (1.33 vs. 4.04 g/100g). The content of dietary fibre in examined dishes was similar, and amounted to 2.32 g/100 g and 2.33 g/100 g in the spaghetti and salad, respectively (P<0.001). The ratio of saturated to monounsaturated and polyunsaturated acids per 100 g of the chicken salad and spaghetti with tomatoes and parmesan cheese was 0.68:2.98:0.38 g and 0.54:0.61:0.18 g, respectively.\r\nHigh contents of protein in grilled chicken salad and digestible carbohydrates in spaghetti with tomatoes and parmesan, as well as favourable fatty acid profile substantiates their use as part of the balanced diet for sportspersons. \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32565497, "asset_id": 5439792, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2268906, "first_name": "Joanna", "last_name": "Molga", "domain_name": "olsztyn", "page_name": "JoannaMolga", "display_name": "Joanna Molga", "profile_url": "https://olsztyn.academia.edu/JoannaMolga?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2268906/1901352/2254077/s65_joanna.molga.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46771, "name": "Eating disorders in athletes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eating_disorders_in_athletes?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4682563, "title": "Ethical Consumption and New Business Models in the Food Industry.

Abstract: (Qualitative assessment of the preparation of a menu from an universitary restaurant from Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista \u2013 BA, Brazil). Food Services aim to provide balanced meals to meet the nutritional needs of their clients. The menus become important tools in the construction of the nutritional education. This work aimed to analyze qualitatively the menus offered in a distribution point of meals at a university restaurant in Vit\u00f3ria da Conquista \u2013 BA, Brazil. The menus were analyzed between April and June 2015, totaling 60 days, through the application of the QAMP method (Qualitative Analysis of Menu Preparations). There was a supply of leafy leaves of 53.3% and fruits on 70% of the time. These positive aspects of the menu were considered \"regular\". The incidence of sulfur-rich foods (33.3%), as well as the color monotony of the preparations (28.3%) and the supply of sweets (30%) were also classified as \"regular\". The offer of fatty meat (21.7%) was classified as \"good\". The reduced supply of preserves (10%), fried food (5%) and the combination of fried food + candy (3.3%) is considered as \"Excellent\". It is important to apply some changes to improve the aspects evaluated in the menu, including increase of the supply of leafy food and fruits, decrease of the supply of sweets and better planning in the supply of foods rich in sulfur.

Exposure to mycotoxins can directly take place via the consumption of infected foods and feeds; humans can also be indirectly exposed from consuming animals fed with infected feeds. Among the hundreds of mycotoxins known to humans, around a handful have drawn the most concern because of their occurrence in food and severe effects on human health. The increasing public health importance of mycotoxins across human and livestock environments mandates the continued review of the relevant literature, especially with regard to understanding their toxicological mechanisms. In particular, our analysis of recently conducted reviews showed that the toxicological mechanisms of mycotoxins deserve additional attention to help provide enhanced understanding regarding this subject matter. For this reason, this current work reviewed the mycotoxins\u2019 toxicological mechanisms involving humans, livestock, and their associated health concerns. In particular, we have deepened our understanding about how the mycotoxins\u2019 toxicological mechanisms impact on the human cellular genome. Along with the significance of mycotoxin toxicities and their toxicological mechanisms, there are associated health concerns arising from exposures to these toxins, including DNA damage, kidney damage, DNA/RNA mutations, growth impairment in children, gene modifications, and immune impairment. More needs to be done to enhance the understanding regards the mechanisms underscoring the environmental implications of mycotoxins, which can be actualized via risk assessment studies into the conditions/factors facilitating mycotoxins\u2019 toxicities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81336793, "asset_id": 72394616, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 70707312, "first_name": "Chinaza", "last_name": "Awuchi", "domain_name": "kiu-ug", "page_name": "ChinazaAwuchi", "display_name": "Chinaza G Awuchi", "profile_url": "https://kiu-ug.academia.edu/ChinazaAwuchi?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/70707312/18522146/42710628/s65_chinaza.awuchi.jpg"}, {"id": 216783409, "first_name": "Chukwuka", "last_name": "Ogbonna", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OgbonnaChukwuka", "display_name": "Chukwuka Ogbonna", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OgbonnaChukwuka?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216783409/75247997/63756107/s65_chukwuka.ogbonna.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3529, "name": "Organic agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_agriculture?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10225, "name": "Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 287869, "name": "Toxins", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Toxins?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 806073, "name": "Grain Yield", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Grain_Yield?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 49071914, "title": "Factors affecting cracking and breakage of rice (Oryza sativa L.) during milling: A Review", "created_at": "2021-05-30T01:14:40.822-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49071914/Factors_affecting_cracking_and_breakage_of_rice_Oryza_sativa_L_during_milling_A_Review?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_49071914", "summary": "This paper reviews some of the factors, which affect cracking of rice during milling. Factors reviewed included cultural or agronomic practices such as cultivar, date of planting, nitrogen application regime and its availability for plant use, time of harvesting and environmental conditions. Most rice varieties react differently to cracking during milling due to their different genetic composition. The genetic makeup dictates rice efficiency in nitrogen uptake, rate of moisture absorption and desorption as well as the variety's ability to withstand cracking. Julian day of planting also has an important role in ensuring grain quality, milling yield and milling recovery. Cultivar and date of planting were identified to be among the main factors that affected milling yield in most research conducted in several agro ecological zones with diverse environmental conditions. Rice milling yield or cracking resistance ability is connected to the N supplying capacity of soil as well as time of nitrogen application at certain growth stages of the plant, most especially at panicle initiation and grain filling, when N is at the peak of requirement by the rice plant.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67463394, "asset_id": 49071914, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 115615159, "first_name": "Pubtexto", "last_name": "Publishers", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PubtextoPublishers", "display_name": "Pubtexto Publishers", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PubtextoPublishers?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/115615159/38326304/32107941/s65_pubtexto.publishers.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1037, "name": "Agronomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agronomy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10225, "name": "Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19870, "name": "Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 44209986, "title": "Biosynthesis of Anthocyanins and their Applications as Food Additives", "created_at": "2020-10-01T10:16:09.841-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44209986/Biosynthesis_of_Anthocyanins_and_their_Applications_as_Food_Additives?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_44209986", "summary": "An essential attribute of a food product is its visual appeal, where the color is the most evident.

TNO Nutrition and Food Research of the Netherlands were, however, the driving force that organised the conference in Amsterdam. Nutrigenomics is the use of high throughput genomics tools based on the polymerase chain reaction (especially microarray DNA chips) in nutrition research. The conference drew together scientists from all over the world who are making contributions to this rapidly moving branch of scientific research. Over the last three years, research papers and books about gene-nutrient interactions and Nutrigenomics have increased from a trickle to a substantial flow of new knowledge. This knowledge looks likely to change the way nutritional medicine is practiced in the future, putting the emphasis on \" personalised medicine \" , which aims to treat individuals according to their individual genetic profile, taking into account gene-nutrient interactions that differ from person to person. One problem for gene hunters is that, despite the \" mapping \" of the human genome, the function of at least 50% of genes is still unknown. Even when researchers track down the protein that a gene is responsible for, we may still have a problem. This may be a totally new protein with no known function. This has led to the rapidly expanding science of \" Proteomics \" which looks at cell protein pathways.

Nutritional health interventions have included programmes to encourage the establishment of household kitchen gardens and local community farms to supply the people of Nauru with fresh produce. In this chapter, I draw on long-term ethnographic fieldwork to explore why these alternatives to the industrial food system have not only failed to thrive in Nauru, but have also become spaces for contestation and social friction. Further, rather than improve diets in a sustainable way, these donor-funded development initiatives have appeared to instead strengthen existing power and health inequalities. I suggest that such initiatives may be unsuccessful because in focusing on food they do not take into account long-term social ties, relations and hierarchies that structure food networks over time. In order to understand the successes and failures of a nation\u2019s efforts to produce healthy food for its citizens, it is necessary to interrogate the politics and social relations underpinning (post)colonial patterns of land use, food supply and demand.

products. Studies conducted on animals indicate antitumor, antiatherosclerotic and antiinflammatory effect of CLA, also find impact on reducing body fat and increasing muscle growth. However, the number of observations concerning human populations is insufficient to fully evaluate the relationship between CLA intake and reducing the risk of lifestyle diseases. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct further research. Literature data indicate that the use in pigs feed suplementation with CLA preparations, can increase the content of these compounds in the meat and also show, that isomer cis-9, trans-11 is accumulated at significantly higher level. However, these changes were accompanied by increased the share of saturated fatty acids at the expense of monounsaturated which is unfavorable for human health. A better way to increase the CLA content in pork meat appears to be the addition of CLA preparation during the production process, because it does not affect the level of saturated fats. Pork and pork meat products enriched in CLA are characterized by low susceptibility to oxidation, which may result from the coupling of double bonds, antioxidantive properties of conjugated linoleic acid and the increased content of saturated fatty acids. The issue of beneficial effects on human health of pork and pork products with a higher content of CLA, requires further studies conducted on humans. Only then these products can be classified as a functional foods.\n\nScharakteryzowano w\u0142a\u015bciwo\u015bci prozdrowotne sprz\u0119\u017conych dien\u00f3w kwasu linolowego (CLA) oraz dokonano oceny mo\u017cliwo\u015bci zwi\u0119kszenia ich zawarto\u015bci w mi\u0119sie wieprzowym i jego przetworach.

NIRS is a rapid analytical method with high sensitivity and non-invasive advantages. This study developed robust models using benchtop and handheld spectrometers to predict low concentrations of urea, glycine, taurine, and melamine in whey protein powder (WPP). Effectiveness of scanning samples through optical glass and polyethylene bags was also tested for the handheld NIRS. WPP was adulterated up to six concentration levels from 0.5% to 3% w/w. The two spectrometers were used to obtain three datasets of 819 diffuse reflectance spectra each that were pretreated before linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and regression (PLSR). Pretreatment was effective and revealed important absorption bands that could be correlated with the chemical properties of the mixtures. Benchtop NIR spectrometer showed the best results in LDA and PLSR but handheld NIR spectrometers showed comparatively good results. There were high prediction accuracies and low errors attesting to the robustness of the developed PLSR models using independent test set validation. Both the plastic bag and optical glass gave good results with accuracies depending on the adulterant of interest and can be used for field applications.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63818853, "asset_id": 43508518, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18036443, "first_name": "John-Lewis", "last_name": "Zaukuu", "domain_name": "atmenson", "page_name": "JohnLewisZaukuu", "display_name": "John-Lewis Z Zaukuu", "profile_url": "https://atmenson.academia.edu/JohnLewisZaukuu?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18036443/5020929/32464017/s65_john-lewis.zaukuu.jpg"}, {"id": 163581905, "first_name": "M\u00e1ty\u00e1s", "last_name": "Luk\u00e1cs", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Luk\u00e1csM\u00e1ty\u00e1s", "display_name": "M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Luk\u00e1cs", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Luk%C3%A1csM%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 138191329, "first_name": "Zoltan", "last_name": "Kovacs", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ZoltanKovacs29", "display_name": "Zoltan Kovacs", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ZoltanKovacs29?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4467, "name": "Chemometrics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemometrics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23892, "name": "Multivariate Data Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multivariate_Data_Analysis?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64464, "name": "Food Quality and Safety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Quality_and_Safety?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158072, "name": "NIR spectroscopy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/NIR_spectroscopy?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 204769, "name": "Food adulteration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_adulteration?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 12060857, "title": "Phytochemical and Nutritional Evaluation of Amorphophallus campanulatus (Roxb.)

L'esempio trattato in questo caso \u00e8 Master of None, la serie tv comedy americana (Netflix 2015-2017), ideata e interpretata da Aziz Ansari-attore americano di origine indiana-la quale presenta tra i propri temi principali uno sguardo ironico sui pregiudizi etnici e in generale sugli stereotipi culturali. Nella seconda stagione l'Italia vi assume un ruolo centrale, a partire dai primi due episodi ambientati a Modena, nei quali il protagonista compie un viaggio gastronomico di autoformazione alla cucina emiliana, filtrato attraverso una continua lettura citazionista del cinema italiano (dal De Sica di Ladri di Biciclette all' Antonioni de La notte). Ne emerge una rappresentazione dell'Italia volutamente condizionata da clich\u00e9 e luoghi comuni, che, a seconda dei pubblici (americano, internazionale, italiano) ha ottenuto consensi variabili, proprio dovuti a differenti effetti di rispecchiamento. Allo stesso tempo la serie si \u00e8 affermata su magazine lifestyle ed enogastronomici come una sorta di accreditata guida food & travel per la scoperta di luoghi e locali da visitare, sia per New York sia per l'Italia, ponendo cos\u00ec seriamente in questione la differenza tra un testo fiction e un testo non fiction. La comparazione di Master of None con il primo episodio della serie documentario Chef's Table (Netflix, 2015-), anch'esso ambientato a Modena ripercorrendo simili luoghi e motivi, porta a concludere che le differenze di genere discorsivo siano talvolta basate su un labile confezionamento discorsivo, facilmente svelabile attraverso un'analisi semiotica.

Its purpose was to contribute to the management of grass cover in this agricultural unit. For this purpose, floristic surveys were carried out in three (3) age classes of sugarcane cultivation using the transect method. Thus, 133 species of weeds divided into 36 families and 92 genera were recorded. Dicotyledons are best represented with 96 against 37 species of Monocotyledons. In all age groups, the richest families\u2019 species were Poaceae, Fabaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Asteraceae. The species diversity index has shown that the number of weed species increases with the age of the crop. These weeds are floristically homogeneous. Some species such as Cynodon dactylon, Cyperus rotundus, Dioscorea bulbifera and Ipomoea aquatica have been more aggressive in 0-3 month old crops. The most aggressive at 4 to 6 month old crops were Croton lobatus, Cyperus rotundus, Rottboellia cochinchinensis, Ipomoea involucrate, and Momordica charantia. The cane plots of at least 7 months are particularly attacked by Cynodon dactylon, Ipomoea aquatica, Momordica charantia and Porophyllum ruderale. The results of this study highlight the chronology of weed occurrence in the sugarcane crop cycle. This should enable optimal decision-making for weed control to improve weed management.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60287417, "asset_id": 40081178, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33384065, "first_name": "European Scientific Journal", "last_name": "ESJ", "domain_name": "euinstitute", "page_name": "EuropeanScientificJournalESJ", "display_name": "European Scientific Journal ESJ", "profile_url": "https://euinstitute.academia.edu/EuropeanScientificJournalESJ?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33384065/9874609/19912051/s65_european_scientific_journal.esj.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7710, "name": "Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36570650, "title": "Origin, Evolution, Biogeography, and Cultivation of Maize: The Role of Nixtamal to Nutrition and Economic Importance in Ancient and Contemporary Food and Culture.", "created_at": "2018-05-05T16:51:08.792-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36570650/Origin_Evolution_Biogeography_and_Cultivation_of_Maize_The_Role_of_Nixtamal_to_Nutrition_and_Economic_Importance_in_Ancient_and_Contemporary_Food_and_Culture?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_36570650", "summary": "Maize (Zea mays L.) originated from a single domestication event ca. 7000 years ago, directly descendant from an annual grass, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) native to the Balsas River drainage in southern Mexico. It origins have been a matter of considerable scientific debate, largely because of its phenotypic characteristics and importance as an economic staple. The biogeography of maize is related to its stalk sugar. Archaeological evidence indicates maize stalks were chewed and used to make fermented intoxicants such as pulque. The domestication of maize represents a process of evolutionary change involving the genetics of maize varieties. These changes are in response to human influence or conscious selection for certain favorable traits, or unconscious selection, that is, genetic responses to human modification of the environment or management of reproduction. Nixtamal, the preparation of maize through soaking using lime (calcium hydroxide), and ash (potassium hydroxide) to create alkaline solutions incrementally increases its nutritional value. Grinding kernels was considered a ritual act among pre-Columbian cultures. Imagery of women over a mano and metate grinding maize kernels had powerful symbolic references to female gender in Mesoamerican mythology, legend, and folklore. The religious and cultural importance of preparing and grinding maize becomes more comprehensible through food science, and its broader implications for nutritional value and economic importance to the rise of ancient civilizations. Adoption of maize processing in Latin America accompanied the spread of maize cultivation and biogeography. The earliest maize grinding implements date to 1500-1200 B.C. from southern Mexico and Guatemala. Maize processing and its consumption as enchiladas, tamales or tortillas, originated with Mesoamerican food and culture. Recent multidisciplinary evidence indicates previous assertions regarding the economic importance of unprocessed maize to pre-Columbian cultures in other regions of Latin America need to be reassessed, particularly regarding economic dependence.

Food and nutrient intake of the family members was assessed using 24-hour recall method. Consumption units were taken into consideration while calculating the individual food and nutrient intake. A total of 11,537 tribal households from rural areas of Nalgonda district were included in this study. The results of the study showed that rice was the staple food consumed by the population. Consumption of fats & oils, sugar & jaggery and roots & tubers was below recommended daily intake (RDI). Similarly, the diets of the households were also grossly deficient in micronutrients, especially iron, vitamin C and not meeting the Recommended Daily Allowances. This could be due to the poor intake of green leafy vegetables and fruits. Based on the results, it is felt that through health and nutrition education, we can bring change in the food consumption pattern. Promoting kitchen gardens in the villages also plays an important role in improving the in take of iron and vitamin C by increasing access and availability of green leafy vegetables.",

Directorate of Research and Technological Development Activities, ELGO DEMETER, Greece\r\n\r\nThe agricultural and agri-food sector are currently confronted with many challenges influencing all the stakeholders of the value chain (Galliano, Raynaud, 2015): consumers, citizens, firms, farmers and policymakers behaviour. This follows various societal and food crises in recent years, as well as an increasing awareness of environmental issues. This in turn involves public health issues, social issues, economic issues, international issues calling for a transformation towards agri-food systems that are ecologically, socially, and economically sustainable. This evolution takes place in a context where, on the one hand, consumers are more and more demanding in terms of quality, safety, traceability, sustainability of products (Murdoch, Marsden and Banks 2000; Trobe 2001; Dubuisson-Quellier 2009), but at the same time in terms of prices (Aschemann\u2010Witzel and Zielke 2017); on the other hand, highly specialized farms and food firms actively seek to enhance their market competitiveness and profitability (Capitanio, Coppola and Pascucci 2009). As a consequence, the agri-food sector has to deal with often contradictory requirements and has to innovate to square that circle. This raises a central question regarding the extent to which and in what ways the process of innovation itself has to change so as to reorganize and redefine the agri-food system as a whole  (Bock 2012).\r\nWhile the need to change the conventional agri-food systems is becoming nearly unanimous, the modification of existing practices and the introduction of new farming systems (urban farming for example), new forms of consumption (Seyfang 2006) and distribution, are disrupting the existing productive patterns and thus are often blocked. The unlocking of socio-technical systems aiming at pesticide reduction, for example, shows the importance of the processes of coordination of actors throughout the supply chains, the role of changes in advisory practices but also in logistics or marketing (Meynard et al., 2013; Picard, Tanguy, 2016). It also suggests the need to consider innovation as an interactive system rather than a linear process. Furthermore, it is important that an approach, taking into account that these changes might have an impact on food safety, is followed in order to predict the increased likelihood of the occurrence of safety incidents, so as to be better prepared to prevent, mitigate and manage associated risks (Gaitis and Ouzounidou, 2017)\r\n\r\nThis special issue has the following objectives:\r\n1. To identify the various agri-food system actors from production to consumption: firms, farms, new stakeholders like urban consumers, governments, and civil society organizations, involved in innovative activities and in transforming the agri-food sector;\r\n2. To provide a full overview of the innovative activities and different types of innovations, technological, organizational, social, institutional and policy innovations, at play in the transformation of agri-food system, including the development of new agricultural and agri-food practices (low-tech or high-tech), quality certification schemes, new distribution channels, new processes and the development of a circular economy;\r\n3. To offer a better understanding of the interactions between technological innovations and other forms of innovations in transforming the agri-food sector: how diverse type of innovations can foster positive synergies among themselves? What are the major factors fostering these synergies among innovations and leading to wider transitions?\r\n4. To understand and identify how actors (public and private organizations, financial organizations, researchers and trainers) can respond to the major challenges posed by innovations in the agri-food system in terms of regulation and supportive norms: implementation of cooperative projects, training, funding, etc.\r\n5. To implement measures to better understand and limit the risks and environmental impacts, to better respond to changing conditions and exploit opportunities for new ways of production and consumption, including the prevention, rapid detection and effective addressing of emerging risks for food safety and quality.\r\n\r\nHow sustainability-orientedinnovations can encourage actors to rethink their organizations and develop cross-sectors collaboration and experimentation? How to sustain and finance innovations and new modes of food production and distribution? How can we develop a multidimensional approach necessary for the implementation of these types of innovations? Exploring these different issues, from market-based technological innovations to civil-society-based social innovations, aims to shed light on the currentfood innovation dynamics towards quality, safety and sustainability.\r\n\r\nPapers may address several kinds of issues, such as:\r\n- Local and sustainable modes of production and distribution (short supply chains such as Community Supported Agriculture, local farmers\u2019 markets, basket delivery systems, urban agriculture)\r\n- Global value chains versus local value chains in the agri-food sector\r\n- Agro-food supply chains and territorial development\r\n- Agro-innovation in digital times\r\n- Climate change, agro-innovation and food quality\r\n- Sustainable innovation and corporate social responsibility\r\n- Consumer food trends and food safety challenges\r\n- Citizen\u2019s involvement and grassroots social innovations (local food networks,\r\ncooperatives, Participatory Guarantee Systems...)\r\n- Emerging food safety threats\r\n- Health and nutritional claims in food labelling: a puzzle game\r\n- Food Fraud\r\n- Food security: Contributions of a sustainable bioeconomy\r\n\r\n1st October 2019 : Deadline for complete manuscripts through online paper submission: http://www.editorialmanager.com/innovations/default.aspx", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59662432, "asset_id": 39513504, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 59707782, "asset_id": 39513504, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18044901, "first_name": "Delphine", "last_name": "Thivet", "domain_name": "bordeaux", "page_name": "DelphineThivet", "display_name": "Delphine Thivet", "profile_url": "https://bordeaux.academia.edu/DelphineThivet?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18044901/5025096/16509183/s65_delphine.thivet.jpg"}, {"id": 117254422, "first_name": "Corinne", "last_name": "Tanguy", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CorinneTanguy", "display_name": "Corinne Tanguy", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CorinneTanguy?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 117447575, "first_name": "V\u00e9ronique", "last_name": "Saint-G\u00e8s", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "V\u00e9roniqueSaintG\u00e8s", "display_name": "V\u00e9ronique Saint-G\u00e8s", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/V%C3%A9roniqueSaintG%C3%A8s?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1081, "name": "Food Safety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Safety?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4000, "name": "Anthropology of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38360, "name": "Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 145217, "name": "Food Innovation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Innovation?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 823210, "name": "Global Agrifood Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Agrifood_Systems?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 37286272, "title": "(v.3) Balut -- In The Light of What We Don't Know.pdf", "created_at": "2018-08-24T09:16:11.782-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37286272/_v_3_Balut_In_The_Light_of_What_We_Dont_Know_pdf?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_37286272", "summary": "What could a book on balut, an embryonated duck egg, possibly teach us about the world we live in? Margaret Magat hopes to delineate a whisper of subversion in the face of cultural domination by taking a street food from a peripheral corner of the Philippines and tracing its circulation both nationally and globally, through various mass mediated urban sites and diasporas, to pose sharp questions about culinary nationalism; omnivorousness and the accumulation of cultural capital; and the role of old and new media. Though folkloristics was one of the founding sources of food studies, it has receded from view under the glare of cultural anthropology, social history, and sociology, and thus the first compelling aspect of this book is Magat's utilization of that fecund theoretical domain. Our debt to folkloristics is hidden in what is thought to be common sense. Folklore was not only one of the earliest domains of scholarly inquiry to focus on the quotidian object such as food to understand people and their relationships to each other in a spatially-embedded, object-oriented way, but it also gave us a theory about why it had not been more extensively studied. Roger D. Abrahams formulated it succinctly as a \" triviality barrier \". Out of folklore also emerges one of the earliest critiques of the fraught search for \" authenticity \" \u2013 that eternal question that haunts modern consumers of culture-undertaken by Regina Bendix, who links it to the discovery of the folk and their aura in nationalist historiography. Yet, that search for authenticity is the very reason why documentation and analysis of everyday life emerges in the first place, allowing us to accumulate data and critique it.

It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrums, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. The solute is known as the dispersed phase and the solvent is known as the continuous phase. Other examples of emulsions include margarine, mayonnaise, cream, and salad dressing. A colloidal solution is when matter exists in a state of division in between a true solution, which is sugar in water, and a suspension, which is chalk in water.

Food has evolved from a common good and local resource to a national asset and then to a transnational commodity as the commodification process is rather completed nowadays. Cultivated food is fully privatized and this consideration means that human beings can eat food as long as they have money to but it or means to produce it. With the dominant no money-no food rationality, hunger still prevails in a world of abundance. In order to provide a sound foundation for the transition towards sustainable food systems, the very nature of food as a pure private good is contested and subsequently reversed in this paper, proposing a re-conceptualisation of food as a common good, a necessary narrative for the redesign of the dominating agro-industrial food system that merely sees food as a tradable commodity. This aspirational transition shall lead us to a more sustainable, fairer and farmer-centred food system. The idea of the commons is applied to food, deconstructing food as a pure private good and reconstructing it as an impure commons that can be better produced and distributed by a hybrid tri-centric governance system compounded by market rules, public regulations and collective actions. Several food-related elements are already considered as common goods (i.e. fish stocks, wild fruits, cuisine recipes, agricultural knowledge, food safety regulations and unpatented genetic resources) as well as food\u2019s implications (hunger eradication) and benefits (public health and good nutrition). Should food and be consider as a commons, the implications for the governance of the global food system would be enormous, with examples ranging from placing food outside the framework agreements dealing with pure private goods, banning financial speculation on food commodities or preparing international binding agreements to govern the production, distribution and access of food to every human being.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31416578, "asset_id": 3741311, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1250449, "first_name": "Jose Luis",

production of yellow passion fruit has increased in Brazil, and the inadequate disposal of peels has resulted in environment issue, and also a loss of fibers-rich ingredients. Its use contributes to increase the farmer income. This review analyzes the studies which have been performed on the use of passion fruit peel, considering the nutritional aspects, and to propose safe alternatives for employing this residue. Several investigators have assessed the dietary fiber contents in passion fruit peel which ranged from 35 to 90%, and the in vivo tests in mice and humans have identified the benefits of its consumption. Owing to this concern, it has strengthen the development of products enriched with dietary fiber as an ingredient in the formulation. A long time ago, the cyanogenic glycosides have been identified in passion fruit, except in the seeds. The toxic effects of foods containing cyanogenic compounds have been observed in African countries, where the cassava without adequate treatment has commonly been consumed. The thermoplastic extrusion procedure has been considered as a useful tool for reducing toxic components, and its use will be important for processing peels and to reduce cyanogens to the acceptable levels in accordance with the food regulation.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41122868, "first_name": "Jose", "last_name": "Ascheri", "domain_name": "ufrrj", "page_name": "JoseAscheri", "display_name": "Jose L R Ascheri", "profile_url": "https://ufrrj.academia.edu/JoseAscheri?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41122868/11164967/12459312/s65_jose.ascheri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13309, "name": "New Product Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Product_Development?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 422197, "name": "Passiflora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Passiflora?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2699214, "name": "Passion fruit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Passion_fruit?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 56383260, "title": "Impact of various types of heat processing on the energy and nutritional values of goose breast meat", "created_at": "2021-10-07T11:36:11.272-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/56383260/Impact_of_various_types_of_heat_processing_on_the_energy_and_nutritional_values_of_goose_breast_meat?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_56383260", "summary": "The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of various types of heat processing used by consumers (water bath cooking WBC, oven convection roasting OCR, grilling G, pan frying PF) on the energy and the nutritional value of goose breast meat (with and without skin). The material used in the study comprised 72 breast muscles cut from carcasses of 17-wk-old White Koluda geese. The energy value (MJ), the chemical composition (water, fat, protein, ash) and mineral composition (phosphorus P, sodium Na, calcium Ca, potassium K, magnesium Mg, iron Fe, zinc Zn, cooper Cu, manganese Mn) were determined in both raw and thermally processed muscles. It has been concluded that various methods of heat processing have a significant impact on the energy and nutritional values of meat. From a dietary point of view, the most beneficial was OCR meat without skin, and WBC, OCR, PF meat with skin as well, since it had the lowest energy value as well as content and retention of fat, phosphorus, and sodium. However, as for the content of the other minerals and their retention, WBC seems to be the optimal form of heat treatment of skinless muscles. 100 g of such meat provides 3.1; 33.7; 145; 180 and 9% Nutrient Reference Values-Requirements (NRVs-R) for Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, and Mn respectively in a diet of an adult person. As for meat with skin, the optimal method of heat processing to retain minerals is grilling. 100 g of meat processed in this way provides 3.9; 39.7; 125.7; 175; 6 and 12.7% NRVs-R of Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, and Mn. It follows from the above information that goose breast meat, as analyzed here, cannot be considered as a source of calcium since it provides less than 4% of NRVs-R. The results of the study will be useful for the consumers\u2019 nutritional choices. The geese breast meat, depending on the heat processing used and the content of skin, may be a valuable component of a varied diet, providing nutrients and minerals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76160331, "asset_id": 56383260, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2986303, "first_name": "Zuzanna", "last_name": "Goluch,  Assoc.

Based on arsenic concentrations we have classified West Bengal into three zones: highly affected (9 districts mainly in eastern side of Bhagirathi River), mildly affected (5 districts in northern part) and unaffected (5 districts in western part). The estimated number of tube wells in 8 of the highly affected districts is 1.3 million, and estimated population drinking arsenic contaminated water above 10 and 50 \u03bcg/L were 9.5 and 4.2 million, respectively. In West Bengal alone, 26 million people are potentially at risk from drinking arsenic-contaminated water (above 10 \u03bcg/L). Studying information for water from different depths from 107 253 tube wells, we noted that arsenic concentration decreased with increasing depth. Measured arsenic concentration in two tube wells in Kolkata for 325 and 51 days during 2002\u20132005, showed 15% oscillatory movement without any long-term trend. Regional variability is dependent on sub-surface geology.

Cuban families struggle to access food and maintain a decent quality of life as the socialist welfare state continues to falter in post-Soviet Cuba. Drawing on long-term ethnographic research in Santiago de Cuba, book reveals how Cuban families struggle to acquire food and assemble \u201ca decent meal,\u201d a local social category where families determine whether food quality and cultural-appropriateness meet their standards. The research illuminates the social and emotional dimensions of the practices of food acquisition. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and subsequent the loss of its most significant trade partner, Cuba entered a period of economic hardship known as the \u201cSpecial Period.\u201d Although new trade agreements have significantly improved the quantity and quality of rationed food, supplies have not returned to Soviet-era levels. Several years after the worst scarcities of the Special Period, many people from Santiago reported that they continued to live with food shortages and economic hardship. This book reveals that one of the most common ways of dealing with food scarcity, was \u201cluchando la vida\u201d (struggling for life): the arduous task of finding ingredients seen as essential to what is considered a \u201cdecent\u201d meal. To understand this situation, the book introduces \u201cthe politics of adequacy,\u201d which details how people resist and make sense of scarcity or changing availability of basic life necessities, such as food. This work is based on intensive ethnographic fieldwork inside the homes of 22 families in Santiago de Cuba, the island\u2019s second largest city. Spanning neighborhood, social class, household income level, and skin color, this book captures previously undocumented details of household dynamics, community interaction, and individual reflections on everyday life in Cuba today. \n\nBook Keywords: Food, Cuba, Socialism, Inequality, Consumption, Adequacy, Caribbean, Distribution, Household, Everyday Life\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

A 7-day digestibility experiment and a 112-day growth trial were conducted. Total dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) intake as well as body weight gain was similar for all treatments. The highest (P< 0.05) nitrogen (N) intake was in sheep fed T1 and T4 diets, while the lowest was in those fed T2 and T5 diets. Sheep fed T1 and T2 diets had greater (P<0.05) DM and OM digestibility than those fed T4 and T5 diets. The highest (P<0.05) digestibility of N was for the T2, T4, and T5 diets, while the lowest was for the T1 diet. The highest N retention was in T4 diet, whereas the lowest was in T3 diet.

The samples were subsequently analyzed for both nutritional and microbial composition using standard recommended techniques. Results obtained depicts different fungal species in the following respective order viz; Penicillium chrysogenum (22.5%), Aspergillusflavus (17.5%), Fusarium solani (15.8%), Aspergillusniger (12.5%), Aspergillusfumigatus (12.0%), Rhizopus stolonifer (10.0%), Alternaria alternata (6.2%) and Trichoderma atroviridae (3.5%) while both the chemical and the proximate compositions of the examined wheat grains exhibited significant disparity but without any significant variation in the patterns of fungal loads.

In an inchoate or undefined way, we still feel ourselves to be what we eat, and we identify with those people with whom we eat.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59639563, "asset_id": 39492232, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29460741, "first_name": "Nick", "last_name": "Rose", "domain_name": "angliss", "page_name": "NickRose", "display_name": "Nick Rose", "profile_url": "https://angliss.academia.edu/NickRose?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29460741/11289435/12595354/s65_nick.rose.jpg"}, {"id": 133302, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "James", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "PaulJames", "display_name": "Paul  James", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/PaulJames?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/133302/250770/296382/s65_paul.james.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3539, "name": "Food Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Systems?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3541, "name": "Food Security and Insecurity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security_and_Insecurity?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25635, "name": "Food Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Sovereignty?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38360, "name": "Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 81278, "name": "Food Security and Social Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security_and_Social_Justice?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 81291, "name": "Sustainable Food Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Food_Systems?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 191026, "name": "Climate Change and Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_and_Food_Security?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 368486, "name": "Climate change and sustainable food production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_change_and_sustainable_food_production?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1672039, "name": "Land Agriculture and Food Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Agriculture_and_Food_Sovereignty?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 37615076, "title": "How to Lose Body Fat Fast", "created_at": "2018-10-20T00:17:07.856-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37615076/How_to_Lose_Body_Fat_Fast?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_37615076", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57598050, "asset_id": 37615076, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 95528549, "first_name": "Dzaki", "last_name": "Kamal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KamalDzaki", "display_name": "Dzaki Kamal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KamalDzaki?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63097, "name": "Exercise Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exercise_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69367, "name": "Exercise and physical activity for health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exercise_and_physical_activity_for_health?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1206285, "name": "Working Out", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Out?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1457256, "name": "Fat Burning Foods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fat_Burning_Foods?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 36835639, "title": "How can tomorrows farmer's feed 9.5 billion people, sustainably?", "created_at": "2018-06-13T04:07:59.405-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36835639/How_can_tomorrows_farmers_feed_9_5_billion_people_sustainably?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_36835639", "summary": "Currently, we are producing enough food to feed ten billion people.  However, under the current circumstances, over 795 million people are chronically undernourished (in 2016) , 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted annually  and global population levels are set to peak (in 2050) at 9.7 billion people.  Thus, to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger, several changes must be made. Given the upwards population growth, it is easy to assume that tomorrow\u2019s farmers must produce more food to meet the demand. However, this essay agrees with the claim \u201ctomorrow\u2019s farmers need to produce more food with fewer resources\u201d to the extent that, yes, farmers will have to use fewer resources, but not necessarily to produce more food. This paper shall proceed through two substantive sections. The first section will focus on disagreeing with the claim, proving why we do not need to produce more food. This will be done by addressing how both arable and livestock farmers have been working under the concept of Food Security, reviewing their role in the current food systems and organising the problems created in the framework of the Planetary Boundaries (PB). This will lead to a critique of the productionist approach  and instead, advocate that the focus should be on diet change, waste reduction and even distribution of food. The second section will recognise two other key players in the future food systems, the \u201cpeasant farmers\u201d and new startup companies, such as Beyond Meat and Aquabyte. Firstly, it is important to note how the \u201cpeasant farmers\u201d will constitute the majority of tomorrow\u2019s farmers and how their alternative framework called Food Sovereignty, will help achieve several SDGs and offer a more reliable system for tomorrow's farmers to operate in, as it isolates itself from global external shocks as seen with the Global Food Crisis (GFC) of 2007. This essay will then propose the that there is an emergence of new farmers which constitute of innovative startup companies. Their aim is to tackle current environmental issues from the pollution of meat industry, to the depletion of fish stocks and the demand for land from arable farmers to meet production needs by offering potential solutions to ensure Food Security and/or Sovereignty. The importance of doing this is to demonstrate how all of tomorrow\u2019s farmers are key actors to achieve several SDGs and the 2\u2103 limit for global warming levels, set during the 2015 Paris Agreement.  This can only be accomplished if they switch their current focus of producing more food to recognising alternative priorities which this essay will explore.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56788076, "asset_id": 36835639, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55083910, "first_name": "Arifa", "last_name": "Akther", "domain_name": "warwick", "page_name": "ArifaAkther", "display_name": "Arifa Akther", "profile_url": "https://warwick.academia.edu/ArifaAkther?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/55083910/14523367/16181252/s65_arifa.akther.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25635, "name": "Food Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Sovereignty?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38360, "name": "Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 85518, "name": "La V\u00eda Campesina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/La_V%C3%ADa_Campesina?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 86626, "name": "Veganism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Veganism?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 36065476, "title": "scenedesmus.pdf", "created_at": "2018-03-03T00:12:45.782-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36065476/scenedesmus_pdf?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_36065476", "summary": "The present work aimed to investigate the effect of mixing microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus with wheat flour (72% extraction rate) on enhancing the nutritional characteristics, phytochemical compounds and antioxidant activity of lasagna pasta.

Also, it contained high amounts of phytochemical compounds, consequently characterized with high antioxidant activity. Furthermore, it was safe as an edable source, where its lethal toxicity was 10 g/kg mice body weight corresponding to 78 g/70 kg human body weight. Results also showed the increase of protein content with percentages 11.20 and 14.5% in lasagna pasta of control and 7.5% algae, respectively. Phytochemicals and antioxidant activity increased with increasing algae percentage but cooking decreased all phytochemicals compared to the uncooked lasagna pasta. Cooking losse was not significantly affected with increasing algae in lasagna pasta while weight gain decreased compared to control sample. Texture analyses showed that, firmness of lasagna pasta increased with increasing the addition percentage of algae as compared to control sample. Cohesiveness, chewiness and springiness values decreased in all lasagna pasta samples compared to wheat lasagna pasta. Hunter color parameter indicated that, lightness of cooked lasagna pasta was higher than dried lasagna pasta. Also, redness (a* values) of algae lasagna pasta had negative a* and positive yellowness (b*) due to the chlorophyll content. Lasagna pasta of 2.5% algae had higher color, taste, texture and overall acceptability scores compared to other higher algae content.

The ash and carbohydrate contents of defatted flours were 2.7% and 17.56% respectively. The hyperbolic kinetics of dehydration showed that the sun was a slow process of dehydration (6 days were required for the complete elimination of water) while the electric drying at 50\u00b0C and smoking were relatively rapid processes of dehydration. Processing of insects greatly increases protein solubility. The analysis of functional properties revealed that roasting and grilling of larvae led to a decrease in water absorption capacity. In contrast to the boiling and grilling which maintained water absorption capacity at 3.5 ml/g, culinary treatments (smoking) increased the solubility of proteins, and decreased oil absorption capacities to values that are still higher than 0.7 and 0.9 ml/g needed in food formulation. The effect of pH (1-12) on the proteins showed that a majority of proteins are soluble in alkaline pH and there are more than two proteins in RP larvae flours with iso-electric point of 4 and 8. Protein solubility was pH dependent, and increased at pH 7and 8.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51214480, "asset_id": 30779408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48745582, "first_name": "Tiencheu", "last_name": "Bernard", "domain_name": "ubuea", "page_name": "TiencheuBernard", "display_name": "Tiencheu Bernard", "profile_url": "https://ubuea.academia.edu/TiencheuBernard?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48745582/15335433/15985128/s65_tiencheu.bernard.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30454858, "title": "Vendor's Recipes", "created_at": "2016-12-14T23:20:49.681-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30454858/Vendors_Recipes?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_30454858", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50895627, "asset_id": 30454858, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58057986, "first_name": "Chrome", "last_name": "a46cb", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Chromea46cb", "display_name": "Chrome a46cb", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Chromea46cb?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 531, "name": "Organic Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organic_Chemistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30102612, "title": "A Half-Century Portrait: Health Transition in the Xavante Indians from Central Brazil.

Members of this research group first studied the Xavante in 1990 and have since published on such diverse topics such as nutrition, subsistence, demography, epidemiology of infectious and parasitic diseases, and social organization. Recently, the group has focused on the relationship between health profiles and emergent forms of socioeconomic differentiation internal to specific Xavante communities. Additionally, they have begun publishing the results of longitudinal studies that document phenomena that had not yet been evident in cross-sectional approaches. In this chapter, they illustrate these new directions with examples of recent research on dental health, demography, and nutrition transition.

Background: Anaemia is very prevalent in adolescent girls, especially in developing countries like India. Treatment of anaemia based on the cause during adolescence decreases morbidity and mortality during early pregnancy. Despite weekly iron and folic acid supplementation programmes, the prevalence of anaemia among women and adolescent girls is still high. The objective of the study was to assess the proportion of anaemia and its determinants among adolescent school girls.  Methods: An observational study was conducted in adolescent school girls of Chandragiri from January to March, 2018. Demographic data, knowledge and practices of personal hygiene were collected. Nutritional status was assessed by collecting anthropometric, body composition measurements, dietary habits and haemoglobin was estimated.  Results: Of the 111 girls studied, 55.9% were found to be anaemic. Knowledge and practices of personal hygiene was lower in anaemic girls compared to non-anaemic girls. The extent of deficit of iron rich food consumption was low in both anaemic and non-anaemic girls.  Conclusions: Prevalence of mild anaemia was high and iron rich foods intake was low in our study subjects. Assessment of burden of anaemia among adolescent girls is essential to address gaps in implementation of public health programs and effective intervention programs can be designed to reduce the burden of anaemia.  \n \nKeywords: Adolescent girls, Anaemia, Iron rich foods, Knowledge, Attitude and practices ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59496448, "asset_id": 39354816, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48495460, "first_name": "Hemalatha Bathina", "last_name": "bathina3782", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "hemalathabathina3782", "display_name": "Hemalatha Bathina  bathina3782", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/hemalathabathina3782?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48495460/15328000/26299685/s65_hemalatha_bathina.bathina3782.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 159, "name": "Microbiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Microbiology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8566, "name": "Clinical Epidemiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clinical_Epidemiology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41071115, "title": "The International History Review Revisiting the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): International Histories of Agriculture, Nutrition,and Development", "created_at": "2019-11-26T00:44:08.789-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41071115/The_International_History_Review_Revisiting_the_Food_and_Agriculture_Organization_FAO_International_Histories_of_Agriculture_Nutrition_and_Development?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_41071115", "summary": "As far as international organizations and their written histories are concerned, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, presents quite a paradox.

The cells which produce insulin are beta cells. These cells are distributed in a cluster of cells in the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans, named after the anatomist who discovered them. In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells that produce insulin are attacked by the body's immune system. As more beta cells get killed off, the pancreas struggles to produce enough insulin to keep blood sugar levels down and the symptoms of diabetes begin to appear. In type 2 diabetes, the body builds up resistance to insulin and more insulin is needed to bring down blood glucose levels. As a result the pancreas needs to produce more insulin than it would normally need to. If the pancreas can no longer produce enough insulin to bring down sugar levels, the symptoms of diabetes will begin to appear.

Design: In-person pile sort activities were used to identify key dimensions of healthy eating beliefs, and online surveys were used to confirm these dimensions and examine perceived health benefits of healthy eating styles. Participants: The pile-sorting activity recruited 48 US participants in the Phoenix metropolitan area via social media and snowball sampling. Online surveys recruited US participants via Amazon Mechanical Turk (survey 1, n = 70; survey 2, n = 283). Analysis: The researchers used an exploratory visualizing technique (multidimensional scaling) to analyze pile sort data; Property Filling (PROFIT) analysis was used to analyze online survey 1; paired sample t test and repeated-measures ANOVA were used to analyze online survey 2. Results: Eating styles are a distinct set of beliefs within lay models of healthful diets (P < .001) viewed as important for a number of health outcomes, including weight management. Conclusions and Implications: In addition to educating the public about choosing healthy food characteristics , health and nutrition professionals may need to address people's beliefs regarding healthy eating styles to identify gaps and misconceptions.

Specifically, KT consumption has previously elicited hypoglycemic responses in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, implying KT consumption may alleviate symptoms of diabetes. One method by which KT may act as a hypoglycemic agent involves inhibition of digestive glucosidases, such as \u03b1-amylase. Indeed, KT demonstrated an IC 50 of 0.16\u00b10.06% (mL/U) during in vitro pancreatic amylase assay, while unfermented black tea failed to inhibit the enzyme. Inhibition of \u03b1-amylase by KT may be due to pH-dependent inactivation of the enzyme, biotransformation of tea catechins, or a production of an inhibitory factor during fermentation. Production of tea-free kombucha (MT) allowed further analysis of the roles of tea catechins on the inhibitory capacity of the beverage. MT demonstrated higher inhibitory dose than KT concentration at acidic pH (IC 50 = 6.3\u00b15.4% (mL/U)), but MT inhibitory activity was completely abrogated by pH adjustment. Conversely, inhibitory capacity of pH adjusted KT was reduced less than 10-fold (IC 50 = 1.2\u00b10.23% (mL/U)), however, complete inhibition was not achieved. Together these results support a role for both pH and biotransformation of tea compounds in the inhibitory mechanism of Kombucha tea on the enzyme \u03b1-amylase, however, de novo fermentative production of an \u03b1-amylase inhibitor is unlikely.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56415106, "asset_id": 35967148, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5852274, "first_name": "Katherine", "last_name": "Seehusen", "domain_name": "winona", "page_name": "KatieSeehusen", "display_name": "Katherine  Seehusen", "profile_url": "https://winona.academia.edu/KatieSeehusen?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5852274/19091540/19041731/s65_katie.seehusen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 269129, "name": "Fermentation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fermentation?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 681439, "name": "Nutrition Kombucha", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_Kombucha?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2825656, "name": "Kombucha", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kombucha?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 35498662, "title": "Dietary habits of Turkish adolescents in Konya, Turkey", "created_at": "2017-12-23T04:53:07.916-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35498662/Dietary_habits_of_Turkish_adolescents_in_Konya_Turkey?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35498662", "summary": "Problem Statement: The adolescence is a crucial stage between childhood and adulthood during which an individual acquires new qualities and practices including dietary habits that may be influenced by his peers and social circle.

previously reported on the health impact of the plant-based fasting method known as the Daniel Fast (DF). However, our prior studies have included only short-term (21-day) interventions, rather than interventions spanning multiple months. For long-lasting and robust health effects, dietary modification for longer periods of time may be needed. We determined the 6-month impact of a traditional (vegan) DF (n=12) and modified DF (n=9; allowing for the inclusion of small amounts of meat and milk) on anthropometric and biochemical markers of health in men and women (mean age: 45 years). Outcome measures were obtained on day one of the assigned dietary plan, as well as after 3 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months of adherence to the plan. Multiple improvements were noted for both dietary plans across the 6 month intervention, with limited differences noted across time between the traditional and modified DF. Compliance to both dietary plans was approximately 80% at month 6. These data indicate that both a traditional and modified DF, which allow for ad libitum feeding, result in improvements in multiple health-related outcomes. Adopting such a dietary approach may lead to enhanced quality of life, as well as a reduction in disease risk over time. Additional, long-term studies related to the health impact of this fasting method are needed.

This does not mean that sustainable food tourism is or can become carbon neutral. It means that the job of the food designer is to offer climate-friendly solutions and, maybe more importantly, that sustainable food experience designers should focus on how to inspire more sustainable food consumption and anti-consumerist lifestyles beyond the context of the experience.

In particolare, Jose Luis Vivero Pol ha pi\u00f9 volte sottolineato il legame tra la malnutrizione e la visione commodificata del cibo, concludendo che il consolidamento del paradigma del cibo come bene comune rappresenterebbe una scelta di dignit\u00e0 e tutela collettiva pi\u00f9 forte del messaggio alla base del diritto al cibo. Inoltre, esso offrirebbe un punto di partenza per riformare le politiche pubbliche di distribuzione alimentare, il commercio internazionale e le molteplici forme di appropriazione privata e speculazione sul cibo.\nIl riconoscimento e la pratica del paradigma del cibo bene comune saprebbe tradurre i meriti e le forze trasformative sopra descritte e ispirare altres\u00ec una riforma strutturale del \u2018sistema cibo\u2019 attuale, superando il ricorso a rimedi temporanei (come la distribuzione delle eccedenze e l\u2019educazione al consumo critico) ed evitando di concentrarsi esclusivamente sulla fase produttiva. La nozione di bene comune non riguarda, infatti, solo il cibo come frutto della terra che deve essere condiviso, ma anche la terra stessa, i mezzi di produzione, la distribuzione, la trasformazione e il consumo. Immaginare un regime del cibo comune porterebbe dunque al superamento definitivo dell\u2019idea del cibo come commodity in ogni fase della catena alimentare, dalla produzione fino al consumo.

The post harvest products of tomato are being consumed in form of tomato ketchup. Keeping in view the quality and safety of consumers the following studies were undertaken to evaluate the food safety in tomato ketchup prepared from organic and conventionally grown tomato cultivar (Solan Lalima). The organic and conventional tomato ketchup was analyzed for microbiological spoilage and safety parameters at every 20 day interval, during storage. For enumeration of microorganisms present in each sample, 10-fold serial dilutions was followed and the colonies were counted on nutrient agar media after 24 h incubation at 37\u00baC at 20 day time interval. The shelf life of the organic sauce was found to be over 20 days then the control sample.

Most of the weight of your hydrated brain comes from fats called \"lipids\". The brain also contains proteins, amino acids, micronutrients, and glucose. It takes these proteins from your food. However, that post-lunch apathy or late night alertness you might be feeling could simply be the effect of your food eating habits on your brain. The superstar fats are omegas 3 and 6. They have been linked to the prevention of degenerative brain conditions caused by our diets. Eating food rich in omega like nuts, seeds, and fish is crucial to the creation and maintenance of cell membranes. In contrast, long term consumption of other fats like food high in animal fat or sugar can affect your health in a bad way. Eating these types of fats can cause diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. The people diagnosed with these diseases are more likely to develop memory loss and even dementia or Alzheimer's disease. It was experimented that the neuron's rat which ate high fat and sugar diet had shorter and thinner dendrites, therefore, has a little number of synapses-dendrites transmit signals and synapses are the actual sites of neuronal communication-this could be one of the reasons that cause dementia. It also produces inflammation in the hippocampus, because astrocytes and microglia-two types of glial cells-support cells in the brain and become activated to protect neurons from inflammation become activated in response to the harmful environment. The brain needs more energy than other cells. Glucose is the only fuel that can be used directly by the brain. Neurons are always in a state of metabolic activity and have constant demand for energy, even during sleep.

enfants autistes, les particularit\u00e9s du comportement alimentaire sont courantes, et peuvent \u00eatre une source de stress importante pour les parents. Pour cette raison, la nutrition chez l\u2019enfant autiste ne constitue pas uniquement un probl\u00e8me clinique, qui interpelle les intervenantes et intervenants. Puisque l\u2019alimentation poss\u00e8de une importante une dimension sociale, il s\u2019agit aussi d\u2019une r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qui interpelle les familles directement. Dans ce chapitre, nous d\u00e9crirons sommairement les caract\u00e9ristiques des particularit\u00e9s alimentaires chez les enfants autistes et les impacts possibles de celles-ci.

The water holding capacity of the weaning food blends ranged between 1.52 and 3.81 ml/g while the viscosity ranged between 14.32 and 33.61 centipoise at 10% (w/v) flour concentration. The least gelation concentration ranged between 8.02 and 20.21 g/ml. The inclusion of sorghum malt in the blends reduced both water holding capacity and viscosity but increased the least gelation concentration. Almost all the pasting variables, except breakdown viscosity, reduced with the inclusion of sorghum malt in the formulations. The range of values for the pasting factors of the weaning food blends include peak viscosity (130.2-532.1 RVU), trough (73.2-335.3 RVU), breakdown viscosity (28.3-97.4 RVU), final viscosity (160.2-826.2 RVU) and setback viscosity (64.1-516.0 RVU).

The tax, however, remains contentious as pro-and anti-SSB stakeholders alike have drawn on speculative figures to quantify the currently unknown fiscal, economic, and health impacts of the proposed tax. This paper draws on international good practice in monitoring and evaluation, and the National Evaluation Plan criteria, to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework for the SSB tax. Applying the Logical Framework Approach, all potential impacts of the proposed tax, both positive and negative, are identified and matched with the appropriate unit of measurement to develop a comprehensive set of performance indicators. These performance indicators include, but are not limited to, the effects of the tax on economic output, employment, Value-Added and Corporate Income Tax collections, and obesity, diabetes and other noncommunicable disease rates. Each indicator is accompanied by a data collection plan that covers proposed timelines for baseline and subsequent data collection, as well as various data collection methods. These include the use of existing data sources, extensions to current data collection instruments, and the development of purpose-designed surveys. If properly implemented, the proposed economic monitoring and evaluation framework will provide the National Treasury with the necessary evaluative evidence to set the SSB tax at an optimal level that maximises the health benefits of the tax, while minimising any of the potential negative economic consequences.

It is inspired by the healthy lifestyle and nutrition habits of the Okinawa people who are a popular demographic, known for their prosperous health and extreme longevity in life.\n\nOkinawa is the largest island that forms a part of the Ryukyu islands of Japan. It stretches southwest between Kyushu and Taiwan.\n\nThe people of Okinawa are extensively known for their superior health, having more centenarians (people aged above 100) than anywhere else in the world.\n\nAs mentioned in Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic reviews, Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic is a formula based on the diets and daily drinking habits of the inhabitants of this island.\n\nThis dietary supplement is in powdered form, and you simply mix one scoop with water or your morning juice to make a delicious tonic to activate fat loss by attacking its root cause.\n\nThe inflammatory protein, C-Reactive, or CRP in your blood is known to block the fat-burning hormone, adiponectin. This causes inflamed digestion and it disrupts the whole metabolic process.\n\nOkinawa Flat Belly Tonic powder is known to reactivate this adiponectin, which converts the food you eat to energy, instead of storing it as fat cells.\n\nhttps://t.ly/okinawa_discount\n\nWho Curated Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic Formula?\n\n\nIt was a game of fate that led to the discovery of Okinawa Flat Belly Tonic powder.

Porque \u00bfacaso las pr\u00e1cticas culinarias de vanguardia no se valen del prestigio social de la ciencia, as\u00ed como la ciencia utiliza a la cocina por su seductora capacidad de acercamiento al p\u00fablico? El recorrido, jugoso e ilustrativo, nos recuerda que cient\u00edficos y cocineros tienen mucho en com\u00fan\u2026 y esto incluye las recetas de la abuela, los ingredientes secretos y los callejones sin salida que llevan a empezar todo de nuevo.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48219003, "asset_id": 27923466, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

Foliar fertilization is one of the crucial ways for continued cultivation of date palm, obtaining the best results of growth and production, in addition to the possibility to reduce damage from abiotic stress. Although subjected date palm to an annual fertilization program, it faces some challenges, including low soil availability for nutrients, dryness of the soil surface, low root activity in the breeding period, soil alkalinity, as well as water scarcity in areas of cultivation, and symptoms of deficiency of some elements. This review attempts to shed light on the importance of using leaf fertilization, demonstrating the successful technique and positive results, and proving the ability of date palm cells to absorb nutrients, similar to other trees, and interact with chemical and biological fertilizers.

Abstract (Barriers to drug therapy of Diabetes Mellitus): Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels, what may occur due to malfunctioning in the secretion or action of insulin. The difficu lty of adhesion to drug treatment is amidst the main problems faced by health professionals. Two main factors that may influence adhesion to the treatment include access to treatment and lack of knowledge in the management of the disease. In view of the above, this review aims to address the main problems related to adherence to pharmacotherapy of DM types 1 and 2. Here we reviewed data published between 2012 and 2017. Adhesion to med ication is also conditioned by factors such as, economic power, level of education and patient profile (child, elderly, pregnant and disabled). The presence of the pharmacist in basic care is of paramount impo rtance, as well as his professional improvement. Actions of continuous education with the population should be done routinely, thus ensuring adequate understanding of the disease and the benefits offered free of charge by the Ministry of Health in partnership with the SUS and governments.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55830591, "asset_id": 35948038, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10611381, "first_name": "Journal of Applied", "last_name": "Pharmaceutical Sciences", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JournalofAppliedPharmaceuticalSciences", "display_name": "Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Sciences", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JournalofAppliedPharmaceuticalSciences?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10611381/3201420/39536138/s65_journal_of_applied.pharmaceutical_sciences.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 140, "name": "Pharmacology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 154, "name": "Endocrinology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endocrinology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 656, "name": "Pharmacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 4581, "name": "Diabetes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diabetes?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 5796, "name": "Long-term diabetic complications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Long-term_diabetic_complications?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 12571, "name": "Clinical Pharmacology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clinical_Pharmacology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 18556, "name": "Diabetes Mellitus and Its Complications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diabetes_Mellitus_and_Its_Complications?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 23243, "name": "Type 2 Diabetes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Type_2_Diabetes?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 25630, "name": "Endocrinology & Metabolism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endocrinology_and_Metabolism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 71511, "name": "Diabetes mellitus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diabetes_mellitus?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 96573, "name": "Diabetic Retinopathy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diabetic_Retinopathy?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 133186, "name": "Pharmacology and toxicology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pharmacology_and_toxicology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 915951, "name": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Type_2_Diabetes_Mellitus?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 35179056, "title": "The Role of Microorganisms in Digesting Fiber in the Rumen: A Review", "created_at": "2017-11-17T23:08:09.713-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35179056/The_Role_of_Microorganisms_in_Digesting_Fiber_in_the_Rumen_A_Review?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35179056", "summary": "Microorganisms inhabiting the rumen are responsible for the degradation of fiber from their basal diet.

High digestion rate must be achieved in order to utilize the nutrients from the feedstuffs. In this manner, given the ideal nutrients and other needs, ruminants perform at maximum. As to which of the microorganisms are greatly needed in the rumen and as to how much they can help in the achievement of high digestion rate of fiber is a big controversy.

It is important to provide correct useful nutritional information to diabetic patient which can access by mobile technology easily. However, providing such information to patients using mobile application are limited or not easy enough to understand. One way is to use Augmented Reality (AR) technology environments which is very effective method in the expansion of information process visually, especially in health-related area by using mobile devices. Therefore, the integration of AR in mobile application that can provide health information is needed.

Hunger is a basic biological drive and eating should be a straight forward and fun part of family life.  But so often it is not.  Parents are busy, food is expensive and cooking takes time and even when you have managed to prepare the family meal, children announce random likes and dislikes that seem to come out of nowhere.  And on top of all that, we have the fears of obesity and eating disorders looming in the background.  How do we get our children to eat healthily when they don\u2019t like healthy food?  How do we get them to eat more without making them fat?  How do we keep them a normal weight without giving them an eating disorder?  How do we get them to be more active when all they want to do is watch TV or play on their phone? And what do we do about a daughter who starts to obsess about her weight? \n\nThis book aims to describe what constitutes a healthy diet and how to achieve this without making food an issue for your child.  It addresses many of the problems parents face when feeding their children and offers tips on how to overcome these without making matters worse.  And it looks at the ways in which we talk about food, shop and prepare food and eat food with our children and the impact this has on them as they grow up.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36407543, "asset_id": 10343056, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 714833, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Ogden", "domain_name": "surrey", "page_name": "JaneOgden", "display_name": "Jane Ogden", "profile_url": "https://surrey.academia.edu/JaneOgden?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/714833/242880/287178/s65_jane.ogden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 260, "name": "Health Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Psychology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 981, "name": "Health Promotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Promotion?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15108, "name": "Childhood Obesity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childhood_Obesity?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 41939, "name": "Eating Disorders and Obesity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eating_Disorders_and_Obesity?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 88461, "name": "Dieting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dieting?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 103526, "name": "Health Visiting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Visiting?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 120438, "name": "Healthy Eating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Healthy_Eating?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 7994235, "title": "Understanding the Monga in Northwest Bangladesh: household perceptions and perceptual connotations", "created_at": "2014-08-16T17:56:40.049-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7994235/Understanding_the_Monga_in_Northwest_Bangladesh_household_perceptions_and_perceptual_connotations?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_7994235", "summary": "This paper sets out to understand the Monga vulnerability in Rangpur region of northwest Bangladesh from the perspective\r\nof affected households.

"The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of plyometric and circuit training programme on explosive strength. For this study, one hundred twenty (120) male basketball players were selected from Punjab, age ranging between 12 to 16 years. These players were divided into two groups: Experimental Group (n=60) and Control Group (n=60). The Explosive strength was measured before and after a six-week training period. The players of Experimental group were trained for six days per week on alternative days (Plyometric Training on Monday, Wednesday and Friday whereas Circuit Training on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday), whereas Control Group did not participate in any training activity. The Explosive Strength was measured through standing broad jump. Mean and Standard Deviation of the standing broad jump were calculated. However, the Experimental Group showed a sign of improvement in standing broad jump that was significantly greater than Control Group. It was analysed through statistical procedure by using 't-test'. Result of this study showed significant difference between Experimental and Control Groups in pre-test and post-test for dependent measurements (p<0.05). Introduction Basketball is a sport with various complicated demands that need an aggregation of fitness, skill, team tactics and strategies, as well as motivational attitude. The ability to generate top strength level has been estimated as the key to get high sports feat. However, main areas that are likely to play an implicating role in a basketball player's achievement are muscular strength, fitness and body size. Methods of assessing and extending these qualities have been spaciously tested by controlled research setting, but there is a scarcity of research investigating the value of, and methods of improving muscular strength, fitness and body size of basketball players. It is a very demanding and physically challenging game. The ability of athletes has far exceeded the limits of the game put on them by the original inventors. The skills required by today's players are extremely different than those of yesterday. Basketball allows for individual athletes to exhibit physical aptitude within the context of an offence or defence. The attributes of change of direction and power are rules of the game. The athlete should be concerned with developing strength, agility and speed that enable the player to sustain maximum performance for the duration of the game. Explosive Strength is the capacity of the individual to release maximum force in the shortest period of time and agility plays important role in all games and sports, because when a player participates in the game then he/she has to bring about a purpose of fast change in direction and movement of different parts of the body. Plyometric training is an excellent way to train for the players' demands of basketball. Training programmes should include repeated high intensity work, followed by period of recovery that imitates the specific tasks related to basketball. Other terms used in combination with Plyometric training are depth jump, box jump and jump training. Plyometric training has been used in basketball training program as a useful method for improving motor performance. These exercises are used mainly to increase the maximal power output and jumping ability. It includes training loads with a number of rebounds and intervals between sets of exercises and drills. In plyometric training, athletes perform", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64477335, "asset_id": 44126485, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16063750, "first_name": "Hardeep Kaur", "last_name": "Saini", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "HardeepKaurSaini", "display_name": "Hardeep Kaur Saini", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/HardeepKaurSaini?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16063750/47598706/43425774/s65_hardeep_kaur.saini.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7428, "name": "Health Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Education?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25806, "name": "Physical Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Physical_Education?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30611277, "title": "Colloque international sur la saisonnalit\u00e9 de l'alimentation au Ch\u00e2teau des Lumi\u00e8res (Lun\u00e9ville)", "created_at": "2016-12-26T02:34:58.375-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30611277/Colloque_international_sur_la_saisonnalit%C3%A9_de_lalimentation_au_Ch%C3%A2teau_des_Lumi%C3%A8res_Lun%C3%A9ville_?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_30611277", "summary": "Session I, Les variations saisonni\u00e8res, ou s\u2019accommoder des contraintes \u2013 Mod\u00e9rateur Faustine R\u00e9gnier \nSession II, Les enjeux de la saisonnalit\u00e9 \u2013 Mod\u00e9rateur Denis Saillard \nSession III, Saisons et scansions alimentaires \u2013 Mod\u00e9rateur Marie-Pierre Julien ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51058887, "asset_id": 30611277, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20951565, "first_name": "Didier", "last_name": "Francfort", "domain_name": "univ-lorraine", "page_name": "DidierFrancfort", "display_name": "Didier Francfort", "profile_url": "https://univ-lorraine.academia.edu/DidierFrancfort?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20951565/6963603/11536210/s65_didier.francfort.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1913, "name": "Gastronomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gastronomy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61525, "name": "Gastronomia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gastronomia?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 207265, "name": "Alimentation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alimentation?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 374618, "name": "Histoire culturelle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Histoire_culturelle?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 9696734, "title": "Therapeutic Role of Dietary Omega\u20113 Fatty Acids in Periodontal Disease", "created_at": "2014-12-09T12:39:04.024-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9696734/Therapeutic_Role_of_Dietary_Omega_3_Fatty_Acids_in_Periodontal_Disease?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_9696734", "summary": "Periodontal diseases are multifactorial diseases, initiated primarily by the bacteria present in the dental plaque.

Persea americana (avocado) is widely grown fruit in parts of South East, Nigeria, where it is used as a medicinal plant in the treatment of several ailments by alternative medical practitioners. The chemical components of Persea americana seed includes the proximate and minor components. The fleshy part of the fruit was removed to obtain the seed. The dried seeds were ground to powder and dried to constant weight. The seed is high in carbohydrate (49.03\u00b1 0.02g/100g), lipid (17.90\u00b1 0.14g/100g), protein (15.55\u00b1 0.36g/100g) moisture (15.10\u00b1 0.14g/100g). It also showed low amounts of ash (2.26\u00b10.23g/100g). The seed also presented total oxalate (14.98\u00b10.03mg/100g). Levels of tannin (6.98\u00b10.04mg/100g) and phytic acid (3.18\u00b10.16mg/100g) were also present in low amount. It seems P.americana seed contains substantial amount of nutrients that could warrant it's utilization in animal feed or food.

around from thousands of years and were developed during Roman Empire. Bakery industry is one of the major food industries in India. These industries have played an important role in the economic development of the country. The two most important bakery products viz., bread and biscuits account for about 81% of the whole bakery products. The Indian bakery sector consists of some of the large food categories like breads, biscuits, cakes etc. The branded packaged segment in this sector had a size of R 17,000 crore in 2015. There are many bakery items likes pizza, sandwiches, buns, bread, chocolates etc. are manufactured in different bakeries of Allahabad, these comprise of 15 different types of breads, 12 different kinds of buns, cheese pasta and pizzas. Among all the bakery products the consumption of bread was recorded highest i.e. 35% followed by biscuits i.e. 25%. These products are having a good shelf life. Departmental stores in Allahabad are the main sources of purchase of the bakery products. Purchase made by the consumers from these stores responded satisfied (53%). Children (25%), students and their friends (35%) are the primary consumers of the bakery products followed by other members in a family. Among different bakeries in Allahabad visited and surveyed, on the basis of sensory data it can be concluded that Paradise bakery is having the highest products quality followed by the Calcutta bakery.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54331377, "asset_id": 34457927, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31493941, "first_name": "IRJET", "last_name": "Journal", "domain_name": "irjet", "page_name": "IRJET", "display_name": "IRJET  Journal", "profile_url": "https://irjet.academia.edu/IRJET?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31493941/9304077/11813823/s65_irjet.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35526346, "title": "Promocja zdrowia w zak\u0142adzie pracy: wsparcie dla zdrowego od\u017cywiania si\u0119 i aktywno\u015bci fizycznej pracownik\u00f3w", "created_at": "2017-12-28T03:29:00.690-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35526346/Promocja_zdrowia_w_zak%C5%82adzie_pracy_wsparcie_dla_zdrowego_od%C5%BCywiania_si%C4%99_i_aktywno%C5%9Bci_fizycznej_pracownik%C3%B3w?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35526346", "summary": "Od\u017cywianie si\u0119 i aktywno\u015b\u0107 fizyczna to dwa obszary popularnie rozumianego stylu \u017cycia, kt\u00f3re \u2013 zgodnie z naukowymi ustaleniami, ale i w przekonaniach wi\u0119kszo\u015bci spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwa \u2013 s\u0105 szczeg\u00f3lnie istotne w\u015br\u00f3d og\u00f3\u0142u uwarunkowa\u0144 zdrowia.

It has the highest proportion in cassava tuber which is a staple root crop in many developing countries, especially in West Africa. This research is aimed at determining the sugar contents in cassava tuber. In this examination, the sugar contents were further analyzed at the development phases of the tubers. Study Design: The root tubers of three cultivars which included TMS 98/0581, TMS 98/0505 and TMS 98/0524 from Otukpo Local Government Area, Benue State, Nigeria were investigated. The samples were collected in triplicates. Samples were collected between the month of November to April. Methodology: The starch and sugar contents were determined by techniques described by A.O.A.C. Original Research Article Otache et al.; AJOCS, 3(3): 1-8, 2017; Article no.AJOCS.37112 2 Results: The outcome from this finding uncovers that the Cassava varieties studied had appreciable quantities of sugars and starches. The result shows the following ranges of values amongst the varieties: total sugar (4.02-5.58)%, non-reducing sugar (2.74-4.24)%, reducing sugar (0.28-0.34)%, sucrose (2.60-4.03)% and starch (27.98-38.34)%. Variations were observed in the sugar content with sucrose and reducing sugar recording a mean value across the varieties of (0.82-4.15)% and (0.83-2.03)% respectively from November-March. Conclusion: Reducing sugar and sucrose are important sugars in cassava, which serve as the immediate product of photosynthesis and the fundamental requisite for the synthesis of sucrose. Results from this finding, will be used to enlighten farm extension workers on the requirement for improved photosynthetic process, as a way to build starch yield in cassava tuber. This research will also be used as a pointer in enhancing better awareness on the right season of harvest targeted towards improved nutritional yield in tubers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60760082, "asset_id": 40491617, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49180003, "first_name": "Otache", "last_name": "Monday", "domain_name": "mciu-ng", "page_name": "OtacheMonday", "display_name": "Otache Monday", "profile_url": "https://mciu-ng.academia.edu/OtacheMonday?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49180003/18443214/18393840/s65_otache.monday.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1081, "name": "Food Safety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Safety?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 71289, "name": "Glucose", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Glucose?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 75130, "name": "Sugar industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sugar_industry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 162196, "name": "Sucrose", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sucrose?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 217497, "name": "Food and Beverage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Beverage?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 35692536, "title": "Physico-chemical characteristics of noni fruit juice blended squashes during storage", "created_at": "2018-01-17T06:49:59.514-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35692536/Physico_chemical_characteristics_of_noni_fruit_juice_blended_squashes_during_storage?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35692536", "summary": "Noni fruit (Morinda Citrifolia Linn.), which have highest value of the medicinal purpose but it has strong pungent flavour, acrid taste and turbid nature.

The suggested model was tested through an empirical analysis conducted with children aged 8 to 11 and the data were analysed through partial least squares \u2013 structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) multigroup analysis. The findings indicate that the positive emotions PSAs generate and PSA credibility mediate the effects of the children\u2019s perceived likeability of PSAs on their behavioural intention to eat fruits and vegetables. Overall, understanding the connections between PSA likeability, positive emotions, PSA credibility and behavioural intentions can facilitate the development of further social advertisements aimed at children covering healthy eating. Therefore, the findings of this study are relevant for non-profit organizations, government institutions and advertisers interested in creating effective social messages aimed at children.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73832384, "asset_id": 60345224, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24615386, "first_name": "Fabio", "last_name": "Cassia", "domain_name": "univr", "page_name": "FabioCassia", "display_name": "Fabio Cassia", "profile_url": "https://univr.academia.edu/FabioCassia?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24615386/6657916/19907096/s65_fabio.cassia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 981, "name": "Health Promotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Promotion?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1786, "name": "Social Marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Marketing?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3637, "name": "Advertising", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advertising?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4255, "name": "Children's and Young Adult Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_and_Young_Adult_Literature?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5482, "name": "PLS (Partial Least Squares) Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PLS_Partial_Least_Squares_Methods?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 5483, "name": "PLS Path Modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PLS_Path_Modeling?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 9537, "name": "Advertising And Children/Adolescents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advertising_And_Children_Adolescents?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 11597, "name": "Children's Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_Media?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 30692, "name": "Marketing & Advertising", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marketing_and_Advertising?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 61797, "name": "Advertisement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advertisement?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 151129, "name": "Nonprofit marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nonprofit_marketing?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 242948, "name": "Public Service Announcements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Service_Announcements?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 284627, "name": "SmartPLS Software", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SmartPLS_Software?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 297179, "name": "Social Advertising", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Advertising?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 361860, "name": "Likeability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Likeability?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 523842, "name": "Healthy Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Healthy_Food?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 588198, "name": "Advertising and Branding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advertising_and_Branding?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1032020, "name": "SmartPLS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SmartPLS?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 41041371, "title": "Anne Kunze, Fleischindustrie.

In this article, we investigate a range of nutritional traits of five indigenous maize landraces in the US Southwest based on different kernel endosperm types: pop, flour, flint, dent, and sweet. We present macronutrient and micronutrient values for accessions of each landrace grown in the same environmental grow-out experiment. Macronutrient values vary considerably across these endosperm accessions. Sweet and flour maize had higher values of fat and protein, whereas dent had the highest carbohydrate content. Sweet and flour maize were comparatively the best sources of micronutrients. Sweet maize yielded the highest values of potassium, thiamin, and magnesium, and flour kernels had the highest riboflavin and niacin content. These results indicate that the maintenance of diverse maize landraces had nutritional as well as ecological, symbolic, and culinary value in both the past and today. Compared to modern commercial maize standards, traditional southwestern maize landraces had a somewhat higher caloric value, many had higher vitamin and mineral content, and all accessions but dent displayed higher protein values. This suggests that southwestern maize-focused diets that included diverse landraces may have been more nutritious than previously understood.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80479114, "asset_id": 70931429, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 701802, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Oas", "domain_name": "asu", "page_name": "SarahOas", "display_name": "Sarah Oas", "profile_url": "https://asu.academia.edu/SarahOas?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/701802/1137619/11814983/s65_sarah.oas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 84384, "name": "Maize", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maize?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 218712, "name": "Food and Cuisine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Cuisine?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 393304, "name": "Southwestern US Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southwestern_US_Archaeology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 39010358, "title": "How to Lose Weight Extremely Fast", "created_at": "2019-05-03T07:20:23.843-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39010358/How_to_Lose_Weight_Extremely_Fast?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_39010358", "summary": "This post is created to teach you how to lose weight extremely fast. Body composition in the most simplest form is manipulated by two factors. Those two factors make up the familiar equation of calories out (caloric expenditure) vs calories in (caloric intake). Calories out simply refers to your activity level. Activity level can be categorized by anything other then staying completely still. In this context activity level refers to exercise. Learning how to lose weight with exercise isn't hard either. There is no one exercise program that fits all needs. The best exercise/workout program to follow is the one you can stick to consistently. That is the most vital aspect of the caloric expenditure (calories out) aspect of the equation. Caloric intake (calories in) is the nutritional part of the equation. I am sure you have heard of portion control. That applies to this part of losing weight. In order for your activity level to have an impact on your weight loss you need to establish and maintain an caloric deficit (eating fewer calories then energy your burn). That is the essence of how to lose weight extremely fast. Your activity level raises your metabolism by requiring energy (calories) to perform. This requirement in conjunction with eating in a caloric deficit will make your body seek energy sources from somewhere else other then through digestion. That means the stored energy in your body (body fat) becomes the fuel source to supplement what you haven't provided from food.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59118896, "asset_id": 39010358, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 111398718, "first_name": "Jarred", "last_name": "Wesley", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WesleyJarred", "display_name": "Jarred Wesley", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WesleyJarred?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1415423, "name": "How to Lose Weight", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/How_to_Lose_Weight?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3223102, "name": "How to Lose Weight Extremely Fast", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/How_to_Lose_Weight_Extremely_Fast?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3223103, "name": "How to lose weight in a week", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/How_to_lose_weight_in_a_week?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3223104, "name": "How to lose weight with exercise", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/How_to_lose_weight_with_exercise?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 48916114, "title": "How important are homogenizers in the FMCG industry?", "created_at": "2021-05-14T04:58:50.223-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48916114/How_important_are_homogenizers_in_the_FMCG_industry?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_48916114", "summary": "Consumers are ordering their daily bread and butter online and it gets delivered mostly on the same day or the next days.

It is present mainly in the mitochondria of all cells, where it forms part of the respiratory chain (the primary element responsible for the energy metabolism of the cell). Acting as a conveyor of electrons in the respiratory chain, it is involved in the biosynthesis of ATP. In providing for the uncoupling protein of protons from fatty acids, it is involved in the process of thermogenesis. Moreover, coenzyme Q10 can act synergistically with \u00e1-tocopherol in the regeneration of its active form. As the only antioxidant synthesized exogenously it has a positive effect on the state of biological membranes, protecting them from free radicals and the lipid peroxidation process.

The extracts of Usnea rich in UA have been used in creams, powders, shampoos, deodorants, oral drops and recently in weight loss supplements.  UA has been shown to have some degree of antiprotozoal, antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity 1 .\n\nEarly in 2004, nearly 300 elk died in Wyoming where state officials reported that Parmelia species of lichen and UA was found in elk stomach samples 1.  The FDA received over 21 Adverse Event Reports (6 confirmed) regarding a dietary supplement containing Usnea was reported to have been associated with liver toxicity including a death and 7 cases of liver failure 2-3.  In 2001, the FDA issued a health warning for the supplement in question and it has since been taken off the market.  However, surprisingly other Usnea-containing products remain.\n\nUA concentrations as low as 0.3 \u03bcM directly affects the mitochondria 4.  The compound has been shown to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and resulting in decreased ATP synthesis (hence the weight loss) and cellular respiration.  As an uncoupler, UA is estimated at 50 times greater potency than the classic uncoupler dinitrophenol (DNP).  In addition to it\u2019s uncoupling effects UA stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species which also contributes to it\u2019s cellular toxicity 5.  It is currently unknown whether chronic low dose exposure to UA causes mild hepatic oxidative damage.  UA has a chiral center and can occur as two enantiomers, however, the most predominate isomer in nature is the (+).  Also, UA may exist in equilibrium as keto or enol tautomers (Figure 1).\n\nAt the NCTR, National Toxicology Program (NTP)-supported studies are underway which will evaluate the long term toxicity of UA in the form of Usnea lichen dispersed in 5LG6 rodent diet.  Mechanistic studies will also explore the basis for UA hepatotoxicity.  Confidence in the validity of these studies is supported by regular analysis of the test material lichen(s) as well as pure UA dispersed in the vehicle chosen for dosing.

Plant height, branches and capsule numbers, seed yield and seed oil content of O. biennis increased significantly with the rise in nitrogen fertilizer and zinc spray levels. The maximum levels of plant height, branches and capsules numbers were obtained from plants fertilized with 30 (kg N/fed) combined with zinc spray (400 ppm). The maximum values of seed yield (g/plant; kg/fed) and seed oil yield (kg/fed) were obtained from plants fertilized with 60 (kg N/fed) combined with zinc spray (400 ppm). In addition, the maximum level of oil percentage was obtained from plants fertilized with 60 (kg N/fed) combined with zinc spray (200 ppm). The results of fatty acids composition from O. biennis oil showed non-specific trend to the effect of the treatments under study on the profile of fatty acids. High levels of unsaturated fatty acids (~ 90%) were found in the oil samples, while saturated fatty acids (~ 10%) were found in lower levels. In general, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, ~ 81%); monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, ~ 9%) and saturated fatty acids (SFA, ~ 10%) were measured in oil samples. The predominant fatty acids in O. biennis oils were linoleic acid (C18:2n-6, 71.2-71.7%) followed by \u03b3-linolenic acid (C18:3n-6, 9.7-9.9%), oleic acid (C18:1n-9, 8.1-8.5%), palmitic acid (C16:0, 6.2-6.7%), stearic acid (C18:0, 2.7-3.0%), arachidic acid (C20:0, 0.4-0.5%), gondoic acid (C20:1n-9, 0.5-0.6%) and behenic acid (C22:0, 0.1-0.2%).

This article examines how this might be achieved, drawing lessons from three intervention types: ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTFs), mandatory fortification and voluntarily fortified products. We find that a common set of constraints tends to inhibit markets from delivering nutrition and makes it difficult to reach populations at the \u2018bottom of the pyramid\u2019. Overcoming these constraints requires a shift from working at the level of individual businesses to that of market and food systems. It also suggests a need for renewed focus on the effectiveness of products in reaching key groups, on the informal markets that serve the poor and on the inherent complexity of market systems. These findings suggest that food and nutrition policies and partnerships should be based on principles of experimentation and adaptive learning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37945331, "asset_id": 13100047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 910533, "first_name": "Ewan", "last_name": "Robinson", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "EwanRobinson", "display_name": "Ewan Robinson", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/EwanRobinson?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/910533/337423/50019280/s65_ewan.robinson.png"}, {"id": 30104482, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Humphrey", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JohnHumphrey3", "display_name": "John Humphrey", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JohnHumphrey3?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28360, "name": "Urban Food Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Food_Systems?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52563, "name": "Food Fortification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Fortification?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59372, "name": "Malnutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malnutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 133892, "name": "Bottom of the pyramid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bottom_of_the_pyramid?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 970733, "name": "Market Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Market_Governance?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 12954036, "title": "\"Start with the visceral\": Bryant Terry's Afro Vegan Praxis (A Review)", "created_at": "2015-06-12T15:36:32.194-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12954036/_Start_with_the_visceral_Bryant_Terrys_Afro_Vegan_Praxis_A_Review_?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_12954036", "summary": "In cookbooks dedicated to vegan Black Diaspora cuisine, Chef Bryant Terry abides by a mantra: \u201cstart with the visceral, move to the cerebral, and end with the political.\u201d This review explores Terry's recent cookbooks (Vegan Soul Kitchen, Inspired Vegan, and Afro-Vegan) with particular attention to how this mantra informs their writing, framing, and audience.

Functional properties (swelling, solubility, gelation, oil and water absorption capacities, alkaline water retention) and rheological properties of the native and modified starches were determined. Swelling power and solubility of the starch samples increased with increase in temperature. Swelling power and solubility were pH dependent, with maximum values obtained at pH 12 in both native and modified starches. Increasing degree of alkalinity increased both solubility and swelling capacity. Water absorption capacities of chemically modified starches decreased, but acetylated starch, ATAS showed higher value compared to the native and also chemically modified starches improved oil absorption capacity of the native starch. The modified starches showed increase in alkaline water retention. Gelation studies revealed that ACAS had higher LGC than the native while some chemically modified starches did not alter the gelation capacity of the native starch except for BAS and ACAS with LGC of 10% and 16% v/w. There were significant differences in functional properties between native and chemically modified starches from acha, so chemical modification improved functional properties. Chemical modifications increased pasting temperature except for ATAS and BAS. Set-back values were reduced after modifications, indicating that modification would minimize starch retrogradation.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37032934, "asset_id": 11525065, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2094182, "first_name": "Scientific", "last_name": "Research Publishing", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "scientificresearchpublishing", "display_name": "Scientific  Research Publishing", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/scientificresearchpublishing?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2094182/2786451/7831995/s65_scientific.research_publishing.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51369, "name": "Functional Foods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Functional_Foods?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10340686, "title": "CRAIG MULDREW, Food, Energy and the Creation of Industriousness.

The study reported here explored youth swimming coaches\u2019 interpretations of \u2018good practice\u2019 in relation to athlete nutrition. The study adopted an ethnographic approach involving participant observations of 17 competitive youth swimming squads in England and semi-structured interviews with 11 youth swimming coaches. Legitimised through discourses of physical preparation surrounding \u2018optimal nutrition\u2019, coaches discussed the importance of encouraging athletes to adopt \u2018healthy\u2019 eating habits and, in some cases, attempted to control what athletes ate through banning certain foods, removing \u2018contraband\u2019 foodstuffs, enforcing specific diets and holding regular weigh-ins for athletes. In addition, athletes were objectified as rational machines rather than individual subjects capable of making decisions about their own bodily practices. The consequences of exposing youth athletes to such practices are discussed in relation to athlete\u2019s rights and athlete health and wellbeing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63905935,

wheat gluten blend after it was subjected to heat and simple shear flow in a Couette Cell. The structured biopolymer blend can form a basis for a meat replacer. Light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy provided a detailed view of structure formation over the visible surfaces of the SPI\u2013gluten blend. Protein orientation in the direction of the flow was evident and fibrous formation appeared to exist on the macro- and micro-scale. Furthermore, according to texture analysis, the structured biopolymer obtained from the Couette Cell after processing at 95 \u00b0C and 30 RPM for 15 min has high tensile stress and strain anisotropy indices (\u223c2 and \u223c1.8, respectively), comparable to those of raw meat (beef). The novel element in this work is the use of the neutron refraction method, utilizing spin-echo small angle neutron scattering (SESANS), to provide a look inside the anisotropic biopolymer blend complementing the characterization provided by the standard techniques above. With SESANS, it is possible to quantify the number of fibre layers and the orientation distribution of fibres. For a specimen thickness of 5 mm, the obtained number of fibre layers was 36 \u00b1 4 and the standard deviation of the orientation distribution was 0.66 \u00b1 0.04 radians. The calculated thickness of one layer of fibres was 138 \u03bcm, in line with SEM inspection.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39453305, "asset_id": 17339209, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37017302, "first_name": "Georgios", "last_name": "Krintiras", "domain_name": "tudelft", "page_name": "GeorgiosKrintiras", "display_name": "Georgios Krintiras", "profile_url": "https://tudelft.academia.edu/GeorgiosKrintiras?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37017302/10544946/11768548/s65_georgios.krintiras.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4468, "name": "Food Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Engineering?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10655, "name": "Scanning Electron Microscopy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scanning_Electron_Microscopy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16137, "name": "Food Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Chemistry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 31630, "name": "Food Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Processing?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 39717, "name": "Food Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 65776, "name": "Thermophysical Characterization of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thermophysical_Characterization_of_Food?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 166634, "name": "Characterization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Characterization?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 226081, "name": "Texture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Texture?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 324212, "name": "Texture Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Texture_Analysis?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 713599, "name": "Rheological Characterization of Food Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rheological_Characterization_of_Food_Systems?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 885893, "name": "Light microscopy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Light_microscopy?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 9773653, "title": "Emperor Hirohito, Fidel Castro & the Cuban Lobster ", "created_at": "2014-12-14T23:32:27.837-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9773653/Emperor_Hirohito_Fidel_Castro_and_the_Cuban_Lobster?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_9773653", "summary": "This is the story of my late father, Chef Gilberto Smith-Duquesne and his very unique experience in Hirohito\u2019s Japan. \r\nAfter the 1959 revolution, my father recalled Fidel Castro being interested in Japanese cinema (Samurai films) and in particular, the Japanese work ethic and agricultural practices.

A dynamic, living product, food creates social bonds as it simultaneously marks off and maintains cultural difference. In bringing together anthropologists, historians and other scholars of food and heritage, this volume closely examines the ways in which the cultivation, preparation, and consumption of food is used to create identity claims of 'cultural heritage' on local, regional, national and international scales. Contributors explore a range of themes, including how food is used to mark insiders and outsiders within an ethnic group; how the same food's meanings change within a particular society based on class, gender or taste; and how traditions are 'invented' for the revitalization of a community during periods of cultural pressure. Featuring case studies from Europe, Asia and the Americas, this timely volume also addresses the complex processes of classifying, designating, and valorizing food as 'terroir,' 'slow food,' or as intangible cultural heritage through UNESCO. By effectively analyzing food and foodways through the perspectives of critical heritage studies, this collection productively brings two overlapping but frequently separate theoretical frameworks into conversation.\r\n\r\n Endorsements\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRichard Wilk, Indiana University, USA:\r\nHow can something as perishable as food become a concrete connection with the past?

It is full of convincing evidence that communities are not just imagined, they are also eaten.\r\n\r\nTed Bestor, Harvard University, USA and author of Tsukiji: The Fish Market at the Center of the World:\r\nThis path-breaking collection examines cuisine and cultural heritage as they create and reinforce culinary identities across shifting planes of local, national, and transnational contexts. The essays, by leading specialists in food studies as well as by young scholars, focus on the US, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Slovenia, Spain, France, and Germany, as well as on UNESCO\u2019s role in promoting cultural heritage movements. An appetizing world tour of culinary heritage, and a must-read for serious food specialists.\u2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReviews\r\n\r\n\r\nJournal of Folklore Research - Susan Eleuterio, Gaucher College:\r\nThis collection of thoughtful and well-written essays \u2026 successfully achieves the authors\u2019 goal of articulating food practice and its role in heritage more deeply than categories and labels. These localized examinations of the complicated interactions involved in the production, culinary processes, eating and, yes, consumerization of food provide new insights into the true complexity of examining and defining \u201cfood as cultural heritage.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nAllegraLab: Anthropology, Law, Art and World (www.alegralaboratory.net) - Special Book Symposium featuring Edible Identities:\r\n- Ivan Sandoval Cervantes, University of Oregon:\r\nThis book is highly recommended for scholars in the social sciences and the humanities interested in the politics of food, identity and cultural heritage, especially in relation to local, regional, and national politics. Furthermore, its broad geographical focus makes it an ideal volume to include in introductory and advanced university courses. \u2026 This collection of essays reveals that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to food, authenticity, and identity. \u2026[It] successfully provides a context in which to understand how the \u201cmacdonalization\u201d and \u201cextreme localisms\u201d throughout the world are giving rise to novel and creative strategies to construct and transform \u201cedible identities\u201d.\r\n\r\n-Julie Boticelli, University of East London:\r\nThe volume\u2019s strengths lie in its bringing together of various heritage discourses around food and how these are each implicated in wider circles of affirmations and contestations.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37761116, "asset_id": 12647414, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 163716, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Di Giovine", "domain_name": "wcupa", "page_name": "MichaelDiGiovine", "display_name": "Michael Di Giovine", "profile_url": "https://wcupa.academia.edu/MichaelDiGiovine?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1740, "name": "Foodways (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foodways_Anthropology_?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4000, "name": "Anthropology of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 6915, "name": "Unesco", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unesco?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 19764, "name": "Intangible Cultural Heritage (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Culture_?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 25237, "name": "Food and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Tourism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 31999, "name": "Food Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Tourism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 76239, "name": "Culinary Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culinary_Tourism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 90442, "name": "Food and Gastronomy Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Gastronomy_Tourism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 91173, "name": "Anthropology of Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 145195, "name": "Food and Wine Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Wine_Tourism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 148438, "name": "Anthropology and Sociology of Food, Taste and the Senses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_and_Sociology_of_Food_Taste_and_the_Senses?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 230114, "name": "Food and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Culture-1?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 478991, "name": "Mediterranean diet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mediterranean_diet?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 813416, "name": "UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UNESCO_Convention_for_the_Safeguarding_of_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 818291, "name": "Food Culture and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Culture_and_Identity?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 909752, "name": "Culture and Identity of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_and_Identity_of_Food?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 49139962, "title": "Food and Social Change: Culinary elites, contested technologies, food movements and embodied social change in food practices", "created_at": "2021-06-05T22:18:02.383-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49139962/Food_and_Social_Change_Culinary_elites_contested_technologies_food_movements_and_embodied_social_change_in_food_practices?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_49139962", "summary": "This Monograph collects a variety of articles that take food to analyze social change. By spotting food, they explore transformations at the level of structures and institutions, groups and social movements, and the role of agents, both from elite and the grassroots, explaining complex social dynamics.\nOffering a mix of country-specific case studies and engaging with key concepts and discussions, this Monograph covers social change in nutritional transitions over large historical periods; in renewed processes of nation-building and through food cultures; in disputes over food risks and the legitimacy of knowledge in food politics; in the transformation of food and nutrition into medicines; in social movements and social innovations that expand concepts of justice to include food justice; in the raising consciousness of social, cultural, historical, and environmental impacts of everyday culinary practices, which might lead to emergent changes in values and cultures; and in the transformation of food practices as self-care and lifestyle. The collection is purposefully multi-disciplinary, bringing together scholars from sociology, anthropology and multi-disciplinary fields such as gender studies, STS, and collective health. \nA collective endeavor towards a global sociology of food is still a major challenge, and this Monograph takes a few steps in this direction, by inviting contributions from, with, and about the Global South, exploring food worldwide and in diverse socio-political contexts. \n---> Table of contents: https://journals.sagepub.com/action/showTocPdf?volume=69&issue=3&journalCode=sora",

Algae are among the alternative sources with their large biomass and rich biodiversity. It can produce high amounts of macro and micronutrients, depending on the types and environmental conditions. It is especially rich in protein and essential amino acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, antioxidant vitamins, iron and iodine. It also contains many bioactive substances such as antioxidants, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides and lutein. In this way, it is used as an alternative in some societies for health promotion and disease prevention. Also, it can cause adverse effects such as heavy metal, toxins and allergenic agents. In order to benefit from algae at the highest level, it is necessary to increase scientific research in this field, to conduct risk analysis, to establish legislation and to develop global policies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65241479, "asset_id": 44753357, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99861713, "first_name": "M\u00fccahit", "last_name": "Muslu", "domain_name": "kastamonu", "page_name": "M\u00fccahitMuslu", "display_name": "M\u00fccahit Muslu", "profile_url": "https://kastamonu.academia.edu/M%C3%BCcahitMuslu?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99861713/21886709/21163870/s65_m_cahit.muslu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1633635, "name": "Food Science and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 44589557, "title": "Management and Prevention Strategies for Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) and Their Risk Factors", "created_at": "2020-11-27T11:03:46.845-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44589557/Management_and_Prevention_Strategies_for_Non_communicable_Diseases_NCDs_and_Their_Risk_Factors?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_44589557", "summary": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are of increasing concern for society and national governments, as well as globally due to their high mortality rate.

The main focus is on the elements of self-management and to reach a consensus about the influence of food on risk management and actions toward the prevention of NCDs at all stages of life. Nutrition interventions are essential in managing the risk of NCDs. As they are of the utmost importance, this review highlights NCDs and their risk factors and outlines several common prevention strategies. We foresee that the best prevention management strategy will include individual (lifestyle management), societal (awareness management), national (health policy decisions), and global (health strategy) elements, with target actions, such as multi-sectoral partnership, knowledge and information management, and innovations. The most effective preventative strategy is the one that leads to changes in lifestyle with respect to diet, physical activities, cessation of smoking, and the control of metabolic disorders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65048061, "asset_id": 44589557, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2824041, "first_name": "Dana Khdr", "last_name": "Sabir", "domain_name": "charmouniversity", "page_name": "DanaKhdrSabir", "display_name": "Dana Khdr Sabir", "profile_url": "https://charmouniversity.academia.edu/DanaKhdrSabir?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2824041/923507/27913867/s65_dana_khdr.sabir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1788, "name": "Non-communicable diseases", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non-communicable_diseases?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 17969, "name": "Health Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Policy?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 29394, "name": "Healthcare Operations Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Healthcare_Operations_Management?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 365117, "name": "Prevention Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prevention_Strategies?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 620049, "name": "Risk Factors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Risk_Factors-1?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 44322737, "title": "Suplementos de desintoxicaci\u00f3n y apoyo: Un enfoque m\u00e9dico de salud", "created_at": "2020-10-18T13:24:03.686-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44322737/Suplementos_de_desintoxicaci%C3%B3n_y_apoyo_Un_enfoque_m%C3%A9dico_de_salud?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_44322737", "summary": "Abstracto\n\n \n La desintoxicaci\u00f3n es una necesidad y sencilla para el organismo de eliminaci\u00f3n de sustancias no deseadas.

Then a number of price series for various parts of northern Europe give indications for the long term development of prices of herring. Following this an analysis of the consumption patterns of salted herring is carried out, and finally the influence of mercantilist policies is evaluated.

foothills of Northeast India, Darjeeling is synonymous with some of the finest and most expensive tea in the world. It is also home to a violent movement for regional autonomy that, like the tea industry, dates back to the days of colonial rule.\r\n\r\nIn this nuanced ethnography, Sarah Besky narrates the lives of tea workers in Darjeeling. She explores how notions of fairness, value, and justice shifted with the rise of fair-trade practices and postcolonial separatist politics in the region. This is the first book to explore how fair-trade operates in the context of large-scale plantations. \r\n\r\nReaders in a variety of disciplines\u2014anthropology, sociology, geography, environmental studies, and food studies\u2014will gain a critical perspective on how plantation life is changing as Darjeeling struggles to reinvent its signature commodity for twenty-first-century consumers. The Darjeeling Distinction challenges fair-trade policy and practice, exposing how trade initiatives often fail to consider the larger environmental, historical, and sociopolitical forces that shape the lives of the people they intended to support.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37736232, "asset_id": 4752267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

But beyond the hype, who are the people taking up the diet, and why are they drawn to its restrictive regime? Based on ethnographic research in Melbourne and Sydney, Gressier recounts the compelling narratives of individuals struggling with illness and obesity in order to argue that going Paleo provides a sense of agency, and means of resistance, to the politico-economic structures fuelling the prevalence of lifestyle diseases. From its nostalgic appeal to an idyllic past, to the rise of health populism globally\u2014where a sense of crisis, anti-elite sentiments, and new forms of media are fuelling a lucrative alternative health industry\u2014this book explores the promise and pitfalls of the Paleo diet in Australia.

Excessive intake of food and drink containing oxalate leads to calcium oxalate stone. Also, excessive intake of vitamin C which metabolized to oxalate may lead to hyper calcicuria and an increase in stone formation. Pain medications can be prescribed for symptom relief.

To study changes in food advertising on television after Chile\u2019s food\r\nmarketing restriction was implemented in June 2016.\r\nMethods. Food advertisements shown between 6 AM and 12 AM on the 4 primary broadcast and 4 cable channels with the largest Chilean youth audiences during 2 random weeks in April and May 2016 and 2017 were analyzed for product nutrition and child-directed marketing. Results. The percentage of ads for foods high in energy, saturated fats, sugars, or sodium (HEFSS) decreased from 41.9% before the regulation to 14.8% after the regulation (P < .001). This decrease occurred in programs intended for children (from 49.7% to 12.7%; P < .001) as well as general audiences (from 38.5% to 15.7%; P < .001). The largest declines were seen for sodas, desserts, breakfast cereals and industrialized fruit and vegetable-flavored drinks. Fewer HEFSS ads featured child-directed content (a decrease from 44.0% to 12.0%; P < .001), and the remaining child-directed HEFSS ads\r\nprimarily aired on internationally owned cable channels.\r\nConclusions. The significant postregulation decrease in the prevalence of HEFSS television ads suggests that children in Chile are now less exposed to unhealthy food advertising. However, television originating from national and international outlets should still be monitored for compliance. \r\nCitation: Correa, T., Reyes, M., & Taillie, L.

After drying, the products were ground into powder. Chemical properties and microbiological analysis of grains, camel milk, fermented camel milk and kishk like products were determined. Color measurement, water/ oil binding capacity, viscosity and sensory analysis were done. The chemical composition of oat and barley were better than the wheat in protein, mineral, fiber, vitamin and amino acid. Oats kishk like products gave the best results and sensory evaluation. Moreover oat content of-glucan gave the highest viscosity of prepared produces in comparing with the other products. Thus we recommend to produce these fermented cereal camel milk products as healthy and cheap nutraceutical product.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61474499, "asset_id": 41250888, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46211471, "first_name": "Marwa", "last_name": "El-Gendy", "domain_name": "drc-egypt", "page_name": "MarwaElGendy", "display_name": "Marwa H .

Moreover, the article shows that dietary surveys with their socio-economic perspectives on nutrition were underfunded as well as marginalized in the processes of knowledge production and diffusion while a medicalized approach to nutrition took hold at the FAO Nutrition Division.

But this article shows that industry meddling in science can have a variety of consequences. American food manufacturers long denied that trans fats were associated with disease. Academic scientists, government scientists, and activists in fact endorsed trans fats as a healthier alternative to saturated fats. But in 1990, a high-profile study showed that trans fats increased risk factors for heart disease more than saturated fats did. Industry funded a U.S. Department of Agriculture study that they hoped would exonerate trans fats. But the industry-funded U.S. Department of Agriculture study also indicated that trans fats increased risk factors for heart disease more than saturated fats. Industry quickly began developing trans fat alternatives. This confirms that corporations get involved in science in order to defend their products. But involvement in science can be the very means by which corporations persuade themselves to change their products.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 12023169, "asset_id": 1026587, "asset_type":

However, the relationship between engagement and the effectiveness of dietary DHIs is not well understood. The aim of this review is to describe the association between DHI engagement and dietary intake. A systematic search of four electronic databases and grey literature for records published before December 2019 was conducted. Studies were eligible if they examined a quantitative association between objective measures of engagement with a DHI (subjective experience or usage) and measures of dietary intake in adults (aged \u2265 18 years). From 10,653 citations, seven studies were included. Five studies included usage measures of engagement and two examined subjective experiences. Narrative synthesis, using vote counting, found mixed evidence of an association with usage measures (5 of 12 associations indicated a positive relationship, 7 were inconclusive) and no evidence regarding an association with subjective experience (both studies were inconclusive). The findings provide early evidence supporting an association between measures of usage and dietary intake; however, this was inconsistent. Further research examining the association between DHI engagement and dietary intake is warranted.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 70113201, "asset_id": 53221570, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 87604883, "first_name": "Matthew 'Tepi'", "last_name": "Mclaughlin", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "MatthewTepiMclaughlin", "display_name": "Matthew 'Tepi' Mclaughlin", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/MatthewTepiMclaughlin?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/87604883/20110275/20703098/s65_matthew.mclaughlin.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 586, "name": "Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Sciences?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2875, "name": "User Experience (UX)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/User_Experience_UX_?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3032810, "name": "Digital Health Interventions (DHIs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Health_Interventions_DHIs_?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 19646540, "title": "Den oplysende frugt: Om at spise og drikke i gnostisk-kristen litteratur", "created_at": "2015-12-14T04:41:09.037-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19646540/Den_oplysende_frugt_Om_at_spise_og_drikke_i_gnostisk_kristen_litteratur?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_19646540", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40756870, "asset_id": 19646540, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8083258, "first_name": "Tilde Bak", "last_name": "Halvgaard", "domain_name": "ku-dk", "page_name": "TildeBakHalvgaard", "display_name": "Tilde Bak Halvgaard", "profile_url": "https://ku-dk.academia.edu/TildeBakHalvgaard?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8083258/10503195/11719871/s65_tilde_bak.halvgaard.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2262, "name": "New Testament", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Testament?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 83157, "name": "Nag Hammadi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nag_Hammadi?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 73879824, "title": "How to Burn Fat and Calories", "created_at": "2022-03-16T04:51:09.643-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/73879824/How_to_Burn_Fat_and_Calories?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_73879824", "summary": "In our day to day busy life, it is very difficult to maintain our health as well as our immune system.

Accordingly, our research questions deal with the definition of the main conceptual dimensions developed by the academic literature on PFP as well as with the geographical and temporal differences among the dimensions identified. The first evidence is the increase in the number of papers per year during the last decade. Furthermore, the literature on PFP is centred on the concepts of localisation and structured demand and its impacts on food chain actors, on citizen-consumers and on sustainability at large.

products are very popular food product in Indian society and considered as one of the favorite diet.. World consumption of pasta and noodle products has increased in recent years, Pasta and noodles are usually made from wheat semolina or fine flour and water. They are rich in carbohydrates but lack other essential nutrients, such as dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals .For these reasons, to make composite flour based millet, pulses flour (MBPB).Then durum semolina, composite flour (MBPB) and Plantain flour (P) in different proportions like 70:15:15, 55:30:15 and 40:45:15 were used to develop pasta products. Durum Semolina (100%) was used as control. Proximate compositions like moisture, protein, fat and ash content of the pasta were examined and compared with control. It could be seen that the moisture content of the samples ranged from 6.22% to 7.33%.Sample D (DS: MBPB: P 40:45:15) had highest (12 %.) protein content. Fat content of samples ranged from 0.1% to 0.5%.While Sample D (DS: MBPB: P 40:45:15) had highest (1.38%) ash content. This finding showed that all composite pasta had good acceptable quality and lowest moisture content. While protein, fat and ash content of composite pasta were higher than control. Therefore millet pulses, plantain based pasta enhances the nutritional quality of the value added products which is good option to provide overall essential amino acid balance, helping to overcome the world protein calorie malnutrition problem.

Flour acts as building structure that contributes in the crumb properties. Chlorine treatment of soft wheat flour has been widely used since the 1920s. The functional effect of chlorination is partially de-polymerizing and oxidizing of flour starch. Oxidized starch granules are able to swell more rapidly after the starch reaches the gelatinization temperature and the resulting batter system will be adequately viscous to support the cake's structure without collapsing. Batter expansion is superior for treated flours, even at the lowest chlorination rate, than for untreated flour. Alternatives to chlorine treatment need to be developed because of the potential carcinogenic effect of chlorination. Egg albumin contributes strength to cake crumb and improves cake volume. Acceptable cake volume can be achieved by heating but the dryer, stiffer crumb that springs back upon compression is not produced by heated flours.

Under certain conditions, such as high oxalic acid concentration, high calcium levels, damaged tubular epithelium, urinary tract infections and oxidative stress, calcium oxalates may precipitate and initiate the formation of kidney stones. Objective. The aim of the study is to review the available literature on the possibility of dietary factors to modify the risk of oxalate urolithiasis. State of Knowledge. Oxalates are found in most plant foods; sorrel, rhubarb, chard, soy and cocoa are examples of high-oxalate foods. However, only 10% of oxalic acid which circulates in the bloodstream originates directly from food, and 90% is a product of hepatic metabolism. Its main precursor is hydroxyproline, the amino acid typical for animal proteins: collagen and elastin. The increase in the risk of oxalate urolithiasis is also affected by a too low fluid intake, excessive vitamin supplementation, as well as high levels of simple sugars and sodium consumption. Although plant products are a source of oxalic acid, they also contain antioxidants, especially polyphenols and vitamins, as well as citric acid and potassium, which reduce the risk of calcium oxalate formation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62330985, "asset_id": 42187828, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35502625, "first_name": "Ma\u0142gorzata", "last_name": "Kalemba-Dro\u017cd\u017c", "domain_name": "afm", "page_name": "MKalembadrozdz", "display_name": "Ma\u0142gorzata  Kalemba-Dro\u017cd\u017c", "profile_url": "https://afm.academia.edu/MKalembadrozdz?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35502625/19265814/19200461/s65_ma_gorzata.kalemba-dro_d_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 256581, "name": "Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 514281, "name": "Human Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 973769, "name": "Diet Related Disease Prevention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diet_Related_Disease_Prevention?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1881054, "name": "Plant based diets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Plant_based_diets?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 27852802, "title": "Development of Edible Coating for Shelf Life Extension of Guava Edible Coating for Shelf Life Extension of Guava", "created_at": "2016-08-17T23:45:38.214-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27852802/Development_of_Edible_Coating_for_Shelf_Life_Extension_of_Guava_Edible_Coating_for_Shelf_Life_Extension_of_Guava?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_27852802", "summary": "Guava is economically important fruit which occupies a prominent position among fruit crops grown in Sri Lanka.

Three different concentrations of cassava starch (1%, 2%, 3%) with 1% sunflower oil and Rice bran (1%, 2%, 3%) with 1% sunflower oil + 1% Bee wax were used for treatments and stored under ambient condition (28 0 C-30 0 C, 55%-60% RH), and quality evaluation was done to find out suitable concentration of cassawa starch and rice bran along with other constituents. 2% cassava starch+1% sunflower oil; 2% Rice bran +1% sunflower oil + 1% Bee wax were selected as better performed treatments in retaining the overall quality as it caused minimum changes in fruit Firmness, Titratable acidity, Reducing sugars, Total soluble solids (TSS). Generally, all treatments caused significant (P<0.05) decrease in fruit firmness and pectin content.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48137744, "asset_id": 27852802, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51447699, "first_name": "Co.", "last_name": "SEP", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CoSEP", "display_name": "Co.

By far the largest potential reduction in GHG emissions is achieved by eliminating meat from the diet (35% reduction), followed by changing from carbon-intensive lamb and beef to less carbon-intensive pork and chicken (18% reduction). Cutting out all avoidable waste delivers an emissions saving of 12%. Not eating foods grown in hot-houses or air-freighted to the UK offers a 5% reduction in emissions.

Bailey) Mansf. ex Greb.) is an underexploited and under-researched crop species with the potential to contribute to crop diversification in Sub-Saharan Africa. The species is cultivated in the drier parts of Southern Africa, mainly by smallholder farmers who maintain a wide range of landrace varieties. Understanding the molecular and morpho-physiological basis for drought adaptation in citron watermelon under these dry environments can aid in the identification of suitable traits for drought-tolerance breeding and improve food system resilience among smallholder farmers, thus adding to crop diversification. This paper reviews the literature on drought adaptation of Citrullus lanatus spp. (C3 xerophytes), using the systematic review approach. The review discusses the potential role of citron watermelon in adding to crop diversification, alternative food uses, and potential by-products that can be processed from the crop, and it analyzes the role of Sub-Saharan African farmers play as key actors in conserving citron watermelon germplasm and biodiversity. Finally, the review provides a summary of significant findings and identifies critical knowledge gaps for further research.

During the process of storage and marketing of wooden fish is often contaminated by certain types of mold, especially Aspergillus sp. The presence of mold contaminants would reduce the wooden fish quality and dangerous for consumption. It is therefore necessary natural ingredients that can act as a preservative, one of which is chitosan. The purpose of this study was to analyze the long wooden fish optimum soaking in a solution of chitosan to produce wooden fish that have a longer shelf life than fish-covered wood flour. The study begins by preparing chitosan from shrimp shells. Chitosan is extracted from shrimp shells, with a solution of NaOH and HCl and dried at a temperature of 65\u00b0C. Wooden fish with chitosan coating is done by soaking the fish in a timber with 1.5% chitosan larutam time variation of 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 minutes. The fish dried in the sun to harden fish such as timber, stored at room temperature (\u00b1 30\u00b0C). Test storability of wooden fish is done until a certain time limit (4 weeks), namely on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28, through organoleptic (color, texture, aroma and taste) and mold on the fish population analysis of timber. The results showed that soaking the fish for 60-75 minutes in a solution of chitosan 1.5% (w/v) to produce the most good organoleptic value, with no evidence of mold growth on the shelf life of 28 days so that the wooden fish unfit for consumption.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56313145, "asset_id": 36402124, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 76622454, "first_name": "Resmila", "last_name": "Dewi, S.Si.,M.Sc", "domain_name": "tni-au", "page_name": "ResmilaDewi", "display_name": "Resmila Dewi, S.Si.,M.Sc", "profile_url": "https://tni-au.academia.edu/ResmilaDewi?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/76622454/19515778/29831853/s65_resmila.dewi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9130, "name": "Chitosan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chitosan?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 247059, "name": "Mold", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mold?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 864679, "name": "Edible Coating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Edible_Coating?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 35085447, "title": "SOLAR COLD STORAGE", "created_at": "2017-11-08T01:22:52.743-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35085447/SOLAR_COLD_STORAGE?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_35085447", "summary": "https://irjet.net/archives/V4/i10/IRJET-V4I10193.pdf", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54946515, "asset_id": 35085447, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31493941, "first_name": "IRJET", "last_name": "Journal", "domain_name": "irjet", "page_name": "IRJET", "display_name": "IRJET  Journal", "profile_url": "https://irjet.academia.edu/IRJET?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31493941/9304077/11813823/s65_irjet.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2738, "name": "Renewable Energy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renewable_Energy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31088943, "title": "NUTRIENT COMPOSITION OF CEREAL BASED ORAL REHYDRATION SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHOEA IN INFANTS", "created_at": "2017-01-26T17:02:10.098-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31088943/NUTRIENT_COMPOSITION_OF_CEREAL_BASED_ORAL_REHYDRATION_SOLUTIONS_FOR_MANAGEMENT_OF_DIARRHOEA_IN_INFANTS?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_31088943", "summary": "This study evaluated the nutrient composition of two cereal, millet and sorghum, based oral rehydration solutions.

Using extensive empirical research, the authors describe the increasingly transnational organization of culinary fields, multicultural culinary contact zones, and state-led culinary politics. Chapters include studies of the pathways in which Asian cuisines cross borders and subsequently interact with local culinary systems. Authors also study how cuisines from abroad enter into Asian cities and are modified in transnational urban settings. Multi-sited and cross-border ethnographic fieldwork and comparative qualitative case studies uncover the culinary networks and the cultural politics of these traveling cuisines. This volume shows that cuisines in Asia are less and less produced locally but rather in networks of producers, suppliers, entrepreneurs and patrons moving across borders.",

However, if cuisine is to be treated as a protected heritage, then one problem scholars and other interested parties must confront is when to recognize imported or \u201cforeign\u201d cuisines as part of the local culinary heritage worthy of protection or celebration. The example of imported culinary cultural heritage I consider here is the case of \u201cold-style\u201d western cuisine in Shanghai, also known as dacai. While traditional western cuisine in Japan (yoshoku) has been enshrined as one of the three pillars of modern Japanese cuisine and treated with reverence and nostalgia by Japanese foodies, traditional western food in Shanghai (dacai or laoshixican) has not met with the same fate. Indeed the recent rush to import new types of western food into the city has only further marginalized traditional Shanghainese western food, which enjoyed a central place in the culinary life of the city as late as the early 1990s. This paper examines the current condition of western food in Shanghai and efforts to resurrect and market the flavors of \u201cold style\u201d western cuisine.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

"ABSTRACT\n\nThe purpose of this research was to assess money spent and calories consumed by college students from fast food restaurants located on and around a southern college campus. A convenience sample (n = 152) of undergraduate college students (aged 18 - 24) at a southern university participated in a survey that measured dietary intake from seven local fast food chains using a researcher developed food frequency questionnaire and a lifestyle behavior survey that collected data on health practices. A strong positive correlation was found between total monthly fast food expense and total monthly fast food caloric consumption (r(150) = 0.94, p < 0.05), indicating a significant linear relationship between the two variables. An independent-samples t test comparing the mean monthly fast food restaurant expense males to females found a significant difference between the two groups (t(150) = 4.19, p < 0.05).The more money spent by college students contributed to a higher amount of calories consumed from fast food in a typical month. Future research needs to determine if college students are contributing to the high obesity rate and if limiting fast food restaurants on and around college campuses would help decrease fast food consumption in college students.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 25748044, "asset_id": 1841917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2094103, "first_name": "Clearly", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ClearlyLee1", "display_name": "Clearly Lee", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ClearlyLee1?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 931007, "title": "Successful weight loss maintenance: from a restricted to a liberated self", "created_at": "2011-09-19T07:49:39.226-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/931007/Successful_weight_loss_maintenance_from_a_restricted_to_a_liberated_self?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_931007", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 5669398, "asset_id": 931007, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 714833, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Ogden", "domain_name": "surrey", "page_name": "JaneOgden", "display_name": "Jane Ogden", "profile_url": "https://surrey.academia.edu/JaneOgden?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/714833/242880/287178/s65_jane.ogden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 260, "name": "Health Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Psychology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 229062, "name": "Obesity, Weight Loss Maintenance, Dieting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Obesity_Weight_Loss_Maintenance_Dieting?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 763062, "title": "Widespread reward-system activation in obese women in response to pictures of high-calorie foods", "created_at": "2011-07-20T07:09:39.473-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/763062/Widespread_reward_system_activation_in_obese_women_in_response_to_pictures_of_high_calorie_foods?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_763062", "summary": "Behavioral studies have suggested that exaggerated reactivity to food cues, especially those associated with high-calorie foods, may be a factor underlying obesity. This increased motivational potency of foods in obese individuals appears to be mediated in part by a hyperactive reward system. We used a Philips 3T magnet and fMRI to investigate activation of reward-system and associated brain structures in response to pictures of high-calorie and low-calorie foods in 12 obese compared to 12 normal-weight women. A regions of interest (ROI) analysis revealed that pictures of high-calorie foods produced significantly greater activation in the obese group compared to controls in medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, nucleus accumbens/ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, ventral pallidum, caudate, putamen, and hippocampus. For the contrast of high-calorie vs. low-calorie foods, the obese group also exhibited a larger difference than the controls did in all of the same regions of interest except for the putamen. Within-group contrasts revealed that pictures of high-calorie foods uniformly stimulated more activation than low-calorie foods did in the obese group. By contrast, in the control group, greater activation by high-calorie foods was seen only in dorsal caudate, whereas low-calorie foods were more effective than high-calorie foods in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. In summary, compared to normal-weight controls, obese women exhibited greater activation in response to pictures of high-calorie foods in a large number of regions hypothesized to mediate motivational effects of food cues.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51248444, "asset_id": 763062, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 579224, "first_name": "Luke", "last_name": "Stoeckel", "domain_name": "hms-harvard", "page_name": "LukeStoeckel", "display_name": "Luke Stoeckel", "profile_url": "https://hms-harvard.academia.edu/LukeStoeckel?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/579224/2651649/3086211/s65_luke.stoeckel.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2639, "name": "Neuroimaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neuroimaging?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3851, "name": "Obesity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Obesity?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29917, "name": "FMRI", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/FMRI?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34468960, "title": "Japanese Culinary Mobilities Research: The Globalization of the Japanese Restaurant", "created_at": "2017-09-05T02:23:17.784-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34468960/Japanese_Culinary_Mobilities_Research_The_Globalization_of_the_Japanese_Restaurant?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_34468960", "summary": "Japanese restaurant cuisine is now prevalent in markets around the world, from large cities to small towns.

immemorial, Native Americans have resided in Western Oregon. Today, many of these tribes, including the Kalapuya, Molalla, Umpqua, Rogue River, Clackamas, Tillamook, some Shasta, and many other people from regional tribes are part of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. The West Eugene Wetlands are within the traditional homelands of the Kalapuya and a part of the vast expanse of lands regional tribes ceded to the U.S. Government in treaties between 1853 to 1855. After the treaties were signed, the tribes were relocated by the U.S. Government to the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation located 30 miles west of Salem, Oregon at the foothills of the coast range. Traditionally, the tribes utilized hundreds of plants for food, medicine, structures, weaving materials and more. The tending, harvest, and use of plants had (and continues to have) important roles in ceremonies, celebrations, and household use.  For thousands of years the Willamette Valley has provided a vast array of plant foods for the Native American people that live here. Many traditional foods can be found in the West Eugene Wetlands, a varied landscape of upland oak savannah, upland prairie, wetland prairie and riparian zones that host a great diversity of plants and animals. For example, tarweed (Madia sp.), grows on dry prairies, camas grows on wet prairies, hazel grows on dry semi-open or brushy areas, and the oaks grow in dryer zones. The Kalapuya used a variety of management techniques to improve food production systems. The maintenance of the traditional foods through tilling, digging and other activities helped maintain the varied landscape. Controlled fires were regularly set which had many benefits including keeping out unwanted competitor species and insects, and returning nutrients to soil.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42064284, "asset_id": 20795266, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 42064396, "asset_id": 20795266, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37095133, "first_name": "Eric", "last_name": "Jones", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "EricJones", "display_name": "Eric T Jones", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/EricJones?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37095133/10550062/11774473/s65_eric.jones.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2461, "name": "Wetlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Wetlands?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3530, "name": "Sustainable agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_agriculture?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3729, "name": "Environmental Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Anthropology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5221, "name": "Restoration Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Restoration_Ecology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5222, "name": "Conservation Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation_Ecology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 7649, "name": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Ecological_Knowledge?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 12764, "name": "Customary Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Customary_Law?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 18116, "name": "Indian Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Law?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 21296, "name": "Non Timber Forest Products (NTFP)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Non_Timber_Forest_Products_NTFP_?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 23980, "name": "Ecological restoration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecological_restoration?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 48494, "name": "Biodiversity Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biodiversity_Conservation?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 52830, "name": "American Indians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Indians?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 43310904, "title": "The Kefir Cookbook : An Ancient Healing Beverage for Modern Life, Recipes from My Family Table and Around the World", "created_at": "2020-06-10T19:31:19.860-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43310904/The_Kefir_Cookbook_An_Ancient_Healing_Beverage_for_Modern_Life_Recipes_from_My_Family_Table_and_Around_the_World?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_43310904", "summary": "In 1986, ten years after they emigrated from Kiev, Michael and Ludmila Smolyansky introduced kefir to America.

Menstruation embarks the journey of an adolescent girl into a healthy reproductive woman. Aim: The aim of the study was assessment of nutritional status, menstruation, factors influencing menstruation in adolescent girls. Methodology: A total of 100 girls (12-18 years) were screened, 83 girls who had attained their menarche were assessed using a selfstructured questionnaire at Non-Governamental Organisation run school in Sahakaranagar, Bengaluru. Results: Majority (53%) of the study population had a normal BMI, 28% were underweight and 11% were overweight with mean menarchal age of 12 \u00b1 0.3 years. Body mass index of the adolescent girls influenced their menarchal age (p = 0.003*) however it did not influence the regularity of menses and duration of menstrual cycle. Age at menarche did not influence duration of menses. Nutrient intake assessed using 24-hour recall and Food Frequency Questinnaire reflected low nutrient intake. The most common Pre-Menstral Syndromes experienced were back pain and abdominal cramps while 93% had dysmenorrhea. Conclusion: The study concluded that underweight girls attained late menarche compared to overweight girls and poor nutrition affects the severity of menstrual disorders. Hence proper education on role of nutrition during menstruation should be imparted for their betterment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67652075, "asset_id": 49268257, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 172570156, "first_name": "geetha", "last_name": "santhosh", "domain_name": "mountcarmelbangalore", "page_name": "geethasanthosh", "display_name": "geetha santhosh", "profile_url": "https://mountcarmelbangalore.academia.edu/geethasanthosh?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116793, "name": "Community Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1704892, "name": "Nutrition Counseling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_Counseling?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 49124520, "title": "Corpos plurais", "created_at": "2021-06-04T06:37:43.363-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49124520/Corpos_plurais?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_49124520", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67515799, "asset_id": 49124520, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 41140764, "first_name": "rubia carla", "last_name": "formighieri giordani", "domain_name": "ufpr", "page_name": "rubiacarlaformighierigiordani", "display_name": "rubia carla formighieri giordani", "profile_url": "https://ufpr.academia.edu/rubiacarlaformighierigiordani?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/41140764/50621507/98794975/s65_rubia_carla.formighieri_giordani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 993989, "name": "Antthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Antthropology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 46815047, "title": "Moral Orders of Multinationals: Registers of Value in Corporate Food Production", "created_at": "2021-04-13T06:10:07.147-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/46815047/Moral_Orders_of_Multinationals_Registers_of_Value_in_Corporate_Food_Production?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_46815047", "summary": "This article analyzes moral registers about and within one of the world\u2019s largest food corporations. Based on fieldwork at a French multinational corporation, I trace how speech registers surrounding food circulate across institutional arenas, reconfiguring material connections between the company and consumers. I examine the emergence of a \u201cBig Food\u201d register, critical of the food industry, and analyze the discourses it has triggered within one corporation, comparing talk of ethics and economics among employees in Paris and Johannesburg. Corporate efforts to produce value through food result from struggles between value projects of diverse employees who are positioned differently relative to corporate\nhierarchies and global inequalities. I argue that moral language in and around the food industry can elucidate current transformations in global capitalism, revealing multinationals\u2019 struggles to credibly voice registers aligned with consumers\u2019 values in their search for competitive advantage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66256544, "asset_id": 46815047, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1082662, "first_name": "Chelsie", "last_name": "Yount-Andr\u00e9", "domain_name": "leidenuniv", "page_name": "ChelsieYountAndr\u00e9", "display_name": "Chelsie Yount-Andr\u00e9", "profile_url": "https://leidenuniv.academia.edu/ChelsieYountAndr%C3%A9?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1082662/375239/61377731/s65_chelsie.yount-andr_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 98, "name": "Semiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Semiotics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1452, "name": "Corporate Social Responsibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporate_Social_Responsibility?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4834, "name": "Economic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Anthropology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2775950, "name": "Langauge Ideologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Langauge_Ideologies?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 42192494, "title": "The rise of nutritionism and decline of nutritional health in Nauru", "created_at": "2020-03-11T04:16:33.837-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42192494/The_rise_of_nutritionism_and_decline_of_nutritional_health_in_Nauru?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_42192494", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62336701, "asset_id": 42192494, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25141, "first_name": "Amy", "last_name": "McLennan", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "AmyKMcL", "display_name": "Amy K McLennan", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/AmyKMcL?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25141/8140/30588125/s65_amy.mclennan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2365, "name": "Pacific Island Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Island_Studies?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40008661, "title": "INFLUENCE OF PARTIAL SUBSTITUTION OF SUGAR WITH SERENDIPITY BERRY (DIOSCOREOPHYLLUM CUMMINSII) EXTRACT ON THE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES AND SHELF-LIFE OF WHEAT BREAD", "created_at": "2019-08-04T10:23:06.164-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40008661/INFLUENCE_OF_PARTIAL_SUBSTITUTION_OF_SUGAR_WITH_SERENDIPITY_BERRY_DIOSCOREOPHYLLUM_CUMMINSII_EXTRACT_ON_THE_QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES_AND_SHELF_LIFE_OF_WHEAT_BREAD?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_40008661", "summary": "Serendipity berry (Dioscoreophyllum cumminsii) contains a protein sweetener termed monellin which could be substituted for sugar in foods for diabetics and dieters.

Three inoculation levels (0.2 gL-1 , 0.3 gL-1 and 0.4 gL-1) of traditional yoghurt cultures and two probiotic cultures were separately used to develop drinking yoghurt. Drinking yoghurts were stored at 4 0 C for 21 days and analyzed for microbial counts, titratable acidity and pH on 0, 7, 14 and 21 days of storage. Sensory evaluation was done within four-day interval from day 1 to day 14 with 30 untrained panelists using five point hedonic scales. Titratable acidity and pH were significantly different (P < 0.05) with added cultures and culture levels. There was an interactive effect of treatment and storage time on pH for the developed product (P < 0.05) and developed product was within the acceptable range up to 14 days of storage at 4 0 C. Ash, dry matter, fat contents, brix value and density did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) with cultures and culture levels. Yoghurt made with LA-5 received the highest overall acceptability. The developed products were negative for pathogenic microbes up to 21 days of storage. In conclusion, 0.3 gL-1 inoculation level of LA-5 could be used to develop the probiotic drinking yoghurt using goat's milk with desired physiochemical, microbiological and sensory properties.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47321153, "asset_id": 27067174, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49799106, "first_name": "JASH", "last_name": "MATHEW", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MATHEWJASH", "display_name": "JASH MATHEW", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MATHEWJASH?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 51168915, "first_name": "Isuri", "last_name": "Jayawardana", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IsuriJayawardana", "display_name": "Isuri Jayawardana", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IsuriJayawardana?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 21560802, "title": "Kitchenscapes, Tablescapes, Platescapes, and Foodscapes: Influences of Micro-Scale Built Environments on Food Intake", "created_at": "2016-02-04T10:46:03.773-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21560802/Kitchenscapes_Tablescapes_Platescapes_and_Foodscapes_Influences_of_Micro_Scale_Built_Environments_on_Food_Intake?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_21560802", "summary": "Built environments at many scales influence the type and amount of food consumed.

important dietary and medicinal role throughout the history of mankind. In some Western countries, the sale of garlic preparations ranks with those of leading prescription drugs. The therapeutic efficacy of garlic encompasses a wide variety of ailments, including cardiovascular, cancer, hepatic and microbial infections to name but a few. However, the elucidation of its mechanism for therapeutic action has proved to be more elusive and a unifying theory, which could account for its reported multifarious activities, is yet to emerge. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) seem to be at the core of many disease processes and it is an attractive and convenient hypothesis that garlic might exert its activities through modulatory effects on ROS. A literature search on garlic and its antioxidant potential churned up a surprisingly large amount of data, some of it good, some bad and some of its definitely ugly.Various preparations of garlic, mainly aged garlic extract (AGE), have been shown to have promising antioxidant potential. However, the presence of more than one compounds in garlic, with apparently opposite biological effects, has added to the complexity of the subject. Raw garlic homogenate has been reported to exert antioxidant potential but higher doses have been shown to be toxic to the heart, liver and kidney.So where do we stand today on this issue of garlic? Is garlic always good for health? How safe is it? Is it necessary to isolate the antioxidant compounds for its medicinal use in a more effective way? These issues are addressed in this review.

For this review more than 200 research articles have been screened out on the subject and 101 relevant studies have been identified and included in paper writing. Maternal nutritional status could be considered as primary predictor factor for birth weight of infants. This relationship is influenced by many factors. Dietary intake during pregnancy is the main determinant of birth weight. Not only macronutrients but micronutrients also play important role in the growth and development of fetus. Micronutrient status during pregnancy is correlated with the birth weight of neonate. Prepregnancy maternal weight &lt;45 kg, height &lt;145 cm and low BMI &lt;18.5kg/m are associated with low birth weight and adverse birth outcomes. Low socio economic status is the strongest predictor for low birth weight. Although it does not affect it directly but indirectly it affect...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78341308, "asset_id": 67575024, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6217487, "first_name": "neena", "last_name": "bhatia", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "neenabhatia", "display_name": "neena bhatia", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/neenabhatia?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 586, "name": "Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Sciences?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3763226, "name": " Nutrition and CNRT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_CNRT?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44126544, "title": "EFFECT OF PLYOMETRIC AND CIRCUIT TRAINING PROGRAMME ON AGILITY OF MALE BASKETBALL PLAYERS OF PUNJAB", "created_at": "2020-09-20T08:46:57.692-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44126544/EFFECT_OF_PLYOMETRIC_AND_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_PROGRAMME_ON_AGILITY_OF_MALE_BASKETBALL_PLAYERS_OF_PUNJAB?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_44126544", "summary": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of plyometric and circuit training programme on agility. For this study, one hundred twenty (120) male basketball players were selected from Punjab, age ranging from 12 to 16 years. These players were divided into two groups: Experimental Group (n=60) and Control Group (n=60). The Agility was measured before and after a six-week training period. The players of Experimental group were trained for six days per week on alternative days (Plyometric Training on Monday, Wednesday and Friday whereas Circuit Training on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday), whereas Control Group did not participate in any training activity. The Agility was measured through shuttle run 10\u00d710 Yards. Mean and Standard Deviation of the shuttle run were calculated. However, the Experimental Group showed a sign of improvement in shuttle run that was significantly lesser than Control Group. It was analysed through statistical procedure by using \"t-test'. Results of this study showed significant difference between Experimental group and Control Groups in pre-test and post-test for dependent measurements (p<0.05). Introduction Training is an important activity which improves physical performance of the individual or a group. When we are talking about physical performance, it means sports performance and performance of our body to sustain our routine life. This shows that player\"s performance is important for the performance of the organization and the training and development is beneficial for the players to improve their performance. Players practice to achieve a specific goal through structured and focused training. The intent of the training is to increase the player\"s ability and work capacity to optimize his performance. Training is undertaken across a long period of time. The player learns to cope with highly stressful stimuli in training and competitions. Physical excellence should evolve through an organized and well-planned training program based on practical experience. Training is good for all the games. \"Games for the fun of it\", is a common saying and it is indicative of the pleasure one derives through participation", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

restaurants have become popular with consumers for several reasons. One of the main reasons is that, through economy of scale in purchasing and producing food, these restaurants can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food, it can be reassuring to a hungry person who is in a hurry or is far from home.\nBangalore is a place where people from all over India come in search of good jobs, education and many other facilities.

Methylene blue Reduction test is used to detect the presence of bacteria in milk. This test works on the principle that the methylene blue indicator is present in an oxidized form, but in the presence of bacteria, leads to the reduction of this indicator in a comparatively short span of time. The blue color developed on addition of the indicator to the milk will change to white color within a short period indicates the presence of bacteria in the milk and thus denotes improper pasteurization. Milk contains many other nutrients and the carbohydrate lactose. An emulsion is a suspension of droplets of one liquid into another liquid. Milk is an emulsion of fat in water. Butter is an emulsion of water in fat. The solute is known as the dispersed phase and the solvent is known as the continuous phase. Other examples of emulsions include margarine, mayonnaise, cream, and salad dressing. A colloidal solution is when matter exists in a state of division in between a true solution, which is sugar in water, and a suspension, which is chalk in water. The characteristics of a colloid are small particle size, electrical charge, and affinity of the particles for water molecules. In milk, the whey proteins are in colloidal solution. Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrums, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases.

The pulp of the fruits was oven dried at 105\uf0b0C until constant weight prior to the analysis for its macronutrients, sugar and vitamin C profile. The analysis found 52.96%, 40.19%, 1.16%, 4.97%, 2.12% and 0.71% of moisture, carbohydrate, protein, fat, fibre and ash content respectively. The energy reported in 100g of the fruit was 210kcal. The naturally sweet-tasting fruit contained 2.7%, 3.3% and 15.6% of fructose, glucose and sucrose respectively and had a vitamin C concentration of 6mg/100g. These superior attributes of the fruit compared with some commercially available dried fruits indicate that there is potential for it to be further explored for use in snack, bakery, confectionery and dairy industries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65173527, "asset_id": 44697347, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 148727095, "first_name": "Gomathy", "last_name": "V Sethuraman", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "GomathyVSethuraman", "display_name": "Gomathy V Sethuraman", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/GomathyVSethuraman?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/148727095/50212828/38215956/s65_gomathy.v_sethuraman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 967547, "name": "Nutritional Composition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutritional_Composition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1448832, "name": "Fresh Fruit and Commercial Fruit-concentration of Vitamin C", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fresh_Fruit_and_Commercial_Fruit-concentration_of_Vitamin_C?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3182575, "name": "Sugar profile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sugar_profile?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3446038, "name": "canistel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/canistel?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3830429, "name": "Pouteria campechiana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pouteria_campechiana?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3830430, "name": "buah kuning telur", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/buah_kuning_telur?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 11603295, "title": "Careful Eating: Bodies, Food and Care", "created_at": "2015-03-23T04:26:43.237-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11603295/Careful_Eating_Bodies_Food_and_Care?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_11603295", "summary": "Critically reflecting on the interplays between food and care, this multidisciplinary volume asks \u2018why do individuals, institutions and agencies care about what other people eat?\u2019 It explores how acts of caring about food and eating shape and intervene in individual bodies as well as being enacted in and through those bodies. In so doing, the volume extends current critical debates regarding food and care as political mechanisms through which social hierarchies are constructed and both self and 'other' (re)produced. Addressing the ways in which eating and caring interact on multiple scales and sites - from public health and clinical settings to the market, the home and online communities - Careful Eating asks what \u2018eating\u2019 and \u2018caring\u2019 are, what relationships they create and rupture, and how their interplay is experienced in myriad spaces of everyday life. Taking account of this two-directional flow of engagement between eating and caring, the chapters are organized into three central theoretical dimensions: how eating practices mobilize discourses and forms of care; how discourses and practices of care (look to) shape particular forms of eating and food preferences; and how it is often in the bodies of individual consumers that eating and care encounter one another.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38159394, "asset_id": 11603295, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2523266, "first_name":

Social perception of urban agriculture in Latin-America. A case study in Mexican social housing. Land Use Policy 76 (2018) 719\u2013734. \nAbstract. Food security is at the heart of governmental agendas of developing countries. In Latin America, urban agriculture (UA) offers an interesting alternative to ensuring a sufficient, safe and nutritious food supply for urban populations. However, Latin American cities have been subject to radical transformations in the last decades, most apparently through the expansion of social housing. The main objective of this research is to analyze the social perceptions and feasibility of UA in Mexican social housing neighborhoods. The M\u00e9rida city was used as a representative case study. Structured interviews were given to 65 key stake-holders across different categories (residents, urban government officials and technical experts). The results indicate a nonexistent perception of UA in M\u00e9rida, despite the secular agricultural tradition of the Yucatan region. Nevertheless, respondents agreed in their interest in potentially developing UA activities to improve diets, increase green areas, support local economies, and reduce CO2 emissions. The main perceived barriers for UA are the prevalent model of housing, with a very limited floor area, and the current approach to urban planning, which lacks non-built-up areas. Significantly, large artificialized zones create suitable areas to implement UA on extended rooftops. Finally, stakeholders demand the intervention of authorities at different levels (Federal [national], State [regional] and local) as a requirement to develop UA properly. The main pathways for this support should be to prepare new urban and housing policies and introduce economic incentives.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56722160, "asset_id": 36774625, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2306218, "first_name": "Mar\u00eda", "last_name": "P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez", "domain_name": "uady", "page_name": "Mar\u00edaP\u00e9rezS\u00e1nchez", "display_name": "Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez", "profile_url": "https://uady.academia.edu/Mar%C3%ADaP%C3%A9rezS%C3%A1nchez?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2306218/730703/907272/s65_mar_a.p_rez_s_nchez.jpg"}, {"id": 33783463, "first_name": "Beatriz", "last_name": "Rodriguez-Labajos", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "BeatrizRodriguezlabajos", "display_name": "Beatriz Rodriguez-Labajos", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/BeatrizRodriguezlabajos?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33783463/9960906/11107761/s65_beatriz.rodriguez-labajos.png"}, {"id": 34034598, "first_name": "A.", "last_name": "Josa", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JosaA", "display_name": "A.

Consumers have become increasingly aware of the nutrition-health link, increasingly responsible for changing their own diets, and increasingly reliant on nutrition information to do so. Unfortunately, these same conditions also create opportunities for nutrition misinformation to flourish. News reports rarely provide enough context for consumers to interpret the advice given, and preliminary or idiosyncratic findings often attract unmerited and misleading attention.\nEffective nutrition communication must be consumer-focused and presented with sufficient context to allow consumers to weigh the information and determine whether it applies to his or her unique needs. Consistent with its vision that members \u201care the leading source of food and nutrition services,\u201d the American Dietetic Association (ADA) recognizes its responsibility to help consumers identify food and nutrition misinformation in the following ways:\nADA members need to be leaders in providing consumers wih sound, science-based nutrition information and helping them to recognize and avoid misinformation.\nADA members need to be primary resources of sound nutrition for the media and to inform the media when misinformation is presented, as the electronic and print media are primary sources nutrition information for consumers.\nADA, the world's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, must continue to work diligently with other healthcare practitioners, educators, policy makers, and the food and dietary supplement industry to responsibly address the medical and psychological, physiological, and economic effects of food-  and nutrition-related misinformation on consumers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42395039, "asset_id": 21696670, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40496048, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Wansink", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "BrianWansink", "display_name": "Brian Wansink", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/BrianWansink?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40496048/11048813/93556953/s65_brian.wansink.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 276623, "name": "Misinformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Misinformation?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 21419611, "title": "Determination of Water-Insoluble \u03b2-d-Glucan in the Whole-Grain Cereals and Pseudocereals", "created_at": "2016-02-01T11:50:11.991-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21419611/Determination_of_Water_Insoluble_%CE%B2_d_Glucan_in_the_Whole_Grain_Cereals_and_Pseudocereals?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_21419611", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41863375, "asset_id": 21419611, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42488330, "first_name": "Ahmed", "last_name": "Badr", "domain_name": "tanta", "page_name": "ABadr", "display_name": "Ahmed Badr", "profile_url": "https://tanta.academia.edu/ABadr?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1037, "name": "Agronomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agronomy?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10225, "name": "Agriculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Agriculture?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 11109468, "title": "Diversifying diets: using indigenous vegetables to improve profitability, nutrition and health in Africa", "created_at": "2015-02-26T05:32:36.205-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11109468/Diversifying_diets_using_indigenous_vegetables_to_improve_profitability_nutrition_and_health_in_Africa?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_11109468", "summary": "Indigenous vegetables were previously considered subsistence food crops\nas opposed to cash crops.

Yet, indigenous\nvegetables often accompany staple crops in meals, and most staple crops are\nless palatable without associated vegetable servings. Indigenous vegetables\ncan enhance bioavailability of micronutrients in staple crops and promote\nabsorption. In addition, some indigenous vegetables\ncan be harvested in just 21 days, providing a rapid response to urgent needs\nfor food and nutrition, while most of the food security crops take at least six to\nnine months to reach harvest. It is now recognized that food security cannot\nbe delinked from nutritional security, to which the consumption of indigenous\nvegetables significantly contributes.

However, mitigation is complicated by trade-offs, multiple ways for producers to achieve low impacts, and interactions throughout the supply chain. Producers have limits on how far they can reduce impacts. Most strikingly, impacts of the lowest-impact animal products typically exceed those of vegetable substitutes, providing new evidence for the importance of dietary change.

The conversion of tomatoes into tomato paste will be examined in considerable details as this materials now forms an almost standard article of commerce and constitutes a most convenient means of shipping and storing tomato solids in a form which can be readily converted to finished product or food ingredient. In several countries and in international trade it was often referred to as tomato puree until a few years ego. During the transition stage of altering the name from tomato puree to tomato paste several canners and suppliers called the higher concentrations (say 28/32%) tomato paste and the lower concentrations (say up to 26%) tomato puree. This still continues in some circles and in several Regulations and Recommendations still in operation the expression tomato puree is used. The tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) is, of course, a true fruit, but in view of its association with savory dishes it is seldom eaten as such. It finds major acceptance in the fresh state as a salad component, as a juice which may be consumed fresh or preserved by canning or freezing, it may be peeled and preserved either whole, peeled or even sliced, used as an ingredient in sauces and soups, or completely dehydrated to a powder which, like tomato paste, may be used as a convenient ingredient in a whole range of other food product. The relative ease with which tomatoes could be crushed and concentrated to form a paste gave rise to some traditional methods of making this material on a domestic basis in those countries where the fruit could be grown as an outdoor crop. The simplest means of producing such tomato pastes consisted of spreading the crushed ripe tomatoes on stone slabs in the hot sunshine, and after concentration by evaporation; the product was mixed with salt and could be stored for use during the winter months. The qualities desired in a tomato to be used in the production of tomato paste may be summarized as follows: 1: It should have a high content of soluble solid. 2: It should posses an intensely red color, not only of the skin but of the entire flesh. 3: The flavor must be good and characteristic, free from scanted and other off-flavors.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50867080, "asset_id": 30423382, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12947268, "first_name": "Farhang", "last_name": "Awlqadr", "domain_name": "tabrizu", "page_name": "FarhangHamid", "display_name": "Farhang H A M E E D Awlqadr", "profile_url": "https://tabrizu.academia.edu/FarhangHamid?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12947268/3660828/108509689/s65_farhang.awlqadr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 523, "name": "Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1081, "name": "Food Safety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Safety?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4000, "name": "Anthropology of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4468, "name": "Food Engineering", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Engineering?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 7710, "name": "Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 16137, "name": "Food Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Chemistry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 31630, "name": "Food Processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Processing?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 31632, "name": "Food Microbiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Microbiology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 38360, "name": "Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 39717, "name": "Food Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Technology?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 26446036, "title": "Toward the Turin Food Policy.

The application of a \"front\" nutritional label is interesting in principle because it is more visible, unlike the mandatory nutritional label, which is located on the back or side of the packages. However, on the other hand, it can mislead the consumer should they intend to value the product nutritionally apart from the diet as a whole. An effective policy for the health of the citizen must be based on adequate training in food and consumption, starting from school age and reaching to society in general, contemplating the insertion of the variety of products in the variety of possible diets, according to the nutritional needs of the citizen, based on age, sex, lifestyle and sustainability. In this context, front labelling must be integrated into a global strategy to be effective and avoid being counterproductive.

Fiber-related claims had a main effect leading to more positive ratings of the product, compared to having no NC claims or fat-related claims. These positive ratings extended beyond perceptions of the fiber content to perceptions of overall healthiness, naturalness, quality, vitamin content, and intentions to purchase and recommend the product\u2014a health halo effect. No significant interaction between warnings and NC claims was found. However, warnings had a main effect on perceptions irrespective of the presence of NC claims, with one warning significantly reducing ratings, dampening any halo effects, and two warnings further dampening any effects.

Abstract: Purpose: This paper demonstrates the benefits of cooking one-to-one, alongside commensality (eating together) for improving offender/ex-offender health and well-being, measured in terms of improved social skills, cultural competencies and successful resettlement. Design/methodology/approach: Fieldwork conducted over nine months included; participant observation of lunch times (n = 56), cooking one-to-one with trainees (n = 27), semi-structured interviews (n = 23) and a 'photo-dialogue' focus group with trainees (n = 5) and staff (n = 2). Findings: Commensality is beneficial for offender/ex-offender health and wellbeing. Further, preparing, cooking, serving and sharing food is a powerful means of improving self-esteem and developing a pro-social identity. Research limitations/implications: The original focus of the research was commensality; it was during the study that the potential for cooking as an additional tool for health and wellbeing emerged. A future longitudinal intervention would be beneficial to examine whether the men continued to cook for others once released from prison and/or finished at the RS. Practical implications: Everyday cooking to share with others is an invaluable tool for improving self-worth. It has the potential to build pro-social self-concepts and improve human, social and cultural capital. Social implications: Cooking lunch for others is part of strengths based approach to resettlement that values community involvement. Originality/value: Cooking and eating with offenders/ex-offenders is unusual. Further hands-on cooking/eating activities are beneficial in terms of aiding self-confidence and self-respect, which are vital for improving offender/ex-offender health and well-being. Introduction This paper reports on the benefits of cooking for offender/ex-offender health and well-being at an independently run rural resettlement scheme (RS) that works with men released for work experience on temporary licence (ROTL) from the local prison every day and others in the community referred through the local probation team, collectively referred to as trainees. The RS is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO), currently the only one of its type in the country, now in its 4th year. It works with men from the resettlement wing of the local prison who are coming to the end of their prison sentences and offers through the gate support, alongside training in a range of occupations (for example construction, landscaping, market gardening and woodworking). Trainees also engage in what might be considered more craft based activities such as art, pottery and woodturning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56347455, "asset_id": 36433693, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19076359, "first_name": "Julie", "last_name": "Parsons", "domain_name": "plymouth", "page_name": "JParsons", "display_name": "Julie M Parsons", "profile_url": "https://plymouth.academia.edu/JParsons?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19076359/5298887/7889866/s65_julie.parsons.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73666, "name": "Cooking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cooking?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 202176, "name": "Commensality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commensality?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 793490, "name": "Cookery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cookery?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 838783, "name": "Rehabilitating Offenders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rehabilitating_Offenders?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 32152343, "title": "'Food at the nexus of bioethics & biopolitics' in 'The Routledge Handbook of Food Ethics' (eds) Mary C Rawlinson & Caleb Ward", "created_at": "2017-03-30T15:40:27.639-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32152343/Food_at_the_nexus_of_bioethics_and_biopolitics_in_The_Routledge_Handbook_of_Food_Ethics_eds_Mary_C_Rawlinson_and_Caleb_Ward?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_32152343", "summary": "This chapter draws attention to the fact that food is not only a (bio)ethical concern but also a biopolitical concern. The growing anxieties regarding climate change, market-failure, and food security at local and global levels re-frames food ethics from consumer choice to wider political and structural issues. In the first part I outline the limitations of bioethical discourses of choice and responsibility surrounding food and health. In the second part I argue that much of the bioethical discourse ignores the biopolitical dimension of food systems by merely encouraging individuals and populations to make healthy food choices. I do not argue that bioethical analyses are redundant or should be ignored. Rather, in the third and final part I argue for the inclusion of biopolitics as a crucial corrective for bioethics to critically respond to concerns surrounding food and that together a substantial political and ethical analysis of food is possible.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52394521, "asset_id": 32152343, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2612940, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Mayes", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "ChristopherMayes", "display_name": "Christopher Mayes", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/ChristopherMayes?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2612940/828424/1029310/s65_christopher.mayes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 906, "name": "Applied Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Ethics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1414, "name": "Bioethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bioethics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1696, "name": "Political Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Theory?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 16323, "name": "Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolitics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 20587, "name": "Food ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_ethics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34612, "name": "Food Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Politics?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 38360, "name": "Food Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Security?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 27908719, "title": "Design for Food and Nutrition: complessit\u00e0 e virtuosit\u00e0", "created_at": "2016-08-20T07:02:30.481-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27908719/Design_for_Food_and_Nutrition_complessit%C3%A0_e_virtuosit%C3%A0?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_27908719", "summary": "This essay explains the choices made by ADI for the first International issue of Compasso d\u2019Oro Award dedicated to Design for Food and Nutrition as the theme, demonstrating the desire of the Association for Industrial Design to make its own contribution to an issue that is as current as it is controversial.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48198482, "asset_id": 27908719, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 578009, "first_name": "Marinella", "last_name": "Ferrara", "domain_name": "polimi", "page_name": "MarinellaFerrara", "display_name": "Marinella Ferrara", "profile_url": "https://polimi.academia.edu/MarinellaFerrara?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/578009/205588/239943/s65_marinella.ferrara.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27761492, "title": "Functional Food Carbohydrates Addressing Nutraceutical Needs.pdf", "created_at": "2016-08-14T00:55:20.517-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27761492/Functional_Food_Carbohydrates_Addressing_Nutraceutical_Needs_pdf?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_27761492", "summary": "Clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that functional food carbohydrates seem to exert health-enhancing effects.

An emulsion is a suspension of droplets of one liquid into another liquid. Milk is an emulsion of fat in water. Butter is an emulsion of water in fat.

A colloidal solution is when matter exists in a state of division in between a true solution, which is sugar in water, and a suspension, which is chalk in water. The characteristics of a colloid are small particle size, electrical charge, and affinity of the particles for water molecules. In milk, the whey proteins are in colloidal solution. Milk is a pale liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals before they are able to digest other types of food. Early-lactation milk contains colostrums, which carries the mother's antibodies to its young and can reduce the risk of many diseases. Milk may contain some harmful microorganisms like bacteria along with some potentially beneficial microbes. Microbiological analysis of milk is carried out to determine the degree of bacterial contamination in milk and to understand the chemical changes brought in milk as a result of microbial action. Pasteurization is done to destroy such harmful bacteria. If pasteurization of milk is not carried out properly there will be presence of larger count of bacteria in the milk. Methylene blue Reduction test is used to detect the presence of bacteria in milk. This test works on the principle that the methylene blue indicator is present in an oxidized form, but in the presence of bacteria, leads to the reduction of this indicator in a comparatively short span of time.

Spray drying technique was used to prepare the encapsulated carrot coagulum powder (ECCP) from enzyme extracted carrot coagulum at an inlet temperature of 170 \u00b0C and using 15% of maltodextrin as carrier agent. The obtained powder was incorporated in different proportions in the formulation of health drink powder (HDP). Ingredients used were malted wheat, malted green gram, soy protein isolate, malt extract and skimmed milk powder (SMP). The developed product contained 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% ECCP. A 9-point hedonic sensory score card was used for studying the acceptability. Sensory evaluation indicated that addition of up to 7.5 % ECCP into the formulation of HDP improved its appearance, colour and overall acceptability. This formulation was then selected for the analysis of proximate, minerals, total carotene and water activity. HDP without the addition of ECCP served as control. ECCP incorporated HDP had lower water activity and moisture compared to control health drink powder. Nutritional analysis of HDP with 7.5% incorporation of ECCP resulted in a significant increase in the fibre, carbohydrate, energy and also minerals such as potassium, zinc, iron, sulphur, copper and sodium. Incorporation of ECCP resulted in a higher total carotenoid content (1.24 mg/100g) compared to control (0.65 mg/100g).

ABSTRACT With the widespread use of technology, many houses now have access to internets. The widespread use has also caused many kinds of dependencies. Many definitions such as television addiction, internet addiction, mobile game addiction, social media addiction have entered into the literature and have been studied. All these dependency models are evaluated in the context of technology dependency. In technology dependent children, many problems such as increased on-screen time, physical inactivity, psychosocial problems, sleep disturbances, deterioration of diet, exposure to advertising, increase in unhealthy food consumption are observed. All of these problems are also supported by many studies that pose a risk to obesity.It has also been proposed to increase physical activity-enhancing practices in terms of combating obesity. Nevertheless it is thought that the right use of technology and the increase in the level of knowledge can minimize the risks.

Int. J. Bus. Soc. Sci. Res. 3(4): 271-276. Retrieve from Abstract The study was conducted to formulate the gluten free bread and to evaluate the overall acceptability of the bread when it was prepared by using different flour like barley, maize, rice, starch, and 10% of wheat flour aiming to find a mixture to replace the wheat flour in the production of gluten free bread. Then an investigation was carried out to find out the acceptable prepared bread using different percentage of barley, maize, rice, starch, and 10% of wheat flour. The prepared samples were evaluated for sensory quality by Hedonic Rating Test. The sensory evaluation revealed that the prepared bread formulated with 50% barley, 10% maize, 10% rice, 20% starch and 10% of wheat flour (S 5) was most acceptable bread in terms of color, flavor, taste, texture preference and overall acceptability and ranked as \" Like very much \". Among the other formulations S 4 (70% maize, 20% starch and 10% wheat flour) was ranked as \" Like slightly \" in terms of overall acceptability according to secured score. On the basis of weight moisture, protein, fat, ash and total carbohydrate contents were found 27.65%, 3.00%, 7.2%, 2.45% and 59.69% respectively for selected manufactured bread where 30.44%, 1.8%, 7.8%, 1.49% and 58.32% respectively in control bread (100% wheat flour). To ensure the high quality of gluten free bread should be prepared by using the combination of 50% barley, 10% maize, 10% rice, 20% starch and 10% of wheat flour at 230 0 C baking temperature and baking for 27 minutes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55528803, "asset_id": 35658664, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34610913, "first_name": "Md.Hafizur", "last_name": "Rahman,PhD", "domain_name": "caas", "page_name": "MdHafizurRahmanSunny", "display_name": "Md.Hafizur Rahman,PhD", "profile_url": "https://caas.academia.edu/MdHafizurRahmanSunny?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34610913/10110393/18761346/s65_hrahman.sunny.jpg"}, {"id": 50051805, "first_name": "Jakaria chowdhury", "last_name": "Onik", "domain_name": "caas", "page_name": "JakariachowdhuryOnik", "display_name": "Jakaria chowdhury Onik", "profile_url": "https://caas.academia.edu/JakariachowdhuryOnik?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50051805/13153695/14458327/s65_jakaria_chowdhury.onik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30706975, "title": "Changes in hexanal, thymoquinone and tocopherols levels in blends from sunflower and black cumin oils as affected by storage at room temperature", "created_at": "2017-01-02T10:05:29.784-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30706975/Changes_in_hexanal_thymoquinone_and_tocopherols_levels_in_blends_from_sunflower_and_black_cumin_oils_as_affected_by_storage_at_room_temperature?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_30706975", "summary": "Changes in hexanal, thymoquinone and tocopherols levels in blends from sunflower and black cumin oils as affected by storage at room temperature The aim of this study was to investigate the oxidative stability (oxS) of oil blends formulated from sunflower oil (So) and cold pressed black cumin oil (BCo) stored at room temperature for 6 months. Blends (5%, 10% and 20%, w/w) of BCo with So were prepared. Progression of oxidation was followed by measuring peroxide value (PV), conjugated dienes (Cd) and conjugated trienes (CT). Changes in the thymoquinone and tocopherols levels of oils and blends during storage were also recoreded. In addition, hexanal was identified and measured using the headspace/solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS/SPME-GC/MS). Inverse relationships were noted between PV and oxS at termination of storage. Levels of PV, Cd and CT in So and blends increased with an increase of storage time. So:BCo (80:20, w/w) blend had lower values of PV, Cd and CT than the other blends during storage. Hexanal content was not significanly affected in blends and So during storage. So:BCo (80:20, w/w) blend contained the highest thymoquinone and \u03b3-tocopherol content among the blends. BCo improves oxS of So and enrich the blends with thymoquinone and tocopherols. Stability of blends were better than So, most likely due to changes in the amounts of thymoquinone and tocopherols found in BCo.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51153345, "asset_id": 30706975, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 958244, "first_name": "Prof. Mohamed", "last_name": "Fawzy Ramadan Hassanien", "domain_name": "uqu", "page_name": "ProfMohamedFawzyRamadanHassanien", "display_name": "Prof. Mohamed Fawzy Ramadan Hassanien", "profile_url": "https://uqu.academia.edu/ProfMohamedFawzyRamadanHassanien?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/958244/976541/1222332/s65_mohamed.hassanien.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52055, "name": "Lipids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lipids?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26451395, "title": "Coenzyme Q10 - American Family Physician", "created_at": "2016-06-23T19:44:59.597-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26451395/Coenzyme_Q10_American_Family_Physician?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_26451395", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46746743, "asset_id": 26451395, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50403868, "first_name": "Alonso", "last_name": "Arcos", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AlonsoArcos", "display_name": "Alonso Arcos", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AlonsoArcos?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50403868/13271791/14538180/s65_alonso.arcos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19459455, "title": "What's Cooking, Mom?

Rights of the Children came up with a number of children rights. Among them is the Right to eat healthy food, derived from Article 27, which states that every child has a right to a standard of living that is good enough to meet their physical, social and mental needs. The study investigates relationship between diet variety and parent perceptions of pre-schooler children, the eating challenges which pre-schoolers face, the levels of parental awareness on the significance of dietary varieties and strategies parents are using to curb eating problems of pre-schooler children. The study recommends that, there be a link between diet variety and parents\u2019 perceptions on mealtime behaviours of their children particularly the pre-schoolers. Therefore parents should be taught on the importance of dietary variety to the children and how to enforce good eating habits.\u00a0 Article visualizations:", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Biofortified crops will be low-energy-dense products high consumption will further prevent an increasingly overweight and obesity among people. Potato may be a good carrier of iodine due to the high consumption of this vegetable among people throughout the year. This publication focuses on collecting information on the biofortification effectiveness of potato-the most consumed vegetable in Poland, and kale which is not very popular among these consumers. Due to its high nutrient content, it is worth promoting the increased consumption of kale among people.

O consumo de chocolate amargo tem aumentando devido sua caracter\u00edstica funcional, provocado pela presen\u00e7a de subst\u00e2ncias ben\u00e9ficas a sa\u00fade, essencialmente pela sua capacidade antioxidante.

Os resultados obtidos mostraram que as diferentes marcas de chocolate ao leite possuem quantidades superiores de glic\u00eddios redutores em glicose e glic\u00eddios n\u00e3o redutores em sacarose em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao chocolate 70% e os valores encontrados para os a\u00e7\u00facares totais nas amostras est\u00e3o, em maior parte, com \u00eanfase ao chocolate ao leite, divergentes com as informa\u00e7\u00f5es contidas nos r\u00f3tulos. Sendo assim, foi poss\u00edvel concluir que os r\u00f3tulos n\u00e3o est\u00e3o sendo fiel ao produto.

The mixture is obtained by dividing a single phase finely into droplets that are very small. In the food industry, the making of emulsions is by suspending oil in water (w/o) or liquid suspended in oil (w/o) (Clark 2013, p.2). Complex systems such as oil-in-water in oil are also used in making product emulsions in the food industry. The chemical composition of emulsions is known as colloids. These are mixtures that are heterogeneous and comprising of particles that are tiny and suspended in another material that is immiscible (Brown 2007, p.29). The particles in colloids are more massive than molecules, even though less than one-thousandth of a millimeter. In that case, the size of these particles makes them not able to settle and thereby to pass through the filter paper. The liquid-liquid colloids are what produce a stable and surfactant free oil in water emulsion in small droplets of liquid measuring 10 to 200 \u03bcm depending on the mixing conditions of the experiment (de Folter, van Ruijven and Velikov 2012, p.6807).

However, the explanation for this growth is not clear. After dismissing several possible explanations of this growth (conversion, immigration, and change in the age at marriage), it is argued that the main factor of this growth is the improvement in nutrition among the Jews in the Land of Israel, an improvement that took place, unnoticed, in the course of several hundred years until it became evident in the Rabbinic sources.\n\nFollowing Y. Felix it is argued that several new agricultural crops penetrated the Land of Israel. Among these new crops were: rice, carob (Ceratonia Siliqua), honey-bees and hens (Gallus). It is argued that these are samples only, and as a matter of fact the number of new crops was much higher.\n\nThe methodological problem is discussed: how can one deduce ex silentio, especially when there is some \u201ccontra\u201d evidence (such as the case of the cock on a seal from the 8-7 century BCE). \n\nIt is argued that the growth in the amount of available food, made longer the shelf-time of products, improved the nutrition of the population (in calories, vitamins and protein), and this lowered the mortality rate, especially among children.

relationship of intimacy with consumers, which is compounded by presenting styles, social media and the opening up of their personal lives. These intimacies are extended into domestic spaces through the material objects, such as kitchen equipment, specialist ingredients and cookbooks, which are brought into the home. This article interrogates the ways a group of UK consumers interact with this \u2018stuff\u2019 of celebrity chefs and explores the ways these interactions (re)produce chefs and make them present in consumer homes. As such, it elucidates how focusing on the material objects that consumers personalise and associate with a celebrity chef can provide new insights into assessing the ways such chefs influence food and eating practices, as well as showing how these objects enable consumers to actively produce their food identities and social relations. As these relations are social and economic, attention is drawn to the manner in which the fostering of intimacies can obfuscate commercial relations.

anthropological linguistics and food studies to examine how K'iche' Maya foodways are elucidated by the study of interactions between language and the materiality of food. The meaning and symbolism of food emerge from the diverse social and cultural settings in which people live. How people talk about food relates to how their cultural identities form around it, all of which become embedded in its physical substance. Thus, the conceptual development of food is inseparable from the structural development of language. In this sense, Indigenous languages in K'iche' communities highlight the importance of cultural meaning, spirituality, and agricultural practices that are interwoven with foodways. From this perspective, the conceptual and structural ties between food and language highlight their intrinsic relationship. By exploring this relationship, this paper examines how K'iche' Mayan language gives food culture a legacy of meanings that have persisted through time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84984377, "asset_id": 77679570, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 53983201, "first_name": "Miguel", "last_name": "Cuj", "domain_name": "vanderbilt", "page_name": "MiguelCuj", "display_name": "Miguel Cuj", "profile_url": "https://vanderbilt.academia.edu/MiguelCuj?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33624, "name": "K'iche'an Mayan Languages and Cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kichean_Mayan_Languages_and_Cultures?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 66905, "name": "Guatemala", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Guatemala?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 67833324, "title": "[Review] Food in the Ancient World / J.M.

Natural toxins including saponin, glycoalkaloids, lectin and heavy metals (Pb, Cd, total As) in soil, water and plants were determined. The chemical analysis was done using HPLC, ICP-MS and mutation degree was based on Drosophila assay. The results indicated that the concentration of phytotoxins in selected plants was low (3-60 mg/g DW). In addition, no heavy metals were detected in the water while low concentrations were detected in the soil and plants ranging 0.02-0.32 mg/kg for Pb, 0.04-0.17 mg/kg for Cd and 0.013-0.147 mg/kg for total As. Regarding mutagenicity, all samples tested by the assay showed no mutation except Careya sphaerica Roxb. for which an initial concentration led to smaller size Drosophila flies. The results indicate that areas with minimum human activity could also be contaminated with naturally occurring heavy metals such as Pb and As. However, all toxins and mutagenicity were within the limits as defined by the Thai food safety regulations. Moreover, at moderate consumption, these studied plants did not exhibit toxic effects.\nLink of the (Abstract) Paper: https://www.wflpublisher.com/Abstract/5498\n\nLink of the website: https://www.wflpublisher.com", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57905957, "asset_id": 37896607, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 87236435, "first_name": "JFAE Journal", "last_name": "Administration", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OmarFaruk244", "display_name": "JFAE Journal  Administration", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OmarFaruk244?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/87236435/20097421/19855898/s65_omar.faruk_administrator_.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37656623, "title": "Nutririch millet (Finger millet) and Legume (Macrotyloma uniflorum) in developing Ready-To-Eat (RTE) food", "created_at": "2018-10-26T22:26:57.154-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37656623/Nutririch_millet_Finger_millet_and_Legume_Macrotyloma_uniflorum_in_developing_Ready_To_Eat_RTE_food?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_37656623", "summary": "The proposed article is envisaged in developing RTE foods by effective use of underutilized Nutri-cereals (millets) and legumes which focuses on the functional, rheological and nutritional aspects of millets and legumes used in formulating RTE foods.

Canthaxanthin exists naturally in birds, fish, fungi. algae and insects. It is a red carotenoid and widely used in the feed industry as an additive for offering red pigmentation to egg yolk and poultry skin. It is a highly potent red colourant available to poultry industry. In comparison to the red carotenoid from plants. canthaxanthin is in a high bioavailability form and has a higher deposition rate in egg yolk and poultry skin. Flesh colour is a very important quality indicator used by consumers to judge the quality for farmed salmonids. in combined with astaxanthin. canthaxanthin is commonly used for salmon and trout pigmentation. Canthaxanthin acts as an antioxidant like vitamins C and E. it helps to protect the body cells from the damaging effect of free radicals and has a positive impact on the immune system. Canthaplus\u00ae.10 0 /0 is the product of choice for the feed industry. The high purity canthaxanthin is finely emulsified with antioxidants and dispersed evenly in a protective matrix. The fine emulsion of canthaxanthin allows an optimum absorption of the carotenoid in the digestive tract resulting in a higher deposition rate in target sites. The product is manufactured by the spray-dried coating technology and the use of antioxidants protects the conjugated double bond structure of the canthaxanthin molecule from oxidative decomposition when exposed to air, heat and humidity.

The risk of child morbidity and mortality increased if undernutrition during this critical phase of the child's lifetime. 53% of all childhood death was estimated globally, and 3.1 million Under-five children were dying every year due to Malnutrition. Particularly under-five children are the most at risk for malnutrition and related effects because they are more vulnerable to adverse environmental factors and respond sensitively to dietary changes. This review was aimed to assess the nutritional status of children under-five years of age in the Ethiopian context. Regarding methodology, peer-reviewed journals published from 2001 up to 2017 were searched from online databases such as pub med, Ethiopia was the search interest. In Ethiopia, a major public health problem is existed due to Malnutrition and has a significant impact on communities, particularly in women and children. The common types of diseases caused by malnutrition in under-five children are Wasting, Stunting, Protein-Energy-Malnutrition, Marasmus, and Kwashiorkor. Some of the factors that maximized the incidence of malnutrition were Community's Low educational status, poor dietary diversity, seasonal variation, inappropriate breastfeeding and size of the family. The annual cost associated with a child undernutrition was estimated at around 16.5 % of the Ethiopian GDP (1.5 million USD). Ministry of health in collaboration with the Agricultural sector was working to overcome these nutritional disorders. The inclusion of nutritional health services in the public health approach was adopted by (FMoH) Federal Ministry of Health (Health Extension Program) which among the interventions carried out. In summary, in Ethiopia, the prevalence of malnutrition is elevated. Even if primary prevention have been tailored to provide education on weaning practice, early initiation of breastfeeding, family planning, prevention of malaria and diarrhea, health education about dietary diversity and malnutrition screening in primary health care context, the level of malnutrition among under-five children was increased. Attention and collaborative efforts among the government, development partners and stakeholders were suggested.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59695449, "asset_id": 39544230, "asset_type":

system, gastronomy today has naturally turned in the direction of anti-industrialization and anti-globalization in search of both nutritionally and gustatorily rich food. Related to this concern with food are also concerns over the local economy, envi- ronment, labor problems, healthy and safe living, and many other issues. At the same time, however, questions on what and how to eat can be easily trivialized into a matter of individual consumption choice. Specifically, food activism in a neo-liberalist economy is always at odds with the need for collective action to reform the food system and the self-responsibility-based logic of consumerism. Whether it is a right or a responsibility to eat well is, therefore, an in- evitable question when considering the nature of food activism today. Through analysis of the shokuiku (Food and Diet Education) campaign launched by the Japanese government, this paper will strive to reveal problems in food activism with an emphasis on the responsibility to eat well. This case will illustrate that when the emphasis is on a person\u2019s responsibility rather than his or her right, food activism fails to recognize existing social inequalities in class and gender that underlie the current food system. Traditionalism, nationalism, and society\u2019s ideas of what constitutes motherly love distract people from the pursuit of true gastronomy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60687371, "asset_id": 40430379, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 127859740, "first_name": "Aiko", "last_name": "Kojima Hibino", "domain_name": "saic", "page_name": "AikoHibino", "display_name": "Aiko Kojima Hibino", "profile_url": "https://saic.academia.edu/AikoHibino?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17158, "name": "Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japan?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 11940239, "title": "PRACTICAL EXAMPLE OF A BUSINESS PLAN", "created_at": "2015-04-14T05:34:31.870-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11940239/PRACTICAL_EXAMPLE_OF_A_BUSINESS_PLAN?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_11940239", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37302579, "asset_id": 11940239, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29589414, "first_name": "umar", "last_name": "bagban", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ubagban", "display_name": "umar bagban", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ubagban?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 39, "name": "Marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marketing?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1907, "name": "Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8164063, "title": "Growth and Productivity of Mango Grown under Greenhouse Conditions", "created_at": "2014-09-01T20:28:43.929-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8164063/Growth_and_Productivity_of_Mango_Grown_under_Greenhouse_Conditions?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_8164063", "summary": "THE SUITABILITY of white greenhouse net cover for growth of mango (Mangifera indica.

The study compares 4 groups of people in the U.S.: Christians (n = 39), Hindus (n = 29), Jews (n = 23), and non-religious people (n = 63).  A total of 154 participants were given surveys in which they rated their feelings about eating various animals. Data from Christian and non-religious groups exhibited similar patterns such as a high likelihood of eating a given animal when starving, while results from Jews and Hindus were consistent with their religion's respective food taboos. Despite these differences, morality and disgust are strongly correlated with one another in almost all instances. Moreover, morality and disgust are almost equally important considerations when determining willingness to eat when starving.  \n \n \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53685443, "asset_id":

aim of this study was to reformulate 6 commercial dry soups available in the Egyptian market into healthy sensory and nutritional profile. Commercial dry soups (CDS) were sensory and chemically evaluated. The sensory test included 50 people; male and female equally divided (25-50y), in order to identify consumers' acceptability for the commercial and reformulated dry soups (RDS) on a 9-point hedonic scale. The RDS were simulated to commercial soup ingredients but with adding more herbs, fibre, salt replacer, no hydrogenated fats or flavour enhancers were added. Results showed that the CDS have higher fat, sodium (>0.2 g/100g) and total trans fatty acids (TFA) (>0.2 g/100g) than RDS. However, the RDS indicated to zero total TFA, reduction of total fat and sodium and increased protein, complex carbohydrates and fibres compared to CDS. Sensory evaluation results indicate that the RDS increased the liking attributes in males significantly (F = 38.34, P < 0.0001) for appearance, colour, flavour and total acceptability.",

After a brief introduction into the area, we will spend some time playing with OpenSauce software and see how we can cook from colours, sounds, tweets or even human stories. We will also get our hands dirty while cooking our own data, and try to build our own edible data-visualisation prototype.

It is also known that flavonoids bind to proteins. The effect of the interaction between tea flavonoids and proteins on the antioxidant capacity was examined. Their separate and combined antioxidant capacities were measured with the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. It was observed that the antioxidant capacity of several components of green and black tea with alpha-, beta-, and kappa-casein or albumin is not additive; that is, a part of the total antioxidant capacity is masked by the interaction. This masking depends on both the protein and the flavonoid used. Components in green and black tea, which show the highest masking in combination with beta-casein, are epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid.

"work_23449632", "summary": "Ethnopharmacological relevance\r\nRecent studies have shown that groups sharing the same or very similar environments, but with diverse cultural backgrounds (e.g. different ethnos and/or religion) have considerably different knowledge of folk (medicinal) plant uses. Yet, it is not clear to what extent various factors (such as culture, economy, isolation, and especially social and political situations) contribute to such differences in the utilization of the same natural resources.\r\n\r\nAim of the study\r\nThis paper addresses the effect of border created in 1940 and subsequent separation of a single ethnic group on changes in their folk use of medicinal and wild food plants. The Hutsuls of Bukovina had been homogenous for centuries, but were separated in 1940 as a result of the formation of state borders between Romania and the former Soviet Union (now Ukraine). The aim of the study is to analyse if the belonging to this different states for 75 years have induced different changes in local plant use within communities that share a common historical legacy and environment.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods\r\nIn depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 42 people in May 2015. Collected data were analysed, and comparisons were made between the data gathered on the two sides of the border for different use categories: medicinal, wild food and veterinary plants, as well as other remedies. Recently collected data were also compared with historical data obtained for the region, medicinal plant folk uses in Romania and medicinal plant uses of The State Pharmacopeia of the Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nDivergences in current medicinal plant use are much greater than in the use of wild food plants. The majority of the wild food taxa, including those used for making recreational teas, are also used for medicinal purposes and hence contribute to the food-medicine continuum, representing emergency foods in the past and serving as memory markers for possible future food shortages. Compared with the historical data, considerable changes have occurred within specific medicinal applications and less in the taxa used. The influence of the Soviet State Pharmacopeia on present ethnomedicine on the Ukrainian side is minimal.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nHutsul herbal ethnomedicine on the Ukrainian side of the border has continued to evolve (the abandonment of some uses and the adoption of others), whereas on the Romanian side it has undergone significant erosion with a proportionally smaller adoption of new uses and the leaving behind of possibly more \u201ctraditional\u201d uses than on the Ukrainian side. In sum, current ethnomedicinal practices of Hutsuls living on both sides of the border are more extensive than those reported in historical sources. Yet the unknown sampling method employed to collect the historical data and possible skipping of \u201cordinary\u201d uses by folklorists and ethnographers does not allow for definitive conclusions to be drawn. Cross-cultural and cross-border ethnobotany represents one of the most powerful means for addressing the issue of change and variability of medicinal plant uses and heritage, and further studies in other areas of Eastern Europe and beyond need to address the trajectory proposed by the present study.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43890519, "asset_id": 23449632, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 244958, "first_name": "Renata", "last_name": "S\u00f5ukand", "domain_name": "unive", "page_name": "renata", "display_name": "Renata  S\u00f5ukand", "profile_url": "https://unive.academia.edu/renata?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/244958/2931068/19053267/s65_renata.s_ukand.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 136, "name": "Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_History?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 787, "name": "Folklore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Folklore?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 793, "name": "Medical Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Anthropology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1700, "name": "Ethnobotany", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnobotany?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 5821, "name": "Ukrainian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukrainian_Studies?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 15357, "name": "Ethnobiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnobiology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 21999, "name": "Ukraine (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukraine_History_?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 28538, "name": "Ethnomedicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomedicine?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 33528, "name": "Bukovina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bukovina?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 36514, "name": "Ethnoecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnoecology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 46989, "name": "Ukraine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukraine?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 179777, "name": "Ethnobotany, Ethnobiology, Ethnoecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnobotany_Ethnobiology_Ethnoecology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 298255, "name": "Ethnobotany in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnobotany_in_Europe?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 516107, "name": "Bukowina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bukowina?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 704636, "name": "Hutsuls", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hutsuls?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 79099519, "title": "Analysis of the Benefits of Digitization of Fair Price Shops under National Food Security Act: A Study of Haryana State", "created_at": "2022-05-15T06:48:13.900-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79099519/Analysis_of_the_Benefits_of_Digitization_of_Fair_Price_Shops_under_National_Food_Security_Act_A_Study_of_Haryana_State?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_79099519", "summary": "The purpose of the research paper is to analyze the benefits of digitization of fair price shops (FPS).

As you stroll down a darkened entryway (or after you have waited in line in that entryway), you turn a corner and confront a robot-like creature, very similar to the robot in the TV series \"Lost In Space.\"  A computer monitor is in the robot's chest.  As you approach, the robot politely asks your name.  You say \"Bill Wireling\" (your name), and a moment later, a menu shows up on that monitor in his chest.  As it happens, the last time there, you had ordered a Porterhouse steak, medium well done, with mushrooms on the side, a salad with Thousand Island dressing, Iced tea with lemon and sugar, no salt, etc.\nThe computer monitor now shows the \"Special of the House\", with that EXACT meal description, with the prominent title \"Steak a la Wireling\".  Your companion HAS to be impressed!  Maybe you are a more important person than was first perceived.  After all, how important does a person have to be before a restaurant names a meal after him?  Now, when the robot asks if you again want the Specialty of the House, you can just casually say yes!\nSince that meal is exactly what you had ordered last time, and most humans are very predictable, there is a pretty good chance that you will want the \"Specialty of the House.\"  Of course, you could tell the robot, \"Maybe not.  I think I'll look at a menu.\"  and things would also proceed with you looking VERY important!\nOf course, after you have passed, and the robot asks the next person in line, the \"Special of the House\" then becomes \"Chicken Watterson\"!", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54985222, "asset_id": 23911694, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

"dom_id": "work_27724796", "summary": "The study tested the possibility of incorporating corn and soya bean flours to partially substitute wheat flour in the production of cakes. A 3x2 factorial design was followed using three different composite flour formulations (A, B= 80 soya bean: 15 corn: 5 wheat; C, D= 15 soya bean: 80 corn: 5 wheat; E, F= 50 soya bean: 20 corn: 30 wheat) at two levels of creaming (manual and machine creaming). Samples A, C and E were manually creamed whereas B, D and F were subjected to machine creaming. Composite flours were used to bake cakes, with 100% wheat flour cake serving as control. A total of seven samples were produced, coded and tested for acceptability using a nine-point hedonic scale in affective sensory test. Correlation analysis was performed to ascertain the influence of individual flour components on the performance of cake samples. Proximate analysis was also conducted on best overall scored sample and control sample (G). Results showed that all cake samples compared well sensorially with average score of 7.23 for overall acceptability against G (7.33), inferring they were all liked moderately by the sensory panel. Correlation coefficients showed that sensory scores were lower for increasing amounts of soya bean (-0.4656) and corn (-0.3637) but higher for increasing amounts of wheat (0.8680). For proximate and energy contents, sample F had significantly higher values for moisture (24.71) and protein (18.50) than G (19.01 and 8.19 respectively) (P<0.05). The control sample (G) also recorded higher values for fibre (26.23) and lipids (42.77) than sample F (23.92, 30.41 respectively) (P<0.05). Energy values of samples revealed a higher value for G (520.61 kcal) than F (443.37 kcal). Creaming methods had no significant influence on the sensory performance of cakes. Substituting wheat flour with soya bean and corn flour was recommended but more work needs to be done to improve on associated heaviness and rough texture of cakes produced.",

difficult? This book answers a question that many parents find themselves asking on a daily basis.  Hunger is a basic biological drive and eating should be an easy part of family life.  But too often, it is not.  Based on 30 years of research into eating behaviour and 21 years being a mother, Jane Ogden offers straightforward advice about how to encourage children to develop a healthy, unproblematic approach to eating from birth through to young adulthood.\n\nThe book describes current theory and research and turns these into practical tips for use in everyday family life.  It covers how children learn to like food, how habits are formed and can be changed, what children should be eating and how this can be helped to happen without making food into an issue.  She discusses common problems that parents face such as picky eating, undereating, overeating, obesity, body image issues and eating disorders and how to deal with a child who thinks they are fat.  She also provides practical tips and solutions and some simple ways to feed a family a healthy diet.  \n\nWith insightful advice about one of the most complicated adventures in parenting this guide is a must have for any parent who wants their child\u2019s relationship with food to thrive. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68107910, "asset_id": 49935299, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 714833, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Ogden", "domain_name": "surrey", "page_name": "JaneOgden", "display_name": "Jane Ogden", "profile_url": "https://surrey.academia.edu/JaneOgden?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/714833/242880/287178/s65_jane.ogden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1040, "name": "Food Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3128, "name": "Sociology of Food and Eating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Food_and_Eating?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3851, "name": "Obesity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Obesity?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4545, "name": "Parenting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parenting?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4583, "name": "Child Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_Development?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 15827, "name": "Eating Disorders and Body Image", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eating_Disorders_and_Body_Image?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 41939, "name": "Eating Disorders and Obesity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eating_Disorders_and_Obesity?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 73666, "name": "Cooking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cooking?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 89805, "name": "Weight Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Weight_Loss?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 96097, "name": "Motherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Motherhood?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 152721, "name": "Home Cooking Recipes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Cooking_Recipes?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 218820, "name": "Eating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eating?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 219309, "name": "Fast Food Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fast_Food_Industry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 655154, "name": "Effects of Parenting Styles in Childhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Effects_of_Parenting_Styles_in_Childhood?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 939482, "name": "Women and Food/eating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Food_eating?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 43973570, "title": "ASAM 151W ASIAN Eats: Asian American foodways", "created_at": "2020-08-28T23:19:36.115-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43973570/ASAM_151W_ASIAN_Eats_Asian_American_foodways?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_43973570", "summary": "Catalog Description: The main purpose of ASAM151W is to introduce students to the conventions of academic writing and critical thinking.

This study aimed to assess nutritional status & focus on the nutrient intake in patients with thalassemia. The main motive of this study was to see if thalassemia patients were able to meet their daily body requirement. \nMethods: Six hundred patients with (317 males and 283 females) were enrolled in this study. Data of food intake, anthropometry and biochemical parameters were collected by a pre-designed questionnaire. Nutritional status was evaluated by anthropometric measurements. Dietary intake was assessed by 24-hour dietary recall. Dietary recall for three days was counted. Hemoglobin and Ferritin levels were also determined. \nResults: The results showed that these patients had normal nutrition evaluated by BMI and their Hemoglobin & ferritin levels were not normal. These levels keep fluctuating. However, the anthropometric measurements including height, weight and body mass index demonstrated that these patients were stunted. It was also found that they had average total energy intake lower than the dietary reference intake \nConclusion: The results of anthropometric measurements in this study indicated that patients with thalassemia had growth impairment. Although BMI appeared normal in these patients, their dietary intakes were apparently inappropriate. Therefore, the nutritional assessment and appropriate nutritional interventions should be incorporated into\ntherapeutic plans for these patients to improve growth status and clinical outcomes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57159675, "asset_id": 37208794, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75953470, "first_name": "Nishat", "last_name": "Sanjida", "domain_name": "govhec", "page_name": "NishatSanjida", "display_name": "Nishat Sanjida", "profile_url": "https://govhec.academia.edu/NishatSanjida?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75953470/19084380/19034320/s65_nishat.sanjida.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2065, "name": "Research Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_Methodology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 34555636, "title": "Ripe Chesa Fruit as Flour Supplement Used in Baking.docx", "created_at": "2017-09-13T01:44:23.594-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34555636/Ripe_Chesa_Fruit_as_Flour_Supplement_Used_in_Baking_docx?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_34555636", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54420985, "asset_id": 34555636, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33108644, "first_name": "Angelica", "last_name": "Perez", "domain_name": "lyceum", "page_name": "AngelicaPerez", "display_name": "Angelica  Perez", "profile_url": "https://lyceum.academia.edu/AngelicaPerez?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33108644/9825448/25032316/s65_angelica.perez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 85366, "name": "ANOVA", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ANOVA?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 60170505, "title": "A Research Paper on Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana' (PMMVY)", "created_at": "2021-10-27T21:01:43.043-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/60170505/A_Research_Paper_on_Pradhan_Mantri_Matru_Vandana_Yojana_PMMVY_?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_60170505", "summary": "Under-nutrition adversely affects majority of women in India.

Yoghurt combined with papaya juice may\nresult in a product with enhanced functional and nutritional properties, and sensory acceptability. Papaya possesses antioxidant\nproperties as it is rich in \u03b2-carotene and phenolic compounds. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of\npapaya juice supplementation and levels of gelatin addition on physicochemical and acceptability of yoghurt. The experiment was\nlaid out in a 3\u00d74 full factorial arrangement where each of three gelatin addition levels (0.5, 0.6 and 0.7% w/v of the milk) were\ncombined with one of the four papaya juice addition levels (0,10,15 and 20% w/w of the base milk) to give twelve different yoghurt\nformulations. Proximate composition, total phenolics, total carotenoids and reducing power of yoghurt samples were determined\non day 1 whereas yoghurt firmness and consumer acceptance tests were done on day 7. The addition of papaya juice to yoghurt\nformula resulted in a decrease in fat and an increase in the total solids, protein and ash values. The addition of gelatin improved\nthe syneresis and firmness of yoghurt. Increased amount of gelatin and papaya juice addition significantly (P\u22640.05) decreased the\nsyneresis of yoghurt samples and increased the firmness. The total carotene, phenolic and reducing power of yoghurt samples were\nsignificantly (P\u22640.05) increased with the increased papaya juice level. Panelists favored samples with 10% papaya juice and 0.5%\ngelatin in terms of appearance, color and overall acceptability. The results indicated the viability of commercially producing papaya\njuice supplemented yoghurt along with gelatin to combat syneresis, improve firmness, enhanced the total carotenoids, phenol and\nreducing power, crude protein and total solid of the yoghurt samples. Therefore, it is concluded that addition of papaya juice into\nyogurt improves the nutritional and functional property of yoghurt.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60419824, "asset_id": 40195350, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 97219795, "first_name": "iris", "last_name": "publishers", "domain_name": "unam", "page_name": "irispublishers", "display_name": "iris publishers", "profile_url": "https://unam.academia.edu/irispublishers?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/97219795/21209210/22437744/s65_iris.publishers.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15901, "name": "Yoghurt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yoghurt?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 722740, "name": "Fish Gelatin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fish_Gelatin?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1323351, "name": "Syneresis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Syneresis?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34832574, "title": "R\u016fznorodost stravy \u010desk\u00fdch zem\u00ed ve zkratce /Variety of Food in the Czech Lands in Short/", "created_at": "2017-10-11T10:58:18.167-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34832574/R%C5%AFznorodost_stravy_%C4%8Desk%C3%BDch_zem%C3%AD_ve_zkratce_Variety_of_Food_in_the_Czech_Lands_in_Short_?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_34832574", "summary": "Strava jako neodd\u011bliteln\u00e1 sou\u010d\u00e1st nejen lidsk\u00e9ho byt\u00ed doznala mnoha forem a s rozvojem zem\u011bd\u011blstv\u00ed a technologi\u00ed dala rozvinout bohat\u00e9 kulin\u00e1\u0159sk\u00e9 fantazii lid\u00ed, odr\u00e1\u017eej\u00edc\u00ed se v region\u00e1ln\u00edch kuchyn\u00edch, v\u010detn\u011b stravy v \u010cesk\u00fdch zem\u00edch, a to nejen v rozmanit\u00fdch n\u00e1zvech pokrm\u016f, ale tak\u00e9 zapsan\u00e9 v cel\u00e9 \u0161k\u00e1le kucha\u0159sk\u00fdch knih.

There are two hypotheses I am trying to test: 1) there is a commonly shared diet structure in Balkan area, and 2) people consume similar quantities of basic food. Although these hypotheses are considerably weaker than that of the existence of a \u201cBalkan cuisine\u201d, it seems to me that they are the means of doing the most of the available data.

Four crops (soy, corn, cotton and canola) account for 99% of GM hectares. Despite the veneer of social validity that regulators cast, the GMO sector has failed to gain a social licence. Where GM labelling is required, food manufacturers avoid GM ingredients. GMOs have failed to gain price parity with their non-GM counterparts, and they attract price penalties. Segregation of GMOs and non-GMOs has failed (with a tolerance of 0.9% GM contamination in so-called non-GM canola). GM has failed the coexistence test with a GMO growers contaminating neighbouring farms. GMOs are a biosecurity fail, with test plots of GM canola planted in the late 1990s still monitored two decades later for rogue canola plants. Most GMO crops are glyphosate dependent. Glyphosate is globally subject to massive litigation claims and awards, and is implicated in the causation of multiple cancers. Mechanisms for compensating farms contaminated by GMOs are lacking. The GMO industry has taken no responsibility for contaminations. GMOs are a threat to the organic sector and the maintenance of certification and price premiums. Most countries (88%) do not grow GMO crops.

An acceptance test and microbiological analysis of the formulations 10%, 15% and 20% were also performed. Except for lipids, the centesimal composition and caloric values revealed no statistically significant differences. An addition of purple yam in natura up to 20%, instead of wheat flour in ordinary bread (0%), can be made with no effect on the diet\u2019s energy. The free radical scavenging, 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and lipid per oxidation (LPO) methods revealed that the greater the percentage of purple yam being added into the breads the higher the antioxidant activity detected. The acceptance test applied to compare the three formulations of purple yam breads revealed a significant difference only in the attribute colour. Purple yam breads showed no preferable differences.

Based on published and archival materials, the paper focuses on the role that milk played in Soviet nutrition and the role that packaging played in Soviet consumption. The article also examines the modernization of technology for making packaging as well as technology transfer from the West. It concludes that, as in many Western countries , both the Soviet state and Soviet specialists saw it as important to increase the consumption of milk after the war, but the meaning of milk changed. Milk, a basic staple for nutrition, became a matter of science and specialists sought to explain its positive effects. In addition, due to the development of the paper and chemical industries , new forms of milk packaging, more practical in their uses, were introduced in the West. Soviet leaders and specialists saw the new packaging as a desirable feature of modernity, but were unsuccessful in launching domestic technologies for manufacturing such packaging. While experimenting with domestic technology, Soviet producers also received foreign equipment for making milk packaging. Nevertheless, the capacity of such foreign equipment was not enough to satisfy growing demand and the consumption of \"modern packaging\" remained lower than in the West until the introduction of capitalism and, with it, foreign companies into the Russian market in the 1990s.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58878984, "asset_id": 38788858, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2947966, "first_name": "Elena", "last_name": "Kochetkova", "domain_name": "uib", "page_name": "ElenaKochetkova", "display_name": "Elena Kochetkova", "profile_url": "https://uib.academia.edu/ElenaKochetkova?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2947966/2827694/12117128/s65_elena.kochetkova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 923, "name": "Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5021, "name": "Packaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Packaging?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9154, "name": "History of the USSR", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_USSR?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10072, "name": "Technology transfer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_transfer?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 15282, "name": "Technological Innovation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technological_Innovation?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 21219, "name": "Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 117832, "name": "Food Packaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Packaging?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 171276, "name": "Kitchen", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kitchen?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 201273, "name": "Soviet Union", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Union?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 205742, "name": "Milk products", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Milk_products?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 224708, "name": "Russian and Soviet History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_and_Soviet_History?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 385364, "name": "Pulp and Paper Industry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pulp_and_Paper_Industry?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 511009, "name": "Consumption Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_Culture?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 918582, "name": "Khrushchev", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khrushchev?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1833332, "name": "Packaged Milk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Packaged_Milk?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1857042, "name": "Socialist Modernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialist_Modernism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 2046929, "name": "Socialist Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialist_Modernity?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3197323, "name": "Tetra Pak", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tetra_Pak?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 3197324, "name": "triangle packages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/triangle_packages?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 33171649, "title": "The Effect of Different Sugars (starch, lactose, sucrose, glucose and fructose) To The Rate of Carbon Dioxide Evolution of Yeast in Fermentation", "created_at": "2017-05-24T01:14:48.534-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33171649/The_Effect_of_Different_Sugars_starch_lactose_sucrose_glucose_and_fructose_To_The_Rate_of_Carbon_Dioxide_Evolution_of_Yeast_in_Fermentation?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_33171649", "summary": "The study tested the effect of different sugars (starch, lactose, glucose, sucrose and fructose) in its rate of carbon dioxide evolution in fermentation.

"Beetroot (Beta vulgaris) is a traditional and popular vegetable in many parts of the world including India. It is the taproot portion of the beet plant. It is especially rich in fiber as well as in sugars and has a moderate caloric value. It also has several bioactive compounds like betalains, carotenoids and is a powerful dietary source of nutrients. The present study was designed to evaluate proximate and antioxidant potential of beetroot flour which was prepared by dehydration technique. Beetroot flour was then used to develop food products incorporating it, followed by sensory evaluation of them. The results of the study accord appropriate proximate value and high antioxidant potential to beetroot flour. The products developed were Beetroot Barfi and Beetroot Kanjhi having 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% incorporation of beetroot flour. The results indicate that the Beetroot Barfi having 1% and Beetroot Kanjhi having 4% incorporation of beetroot flour was accepted as well as their respective standard. The study is expected to extend the use of beetroot, a commonly grown yet marginalized foodstuff, in the form of its flour blended food products to provide nutrients and health enhancing phytochemicals to the masses.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59657261, "asset_id": 39508392, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 95651909, "first_name": "Dr. Deepika", "last_name": "Dhawan", "domain_name": "chitkara", "page_name": "DrDeepikaDhawan", "display_name": "Dr. Deepika Dhawan", "profile_url": "https://chitkara.academia.edu/DrDeepikaDhawan?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/95651909/21848147/21135350/s65_deepika.dhawan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48447, "name": "Food Product Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Product_Development?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38054392, "title": "Aceita\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de nhoque contendo compostos bioativos do extrato seco de ch\u00e1 verde", "created_at": "2018-12-28T18:29:39.057-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38054392/Aceita%C3%A7%C3%A3o_e_caracteriza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_nhoque_contendo_compostos_bioativos_do_extrato_seco_de_ch%C3%A1_verde?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_38054392", "summary": "Resumo: Esta pesquisa teve por objetivo desenvolver e caracterizar nhoques com tr\u00eas concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de extrato seco de ch\u00e1 verde (CV): 0,5; 1,5 e 2,5%.

Abstract (ACCEPTANCE AND CHARACTERIZATION OF GNOCCHI WITH BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS FROM DRIED GREEN TEA EXTRACT): This research aimed to develop and characterize gnocchi with three green tea extract concentrations: 0.5; 1.5 and 2.5%. Gnocchi were subjected to cooking test analysis, sensory evaluation, proximate composition and phenolic compounds analysis. The addition of green tea extract in all samples did not cause significant differences on cooking, as well as in the proximate composition. In sensory evaluation, the appearance of the sample containing 0.5% of green tea was better evaluated when panelists were informed about the product. The color of the samples with 0.5% and 1.5% green tea was better accepted and aroma was less accepted in the concentration of 2.5%, after given the information to consumers. The addition of 1.5% green tea extract was enough to increase the phenolic compounds of the gnocchi, and the extra addition of extract is unnecessary and may cause less acceptability.

Penelitian dilakukan dengan menggunakan Rancangan Acak Lengkap pola Faktorial dengan 2 faktor. Faktor pertama adalah konsentrasi bleaching earth (bentonit) (1,2%, 1,4%, dan 1,6%). Faktor kedua adalah lama pengadukan (10 menit, 15 menit dan 20 menit). Parameter uji yaitu kadar asam lemak bebas, kadar air, dan organoleptic yang meliputi warna, aroma dan rasa. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa penambahan konsentrasi bentonit dan lama pengadukan tidak menunjukkan adanya pengaruh signifikan terhadap kadar asam lemak bebas, aroma dan rasa minyak goreng superworm. Namun interaksi kedua faktor memberikan pengaruh secara signifikan terhadap nilai kadar air dan warna minyak goreng superworm. Konsentrasi bentonit terbaik adalah 1,6% dengan lama pengadukan 10 menit, dimana kadar asam lemak bebas sebesar 0,15 mg KOH/g dan kadar air sebesar 2,86%. SUMMARY This study aimed to determine the effect of bentonite in superworm oil bleaching process and to determine the optimal concentration of bentonite and stirring optimal length of time to improve the purity of the oil superworm. The study was conducted using a completely randomized design factorial with two factors. The first factor is the concentration of bleaching earth (bentonite) (1.2%, 1.4% and 1.6%). The second factor is the stirring length of time (10 minutes, 15 minutes and 20 minutes). The test parameters are free fatty acid content, water content, and organoleptic (color, aroma and flavor).The results showed that the addition of bentonite concentration and stirring length of time did not show any significant effect on the free fatty acid content, aroma and flavor of superworm cooking oil. But the interaction of both factors give significant influence on the water content and the color of superworm cooking oil. Best bentonite concentration is 1.6% with a stirring 10 minutes long, where the levels of free fatty acids of 0,15 mg KOH/g and water content of 2,86%.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56208473,

Suggesting that due to various conflicts of interest and corruption in industrial capitalism, society is at a crisis point. The crisis is multifaceted in nature, and this study uses social conflict and risk theory to analyse it. Looking into the different facets and pointing to globalisation as an instrument for neoliberal subjectivation, the study shows that there is a transformation underway in the perception of food, which is explained by symbolic interactionism. These concepts are\nused to explore the growing obesity epidemic in conjunction with the sugar revolution, coming to the conclusion that obesity is merely a sign of sugars\u2019 effects.

transformation of rural society and culture cannot be understood from a local perspective alone.  Rural areas have nowadays come up as places for entertainment, leisure activities, and second homes and are seen as an alternative to urban residential areas.  They reflect a cultural interest in rurality and locality in the larger society, which encourages new customs, practices and social demands. In examining the processes of transformation and redefinition of local identity, we will consider the heritage feature \u2013 more specifically food and gastronomy\u2013 as an element of tourist development at local level. Palm wine is an alcoholic beverage created from the sap of various species of palm tree such as the Palmyra, date palms, and coconut palms. It is known by various names in different regions and is common in various parts of Asia, Africa, Caribbean Islands and America. Palm wine production by small holders and individual farmers may become a source of regular household income that may economically be worth more than the value of timber sold. Kallu or toddy is a cheaply priced common man\u2019s alcoholic drink. The aim of this paper is to find the potential of toddy to attract tourists in the rural areas of Kerala by finding out Mean, Frequency and Percentage using SPSS 25.0 and graphs are drawn from Excel 2010. Primary data collected through structured questionnaire from the domestic tourists in Kerala. Convenience sampling method was adapted by the researchers to select respondents.

therapeutic steps in the treatment of pain and inflammation can include the use of vitamin D, chondroitin sulfate, niacinamide, and botanical medicines such as Boswellia. In direct contrast to so-called \u201canti-inflammatory drugs\u201d which always have significant toxicity, each of these natural treatments has been proven in controlled clinical trials to significantly reduce pain and inflammation without major adverse effects. Chondroitin sulfate has actually been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality in humans while it safely and effectively ameliorates the pain and inflammation of osteoarthritis. Similarly, vitamin D supplementation has been proven effective in the treatment of hypertension, depression, migraine headaches, polycystic ovary syndrome and in the prevention of type-1 diabetes. By failing to fully cover chiropractic and naturopathic healthcare services, insurance companies which comprise and contribute to the American healthcare system are losing profitability and forcing patients to use drug and surgical treatments that are commonly less effective, more dangerous, and more expensive than the natural treatments described in this paper. Services provided by chiropractic and naturopathic physicians are supported by peer-reviewed research and deserve equitable coverage and status in America\u2019s healthcare system. \n",

Article 48 directs that States should endeavor to organize agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines, particularly taking steps to preserve and improve breeds and prohibiting the slaughter of cows, calves and other milch and draught cattle. This often conflicts with the fundamental right to trade in Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. In 2021, the BJP government brought in a complete ban on slaughter of bulls, bullocks, male and female buffaloes below the age of 13, in addition to cows whose slaughter was already prohibited by an older 1964 Act. In addition, the transport, sale, export, purchase or disposal of these cattle for purpose of slaughter within and outside the state has been completely prohibited. Authorities can now conduct search and seizure operations, including of vehicles, just based on suspicion. The revised definition of beef to include flesh of cattle\n(cow, calf of cow, bull, bullock, he or she buffalo <13 years) now translates into a default ban as licenses for sale of beef are being denied to traders. Overnight, a thriving trade in Karnataka has been made illegal, with several adverse consequences which have been aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and unplanned lockdown. Penalties and punishments under the new Act include imprisonment of not less than 3 years and upto 7 years on conviction, with fines of not less than Rs. 50,000 and upto Rs. 10 lakhs.\nThis report by the Ahara Namma Hakku (Our Food Our Right) collective documents the effect of this ban on farmers, cattle traders, butchers, vendors and consumers and the debilitating blow dealt by this Act to the livestock, leather and meat economy of Karnataka. The report highlights the concerns of members of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), Beef merchants association, Jamaat-e-Islami, Karnataka Minority Rights\nForum, Dalit Sangharsh Samiti (DSS-Bheemvada), Hide and Skin Curing Units, Slaughterhouses, Eateries, cattle market officials and traders as well as Consumers of bovine meat. Comprising a significant section of Karnataka\u2019s population, their voices need to be amplified and the Karnataka government has to take serious cognizance of\ntheir critique of the Act. The primary demand is the repeal of the 2020 Act.

A cross-sectional study was conducted from March-May 2018 on 210 children. Data collection included socio-economic and  demographic  characteristics,  anthropometric  measurements  and  assessment  of  IYCF  practices  by using the 24-hour dietary recall. A total of 210 (121 females and 89 males) children were included in the study. Colostrum is most often given (77%). All children are breastfed; 92% are breastfed on demand. The median age of cessation of breastfeeding (BF) is 27.7 months. Only 20% of children are breastfed immediately after delivery. About 37% receive pre-milk fluids. Only 21% of those aged 0-3 months are exclusively breastfed. Only 30% of those aged 6-8 months receive complementary foods. The median age of introduction of the first food is 9.5 months. About 30% of children never receive porridge. Majority of mothers gave children 3 types of food according to their classification, including starch and cereals, meat and alternatives, and fruits and vegetables with a total diversity score of 0.75 (\u00be). Porridges consumed are of  low  nutritional  quality,  60%  consisting  only  of  a  cereal  and  water.  Among  children  who  take  a complementary food, the frequency is at least 3 times a day for 49% of children aged 6-8 months, 57% of those aged 9-11 months and 68% of those aged 12-17 months. Their MUACs were below 125 mm and the vast majority did not show edema and their weight-for-height ratio was less than minus to standard deviations. The rates of stunting, underweight and emaciation are 43%, 46% and 13% respectively (Z-score <-2\u03c3). The late introduction of complementary foods and their insufficient quality (the daily ration, eating meat, consumption of milk and milk products and weight of the child) are statistically significant factors that affect the nutritional status of children (p<0.05).

This phenomenon presents vital benefits for climate change, environmental degradation, human health and animal welfare. Yet, little research has investigated the rapidly growing trend. A broader understanding of the decision to reduce one's consumption and the cognitive, social and physical processes involved in maintaining dietary changes is essential for policy makers, campaigners and researchers working toward a sustainable future. Meat reduction and vegan campaigns by non-governmental organisations serve as a primary promoter of reduction and present a unique opportunity to research reducers when they may first be seeking a dietary transition. The theoretical framework employed within this dissertation combines the first comprehensive model of behaviour change, the Behaviour Change Wheel (Michie, Atkins and West 2014), with the fields of social consumption and sustainable and ethical consumption to analyse the reducer and the reduction process through a more comprehensive framework. A mixed-methods approach has been used to investigate the barriers, motivators and goals of participants in seven UK-based meat reduction and vegan campaigns through focus groups (n=33) and a longitudinal web-based survey (n=1,587). To the best of the researcher's knowledge, this represents the most comprehensive study of reducers and reduction campaigns to date. Interviews with campaign staff (n=13) and an examination of campaign messaging and strategies have been used to further analyse campaign participation and the reduction process. Findings reveal key trends within highly diverse approaches to reduction, including a reduction hierarchy that prioritises red meat and neglects fish and egg reduction through a tendency for small, gradual dietary changes. While meat reducers were likely to be successful on a short-term basis, they were unlikely to maintain reductions over a prolonged period. Those with the greatest levels of abstention were, instead, the most likely to meet their reduction goals. Animal protection also emerged as key for many reducers, potentially creating a new perspective - a mindshift - that re-positions the animal source within the consumption process. Findings suggest that policy makers, campaigners and advocates need to consider the psycho-social element within the reduction process, with the potential for a wide variety of consumer types and, importantly, the need to not simply address what is consumed but to address normative omnivorous consumption that is formed around a meat component and de-values meatless meals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65287911, "asset_id": 44792671, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30936360, "first_name": "Trent", "last_name": "Grassian", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "TrentGrassian", "display_name": "Trent Grassian", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/TrentGrassian?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30936360/50440568/41351410/s65_trent.grassian.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 591, "name": "Nutrition and Dietetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutrition_and_Dietetics?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1582, "name": "Sustainable Production and Consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Production_and_Consumption?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12204, "name": "Animal Welfare", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Animal_Welfare?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14892, "name": "Vegetarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vegetarianism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 18845, "name": "Environmental Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Sustainability?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 24849, "name": "Sociology of consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_consumption?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 38462, "name": "Animal Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Animal_Rights?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 42569, "name": "Environmental Behaviour Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Behaviour_Change?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 61978, "name": "Consumer Behavior and Food Choice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Behavior_and_Food_Choice?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 86626, "name": "Veganism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Veganism?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 104394, "name": "Sustainable Consumption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Consumption?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 213676, "name": "Behaviour change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Behaviour_change?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1031232, "name": "Sustainable Food & Farming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainable_Food_and_Farming?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1122591, "name": "Consumer Behaviour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Behaviour?f_ri=10221"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 41449415, "title": "Consumption of energy drink and associated factors: Experience from students of public university in Bangladesh", "created_at": "2019-12-28T03:10:15.247-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41449415/Consumption_of_energy_drink_and_associated_factors_Experience_from_students_of_public_university_in_Bangladesh?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_41449415", "summary": "Purpose: Energy drink (ED) consumption has become a common trend, especially among the youth. Hence, the purpose of this study was undertaken to assess the ED consumption pattern among the university students and investigate the independent predictors for their preference of such drinks. \nDesign/methodology/approach: It was a cross-sectional study conducted among 323 students from various departments of Noakhali Science and Technology University, Bangladesh. \nFindings: Among students, about 57 per cent were male, and mostly between 21-23 years. About 31 per cent of the students had never consumed ED, while 69 per cent had consumed such drinks at least once in their lifetime. Only 31.4 per cent of the ever consumer had knowledge of its components, and 14.3 per cent of them did not know the negative effects of ED. Bivariate analysis identified the variables that were significantly associated with students' consumption of ED. Taking the significant factors into a multivariate model, the risks of ED consumption were male gender (OR = 3.82; 95 per cent CI = 2.24 \u00c0 6.52), longer study duration in university (OR = 1.02; 95 per cent CI = 1.00 \u00c0 1.03) and doing regular physical activity (OR = 1.69; 95 per cent CI = 1.04 \u00c0 2.75). Originality/value: High consumption of ED among university students is evident, yet their perception regarding components and potential health hazards of such drinks is opaque. This study results suggest the necessity of formulating policy and intervention strategies concentrating on the predictors of ED consumption to promote consciousness about ingredients and related health effects of ED among students of all levels in Bangladesh and other countries as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61955541, "asset_id": 41449415, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75595080, "first_name": "Towhid", "last_name": "Hasan", "domain_name": "umonash-my", "page_name": "TowhidHasan", "display_name": "Towhid Hasan", "profile_url": "https://umonash-my.academia.edu/TowhidHasan?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75595080/18918532/58579229/s65_towhid.hasan.jpg"}, {"id": 47898889, "first_name": "Marjia", "last_name": "Sultana", "domain_name": "umonash-my", "page_name": "MarjiaSultana", "display_name": "Marjia Sultana", "profile_url": "https://umonash-my.academia.edu/MarjiaSultana?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47898889/18416541/18367552/s65_marjia.sultana.jpg"}, {"id": 102818936, "first_name": "Lincon Chandra", "last_name": "Shill", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LinconChandraShill", "display_name": "Lincon Chandra Shill", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LinconChandraShill?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/102818936/25607658/25847098/s65_lincon_chandra.shill.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33087215, "title": "NUTRITIONAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL COMPOSITION ANALYSIS OF SELECTED CASSAVA PROCESSED PRODUCTS", "created_at": "2017-05-18T18:31:12.090-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33087215/NUTRITIONAL_AND_TOXICOLOGICAL_COMPOSITION_ANALYSIS_OF_SELECTED_CASSAVA_PROCESSED_PRODUCTS?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_33087215", "summary": "Cassava (Manihot esculanta Crantz) is an important food source in tropical countries where it can withstand environmentally stressed conditions. Cassava and its processed products have a high demand in both local and export market of Sri Lanka. MU51 cassava variety is one of the more common varieties and boiling is the main consumption pattern of cassava among Sri Lankans. The less utilization of cassava is due to the presence of cyanide which is a toxic substance. This research was designed to analyse the nutritional composition and toxicological (cyanide) content of Cassava MU51 variety and selected processed products of cassava MU51 (boiled, starch, flour, chips, two chips varieties purchased from market) to identify the effect of processing on cassava MU51 variety. Nutritional composition was analysed by AOAC (2012) methods with modifications and cyanide content was determined following picric acid method of spectrophotometric determination. The Flesh of MU51 variety and different processed products of cassava had an average range of moisture content (3.18 \u2013 61.94%), total fat (0.31 \u2013 23.30%), crude fiber (0.94 \u2013 2.15%), protein (1.67 \u2013 3.71%) and carbohydrates (32.68 \u2013 84.20%) and where they varied significantly in between products and the variety MU51, where no significance difference (p >0.05) observed in between MU51 flesh and processed products' ash content where it ranged (1.02 \u2013 1.91%). However, boiled product and MU51 flesh had more similar results in their nutritional composition where they showed no significant difference at any of the nutrient that was analysed. Thus, there could be no significant effect on the nutrient composition of raw cassava once it boiled. Cyanide content of the MU51 flesh and selected products (boiled, starch, flour and chips prepared using MU51 variety), showed wide variation ranging from 4.68 mg.kg-1 to 33.92 mg.kg-1 in dry basis. But except boiled cassava all processed products had cyanide content <10 mg.kg-1 , which is the safe level recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Committee of the FAO/WHO. Thus, preparing products such as flour, starch and chips using MU51 variety could be safe for human consumption.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53187156, "asset_id": 33087215, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28579530, "first_name": "Supun", "last_name": "Rajapaksha", "domain_name": "sjp", "page_name": "SupunRajapaksha", "display_name": "Supun Rajapaksha", "profile_url": "https://sjp.academia.edu/SupunRajapaksha?f_ri=10221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28579530/8087838/19827045/s65_supun.rajapaksha.jpg"}, {"id": 243354, "first_name": "Dr. (Mrs.) Indira", "last_name": "Wickramasinghe", "domain_name": "sjp", "page_name": "IndiraWickramasinghe", "display_name": "Dr. (Mrs.) Indira Wickramasinghe", "profile_url": "https://sjp.academia.edu/IndiraWickramasinghe?f_ri=10221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1081, "name": "Food Safety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Safety?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10221, "name": "Food and Nutrition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_and_Nutrition?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16137, "name": "Food Chemistry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Chemistry?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34478, "name": "Food Science and Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Science_and_Technology?f_ri=10221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39719, "name": "Food Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Analysis?f_ri=10221"}]}, {"id": 32177734, "title": "Food Politics in a Digital Era, Forthcoming: in Digital Food Activism Routledge", "created_at": "2017-03-31T22:34:04.370-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32177734/Food_Politics_in_a_Digital_Era_Forthcoming_in_Digital_Food_Activism_Routledge?f_ri=10221", "dom_id": "work_32177734", "summary": "A farmer on a small scale organic farm in rural India uploads images of his latest produce to consumers and retailers via an open source online food hub; a \" conscious consumer \" in Charlottesville, Virginia uses an app while supermarket shopping to look up the ethical credentials of food producers and product ingredients; a business woman on a work trip to Rio de Janiero is \" informed \" by a travel and food app on her smartphone where and what she might like to eat for breakfast based on GPS technology and her previous preferences.

After briefly presenting the profile of the company, the assignment analyzes the external and internal environment, paying attention to the factors that affect their business, as well as the sources of its competitive advantages. Following these, a hypothetic case is analyzed, whereby a new low-cost retailer enters the fast-food industry in Greece. \r\n\r\nThe scenario of the case discussed in this assignment suggests, a new low-cost retailer enters the fast-food industry in Greece, which obviously affects the business of Goody\u2019s. Within this context, there are two ways in which the company could respond. The first is to continue following a differentiation strategy, focusing on the different nature of the products it offers, compared with the low-cost competitor (as well as other competitors). According to this strategy, companies offer products and services, or product and service features that consumers perceive as unique (Gamble et al., 2010).

This paper has reviewed and analyzed the publications available online particularly focusing on RbF as the source of income, family nutrition, and food security. It is found that the RbF is gaining popularity among the landless and leasehold farmers in recent years as the source of family income and nutrition that ultimately supported in food security. It was found that RbF has significantly contributed to the farmers' income. The cucurbits grown in the riverbeds are good sources of vitamins, minerals, proteins and vegetable oils for the poor and marginalized people. These vegetables are consumed by people for family nutrition and also sold in the local markets for the family income.
