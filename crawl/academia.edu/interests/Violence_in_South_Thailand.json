Like the rest of Thai/Malay peninsula, although the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Thailand\u2019s far-south are conservative traditionalists, the size and influence reformist Islam continues to increase. This is particularly the case among urban Malays. While the roots of reformism were sown in the 19th century by luminaries such as Syeikh Daud al-Fatani (1769-1847), and Syeikh Ahmed al-Fatani (1856-1908), the most important reformist personality in the early 20th centuries was Haji Sulong (1895-1945). Since his return from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, Dr Ismail Lutfi Japakiya, the founding of rector of Yala Islamic University (Thailand\u2019s first Islamic university) has emerged as the leader of Saudi style salafism. I conclude by considering the impact of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at, a South Asian revival movement, on Islamic diversity in South Thailand since its arrival in the 1980s. A important point infrequently made in analysis of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at is that both reformists and traditionalists are involved in this important revivalist movement.",

The reasons for this neglect are complicated. Beyond (non-negligible) methodological constraints and difficulties in attaining access to some orders not open to outsiders, a double marginalization is observable. In addition to being located at the periphery of Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201cIslamic arc\u201d (Tagliacozzo 2013), those studying Islam in Thailand have focused on but more has been written on religiously motivated violence, and the (revivalist) Tablighi Jama\u2019at and (reformist) Salafiyyah which developed mass followings during the twentieth century, than the turuq they replaced. These range from those violently resisting Bangkok\u2019s project of assimilation in the far-south since 2014, to the revivalist Tablighi Jama\u2019at and reformist Salafiyyah that are now found throughout the country. This paper redresses such neglect by presenting a historical anthropology of Thai tariqa based on fieldwork among sufi orders in Thailand since late 2012. I begin by introducing some of the most important sufi personalities who, during the twentieth century, returned from educational sojourns in the Middle East, Java, and Kelantan, with permission (ijazah) to initiate or revive a range of sufi orders in Central Thailand (Ayutthaya and Bangkok), the Southern Thai-speaking upper south (Pang-nga Bay and Songkhla), and parts of the Malay-speaking far-south (Narathiwat). I describe ways in which orders widely distributed throughout the Muslim World such as the Qadriyyah, Shadhiliyyah, and Ahmadiyyah-Idrisiyyah, have been localized by Muslim communities in Thailand. I argue that successful doctrinal and ritual innovations are frequently championed by familiar people advocating and embodying something strange. The variety of localized global turuq that I present, challenge a number of assumptions about the cultural geography of Islamic diversity in contemporary Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments":

photographs by photo-journalist Richard Humphries, focusing on Thailand's troubled deep South. The collection was compiled over a ten-year period. \n\nThe introduction to the collection is by Gerard McDermott.\n\n'The collection captures the colourful and, at times, clashing identities and traditions of different peoples living together, yet separately; their histories and cultures sometimes overlapping, and sometimes conflicting. Some of the photos use allusions, symbolism and subtle references, while others make a virtue of plainness and immediacy. Richard's work maintains either a respectful intimacy or a sympathetic distance: at times, raw and immediate; at other times, detached.' - Gerard McDermott", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

"dom_id": "work_29885940", "summary": "No credible claims can be made that the role of language \u2013 specifically Malay \u2013 has been entirely overlooked by those studying conflict dynamics in South Thailand. Nevertheless, those concerned with religious factors dwarf the number of studies interrogating language issues. Without suggesting that language represents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue that anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand's southern impasse must be more informed about language policy, monolingual mind-sets, and linguistic justice, namely how linguistic repertoires and linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are theoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper's two substantive sections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and how the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states between South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok's policies towards southern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking Buddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South Thailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact with recent treatments of how language and religion are involved in constructions of ethno-nationalisms, and linguistic injustice that leads to inequality among linguist minorities. I conclude suggesting reasons for anyone seeking peaceful political resolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority possesses close connections to the Malay cosmopolis \u2013 needing address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand's (deeply entrenched) monolingual mind-set and discriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.",

concerned with religious factors dwarf the number of studies\r\ninterrogating issues related to language. Without suggesting that language\r\nrepresents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue\r\nthat anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand\u2019s southern\r\nimpasse must be more informed about language policy, linguistic justice, and how\r\nlinguistic repertoires are linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

It moves beyond the routine rounding up and interrogation of the \u201cusual suspects\u201d in two ways: first, by including a range of uncivil elements of Thai Buddhism, and second, by examining often ill-conceived Thai interference in Islamic matters. The article also poses questions about the \u201cusual suspects\u201d, beginning with a description of Islamic movements which contribute to an increasingly divided Islamic community less able to prevent and limit Islamic violence. The paper investigates the Islamic credentials of the insurgency and distinguishes between the presence of jihadi rhetoric with a developed jihadi rationale, a recent development in southern Thailand. The article argues for the localization of the global, a process which features local actors and agents that are informed by parochial and highly ethnocized version of Islam that is countering occasionally uncivil Buddhist opponents, as an approach for studying violence in the Thai south.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30306328, "asset_id": 2254860, "asset_type": "Work",

Although his interests may appear unsurprising for someone hailing from the north which is widely regarded as Thailand\u2019s most ethnically diverse region, Thailand\u2019s ethnic diverse has been ignored or downplayed by foreign and Thai scholars alike. Thai citizens of Chinese descent were once regarded as Thailand\u2019s largest and most successfully assimilated ethnic minority, and Peter Vail (2007) has referred to the one million Khmer residents of Isaan as an invisible minority. The largest, least assimilated \u2013 not to mention most problematic \u2013 ethnic constituency in Thailand are the Malays of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat. The cultural geography of the Malay World in Thailand might have once extended as far north as Rayong, and Malay-speaking communities in Central Thailand still exist, but there has been unprecedented violence in the restive south. This chapter revisits the role of ethnicity and religion in one of the world\u2019s deadliest subnational conflicts. Vaddhanaphuti, in his analysis of ethnic conflict between upland and lowland communities in North Thailand, argued for multi-causality in which access to natural resources and uneven development were important factors. I ask what an acceptance of multi-causality, and the inadequacies of framing Thailand\u2019s southern violence as a religious and/or ethnic conflict contributes to an analysis of the south. This chapter develops Imtiyaz Yusuf\u2019s proposal that violence in South represents a conflict between the competing chauvinistic ethno-religious worldviews of Thai satsanaa and Malay agama. In it, I propose moving beyond rounding up the \u201cusual suspects\u201d in two ways. Firstly, I remind readers of the presence of uncivil Buddhism constituencies within Thailand. Although Islam and Christianity are commonly be associated with violence, people unfamiliar with Buddhist initiated violence against Muslims in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and South Thailand may be surprised by the concept of Buddhist warfare coined by commentators such as Michael Jerryson (2010). Secondly, I ask new questions for the usual suspects. I argue that increased assimilation among urban Malays and reformist activism throughout the south are has led to unprecedented diversity. Not only have (mainly urban) Malay communities benefited from time modernity, but the fragmented nature of the Muslim leadership has undermined its ability to discredit religiously motivated attacks against both fellow Muslims and the Thai state. My analysis of the Islamic credentials of the insurgency distinguishes between jihadi rhetoric, and a coherent jihadi rationale. I argue that local actors have adopted the former from movements sharing their concern to defend Islam. While it is undeniable that these adhere to a highly ethnocized version of Islam, they clash with uncivil Buddhist elements at a time when the role of the Thai military  in public life shows no signs of abating", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37877928, "asset_id": 12913162, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 39796385, "asset_id": 12913162, "asset_type": "Work",

The unprecedented announcement of this formal \u2018peace dialogue\u2019 between the Thai state and an insurgent group led to much scepticism from different parties concerning the motivations of the NSC and the level of influence of the BRN delegation\u2019s chief representative, Hassan Taib. This article critically examines the turbulent ten month period from the February 28th declaration in Kuala Lumpur to the December 29th announcement by General Prayuth Chan-ocha that the military, and not the NSC, would represent Thailand at the next round of talks. This article also evaluates the positive aspects of the talks and the current barriers toward further progress for peace in the region. Additionally, attention is also drawn to the relevance of BRN\u2019s communication with both the general public and the NSC.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65137826, "asset_id": 8017888,

A review of the processes through which Islam became an authentically Southeast Asian religion suggests that this merit-making conundrum is a recent example of the adoption and adaptation of Indic terms by Southeast Asian Muslims. These were central to the creation of Islamicate cultures. The concepts Indic and Islamicate are capable of pushing through conceptual cul-de-sacs such as syncretism and shared cosmologies. In addition to the specific generation of merit erroneously assumed as its only meaning, the article reveals that tham bun also denotes undifferentiated religious actions, and is code for a range of feasts unrelated to merit-making. It argues that the co-option of tham bun by Thai-speaking Muslims is an example of a search for equivalents. It also suggests the presence of an authentically Islamic economy of merit in Southern Thailand, confirming Islam\u2019s ability to speak the language of Indic Southeast Asians and to scratch where they itch.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33426080, "asset_id": 6703689, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher",

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Reasons range from their incompatibility with modernity, to the success that powerful interests have manipulated public opinion that their pharmaceutical products are the most reliable treatment. This paper explores alternative diagnoses to social problems in Muslim Southeast Asia where the words \u201cIslam\u201d, \u201cIslamic\u201d, and \u201cIslamist\u201d appear in both diagnoses of causes and prescriptions for cures. I make the case for placing more emphasis on \u201cMuslims\u201d, and less on Islam. Furthermore, in today\u2019s hyper-connected ummah, a broad \u2013 and widening \u2013 range of Muslims and \u201cIslams\u201d exist in Southeast Asia. My specific interest is in the analysis of social problems in Thailand\u2019s Malay-dominated far-southern provinces, and this paper reiterates arguments that (tantalising) mono-causal myths must be discredited and replaced by approaches attentive to multicausality. As most things happen for more than one reason, religious\nailments are one of a number of factors that have contributed to social\nproblems. In South Thailand, others include political instability, Malay\nlanguage loss, and widespread social disintegration. Doctrinal medicine and religious institutions may, therefore, represent only one part of the\nalternative medicine to cure the social ills plaguing Muslim Southeast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments":

Most  even  vaguely \nfamiliar  with  the  geography  of  violence  in  South  Thailand  will  be  aware  that  this  was  the  site  of  one  of  the  most \ndeadly  notorious  altercations  between  Malay  villagers  and  Thai  secur\nity  forces  in  the  twentieth  century.  Indeed, \nsuggestions have even been made that the timing of the April 2004 attacks were connected with the events of April \n1948. Although this paper builds on previous studies, its primary objective is to both place the \nDusun Nyoir rebellion \nin  its  wider  geo\n-\npolitical  context,  and  to  revisit  conceived  wisdom  about  the  role  of  Islamic  movements  (albeit \ninadequately)  classified  as  Sufism.
