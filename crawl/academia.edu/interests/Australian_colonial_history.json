Unlike other convicts, ticket-of-leave men were allowed to enter the colonial workforce, earn a wage and acquire property, although they remained subject to police surveillance and faced legal disadvantages. Despite the fact that most Western Australian convicts spent longer on ticket of leave than in colonial gaols or prisoner work parties, few historians have examined the ticket-of-leave experience in detail. Many have focussed on the freedoms of ticket-of-leave life described in convict department reports, reaffirming official assurances that 'ticketers' were treated more or less as free men. This article challenges these representations, providing a long overdue systematic exploration of ticket-of-leave standards of living. Through analysis of ticket-of-leave wage rates, living costs and mortality data, it shows that the 'freedoms' ticketers were afforded rarely translated into favourable living standards or work conditions. Not only were most ticket-of-leave holders disadvantaged in comparison to free men, but a considerable proportion were scarcely better off (in terms of living and labour conditions) than incarcerated convicts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81076124, "asset_id": 71938082, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 64293730, "first_name": "Louis", "last_name": "Marshall", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "LouisMarshall", "display_name": "Louis Marshall", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/LouisMarshall?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/64293730/16781933/17042441/s65_louis.marshall.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 24377, "name": "Mortality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mortality?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 186703, "name": "Convict Transportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_Transportation?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 271756, "name": "Western Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Australia?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1196636, "name": "Free and Unfree Labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Free_and_Unfree_Labour?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 49534727, "title": "Cox's Way: An Historical and Archaeological Study of Cox's Road and Early Crossings of the Blue  Mountains, New South Wales, with Foreword to the digital copy and updates for readers.

It has been suggested this concern manifested itself in domestic architecture, in both active and passive defensive strategies designed to afford protection against various forms of potential attack. Yet there remains a lack of substantive research to support such assertions. In this article, we present an analysis of accounts drawn from a range of sources of 97 domestic structures across Queensland with claims for defensive features. Although suggesting that fortified domestic structures were more common than previously envisaged, our review indicates that defensive features were usually minimal-holes in walls and barrable doors, windows or other ports of entry-reflecting the often expedient nature of the structures themselves. First-hand accounts of these buildings are rare, although not entirely absent, with most written accounts being reminiscences told in hindsight by later descendants, resulting in both distortions and myth-building. Accounts of fortified domestic structures peak in the decades following Federation and through both World Wars as the newly minted Australian nation explicitly engaged in nation-building and constructing the 'glorious pioneer' narrative.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67447378, "asset_id": 49057105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

For those of us who have taught Indonesian and Malay, the ability to identify Sanskrit, Arabic and European loan words has helped us to show how historical contacts have shaped Indonesian and Malay language and society. 1 With the publication of the fourth edition of the Macquarie Dictionary, 2 Australians have been given an opportunity to examine the way that continuing, and ever closer, contact with Indonesia, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, has influenced Australian English through the ever increasing number of Indonesian and Malay loan words gaining currency in Australian English. This research note documents the Dictionary's current corpus of words from Indonesian 3 and Malay which provide evidence of Australia's historical and modern links to Australia's near north. It might be noted here that Australian English is not the only language to provide evidence of links to Indonesia, since Afrikaans does as well, albeit in a historical rather than contemporary context. 4 Standard English, too, like other European languages, bears the marks of long trading and political links with Asia. The Dictionary in the introductory section to its fourth edition states that it bases its selection of words on those that have 'currency' (p. vii) in Australia as revealed by the wide ranging searches by editorial staff of published and internet Australian sources. The source material includes representative Australian texts such as CJ Koch's The Year of Living Dangerously (1978) and Blanche d'Alpuget's Turtle Beach (1981)(pp. 1652-5).

construction of Cox\u2019s Road, the fabled \u2018first\u2019 road over the Blue Mountains. But 2013 also marks fifty years since geographer Tom Perry pointed out that the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813 was not driven by the search for new land at all, but by a need for more grass for cattle and sheep. Since then many other key strands of the \u2018first crossing\u2019 legends have also been challenged or dismantled. This is why bicentenary event organisers have been careful to add the qualifiers \u2018first official/ reported/ recognised crossing of the Blue Mountains by white men\u2019.\r\nBut can we move beyond simply adding qualifiers to the old story?  What new insights have the historical, geographical and archaeological research of the last half century revealed about the crossings? Where do the legends lead us now? In this paper I want to return to the environments, animals and people of the mountains, river, ford and floodplain. What did the crossing of the Blue Mountains in 1813 and the construction of Cox\u2019s Road mean to convicts, emancipists, settlers and Aboriginal people in their own time and place?  What new light does this throw on the dynamics, culture and compass of colonial life in the 1810s and 1820s? \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39327290, "asset_id": 8119765, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1395937, "first_name": "Grace", "last_name": "Karskens", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "GraceKarskens", "display_name": "Grace Karskens", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/GraceKarskens?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1395937/505934/636077/s65_grace.karskens.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 639898, "name": "Blue Mountains history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blue_Mountains_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1554582, "name": "Cox's Road", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coxs_Road?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 35004336, "title": "Structures of Aboriginal Life at the Time of Colonisation in South Australia", "created_at": "2017-10-30T17:46:11.355-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35004336/Structures_of_Aboriginal_Life_at_the_Time_of_Colonisation_in_South_Australia?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_35004336", "summary": "What does the historical record tell us about the structures of Aboriginal life at the time lands that came to be known as South Australia were colonised? Colonisation refers to the process whereby the British Crown made claim to these lands and then occupied them. The South Australia Act passed through the British Parliament in 1834, enabling this formal act of possession of the region. King William IV issued the Letters Patent in 1836 which defined the territory of South Australia and proclaimed it a colony. A few months later Governor John Hindmarsh arrived at Holdfast Bay to administer the colony. Until the arrival of Hindmarsh's party no Aboriginal people in the colony were aware of the decisions made on the other side of the globe that would disrupt and undermine their lives, cause high rates of illness and death and dispossess them of their lands. In this chapter I investigate how our current knowledge of Aboriginal South Australia has been formed. Our understanding of the structures of Aboriginal society is influenced by the observations of early colonists and later anthropologists, all of whom grappled with how to conceptualise and describe these Aboriginal groupings. I discuss the distribution of Aboriginal people across what was to become South Australia and how cultural, social, political and linguistic groupings were influenced by a range of factors, particularly ecology and the impact it had on availability of resources. 1 There have been two broad approaches to describing the distribution of Aboriginal people: a regional perspective influenced by ecology; and one that rigidly defines tribal groups with clearly defined territories, languages and cultures. A regional approach describes hunter-gatherers living within one of five ecological zones before the colonisation of South Australia: 3", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54868620, "asset_id": 35004336, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2527464, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Monaghan", "domain_name": "adelaide", "page_name": "PaulMonaghan", "display_name": "Paul Monaghan", "profile_url": "https://adelaide.academia.edu/PaulMonaghan?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2527464/787612/47321978/s65_paul.monaghan.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5570, "name": "Australian Indigenous languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_languages?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 279173, "name": "Australian Aboriginal Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_Languages?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1346873, "name": "Aborginal Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aborginal_Australia?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 37170867, "title": "The Making of a Blackbirding Captain: Joseph Vos in the Pacific, 1875 to 1885.", "created_at": "2018-08-02T13:20:49.354-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37170867/The_Making_of_a_Blackbirding_Captain_Joseph_Vos_in_the_Pacific_1875_to_1885?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_37170867", "summary": "Despite the extensive literature on the Queensland labour trade, little has been written about recruiting shipmasters. As a class, assumptions are made about their character, motivations for entering the trade, and their complicity with the illegality frequently associated with recruiting. The academic literature often focuses on agency in the initial recruitment event, where shipmasters generally were not present. Popular writing concentrates on the scandals. Recruiting shipmasters are either ignored or suffer the odium associated with the trade. They are portrayed as immoral drunkards, incompetent seamen at the end of their careers, lawless adventurers, or men of inferior character. This study examines the early life and career of one notorious recruiting shipmaster, Joseph Vos, focusing in particular on his first three formative recruiting voyages. It suggests that the motivations, experiences and characters of recruiting shipmasters are more disparate and nuanced than generally portrayed. It demonstrates that the reputation of the labour trade has tended to obscure the diverse attributes of the shipmasters involved, indicating potential fruitful fields for further research.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62517899, "asset_id": 37170867, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27833140, "first_name": "Robert", "last_name": "Clifton-Steele", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RobertCliftonSteele", "display_name": "Robert L Clifton-Steele", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RobertCliftonSteele?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27833140/20182585/19917330/s65_robert.clifton-steele.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68567, "name": "Queensland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 838079, "name": "New Hebrides", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Hebrides?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1797891, "name": "Blackbirding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blackbirding?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1853447, "name": "Pacific labour recruiting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_labour_recruiting?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2111936, "name": "Colonial history of Pacific Islands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_history_of_Pacific_Islands?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 3384095, "name": "Royal Navy Australian Station", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Royal_Navy_Australian_Station?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 59391086, "title": "Mapping Frontier War on the Sunshine Coast/ Noosa Region", "created_at": "2021-10-21T15:51:54.518-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/59391086/Mapping_Frontier_War_on_the_Sunshine_Coast_Noosa_Region?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_59391086", "summary": "A report for the Sunshine Coast Reconciliation Group This work is a preliminary summary of places associated with conflicts involving wounding or deaths of the invaded and the invaders during the Frontier Wars in the region now known as the Sunshine Coast and Noosa Shires.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73337987, "asset_id": 59391086, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12107330, "first_name": "ray", "last_name": "kerkhove", "domain_name": "usq", "page_name": "raykerkhove", "display_name": "ray kerkhove", "profile_url": "https://usq.academia.edu/raykerkhove?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12107330/3473744/68319068/s65_ray.kerkhove.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2795, "name": "Landscape Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187034, "name": "Australian Aboriginal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1450812, "name": "Australian Frontier Wars", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Frontier_Wars?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 31855798, "title": "Australia - A Hegemonic Power in the Pacific Region.", "created_at": "2017-03-14T01:47:36.587-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31855798/Australia_A_Hegemonic_Power_in_the_Pacific_Region?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_31855798", "summary": "ABSTRACT\n\u201cThe Australian colonies displayed expansionist tendencies almost from the beginning\u201d is a pointed\nstatement, and there is evidence that Australia exerted its influence on and expanded its spheres of\ninterest to neighbouring territories in Melanesia and in the Pacific region as a whole almost from\nthe beginning of its existence.

While successful grain production took several years to establish, developing processes which efficiently and economically milled local and imported wheat and oats into flour remained a problem for far longer.  The adaptation of European technologies to the alien Australian environment, a limited pool of skilled labour, as well as the peculiarities of a largely unfree convict workforce, added to the complications and in many cases attempts to engage in milling proved unsuccessful. \nThis thesis explores the efforts of one colonial entrepreneur, John Lucas, to establish two watermills on the Georges and Woronora Rivers south of Sydney during the 1820s. Although the broad pattern of the history of Lucas and his mills is known, there has not been a detailed study of this colonial enterprise or the operations of these industrial sites. This study aims to understand how the two mills, separated by a considerable distance, functioned as a single economic unit integrating with Lucas' broader mercantile interests.  It will consider the issues of technological transfer and environmental adaptation, as well the role and efficiency of a predominantly convict industrial labour force.  It will also consider the environmental, technological and commercial reasons for the decline and collapse of the milling operations. \nLucas\u2019 Brisbane and Woronora Mills were recently located by the author in the Georges River basin, south of Sydney.

This investigation provides a close historical analysis of the construction of a romantic myth of a Kelly-led republic in much popular Australian history. It systematically reviews the arguments advanced to support the narrative, and demonstrates that they are contradicted at every point by documented historical evidence. Kelly sympathisers were concerned with allegedly wronged relatives demanding justice from the system, together with land security, but never with the system\u2019s overthrow. At no point in the entire Kelly outbreak down to his execution did Kelly concern himself with a republic or political change. It concludes that the \u201cKelly republic\u201d has become Australia\u2019s most extraordinary - if accidental - history hoax.\nThis free A4 PDF book is also available from http://www.ironicon.com.au/ned-kelly-republic-myth.htm", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56958454, "asset_id": 37009028, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 86900922, "first_name": "Stuart", "last_name": "Dawson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "StuartDawson1", "display_name": "Stuart Dawson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/StuartDawson1?f_ri=60115", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 112720, "name": "Ned Kelly", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ned_Kelly?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2168767, "title": "The Life & Legacy of William E.

However, it was the wood-engraved pictures reproduced in colonial Australia\u2019s lively illustrated press, especially in Sydney, that both dominated its visual culture between 1850 and 1900 and influenced these Victorian artists. By giving greater prominence to Sydney\u2019s artist-illustrators what emerges into clear view is an Australia-wide art movement defined not only by its racialized, masculinist, and triumphalist settler iconography but by its continuing reliance on Britain\u2019s imperial art-world for its art-workers and aesthetic direction as well. It nevertheless took an American-inspired enterprise\u2014The Picturesque Atlas of Australasia\u2014to help catalyse this movement\u2019s coming of age in the mid-1880s. Between the exodus of Australia\u2019s leading settler-colonial artists to London around 1900 and their return to these shores after the First World War, the locus of their movement oscillated between Sydney and the Chelsea Arts Club. A century later their vision of a White Australia remains attractive to many art lovers, a conundrum for those seeking to hasten Australia\u2019s stubbornly slow transition to a truly post-colonial society.

This paper starts from this premise, focusing on how elites have deployed metaphors of water and waste to form a rhetorical consensus around the displacement of non-elite citizens in ancient Roman contexts, with reference to similar discourses in the contemporary Global North and Brazil. The notion of 'domestic displacement'-the forced movement of citizens within their own sovereign territory-elucidates how these metaphors were used by elite citizens, such as Cicero, to mark out non-elite citizens for removal from the city of Rome through colonisation programmes. In the elite discourse of the late Republican and early Augustan periods, physical proximity to and figurative equation with the refuse of the city repeatedly signals the low social and legal status of potential colonists, while a corresponding metaphor of 'draining' expresses the elite desire to displace these groups to colonial sites. The material outcome of these metaphors emerges in the non-elite demographic texture of Julius Caesar's colonists, many of whom were drawn from the plebs urbana and freedmen. An elite rationale, detectable in the writings of Cicero, Livy, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and others, underpins the notion of Roman colonisation as a mechanism of displacement. On this view, the colony served to alleviate the founding city-Rome-of its surplus population, politically volatile elements, and socially marginalised citizens, and in so doing, populate the margins of its empire too. Romulus' asylum, read anew as an Alban colony, serves as one prototype for this model of colonisation and offers a contrast to recent readings that have deployed the asylum as an ethical example for contemporary immigration and asylum seeker policy. The invocation of Romulus' asylum in 19th century debates about the Australian penal colonies further illustrates the dangers of appropriating the asylum towards an ethics of virtue. At its core, this paper drills down into the question of Roman colonists' volition, considering the evidence for their voluntary and involuntary movement to a colonial site and challenging the current understanding of this movement as a straightforward, series of voluntary 'mass migrations'. In recognising the agency wielded by non-elite citizens as prospective colonists, this paper contends that Roman colonisation, when understood as a form of domestic displacement, opens up another avenue for coming to grips with the dynamics of 'popular' politics in the Republican period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58760807, "asset_id": 38679602, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 390277, "first_name": "Evan", "last_name": "Jewell", "domain_name": "rutgers", "page_name": "EvanJewell", "display_name": "Evan Jewell", "profile_url": "https://rutgers.academia.edu/EvanJewell?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/390277/98336/106187399/s65_evan.jewell.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 829, "name": "Roman History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11712, "name": "Metaphor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Metaphor?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13314, "name": "Cicero", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cicero?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22455, "name": "Asylum seekers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asylum_seekers?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 22599, "name": "Classical Reception Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Reception_Studies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 36008, "name": "Internal Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_Displacement?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 92826, "name": "Greek and Roman Colonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greek_and_Roman_Colonization?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 104311, "name": "Julius Caesar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Julius_Caesar?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 247665, "name": "Roman colonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_colonization?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 517073, "name": "migration in the Roman world", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/migration_in_the_Roman_world?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 972828, "name": "Roman Colonies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roman_Colonies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 990392, "name": "Romulus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romulus?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 37193796, "title": "The 'Sidney Slaughter House': Convict experience of medical care at the General 'Rum' Hospital, Sydney 1816-1848", "created_at": "2018-08-06T23:34:49.378-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37193796/The_Sidney_Slaughter_House_Convict_experience_of_medical_care_at_the_General_Rum_Hospital_Sydney_1816_1848?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_37193796", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57144970, "asset_id": 37193796, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29920993, "first_name": "Fiona", "last_name": "Starr", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "FionaStarr", "display_name": "Fiona Starr", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/FionaStarr?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29920993/11577689/12911695/s65_fiona.starr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2273, "name": "History of Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Medicine?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

This article challenges this notion by presenting evidence that the newcomers actively utilised native foods. \nThe early colonists did seek to find out about Eora food sources and practices, and rather than clinging to English foodways in ignorance of indigenous resources, there was much experimentation and consumption of local produce. Until introduced foods were successfully produced and in good supply in the colony, indigenous foods played an important role in the diets of many individuals, and were used by the authorities to supplement official rations when salt provisions were in short supply.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35573262, "asset_id": 9313305, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3468788, "first_name": "jacqueline", "last_name": "newling", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "jacquelinenewling", "display_name": "jacqueline newling", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/jacquelinenewling?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3468788/60350691/48610435/s65_jacqueline.newling.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52254, "name": "Foodways", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foodways?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35472081, "title": "The homestead as fortress: fact or folklore", "created_at": "2017-12-19T17:45:49.400-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35472081/The_homestead_as_fortress_fact_or_folklore?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_35472081", "summary": "The construction of the Cambridge Downs homestead, built between 1876 and 1877 on the Stawell River in central north Queensland, has long been thought unusual for the region. Local folklore suggests that it was intentionally fortified as protection against Aboriginal attack and a 2009 replica of the homestead in the main street of Richmond presents this story as a central part of the region\u2019s history. A survey of the structure, however, reveals a building that is atypical but not necessarily fortified. Archaeological and architectural studies of supposedly fortified structures elsewhere are similarly equivocal. We argue that such accounts are part of a long tradition of representing Aboriginal people as a threat. The attacks that such architecture is intended to deter are on domestic spaces, and often on the sacrosanct spaces of family, women and children. As such, they enhance visions of \u2018ordinary\u2019 people as battlers and are automatically cast in terms of choices that are defensive rather than offensive. While fear was a very real experience on the frontier (on both sides), uncritical acceptance of accounts of fortified structures obscures the complexity of the frontier in the past and prevents us from seeing the ways in which such claims are being used to remember or forget the consequences of the frontier in the present.

He arrived in Cooktown during the Palmer River gold rush, when the frontier wars were at their height, and remained there during the period of consolidation of colonial rule, until his death in 1921. Cooktown is now a small and apparently insignificant township, but in the late nineteenth century it represented a key strategic outpost for Queensland\u2019s colonial government, for commerce and trade, and for natural science. E.A.C. Olive shaped his life around the opportunities provided by his location on the northern frontier: he made his fortune as a supplier of goods to miners and government officials during the initial invasion of Cape York Peninsula, held the influential administrative position of Shire Clerk for 36 years, built a thriving domestic economy on the use of Aboriginal labour, and was a prominent naturalist. In all of these spheres of activity, Olive and his family were dependent on Aboriginal people. Olive\u2019s wealth was based on the colonial government\u2019s forcible annexation of land, and consolidated through the use of Aboriginal labour, while his contributions to natural science owe much to the knowledge and skills of his Aboriginal guides, Billy and Sammy Olive. Since its founding, Cooktown has defined itself as a non-Aboriginal space, and emphasised the effort and enterprise of its immigrant \u2018pioneers\u2019 (mostly white, but also Chinese). This study of E.A.C. Olive contributes to dismantling that myth \u2013 a version of terra nullius \u2013 by demonstrating instead the ongoing dependence of Cooktown and its inhabitants on Aboriginal land and labour. \n\nBelinda McKay, \u2018Constructing a Life on the Northern Frontier: E.A.C.

Starting from humble beginnings these industrialists used assigned convicts and former convicts almost exclusively to staff their various enterprises.  \nWhile Tasmanian convict records are well preserved in NSW few individual convict records have survived. It was reported by Walsh (2007 p11) that most of the records of the office of the Principal Superintendent of Convicts (NSW) were destroyed in 1882. Thus, landmark studies of Australian convicts, such as those of Walsh, were based largely on generic records for NSW convicts such as shipping indents, Ticket of Leave records, musters, census and various aggregated returns on secondary punishment. These same record sources have been used to firstly identify the convicts of industrialists John Lucas and Simeon Lord and then to compare their characteristics and behaviour.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86804675, "asset_id": 80415013, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4689555, "first_name": "Greg", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "GregJackson", "display_name": "Greg  Jackson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/GregJackson?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4689555/2006394/2367133/s65_greg.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 127025, "name": "Convict labor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_labor?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 674845, "name": "Watermills", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Watermills?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 695687, "name": "Convicts, New South Wales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts_New_South_Wales?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 967825, "name": "Georges River", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georges_River?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 967830, "name": "John Lucas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Lucas?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 968974, "name": "Convict History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convict_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2367577, "name": "Australian Convict Sites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Convict_Sites?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2444814, "name": "Australian Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Convicts?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2567807, "name": "Industrial convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Industrial_convicts?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2611317, "name": "Simeon Lord", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Simeon_Lord?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 3450670, "name": "convict assignment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/convict_assignment?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 12317267, "title": "Clunes 1873 \u2013 The Uprising that Wasn\u2019t", "created_at": "2015-05-10T05:54:30.658-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12317267/Clunes_1873_The_Uprising_that_Wasn_t?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_12317267", "summary": "The article investigates afresh the circumstances surrounding the \"anti-Chinese uprising\" in the Australian Goldfields town of Clunes in 1873.  \r\nBeginning with historical interpretations of events, it notes that scholars have heavily relied on one colonial newspaper report as their primary source (some scholars use two other sources, but many use only this single document).\r\nThe article then points that there are several primary sources which have never been cited or used by historians; and identifies 5 key overlapping documents.  Some of these colonial sources include recorded interviews by participants taken the following day after the troubles.  It then plots out the course of events as shown by all corroborating sources - and it is surprising to find there was no wild mass uprising, the troubles seeming to comprise of a rowdy 20 minute confrontation halted by police.\r\nThe article then surveys contemporaneous newspaper reports of the day at Clunes, showing the different viewpoints and perspectives taken by colonial publications according to political disposition.  It also plots how accounts were changed, dramatised and embellished as news travelled from country to city, and from newspaper to newspaper across the colonies.  \r\nThe article finishes by posing serious questions on how accounts in historical newspapers need to be more carefully cross-checked and contextualised to verify reported \"news\".\r\npp10.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

In doing so, the thesis integrates Western Australia into broader Australian historical debates about convict labour management, the treatment of secondary offenders, the after-effects of the convict voyage, and the health impacts of physical and psychological punishments.

draft paper explores the prevalence of landscape narratives in art and cinema containing post-apocalyptic futures, bushranger mythology and vigilantism, with a focus on the type of masculinity reflected within these contexts. I will introduce the kind of masculinity that is attributed to Australian men as part of a national myth of character, and will examine various dystopic film narratives, such as Mad Max 2 (1981) and its recent counterpart The Rover (2014). In other words, I am drawn to narratives that feature a decline of civilisation, are set in an expansive Australian landscape, and often contain troubled male protagonists. I wish to demonstrate that this landscape, and its history of violence, hostility and suffering, feeds into post-colonial representations of reworked historical narratives and characters. Here, I link the American frontier to Australian representations of the fringe of white settlement via film theorist David Melbye's theory on landscape allegory. I also present creative works of my own that were produced in relation to these ideas, and use them to explore male characters not only as a facet of Australian cultural identity, but also in relation to wider concerns of masculinity and nature. I conclude with a discussion about Australian artists of my generation who are also tackling the issue of 'Aussie' masculinity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50695903, "asset_id": 30234150, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 526550, "first_name": "David Ashley", "last_name": "Kerr", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "DavidAshleyKerr", "display_name": "David Ashley Kerr", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/DavidAshleyKerr?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/526550/186464/106529233/s65_d._a..kerr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2865, "name": "Masculinity Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinity_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20624, "name": "Dystopian Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dystopian_Fiction?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36906, "name": "Masculinity and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinity_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 66305, "name": "Landscape narratives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_narratives?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 84033, "name": "Road Movies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Road_Movies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 88503, "name": "Utopian, Dystopian, and Post-Apocalyptic Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Utopian_Dystopian_and_Post-Apocalyptic_Fiction?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 114059, "name": "Dystopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dystopia?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 124376, "name": "Australian Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Cinema?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 443162, "name": "Australian Contemporary Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Contemporary_Photography?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 478505, "name": "Dystopian Film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dystopian_Film?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 658039, "name": "Masculinity in Australian film", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masculinity_in_Australian_film?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 742656, "name": "Art History, Post Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History_Post_Colonialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1043908, "name": "Australian Legend Masculinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Legend_Masculinity?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1538817, "name": "Australian bushrangers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_bushrangers?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1576085, "name": "The Australian New Wave", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Australian_New_Wave?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1948121, "name": "Mad Max", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mad_Max?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 17184470, "title": "The Queensland Shearers' Strikes in Rosa Praed's Fiction", "created_at": "2015-10-22T21:28:33.831-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17184470/The_Queensland_Shearers_Strikes_in_Rosa_Praeds_Fiction?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_17184470", "summary": "Novelist Rosa Praed's portrayal of colonial Queensland in her fiction was influenced by her social position as the daughter of a squatter and conservative Cabinet Minister, Thomas Lodge Murray-Prior, and limited by the fact that she lived in Australia for less than one-third of her life.

Before they were taken to the island, the dingoes were implanted with a poison capsule that was intended to kill them after they had killed the goats; they were both pest and 'pesticide' (Mavhunga 2011). Subsequently, freehold land on the island was marketed as a tourism development site. We contextualise the Pelorus Island goat eradication program within the cultural-political history of carceral colonialism in Australia and show how this experiment relates to ideas about the special role that islands play in conservation. We also piece together the story of what happened to the goats and dingoes involved. Our analysis reveals the ways notions of animal pesthood and ecological restoration are co-opted by conservation and tourism interests. The Pelorus experiment illustrates how illusions of idyllic island sanctuaries, which appeal to contemporary tourism tropes of seclusion within a 'pristine' environment, are predicated on the violence inherent to, but obfuscated within, settler-colonialist visions of land for the taking and remaking.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74810935, "asset_id": 61892792, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10316642, "first_name": "Rowena", "last_name": "Lennox", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "RowenaLennox", "display_name": "Rowena Lennox", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/RowenaLennox?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10316642/15977270/21972312/s65_rowena.lennox.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2467, "name": "Conservation Biology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation_Biology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2809, "name": "Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8511, "name": "Environment and natural resources conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environment_and_natural_resources_conservation?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 16323, "name": "Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolitics?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 36059, "name": "Environmentalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmentalism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 54110, "name": "Settler Colonialism & Its Legacies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonialism_and_Its_Legacies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 103708, "name": "Conservation and Restoration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conservation_and_Restoration?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 107550, "name": "Settler colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_colonialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 110388, "name": "Biopower and Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopower_and_Biopolitics?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 190402, "name": "Feral animals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feral_animals?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 247929, "name": "Necropolis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Necropolis?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 252969, "name": "Goats", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Goats?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 304144, "name": "Dingoes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dingoes?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 392175, "name": "Achille Mbembe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Achille_Mbembe?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 467994, "name": "Carceral Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carceral_Geography?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1418898, "name": "Islands and Archipelagos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islands_and_Archipelagos?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 3068353, "name": "Biopolitics/Necropolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolitics_Necropolitics?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 57039606, "title": "Promise and Protection: New Guinea Villagers and the Role of Christianity During the Pacific War", "created_at": "2021-10-10T18:37:13.167-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/57039606/Promise_and_Protection_New_Guinea_Villagers_and_the_Role_of_Christianity_During_the_Pacific_War?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_57039606", "summary": "Published as: Christine Winter, Promise and protection: New Guinea Villagers and the Role of Christianity during the Pacific War, Yasuko Hassall Kobayashi, Shinnosuke Takahashi (Eds.), Transpacific Visions: Connected Histories of the Pacific across North and South, Lexington Books, pp. 21-46 September 2021\n\nThis chapter examines New Guinea villages during the Pacific War through documents written by New Guineans themselves during and shortly after the war.\nDuring the Pacific War, Christianity and village life changed. The local leadership took over visitations, schooling, and church services in the absence of missionaries. A strategic and fundamental declaration of unity tried to counter fragmentations and infighting brought about by war and occupation. In particular, armed militia and indentured laborers, unable to make their way home, were incorporated into a subsistence agriculture and sheltered under condition of observing village culture and rules. Christianity here played an important part in reintegrating men who had been working and living outside of the region, and in controlling the importation of magic and outside customs.\n\tFor members of the Allied and Japanese armies, different modes of dealings applied. Villages attempted to keep these strangers outside the villages as much as possible and protect their gardens from plunder by trading or even strategically feeding dislocated, hungry soldiers, especially during the last phase of the war.\nChristianity on a local level was an identifier and self-proclaimed identity that keep the villages united internally and safe externally, and it was up to the incoming armies to connect with that lived reality of the villages. What K. E. Read identified as a desire for self-determination, and Hogbin summarized as an attitude of neutrality, was part of a confidence in the promise that as Christian communities they would deserve and demand respect.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 72130210, "asset_id": 57039606, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23160563, "first_name":

is a case study reflecting on a nonfiction author\u2019s methodology for developing credible fictional characters in a\nhistorical novel. In writing the artifact that became A respectable married woman (2012), Banks placed great weight on finding\nthe \u2018fictional truth\u2019 of the characters populating the story. Borrowing from the genre of historiographic metafiction\n(Hutcheon 1988) and the notion of a journalist\u2019s \u2018toolbox\u2019 (Banks & Andrew 2012), Banks\u2019s challenge was to create \u2018authentic\u2019\n\u2018whole person\u2019 characters informed by historical artifacts as well as contemporary understandings such as the practice-led\ntheories of Kundera (2003). This study describes and exemplifies how Banks strove for \u2018authenticity\u2019 in a bid to do justice to\nthe \u2018herstory\u2019 of the challenges and achievements of the women of Victoria\u2019s mid- 19th century goldfields. Drawing on insights\nfrom a variety of sources, this paper proposes one practitioner\u2019s experience of creating historical identities. The study\nemphasizes the need to write credible oral language and idiom and examines the centrality of backstories. Such backstories\nimpact readers\u2019 expectations about how potentially stock \u2018characters\u2019 develop into more authentic \u2018selves\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38672241, "asset_id": 15409951, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34554584, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Andrew", "domain_name": "vu", "page_name": "MartinAndrew", "display_name": "Martin Andrew", "profile_url": "https://vu.academia.edu/MartinAndrew?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34554584/13797882/14896943/s65_martin.andrew.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1, "name": "Creative Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Writing?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7819, "name": "Practitioner Inquiry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Practitioner_Inquiry?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21955, "name": "Historiographic Metafiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiographic_Metafiction?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 206830, "name": "English Literature: Postmodernism, Metafiction, Historiographic Metafiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature_Postmodernism_Metafiction_Historiographic_Metafiction?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 219198, "name": "Practice-led research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Practice-led_research?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 811617, "title": "Girard's Wharf", "created_at": "2011-08-07T09:34:32.865-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/811617/Girards_Wharf?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_811617", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79454995, "asset_id": 811617, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 360289, "first_name": "Kirsty", "last_name": "Harris", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KirstyHarris1", "display_name": "Kirsty  Harris", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KirstyHarris1?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/360289/95445/791627/s65_kirsty.harris.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 965001, "name": "Francois Girard", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Francois_Girard?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 965003, "name": "Francis Girard", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Francis_Girard?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 965005, "name": "Colonial Shipping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Shipping?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 965006, "name": "Cedar Logging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cedar_Logging?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 965008, "name": "Sydney Wharfs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sydney_Wharfs?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 50773331, "title": "Review of 'The Personal History of William Buckley: Murrangurk Amongst the First People'", "created_at": "2021-08-06T20:16:25.172-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50773331/Review_of_The_Personal_History_of_William_Buckley_Murrangurk_Amongst_the_First_People?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_50773331", "summary": "Review of 'The Personal History of William Buckley: Murrangurk Amongst the First People'.

It was built as part of Robert Campbell's Duntroon Estate and was an attempt to replicate a late Georgian-style workers cottage. First constructed in the 1850s, it established the status of Campbell's head ploughman above the other agricultural workers on the estate. Nevertheless, the cottage's rooms remained multifunctional. When the Blundell family occupied the cottage later in the 19th century, they changed the appearance of the cottage, creating a complex where social hospitality could be promoted at the front with agricultural activities continuing at the rear. Successive occupants perpetuated this appearance of a comfortable, gentrified smallholding. Recent survey of the stratigraphy has analysed and interpreted the materials, craftwork and spaces to provide new insights into the social archaeology of an important pastoral complex that pre-dated the establishment of the nation's capital.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62117412, "asset_id": 41993571, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 474427, "first_name": "Ash", "last_name": "Lenton", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "AshLenton", "display_name": "Ash Lenton", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/AshLenton?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/474427/160526/8747022/s65_ash.lenton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45999, "name": "Australian archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 3817560, "title": "The Watermills of John Lucas: The Brisbane Mill", "created_at": "2013-06-29T13:34:53.697-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3817560/The_Watermills_of_John_Lucas_The_Brisbane_Mill?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_3817560", "summary": "The archaeology of the Brisbane watermill built by John Lucas in 1822 south of Sydney on Williams Creek, a tributary of the Georges River", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31470358, "asset_id": 3817560, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4689555, "first_name": "Greg", "last_name": "Jackson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "GregJackson", "display_name": "Greg  Jackson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/GregJackson?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4689555/2006394/2367133/s65_greg.jackson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 674845, "name": "Watermills", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Watermills?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 967825, "name": "Georges River", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georges_River?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 967830, "name": "John Lucas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_Lucas?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1110966, "name": "Williams Creek", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Williams_Creek?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1232791, "name": "Brisbane Mill", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brisbane_Mill?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 42335334, "title": "Dante and His Influence in Australia", "created_at": "2020-03-26T18:27:14.350-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42335334/Dante_and_His_Influence_in_Australia?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_42335334", "summary": "This paper was written for the first global Dante Day commemorated on 25 March 2020 in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been published online by the Dante Alighieri Society Canberra. Dante Alighieri is a household name in Australia, but what has been his influence here and how did he make the voyage to Australia's \"altro polo\"? The history and presence of Italian literature in English literature is outlined, as are the presence of Dante Alighieri's works in Australian literature and art. Dante Alighieri Societies and the Italian diplomatic corps have been active promoters of Dante's work and Italian literature and culture generally in Australia. However it can be concluded that, at least in the past, Dante's influence on Italian Australians has been slight. The historical reasons and factors underlying this contradiction are explored. Moreover the question of the potential relevance of Dante to Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is also considered. Dante Day is considered in the context of the meaning that might be attributed to Dante in the context of Italy's diverse history and culture. Dorothea Mackellar, famous for her poet \"My Country\", dedicated to Australia, is recruited as Beatrice for the paper.

"In recent years aural history has received increasing attention from colonial scholars around the globe. Though much of this interest has manifested itself in the US and Europe, Australian colonial historians have begun to recognise that colonists in Australia placed great importance on both the acoustic, as well as the visual sense as a means of interpreting and evaluating their world. This article seeks to contribute to the growing body of acoustic colonial literature by exploring how early colonists in Australia c. 1778-1792 used sounds, noises and silences during their colonial endeavour. It argues that the aural sense was directly linked to notions of identity, class and race, and that sound and noise formed an integral part of ceremonies of possession, and operated as a powerful means of ordering society and maintaining law.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37851766, "asset_id": 12853931, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14662598, "first_name": "Lachlan", "last_name": "Dudley", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "lachlandudley", "display_name": "Lachlan  Dudley", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/lachlandudley?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14662598/6823242/10835488/s65_lachlan.dudley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59608, "name": "Sensory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensory_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 8214413, "title": "Finding Forrester (History Scotland Version Parts 1 & 2)", "created_at": "2014-09-05T18:37:49.981-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8214413/Finding_Forrester_History_Scotland_Version_Parts_1_and_2_?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_8214413", "summary": "Joseph Forrester, a Scot born in 1805, worked with his brother as a silversmith in London during the late 1820s. In 1829 he was caught stealing diamonds, was sentenced to death, but transported for Life to Van Diemen\u2019s Land. He was assigned to David Barclay, a Hobart watchmaker and jeweller, and developed a reputation for the most competent silversmith in the colony for a number of years. On being granted a Conditional Pardon he married, established his own business, and for several years seems to have enjoyed a degree of success. Hostility towards ex-convicts in Van Diemen\u2019s Land and growing business prospects in Melbourne saw him move to Melbourne in 1847 where he undertook commissions for a number of retailers including Charles Brentani. In 1848 his wife died in suspicious circumstances, although an inquest found she died through drowning in the Yarra River. Forrester then married Ann Willis who ran a pawnbroking shop. She died soon afterwards and he went into a brief watchmaking and jewellery partnership before deciding to return to Scotland. Arriving in London he was informed by his sister that, after 26 years, his relatives would not welcome him home. He caught the next ship back to Melbourne where he moved to the country and eventually died a lonely and forgotten death. His early silverwork sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars today and has been written about in Art Gallery and Antiques journals.

It does this through a highly focussed and localised study of the settlement of Ringwood and surrounds, taking as its starting point a selection of historical photographs, paintings, and objects drawn from the collections of the Ringwood and District Historical Society and Maroondah City Council. These historical artefacts are accompanied by contemporary artworks by Fernando do Campo, Tom Nicholson, Rose Nolan, Raquel Ormella, and Zo\u00eb Sadokierski & Kate Sweetapple, strategically deployed to disrupt and reorient the celebratory narrative of placemaking and community building conveyed in the historical objects, so that they may be read instead as a chronicle of colonisation, recorded through imperial systems of data collection, organisation, and representation.\n\nIn this way CIVICS is a settler story, retold in hindsight, by subjects conscious of their complicity in the ongoing colonisation of Australia. Objects and events in Ringwood\u2019s history, central to the exhibition\u2019s narrative, become emblematic of Australia\u2019s history and of settler placemaking across the country. Key to this narrative is the proclamation of Ringwood as a city by the Governor of Victoria, Sir Dallas Brooks, in 1960. This defining moment in the making of Ringwood is understood as part of a larger story of pivotal proclamations that have constituted civic standing, both locally and federally.\n\nCIVICS also looks at documents and systems that have quantified and qualified the inhabitants of Ringwood since settlement, and served to consolidate a contingent citizenry. Landholder registers, voters\u2019 rolls, charts of vaccinated children, and demographic profiles have catalogued the area\u2019s human inhabitants, while its plants, birds, and animals have been identified, named, and assessed according to their perceived value by experts and enthusiasts alike.

In Aboriginal hands, fire made the entire country \u2018beautiful and comfortable\u2019, and so Australia was one vast \u2018estate\u2019, a giant \u2018park\u2019, a series of \u2018farms without fences\u2019. These words imply that Aboriginal rights to land are closely tied to universal fire regimes. Gammage\u2019s book has been well-received and celebrated. But it has also polarised debates on fire regimes, especially the extent to which fire really did shape every corner of the continent, and the related assertion that contemporary ecologies are the result of the cessation of fire since 1788. \nThis paper integrates ethnographic history and archaeology with geography, soil science and ecology in order to set Gammage\u2019s model against a particular ecological zone \u2013 the dense River-flat Forests that once lined Dyarubbin, the Hawkesbury-Nepean River in New South Wales, Australia. Dyarubbin was occupied by Aboriginal people for perhaps 50,000 years, and from 1794 it became the site of the first major settler farming frontier.  Paying attention to the local and the particular, this paper asks: was this fiercely contested country a tidy mosaic of open forests, water and grasslands created by cultural fire?  Was Aboriginal burning here extensive or limited? What aspects of human and ecological history might be obscured by the universalising model in which cultural fire dominates above all other factors? Did the Aboriginal landscape in turn shape the settler one, and what were the consequences for land and people? \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67853607, "asset_id": 36643310, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1395937, "first_name": "Grace", "last_name": "Karskens", "domain_name": "unsw", "page_name": "GraceKarskens", "display_name": "Grace Karskens", "profile_url": "https://unsw.academia.edu/GraceKarskens?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1395937/505934/636077/s65_grace.karskens.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5499, "name": "Fire Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fire_Ecology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19673, "name": "River Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/River_Ecology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24661, "name": "Aboriginal History in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_History_in_Australia?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2955219, "name": "River Flat Forest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/River_Flat_Forest?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 71940325, "title": "Review of Hilary M.

From the early 19th century, surplus yams were traded to Europeans operating in a regional economy, but the Assistant Resident Magistrates (ARMs) of the Australian government of colonial Papua in charge of the islands overlooked this industry in favour of copra, a global commodity. Beginning with a wholesale planting campaign in the 1910s and continuing with a \u2018native plantation scheme\u2019 in the 1920s, the ARMS exhorted Trobrianders to take time away from their beloved gardens to plant and tend coconut trees. Traces of resistance to this overzealous project come mainly through the voice and actions of Paramount Chief To\u2019uluwa of Omarakana, as recorded by the ARMs in patrol reports and station journals. The colonial vision of a copra-based link to the global economy was dimmed by a fall in commodity prices in the mid 1920s, whilst the regional yam trade persisted for decades more. Hence the indigenous yam prevailed over the colonial coconut in a symbolic struggle for primacy in the islands, and the yam remains a symbol of a vibrant traditional Trobriand culture to this day.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57648874, "asset_id": 37661046, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3053844, "first_name": "Andrew", "last_name": "Connelly", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "AndrewConnelly", "display_name": "Andrew Connelly", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/AndrewConnelly?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3053844/1004078/1255645/s65_andrew.connelly.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

Ironically, this insidious imperial myth that China would overrun the West owed its genesis to the impact of European, and particularly British imperial activity, on China in the late-nineteenth century, rather than to any expansionary Chinese aims or activity. The western impact was bi-faceted, involving both the physical incursion of westerners into China, and the related movement of Chinese people overseas to work in western nations and colonies. Under the international coerced labour phenomenon known as the \u201ccoolie trade,\u201d Chinese people were brought across the British Empire as far as the settler colonies of Australia and South Africa, and even to the plantations of the British West Indies. Despite the relative powerlessness of their position as indentured or indebted immigrants, they were inevitably perceived as hostile aliens who threatened \"white\" society. This essay examines the impact of Australian anti-Chinese sentiment on representations of Chinese people in the works of Guy Boothby, an Adelaide-born author who emigrated to London in 1893. It explores Boothby\u2019s representations of Chinese people in the imperial spaces of Britain\u2019s Australian and Southeast Asian colonies, and also in the informal imperial spaces of contact in \u201cforeign\u201d China, in the cities and coastal locations where the British Empire was making its presence and influence felt, in works including Boothby\u2019s travelogue, On the Wallaby (1894), the Dr Nikola series of novels (1895-1901), \u201cThe Story of Lee Ping\u201d (1895), The Beautiful White Devil (1896) and My Strangest Case (1901). It argues that these superficially disinterested but consistently derogatory representations of the far-flung Chinese contributed to the deplorable international myth of the yellow peril, but also could not help revealing the important and largely overlooked presence of the Chinese in the spaces of the British Empire, demonstrating the impact of the coolie trade on imperial society and signalling the multifaceted nature of the British Empire\u2019s involvement with China.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38431456, "asset_id": 14815125, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2761090, "first_name": "Ailise", "last_name": "Bulfin", "domain_name": "ucd", "page_name": "AiliseBulfin", "display_name": "Ailise Bulfin", "profile_url": "https://ucd.academia.edu/AiliseBulfin?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2761090/897623/6620129/s65_ailise.bulfin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1305, "name": "Victorian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2858, "name": "Popular Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Culture?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7299, "name": "Victorian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Literature?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11858, "name": "Popular Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Fiction?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 20631, "name": "Popular Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Literature?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 33152, "name": "Late Imperial-Modern China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Late_Imperial-Modern_China?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 56908, "name": "Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 78562, "name": "Victorian popular fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_popular_fiction?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 132924, "name": "Modern China (especially late Qing and Republican history)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_China_especially_late_Qing_and_Republican_history_?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 220596, "name": "Yellow Peril", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yellow_Peril?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 392801, "name": "Qing imperial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qing_imperial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 440369, "name": "Guy Boothby", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Guy_Boothby?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 582190, "name": "Imperial Adventure Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imperial_Adventure_Fiction?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1013234, "name": "Colonial Australian Fiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Australian_Fiction?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2036420, "name": "William Carlton Dawe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/William_Carlton_Dawe?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 70764540, "title": "I need instant death spell caster +2347015926178", "created_at": "2022-02-06T16:44:53.482-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70764540/I_need_instant_death_spell_caster_2347015926178?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_70764540", "summary": "Good new about Dr ibrahim I'm on Instagram as @i_need_death_spell_caster.

Through a focus on the criminal trial in the colony, and later, state of Victoria between 1880-1939, this dissertation explores the operation of capital punishment as a system that allowed for popular readings of madness in relation to serious interpersonal crimes. \n\nThe system of capital punishment in the Australian colonies allowed for public activism during a two-week period between conviction and execution/commutation in which organisations, groups, families and individuals could submit letters, petitions or deputations to the Premier in support or condemnation of particular prisoners on a case-by-case basis. This dissertation maps the uneven activism deployed in these cases. Insanity was increasingly used by ordinary people as a discursive tool by which to contest the death penalty, and in some cases, a means by which to protest the material circumstances that governed their lives, conditions they viewed as having led offenders to commit crimes of desperation. \n\nThis research draws upon a dataset of 215 convicted trials to examine trials of murder and sexual assault at the Melbourne Supreme Court and assizes between 1880 and 1939. The dataset reveals general trends in crime prevalence, leniency and mental impairment defences that provides the \u2018bigger picture\u2019 of the subject matter that is used to contextualise specific case studies. This study is primarily a qualitative analysis of selected criminal trials within the sample that aims to uncover doctors\u2019, lawyers\u2019 and laypersons\u2019 interactions with the new and evolving \u2018science\u2019 of psychiatry in the context of crime and criminal responsibility. The late-nineteenth century the criminal courtroom became a site of contested knowledge regarding mental states, witnessing insanity claims voiced by doctors, lawyers, judges and everyday people that were inextricably linked to ideas regarding criminality, gender, race and class. The broad-ranging representations of offenders are examined within a post-structural theoretical framework, in particular the ways in which gender informed judgments regarding mental states and culpability.\n\nChapter One outlines the operation of the criminal justice system, the origins of the field of psychiatry and the popular culture around crime that existed in the colony during the late-nineteenth century in order to contextualise the case studies that follow. Chapter Two examines how constructions of femininity heavily impacted upon trials of women who killed infants. Chapter Three investigates how insanity claims presented in trials for male-perpetrated intimate partner homicides were informed by middle-class visions for respectable masculinity between 1880 and 1914. Chapter Four considers the sizable historiography of women who committed murder (excluding infanticide) in Australia, and examines factors of femininity and class in putting forward a more nuanced and historically-grounded approach to the history of women who killed partners between 1880 and 1939. Chapter Five explores male-perpetrated intimate partner homicides between 1914 and 1939, demonstrating how factors such as service in the First World War, the economic depression and the circulation of psychoanalytic language affected constructions of masculinity and insanity at trial. Chapter Six demonstrates how contemporary understandings of sexuality, race and gender informed insanity claims in trials for sexual offences throughout the period, examining the three capital sexual offences of rape, buggery and carnal knowledge of a girl under ten alongside one another. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42631546, "first_name": "Georgina", "last_name": "Rychner", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "gryc", "display_name": "Georgina Rychner", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/gryc?f_ri=60115", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6182, "name": "History of Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Psychiatry?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13229, "name": "History Of Madness And Psychiatry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Madness_And_Psychiatry?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33614, "name": "Capital Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capital_Punishment?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49710, "name": "Infanticide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Infanticide?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55516, "name": "Sexual and Gender-Based Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_and_Gender-Based_Violence?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 128448, "name": "History of Crime and Punishment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Crime_and_Punishment?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 165813, "name": "Partial defence of provocation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Partial_defence_of_provocation?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 232654, "name": "Insanity Defense", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insanity_Defense?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 670972, "name": "Intimate Partner Homicide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intimate_Partner_Homicide?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 3817523, "title": "The Road South to the Illawarra Part 1", "created_at": "2013-06-29T13:24:50.778-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3817523/The_Road_South_to_the_Illawarra_Part_1?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_3817523", "summary": "There are three rivers between Sydney and the Illawarra, the Cooks, Georges and Woronora.

While the concept of savagery had long been understood to apply to categories of human populations deemed to be in want of more historically advanced \u2018civilisation\u2019, the application of this term in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was increasingly being correlated with the emerging terminology of racial characteristics.

Situating it in the context of South Australian nationalism, this study elucidates South Australian leadership in founding the Gallery in order to demonstrate its role in the colonial conception of an independent future. It examines the debates around the establishment, evaluating ways in which South Australians considered various artistic, theoretical and institutional ideals and sources, defined the value and purpose of a national gallery, and viewed artworks forming its founding collection. Their reception of British and colonial paintings is particularly explored to reveal colonial attitudes to the metropole, the empire\u2014the British and as a historical phenomenon\u2014and their colonised realm during the late nineteenth century. The article explains how the debates around the establishment of the National Gallery sustained a focus on art and its capacity to facilitate a community such as South Australia to develop a culture of its own and on an imagined future of South Australia as an independent state. By highlighting these aspects, which could be revealed or conceived only by considering visual art and building its institution, it argues for the role of art and the National Gallery in contemporary South Australian nationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61099569, "asset_id": 40816923, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11088535, "first_name": "Emmanuelle", "last_name": "Ha", "domain_name": "hufs", "page_name": "JeongYonHa", "display_name": "Emmanuelle Ha", "profile_url": "https://hufs.academia.edu/JeongYonHa?f_ri=60115", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15713, "name": "Victorian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Art?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35165, "name": "History of the British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_British_Empire?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 157937, "name": "19th Century British Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/19th_Century_British_Art?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 552270, "name": "South Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 636351, "name": "John William Waterhouse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/John_William_Waterhouse?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 710806, "name": "J.W.

They must take into account the memories stored in oral histories and textual sources, recognise the plurality of cultural influences and performance practices in complex networks of personal interaction, and grapple with the representational limitations of staff notation and struggle to interpret iconography before and after the age of photography. They must understand how sounds and emotions are linked to places and spaces, and explain how they move and migrate. This article offers a critical survey of existing approaches to research on musics in Australian societies from the beginning of colonisation (26 January 1788) to Federation (1 January 1901), and proposes that the increased use of a reflexive paradigm has the potential to open the historical study of Australian colonial societies to new directions. * We pay our respects to Elders past, present, and future of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples mentioned in this article and the traditional custodians of the land on which the research for the article was primarily undertaken, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation.

Roberts was then a guest of the settler-colonist Henry Hay at Collendina Station in the Riverina district of New South Wales. Half a century before, in 1841, the property had been granted by the Crown as a pastoral lease. Yet this land has never been ceded by its sovereign owners, the Bangerang people, and for this community, the land holds deep ancestral memory of connection to Country and cultural practice. Remaining in the Corowa region, on the border between New South Wales and Victoria, Roberts began work on his subsequent major painting, A Break Away!. Already celebrated in the nineteenth century as an epic history painting of Australia\u2019s pastoral industry, the story depicted is also one of dispossession and the violence of the colonial frontier since British invasion in 1788.\r\n\r\nThrough landscape painting and portraiture, the Australian impressionists (also known as the \u201cHeidelberg School\u201d) formed a persistent visual representation of the colonial project that took root in the late eighteenth century and remains ongoing today. Tom Roberts, the older and more established artist among these plein-air painters, rendered the landscape with the sturdy self-possession and assurance of a man of empire. The British-born Roberts has continued to be lionized for establishing an Australian impressionist landscape tradition through his enduring images of nationhood.5 In 1915 friend and fellow artist Arthur Streeton dedicated his own exhibition: \u201cTo Tom Roberts, from whose quick perception and expression of the principles of impressionism in 1886 sprang the first national school of painting in Australia.\u201d Roberts\u2019s narratives of nationhood\u2014both visual and literary\u2014are marked by a distinct masculinity and racial positioning. The landscape is empty of Indigenous people, reinforcing and legitimizing the colonial project in Australia as confirmation of the euphemistic \u201cdying out\u201d of the traditional owners and custodians of the land. In this contrived history of masculine \u201cwhiteness,\u201d people from the Asian diaspora working in Australia are also positioned outside the picture plane, and women are restrained by the inactivity and submissiveness of conventional portraiture.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31238448, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Kindred", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "EmmaKindred", "display_name": "Emma Kindred", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/EmmaKindred?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31238448/9207821/10266689/s65_emma.kindred.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40346, "name": "Australian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_art?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 225888, "name": "Collaboration and Representation within Indigenous Decolonising Research Methodologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collaboration_and_Representation_within_Indigenous_Decolonising_Research_Methodologies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 301992, "name": "Impressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impressionism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1019274, "name": "Nationalism and Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_and_Decolonization?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1340621, "name": "Australian impressionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_impressionism?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 3877504, "title": "Bush Bank Mill", "created_at": "2013-07-05T17:29:54.764-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3877504/Bush_Bank_Mill?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_3877504", "summary": "The Empire announced on the 26 March 1856 the immanent opening of the BushBank steam mill just south of Kiama on what was then the main road.

The Port Arthur settlement began life as a small punishment-oriented timber station in 1830 on the Tasman Peninsula and quickly grew in importance replacing Sarah and Maria islands. Additional industries were added including ship building and coal mining, both from 1834. Shipbuilding, which became an important industry, was a way of providing selected convicts with a useful skill they could use once they were freed. With the cessation of transportation to Tasmania in 1853 fewer convicts arrived at Port Arthur but the years after 1856 were the busiest time for Port Arthur shipping although the remaining convicts were getting older and less effective as workers.

The novel The Secret River helps to break the silence of the white settlers of Australia on how they have come to be so rich despite their beginnings as convicts. Kate Grenville, a non-indigenous writer of Australia wanted to rewrite history for the sake of aboriginal natives and to help them in making a chronicle of their own. This abstract traces Kate's endeavour in rewriting the dark legacy of colonialism. She grew up hearing stories about her ancestors from her mother, but now looking back at it, there was never a mention of the indigenous people in any of the family legends. When the penal colony of New South Wales was first established about two hundred years back, there were already people living in Australia, even before the colonisation of Britain. The natives are not called aborigines for no reason. It was a shock to the system that the mysterious disappearance of the aboriginal people had been kept silent in history. Kate Grenville takes a bold stand and breaks that silence once and for all by explaining the brutal truth of the killing massacre carried out by her white ancestors on the natives just to 'take up' their lands and feel 'settled'. The secret river of blood is veining under Australia's dark past and staining the white settlers' conscience with the innocent aborigines' blood on their hands. Kate despite being a non-indigenous writer tries to do right by her indigenous brothers and sisters by going so far as to break the innocent fa\u00e7ade of her own great-great-great grandfather, Solomon Wiseman, whom the novel has been modelled upon, with the accounts of the real facts and incidents of the history untold.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77807059, "asset_id": 66726810, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 211472703, "first_name": "Priyadarshini", "last_name": "R.", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PriyadarshiniR7", "display_name": "Priyadarshini R.", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PriyadarshiniR7?f_ri=60115", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 74306, "name": "Kate Grenville", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kate_Grenville?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 497567, "name": "Australian Aborigines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aborigines?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1329039, "name": "The Secret River", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Secret_River?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 63408966, "title": "In the soil that nurtures us: A certain death to the colonial monument", "created_at": "2021-12-06T23:37:09.907-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63408966/In_the_soil_that_nurtures_us_A_certain_death_to_the_colonial_monument?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_63408966", "summary": "The removal of the monument to slave owner Edward Colston in Bristol during the Black Lives Matter uprising in 2020 did more than denounce the ongoing celebration of colonial legacies.

By situating Thomas Woolner\u2019s Captain Cook (1879) within the context of settler-colonial nation building to link its protection by police at the height of the 2020 BLMS protests, this paper emphasises the value of colonial monuments to the five-hundred-year history of modern colonisation. Colonial monuments in Australia serve a militarised function to narrate the lie of a just settlement on the grounds of terra nullius and deny First Nations sovereignty.

The idea was first discussed by him in the third issue of the Worker, 1 May 1890. It is hardly enough to know that such a book is good if you can't get hold of it, not even though within a few hundred miles it is selling for a shilling and you have several of them to spare. Cooperation on sound business lines will solve the difficulty. It is not possible just yet for the workers to get up for themselves the \"travelling free library\" 1 which the Boomerang is always urging the Government to start, but they can chip in their sixpences and shillings on a \"Book Fund\" to be invested in cheap and popular books, these to be supplied by mail to any address upon receipt of the cost price as announced in the Worker. By such an arrangement it would speedily be possible to send Looking Backward, Cooperative Commonwealth, George's books, Story of an African Farm and innumerable other sound, fascinating and elevating books to the Flinders or the Maranoa or Cooktown prepaid for one shilling. A sailor, a bushman, an artisan, a farmer or a labourer, who wanted to read any volume on the \"Book Fund\" list would only have to enclose postal note or stamps for the price named-the cost price, plus postage would be the price named-to the Worker Office and by return mail he would get his book. Sheds could order 25 or 50 or 100 books, the whole list if they liked, and have a first-class little library for a song. But not only the bushman but the townsman would benefit. How hard it is to get progressive books even in Brisbane! How they are jumped and begged for, almost stolen, by hundreds who have heard of them and ache to read them when they see them! A Brisbane man could drop into the Worker Office for his book and would be wanting to do so as often as a Townsville or Blackall man would be mailing for one. It would be the initiative, too, for a great propaganda and educational work which should be centered in the projected Brisbane and Townsville Trades Halls. It is the index, too, of what is possible if we join in making the Worker what it should be, the means by which we monthly work more and more together. The \"Book Fund\" is already started.

often said that they were civilising a wilderness. The truth was that the occupied country already had people, laws, politics, and economies. What did 'civilisation' mean to the free settlers? And what was the relationship between civilising and violence?\n\n\"The Civilisation of Port Phillip\" tracks the violent history of the first years of British settlement in the Port Phillip District, now the state of Victoria. It illuminates the underlying free-settler rhetoric that advocated and abetted violence on the frontier. For the first time, we hear the settlers tell us in their own words what the civilisation of Port Phillip really involved.\n\nFrontier violence in Port Phillip involved Aboriginal peoples, convicts, free settlers and colonial officials. This history shows how the lives of these different people interconnected in early Port Phillip, in unlikely friendships, dire misunderstandings, and fatal clashes. It paints a vivid picture of the period drawn from archival records, a thorough re-reading of older histories, and new ideas in the scholarship of violence.\n\nAs well as sheep and firearms, free settlers brought Enlightenment ideas about civilisation to Port Phillip. When these European ideas were coupled with Australian frontier experience, they manifested in an exterminatory attitude towards people deemed undesirable in the coming colony. \"The Civilisation of Port Phillip\" shows how free-settler rhetoric, law, and systems of classification reinforced and sought to justify the violence of the frontier.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55800468,

The western impact was bi-faceted, involving both the physical incursion of westerners into China, and the related movement of Chinese people overseas to work in western nations and colonies. Under the international coerced labour phenomenon known as the \u201ccoolie trade,\u201d Chinese people were brought across the British Empire as far as the settler colonies of Australia and South Africa, and even to the plantations of the British West Indies.

We know what the painting looked like, and why it was created, and we know the details of the journey taken by the painting: from Italy to Prague; from Prague to Sweden; from Sweden back to Italy; then to France and to London. But for most who have written about the painting it disappeared from public sight after the auction of February 1800.\r\nThis is the story of how the painting in fact was not lost after the 1800 auction but was sold on several more occasions and went from London to Scotland and ultimately ended up in Australia where it was exhibited by Dr Farquhar McCrae. This is also the story of Farquhar McCrae, perhaps better known to Australian readers through his sister-in-law, Georgiana Huntly Gordon McCrae and the journal she wrote describing life in Melbourne during the 1840s. But Farquhar's life story is at least as interesting as that of Georgiana's, yet it has previously not been told, at least not in this detail.\r\nBut this story is not a mere list of dates and facts documenting a sequence of auctions and the sellers and buyers who traded in art works. They are the mere dots of history. The data points. And in joining those data points this story narrates the journey taken by Barocci\u2019s lost painting. During the search, like Alice following the White Rabbit, we encounter clues that entice us to enter pathways that sometimes turn out to be dead ends. And, at the end of the journey, we may, or may not, have found the treasure we seek, but, either way, we can look back at the journey with a sense of great reward.\r\n\r\nThe 478 page, fully illustrated in colour, softcover edition, and an equivalent eBook/iPad version are available for purchase here: https://au.blurb.com/b/10604160-farquhar-mccrae-and-the-burning-of-troy\r\n\r\n or through my Historia Incognita site here: https://historiaincognita.net/2020/02/16/the-search-for-federico-baroccis-lost-1589-painting-aeneas-flight-from-troy/\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65226558, "asset_id": 44740738, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 497428, "first_name": "Douglas", "last_name": "Wilkie", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "DouglasWilkie", "display_name": "Douglas Wilkie", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/DouglasWilkie?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/497428/170863/14829758/s65_douglas.wilkie.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 40346, "name": "Australian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_art?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149103, "name": "Colonial Melbourne", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Melbourne?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 274762, "name": "National Gallery of Victoria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Gallery_of_Victoria?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 412894, "name": "Federico Barocci", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Federico_Barocci?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 772191, "name": "Australian art history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_art_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1711756, "name": "Charles Joseph La Trobe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Charles_Joseph_La_Trobe?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 3836327, "name": "Farquhar McCrae", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Farquhar_McCrae?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 3817564, "title": "The Watermills of John Lucas: The Flow of Wheat and Flour", "created_at": "2013-06-29T13:36:46.320-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3817564/The_Watermills_of_John_Lucas_The_Flow_of_Wheat_and_Flour?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_3817564", "summary": "Previous articles in this series have discussed the history of John Lucas\u2019 two water mills and their archaeological remains.

This involves the maritime landscape of the Georges River and its tributaries together with the boats that would allow transport of materials and people between the two mills, creating a single economic and social unit. The maritime connections of the Lucas family have been detailed in the family history. Their farming interests in Tasmania were most probably useful in the supply of wheat to John Lucas\u2019 mills.

In the absence of a clerical hierarchy or recognised historical expertise, four competing claims for the title of \u201cfirst evangelist\u201d emerged in the Churches of Christ (Disciples of Christ) denomination in colonial Victoria. Each of these claims is critically analysed in the light of rapidly developing church identity, the work of the evangelists in the 1860s, the influence of Australian nationalism, and historiographical portrayals which sought to make these four men heroes even in their absence. Finally the article examines absence of another kind \u2014 historiographical omission \u2014 and the question of the heroic in denominational church history.\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9809.12367/abstract", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26097042, "first_name": "Kerrie", "last_name": "Handasyde", "domain_name": "divinity", "page_name": "KerrieHandasyde", "display_name": "Kerrie  Handasyde", "profile_url": "https://divinity.academia.edu/KerrieHandasyde?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26097042/12174785/96913723/s65_kerrie.handasyde.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3524, "name": "Historiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3987, "name": "History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Memory?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7791, "name": "Heroism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heroism?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8495, "name": "History of Missions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Missions?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8816, "name": "Restoration (Stone-Campbell) Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Restoration_Stone-Campbell_Movement?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 10947, "name": "Jewish - Christian Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_-_Christian_Relations?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 14893, "name": "Church History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 37115, "name": "Christian Zionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christian_Zionism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 44987, "name": "Evangelism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evangelism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 47747, "name": "Christian Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christian_Leadership?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 192113, "name": "Disciples of Christ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disciples_of_Christ?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 255908, "name": "Church Leadership & Ministry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Church_Leadership_and_Ministry?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 344261, "name": "Stone-Campbell Movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stone-Campbell_Movement?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 454059, "name": "Baptism in the Holy Spirit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baptism_in_the_Holy_Spirit?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1014874, "name": "Australian Jewish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Jewish_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1213496, "name": "Goldrush History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Goldrush_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2489560, "name": "Churches of Christ in Victoria and Tasmania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Churches_of_Christ_in_Victoria_and_Tasmania?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2489561, "name": "Churches of Christ in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Churches_of_Christ_in_Australia?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 1507321, "title": "Rosa!

Born into frontier Queensland at a time when settlers lived in isolation, afraid of Aboriginal attacks, she was to spend her adult life in the literary, artistic and political circles of London. As a young woman, moving in the squattocracy circles of Brisbane, and later in London, as a member of Oscar Wilde's bohemia, Rosa kept notes of the characters and conversations around her. Her forty-five books show evidence of her keen and intelligent observation.\nWhile Rosa's most successful works were set in Australia, her literary subjects were varied, and reflect many aspects of her life - her interest in women's rights; her own unhappy marriage; and, of course, her search for spiritual meaning. On this search she gathered up Aboriginal dreaming, Catholicism, astrology, spiritual mediums, the supernatural and reincarnation - and finally discovered her twin soul.\nRosa's story is a rich and dramatic one, full of psychological interest. In 'Rosa! Rosa!', Patricia Clarke shows how she managed her amazing output in the midst of family problems, marital woes, illness more frequent with the years, and a constant changing of 'homes'.\nWith this brilliant analysis of Praed's life, Patricia Clarke offers a new and original evaluation of her place in the history of Australian women.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1010308, "first_name": "Patricia", "last_name": "Clarke", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PatriciaClarke", "display_name": "Patricia Clarke", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PatriciaClarke?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1010308/3420507/14147622/s65_patricia.clarke.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 19109, "name": "Spiritualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spiritualism?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26469, "name": "Theosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theosophy?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217239, "name": "Rosa Praed", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rosa_Praed?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 296725, "name": "Women authors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_authors?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 786629, "name": "1880s-1940s", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/1880s-1940s?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2444801, "name": "Australian Colonial Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Colonial_Life?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2444837, "name": "Australian Women Authors", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Women_Authors?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2444838, "name": "Hornet Bank Massacre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hornet_Bank_Massacre?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 21532029, "title": "Two Colonials in London's Bohemia: Rosa Praed and Mortimer Menpes", "created_at": "2016-02-03T20:28:50.666-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21532029/Two_Colonials_in_Londons_Bohemia_Rosa_Praed_and_Mortimer_Menpes?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_21532029", "summary": "In the latter part of the 1880s, two expatriate Australians, the South Australian-born artist and etcher Mortimer Menpes and the Queensland-born novelist Rosa Praed, became collaborators in London.

The story of the Irish bushranger has inspired numerous books, movies, television series, comics and artwork. A notorious figure, he is most often remembered as the archetypal folk hero battling for survival under the harsh conditions imposed by the British establishment. But where did his story begin? In 1880, four Melbourne journalists travelled on the police train to Glenrowan to cover the intended capture of the Kelly gang that would later lead to Kelly's hanging. JD Melvin (Argus), Thomas Carrington (The Australasian Sketcher with Pen and Pencil), John McWhirter (Age) and George Allen (Melbourne Daily Telegraph) went beyond the role of reporters and became participants in the action.

In 1870, colonial Melbourne was \u2018perspiring juvenile humanity\u2019 with an astonishing 42 per cent of the city\u2019s inhabitants aged 14 and under - a demographic anomaly resulting from the gold rushes of the 1850s. Within this context, Simon Sleight enters the heated debate concerning the future prospects of \u2018Young Australia\u2019 and the place of the colonial child within the incipient Australian nation. Looking beyond those institutional sites so often assessed by historians of childhood, he ranges across the outdoor city to chart the relationship between a discourse about youth, youthful experience and the shaping of new urban spaces. Play, street work, consumerism, courtship, gang-related activities and public parades are examined using a plethora of historical sources to reveal a hitherto hidden layer of city life. Capturing the voices of young people as well as those of their parents, Sleight alerts us to the ways in which young people shaped the emergent metropolis by appropriating space and attempting to impress upon the city their own desires. Here a dynamic youth culture flourished well before the discovery of the \u2018teenager\u2019 in the mid-twentieth century; here young people and the city grew up together.\r\n\r\nReview: '\"Marvellous Melbourne\", a precocious new world city of the late nineteenth century, is the site for this rich and acute study of how young people carved out their own spaces in the urban outdoors. Simon Sleight draws on a remarkable range of sources to illuminate the subversive perspectives of Melbourne's youth. The book contributes to the burgeoning international scholarship on young people's historical experiences, and is recommended reading for historians, geographers and sociologists alike.'\r\n( Prof Stuart Macintyre, University of Melbourne, Australia)\r\n\r\nSubsections include: \r\nChapter 1.

However, in glaring contrast to the High Court\u2019s decision, and the ubiquitous reference to terra nullius by commentators across numerous professional fields as the British doctrine of colonisation, the Tasmanian historian Dr. Michael Connor purports that terra nullius \u201cwas not the legal doctrine behind the 18th century British occupation of Australia\u2026[because it] was barely known until 1977 when the Redfern Legal Service's Paul Coe introduced it into a High Court case\u201d (2003a, p.4). If so, the High Court\u2019s proclamation regarding \u2018the legal fiction of terra nullius\u2019 as being inconsistent with Australia\u2019s historical reality, is ironically true, though not in terms of it\u2019s historical application, but rather in terms of its historical non-existence in Australia\u2019s colonisation. The application of \u2018the legal fiction of terra nullius\u2019 appears to be a contemporary one; not an historical one.

Whatever the medium, their work reflected dominant views of Australia\u2019s history, achievements and identity, their pictures defined by their celebration of whiteness, masculinity and settlers\u2019 claims to indigeneity by virtue of their possession of Australia\u2019s sunburnt country. What remained outside their frames were the dispossession of First Nations\u2019 peoples and the lives and labour of settler women.\n\nIn addition to sharing a common iconography, Sydney\u2019s and Melbourne\u2019s artists fed off a similar set of artistic influences, largely emanating from London and reinforced by the English-born and -trained artists who dominated these colonial outposts of Britain\u2019s imperial art world. These would include such French-inflected British art practices as plein air painting and tonal realism. In other words, we might start talking about British-Australian impressionism and its distinctive contribution to British art history.\n\nFrom this perspective, Roberts, Streeton and Fullwood\u2019s move to London can be seen as not the ending but the completion of Australia\u2019s settler-colonial art movement; its homecoming to the heartland of British art. The art they created in England was integral to both their cultural and imperial identities and their artistic development.\n\nThe movement ultimately culminated in these artists\u2019 wartime service. It was particularly fitting that Australia\u2019s war art scheme drew on the skills of painters like Streeton but still more heavily on artist-illustrators like Fullwood, whose pictures proved perfect illustrations for Charles Bean\u2019s creation of the Anzac legend \u2014 yet another enduring evocation of a settler-colonial worldview.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66283754, "asset_id": 46910675, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 172730, "first_name": "Gary", "last_name": "Werskey", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "DrGaryWerskey", "display_name": "Gary Werskey", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/DrGaryWerskey?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/172730/18377392/33721133/s65_gary.werskey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54110, "name": "Settler Colonialism & Its Legacies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonialism_and_Its_Legacies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68772, "name": "Art of the British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_of_the_British_Empire?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107550, "name": "Settler colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_colonialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 157937, "name": "19th Century British Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/19th_Century_British_Art?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 772191, "name": "Australian art history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_art_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1297209, "name": "19th Century Australian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/19th_Century_Australian_Art?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 45316522, "title": "Picturesque New England in 1886: An Artist's First Impressions", "created_at": "2021-03-02T15:47:56.503-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45316522/Picturesque_New_England_in_1886_An_Artists_First_Impressions?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_45316522", "summary": "An essay based on A.H.

By 1870, staff numbered 162, of which 50 were known to be compositors and 26 worked as binders (Mills 2004, pp. 67 & 70); and by 1890, staff approximated 395, with 121 of these contracted to conduct compositorial \u2018piece-work\u2019 ('The Government Printing Office, 1890'. 1891, p. 20).\n\nThe GPO\u2019s rapid expansion over this fifty-year period was consistent with the growth in the nation\u2019s economy, literacy and, hence, national expression at that time. Its expansion also necessitated frequent relocation of the GPO to increasingly larger premises to house its equipment, materials and staff; its first custom-made office was constructed in 1870 and comprised two floors: the ground floor and basement. The biography of the GPO, 'The Government Printing Office, 1890', provided fold-out maps of these floors and the GPO\u2019s many branches: the ground floor included publishing room, machine and press room, and warehouse; the basement, the lithographers, stereotypers and paper store.\n\nThrough textual analyses of these maps, specifically, and The Government Printing Office, 1890, more generally, as well as of notable published output and publishing archives of the GPO, this paper conducts a physical mapping of the GPO\u2019s branches of manufacture, and the relationships therein, to discern the plurality of nineteenth-century Australian print culture and, in turn, its emerging national expression.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7346661, "first_name": "Jocelyn", "last_name": "Hargrave", "domain_name": "derby", "page_name": "JocelynHargrave", "display_name": "Jocelyn Hargrave", "profile_url": "https://derby.academia.edu/JocelynHargrave?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7346661/2710640/31394470/s65_jocelyn.hargrave.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1139, "name": "Publishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Publishing?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2340, "name": "Book History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29113, "name": "Nineteenth-Century Literature and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth-Century_Literature_and_Culture?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3127052, "name": "Book production", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Book_production?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 35540723, "title": "Framing the innocent: celebration and anxiety in convict silent cinema.", "created_at": "2017-12-30T04:00:20.845-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35540723/Framing_the_innocent_celebration_and_anxiety_in_convict_silent_cinema?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_35540723", "summary": "At the close of the silent era moviegoers flocked to the longest running most expensive film ever produced in Australia, American director Norman Dawn\u2019s convict epic For the Term of His Natural Life (1927).  Through the film\u2019s rare fortune of surviving almost in its entirety, and the subsequent academic focus on it, Term has masked a significant body of cinema representing the convict experience that appeared before.  This paper sets out to reconstruct these lost films and in the process reveals more than just cinema history.  Most significantly it argues that convict cinema was influential in directing mythologies away from a focus on the innocence of individuals towards the convict class as a collective.  This idea had important implications for how Australian\u2019s understood convicts as national symbols, and is something that has been solely attributed to later literature and academic thought. Through an exploration of the public anxieties and celebrations that surfaced as a result of convict cinema, this paper also argues for a more nuanced approach to claims made regarding the pervasive nature of the social phenomenon termed \u2018the convict stain\u2019.  As will be demonstrated, the popularity of these films pushed back against the widespread censorship of convict histories at both an official and personal level during the opening decades of the twentieth century.  Ultimately this exploration of lost cinema yields new ways of thinking about the development and entrenchment of popular mythologies concerning Australia\u2019s colonisation, many of which still resonate today.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1046624, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Findlay", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "JamesFindlay", "display_name": "James Findlay", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/JamesFindlay?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1046624/486967/613054/s65_james.findlay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12444, "name": "Film History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23294, "name": "Television History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Television_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 149100, "name": "Convicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Convicts?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 33097773, "title": "Up in Smoke: clay tobacco pipes", "created_at": "2017-05-19T06:44:06.258-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33097773/Up_in_Smoke_clay_tobacco_pipes?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_33097773", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29920993, "first_name": "Fiona", "last_name": "Starr", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "FionaStarr", "display_name": "Fiona Starr", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/FionaStarr?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29920993/11577689/12911695/s65_fiona.starr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149287, "name": "History of smoking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_smoking?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 161278, "name": "Australian historical archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_historical_archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 33097456, "title": "Peter Garrett's Hyde Park Barracks ancestor", "created_at": "2017-05-19T06:32:42.975-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33097456/Peter_Garretts_Hyde_Park_Barracks_ancestor?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_33097456", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29920993, "first_name": "Fiona", "last_name": "Starr", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "FionaStarr", "display_name": "Fiona Starr", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/FionaStarr?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29920993/11577689/12911695/s65_fiona.starr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2061, "name": "Genealogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genealogy?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 310750, "name": "Genealogy-Family History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genealogy-Family_History?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 33096998, "title": "Convicts at the General 'Rum' Hospital, Sydney, 1816 -

Colonial societies have tended to be perceived through a post-colonial dichotomy of coloniser and the colonised. Identities, historical events and trajectories have been divided into the archetypes of a powerful, violent transgressing Coloniser and a passive agentless group, -the Colonised. The dichotomy of Coloniser and Colonised has been challenged by recent scholarship in cultural studies, anthropology, material culture studies, museumology and heritage studies. While some in archaeology have also begun to question this duality, there has not yet been a systematic study of the phenomena or of the role of small dynamic groups.\nTo address this gap in archaeological research, three case studies from the British Empire; \u2013 Calcutta, The Straits Settlements and Sydney \u2013 are analysed and compared to examine whether the archaeology and materiality of colonial port cities reveals a plurality of groups within colonial contexts. That these case studies are regional and temporal contemporaries also addresses the current lack of historical archaeology in South and South East Asia, as well as the lack of integration of Australian historical archaeology within the wider Asia-Pacific region.\nUsing principles of British and German landscape archaeology enables the contents and spatial relationships of a landscape to be examined as an archaeological site. This approach is complimented by a consideration of smaller scale material and spatial relationships within and amongst buildings. Grounded in an examination of materiality and landscape my aim is to reveal the nature of the plurality of players within a colonial context, and to assess the social operational consequences of these relationships.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4459615, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Leadbetter", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "MichaelLeadbetter", "display_name": "Michael  Leadbetter", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelLeadbetter?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4459615/1825239/20540086/s65_michael.leadbetter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 266, "name": "Historical Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Geography?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 3290, "name": "Urbanism (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urbanism_Archaeology_?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 6541, "name": "World History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 7275, "name": "South East Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_East_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 12795, "name": "Social Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 12899, "name": "South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 12961, "name": "British Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Empire?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 16226, "name": "Materiality (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materiality_Anthropology_?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 19741, "name": "Big History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Big_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 29244, "name": "Asian art and archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_art_and_archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 30010, "name": "Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Empire?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 45999, "name": "Australian archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 48603, "name": "Singapore History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 161278, "name": "Australian historical archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_historical_archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 198582, "name": "British Indian Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Indian_Empire?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 365814, "name": "British Raj", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Raj?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 451041, "name": "Divide and Rule in British India", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Divide_and_Rule_in_British_India?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 538424, "name": "Archaeology of Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Colonialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 668319, "name": "South Asian History Historiography South Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History_Historiography_South_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 786340, "name": "History Of Calcutta", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_Of_Calcutta?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1106384, "name": "Archaelogy of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaelogy_of_Malaysia?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 13634401, "title": "Review of Kath Leahy's Lords and Larrikins.

A. Phillips coined the term \u2018cultural cringe\u2019 to describe Australians\u2019 relationship to their own culture in 1950, it was immediately embraced as an incisive way to describe the effects of the country's colonial history on its self-identity. The gist of the cultural cringe was that Australians were so obsessed with well-bred Englishness as the measure of greatness that nothing of their own would ever be up to scratch. These days it has become fashionable to pronounce the death of the cultural cringe in Australia, just as it is also fashionable within the humanities to regard the dynamic between \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 culture as pass\u00e9. Kath Leahy's scintillating work is an important reminder not only of the potency of these things in Australia's post-1788 history, but also of their subtly continuing relevance.\n\nLords and Larrikins is in many ways an exquisite diatribe directed at the cocktail of prejudices and insecurities which have allowed \u2013 and still allow \u2013 certain actors to be deemed suitable for leading roles in Australian theatre while relegating others to the role of low player. It covers the history of Australian theatre from the construction of the first Theatre Royal in 1830s Sydney to \u2018the great Hamlet controversy\u2019 among Melbourne theatre critics in the 1860s, on to the rapscallion vaudeville of the 1920s and the explosion of Australian drama and comic theatre which took place in the 1970s. An enjoyable air of invective infuses Leahy's prose, whether she is discussing the fawning response to Lawrence Olivier's Australasian tour in 1948, or the continuing disadvantages suffered by actors of working-class and non-white backgrounds in Australian theatre today. Leahy's work is also a sustained love song to the low player: the mischief-maker or \u2018larrikin\u2019, to use Australian parlance. Best exemplified by the vaudeville comedian-turned-radio and film star, Roy Rene, she argues that the larrikin fool has occupied a position of extraordinary potency in the Antipodes. Since everyone Down Under has been affected by the cultural cringe, the fool's mockery of high pretensions has provided cathartic delight across the social spectrum.\n\nOne of the most valuable aspects of Leahy's work is that it demonstrates the significance of theatre for Australian culture writ large. There is still a reluctance to recognize this among non-theatre historians and publishers in Australia, and my big hope for Lords and Larrikins is that its value will be recognized outside theatrical circles as well as within them. This is a book which should be set reading in courses on gender and cultural studies and Australian history as well as devoured by anyone interested in the history of high and low playing, Shakespearean performance and Australian masculinities. Each chapter bulges with fascinating characters, focusing on actors who have played Hamlet and the Second Gravedigger respectively over the years. Animated by Leahy's spirited and sometimes acerbic prose, Lords and Larrikins is also that rare and happy thing: a historical work that is not only instructive and politically relevant, but also a sheer pleasure to read.\n\nLords and Larrikins: The Actor's Role in the Making of Australia.

It is not hard to see why. A Swindler's Progress powerfully demonstrates the key point he made in Ornamentalism (2002) \u2013 that is, that one has to understand Britain in order to understand the Empire and vice versa. In a work of almost fiendish inventiveness, McKenzie shows the extent to which \u2018high\u2019 British and \u2018low\u2019 Australian society were entwined in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. In the first instance, she tells the story of a Yorkshire family, the Lascelles, which jostled its way into the aristocracy through dirty profit from the West Indian slave trade. She then interweaves this with the story of a swindler who impersonated the Lascelles\u2019 heir after transportation to Van Diemen's Land.\r\nMcKenzie's basic point is that everyone was \u2018on the make\u2019 in the so-called age of liberty, whether they lived in a Yorkshire mansion or spent their time in irons in the colonies. By adding accounts of the anti-slavery and anti-transportation movements, however, she makes her narrative into considerably more. The anti-slavery campaign affected the Lascelles in Britain, while the anti-transportation movement affected the convict impostor in the Antipodes \u2013 but both movements were linked by a rhetoric concerning the rights of British freemen and the prestige of Empire. The fact that the age of liberty's classic rhetoric about rights was profoundly concerned with Britain's imperial interests is thus underlined.\r\n\r\nIt sounds ambitious, and indeed it is. A Swindler's Progress has a bulging cast of characters and switches between analyses of British and Australian politics at breakneck speed. Although written for a lay audience, my advice is not to read this book with a hangover, for you will certainly find yourself struggling with the names and facts and abrupt shifts of location. You will also find yourself bamboozled if you try to skim read. Among much else, there are discussion here of the 1807 Yorkshire election, the Peterloo massacre, convict insurrections in the Hunter Valley, and Governor Bourke's attempts to curb the excesses of the jumped-up New South Welsh \u2018gentry\u2019 towards their convict assignees. As I can attest, however, the effort to keep up with this kaleidoscopic narrative is repaid in the pleasure one feels in its interconnections once the names and the dates fall into place. It is also repaid in the breadth of knowledge one acquires about the \u2018age of liberty\u2019, and with it an appreciation for McKenzie's ingenious mode of transnational history.\r\n\r\nIf I have one point to cavil with this work, it is the fact that the world it describes is so mean. It is indeed a world in which everyone is on the make, in which greed and an unseemly jockeying for position reign supreme. Very occasionally, one gets a sense that life then could be more than this. (There is a lovely portrait of the English politician, Viscount Milton, and his wife Mary, who evidently shared a companionate marriage as well as political convictions during the 1807 Yorkshire election).

Meeting by chance during one of Birtles\u2019 overland explorations by motorcar and one of Nayombolmi\u2019s annual walking route journeys, the two men came together in an area that would become synonymous with the Imarlkba gold mine in present day Kakadu National Park. Their acquaintance, based on mutual needs and curiosity, provides a rare insight into cross-cultural colonial relationships in this frontier region. Beginning in 1929 their interactions continued intermittently as the Birtles-initiated Imarlkba gold mine developed and Badmardi people (and others) joined the workforce.

At least 148 NMP camps of varying duration once existed, and historical and archaeological investigations of these demonstrate some consistent patterning amongst them, as well as idiosyncrasies depending on individual locations and circumstances. All camps were positioned with primary regard to the availability of water and forage. Owing to their intended temporary nature and the frugality of the government, the surviving structural footprints of camps are generally limited. Buildings were typically timber slab and bark constructions with few permanent foundations and surviving architectural features are therefore rare, limited to elements such as ant bed flooring, remnant house or yard posts, stone lines demarcating pathways, and stone fireplaces. Architectural forms of spatial confinement, such as lockups or palisades, were absent from the camps themselves. The most distinctive features of NMP camps, and what allows them to be distinguished from the myriad pastoral sites of similar ages, are their artefact assemblages, especially the combined presence of gilt uniform buttons with the Victoria Regina insignia, knapped bottle glass, and certain ammunition-related objects.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63975610, "asset_id": 43673613, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 215213, "first_name": "Lynley", "last_name": "Wallis", "domain_name": "griffith", "page_name": "LynleyWallis", "display_name": "Lynley Wallis", "profile_url": "https://griffith.academia.edu/LynleyWallis?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/215213/49203/57416/s65_lynley.wallis.215213"}, {"id": 495383, "first_name": "Kelsey", "last_name": "Lowe", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "KelseyLowe", "display_name": "Kelsey Lowe", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/KelseyLowe?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/495383/170866/33079059/s65_kelsey.lowe.jpg"}, {"id": 116840970, "first_name": "Anthony", "last_name": "Pagels", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "AnthonyPagels", "display_name": "Anthony Pagels", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/AnthonyPagels?f_ri=60115", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 140093, "first_name": "Iain", "last_name": "Davidson", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "IainDavidson", "display_name": "Iain Davidson", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/IainDavidson?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140093/37155/117175/s65_iain.davidson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2326, "name": "Nineteenth Century Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nineteenth_Century_Studies?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 5439, "name": "Australian Indigenous Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Archaeology?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 80016, "name": "Police and Policing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Police_and_Policing?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 167069, "name": "Queensland history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queensland_history?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 42335727, "title": "Dante and His Influence in Australia (Video Presentation)", "created_at": "2020-03-26T19:22:44.436-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42335727/Dante_and_His_Influence_in_Australia_Video_Presentation_?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_42335727", "summary": "This paper was written for the first global Dante Day commemorated on 25 March 2020 in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been published online by the Dante Alighieri Society Canberra. Dante Alighieri is a household name in Australia, but what has been his influence here and how did he make the voyage to Australia's \"altro polo\"? The history and presence of Italian literature in English literature is outlined, as are the presence of Dante Alighieri's works in Australian literature and art. Dante Alighieri Societies and the Italian diplomatic corps have been active promoters of Dante's work and Italian literature and culture generally in Australia. However it can be concluded that, at least in the past, Dante's influence on Italian Australians has been slight. The historical reasons and factors underlying this contradiction are explored.

Frontiers are generally understood as cultural, religious, language, and societal divides. Yet, through history, frontiers were imagined and manufactured for people to cross them. Borders did not only separate people, but did also connect them. Similar to the Roman limes, early modern boundaries put in contact what it was considered as 'civilised world' with the 'savage/infidel world'. People lived on, through, and against borders; and in turn, frontiers shaped people and trans-regional connections. Material culture played a crucial role in the construction of frontiers, especially in the so-called 'Age of Exploration' when Europeans searched for new trade routes that would fuel capitalism in their continent and, in the process, colonised large parts of the world. The materiality of borders took place in the form of walls, fortifications, religious buildings, city-plans, prisons, and cemeteries; but also in the form of body-adornment and apparel, food and crops, weapons, labour equipment and tools, and sacred objects. This session looks at those in-between objects that shaped and challenged people and frontiers alike between 1400-1800 AD by exploring African, American, Asian, European, and Pacific contexts. We welcome theoretical and methodological papers exploring the material culture of making and unmaking political, racial, sexual, and confessional boundaries in the early modern colonial world.",

In order to verify this assumption, first the origin and the current rules of Australia's migration policy are presented and described, and then the determinants of immigration to Australia are indicated. Next, the overall state of relations between the EU, its Member States, and Australian immigration matters is explored. The main research questions posed in this text concern the key points of Australia's immigration policies and its determinants, as well as the current state of the EU's and its Member States' relationship with Australia with respect to the refugee crisis and immigration.

Virkamiesten v\u00e4lisen kirjeenvaihdon joukossa valtamerten yli siirtokunnista Lontooseen ja toisin p\u00e4in liikkuivat my\u00f6s eri paikoissa valmistetut kartat, joiden merkitys hallinnollisina dokumentteina kasvoi vuosisadan edetess\u00e4. Kartoilla esitettiin esimerkiksi viimeisin uusi tieto eri ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6ist\u00e4, siirtokuntien kartoituksen edistyminen ja niiden infrastruktuurin kehitys. Kartat olivat virkamiehille yksi hallinnoinnin v\u00e4line ja keskeinen tapa, jolla Australian siirtokuntia visualisoitiin. Karttojen saatavuuteen ja k\u00e4ytt\u00f6\u00f6n liittyi kuitenkin monia rajoitteita.\n\nT\u00e4ss\u00e4 esitelm\u00e4ss\u00e4 tarkastelen millaisia karttoja virkamiehill\u00e4 oli k\u00e4yt\u00f6ss\u00e4\u00e4n eri paikoissa. Tutkimukseni perustuu siirtomaaministerin ja Australian siirtokuntien kuvern\u00f6\u00f6rin v\u00e4liseen kirjeenvaihtoon vuosina 1829-1863. Erittelen mitk\u00e4 asiat vaikuttivat karttojen valmistamiseen ja saatavuuteen siirtokunnissa ja Lontoossa ja analysoin kuinka karttoja luettiin, mit\u00e4 niille tehtiin ja kuinka esimerkiksi niiden puuttumiseen reagoitiin. Tarkastelemalla millaisissa verkostoissa karttoja tuotettiin ja k\u00e4ytettiin osallistun keskusteluun imperiumin hallinnoinnin arkip\u00e4iv\u00e4st\u00e4 ja sen materiaalisuudesta.

It is a process that has been occurring throughout history in situations of colonial conquest and state expansion. Despite the importance and prominence of these processes not only for the state but even more so for the indigenous groups affected, there is remarkably little systematic analysis and theoretical reflection on the causal factors that led members of such groups to agree to lay down their weapons and refrain from pursuing further acts of collective violence.\n\nIn this thesis, I look at colonial processes of pacification in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, and establish the causal mechanisms that lead to the elimination of indigenous warfare between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s. I not only document and analyse these processes in detail, but also develop a methodological and analytical toolkit to compare processes of pacification in general, and an encompassing theoretical framework to explain the gradual but ultimately successful transition to a colonially induced peace. \n\nThe thesis centres on four communities in three ethnic groups in the Okapa and Obura-Wonenara Districts of the Eastern Highlands Province in Papua New Guinea, namely Purosa among the Fore, Amaira among the Auyana, and Bibeori and Obura among the Southern Tairora. All of these communities were first contacted between 1947 and 1949 by government patrols of the Australian Administration. The ensuing process of pacification has been far from uniform, however. While indigenous warfare ceased quickly among the Fore and Auyana, it persisted for a much longer period among the Southern Tairora. These temporal variations and the differing outcomes form an ideal setting to compare different trajectories of pacification and extract general features conducive to the elimination of warfare.",

It has no internal pagination, and the full volume can be viewed here: http://www.foresthistory.org.au/conferences.html)\n\nThis chapter examines the friction between Conservator of Forests George S. Perrin and his Forest Branch on the one hand, and the Railways Department and the hewers who supplied its needs on the other, from the period of Perrin's appointment in 1888 through to his sudden death in December 1900. It illuminates the tensions between developmental and conservational ideals that attended the rapid expansion and maintenance of Victoria's railway network in the late nineteenth century. Victorian governments of all political persuasions were eager to construct railways to encourage the spread of settlement and link rural industries to markets and ports. On the other hand, the previous thirty years had already featured severe destruction of forests by hewers and other parties, and Perrin approached his task of organising and managing Victoria's timber resources with zeal and a sense of urgency. Hence the demands of railway construction for timber increasingly came into conflict with the plans of forest conservators. Yet was antagonism inevitable, and once sharp disagreements emerged were they handled appropriately? This chapter, after sketching the background, will show how the dispute played out and how it was\u2014 or was not\u2014resolved. Perrin's arguments against hewing were not consistent, but went through a process of evolution and encountered sustained opposition from hewers, who pressed their case through local newspapers and lobbying members of parliament. Opportunities for resolution emerged by 1896, but were not taken and antagonism reached its apogee at the end of the decade.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51310795, "asset_id": 30884323, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42750095, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9", "last_name": "Brett", "domain_name": "uow", "page_name": "AndreBrett", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9 Brett", "profile_url": "https://uow.academia.edu/AndreBrett?f_ri=60115", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25721, "name": "Railway and Transportation History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Railway_and_Transportation_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 97026, "name": "Forest Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forest_Conservation?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 113086, "name": "Forest History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forest_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 124175, "name": "Colonial History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 289237, "name": "Australian Environmental history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Environmental_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 318823, "name": "Railways", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Railways?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 513938, "name": "Victorian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 671428, "name": "History of Colonial Victoria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Colonial_Victoria?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 1352978, "name": "Railway Sleepers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Railway_Sleepers?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 26000565, "title": "Brixet: The impact on Australian multiculturalism and a republicanism.

This geo-political economic essential lifeline was felt globally by all sovereign economies which made sense from a regional pragmatic and realpolitical perspective which would undermine the traditional imperial and colonial gains of the previous two centuries of colonial expansion by the British in particular. The British empire where the sun never sets had diminished with the dynamic forces of political and economic tectonic ructions which would shatter and fragment the British hegemony by the nascent forces vying to undermine the established world order of the the day. No doubt the British had overstretched their Imperial grandeur imaginations, like the Romans before them and they could not possibly remain the perpetual hegemonic ruler of a vast Empire into perpetuity. In 1942, the Japanese emphatically destroyed the British imperial conceit once and forever, when the Japanese imperial forces had unceremoniously and violently ousted the British from Singapore. The triumphant Japanese imperial force then would consider such a feat in parity with the humiliation of the Russian Naval power, in 1904, when Russia was defeated by the Japanese. In 1942, with the fall of Singapore, signified the humiliation of the British military power once and forever and the British military presence would never again rise again in Asia and in the South Pacific. In their stead, a nascent American hegemonic influence would prevent the complete decolonisation of Oceania. The Pax Americana remains the pervading influence world over since 1945.

"dom_id": "work_16153286", "summary": "In 1929, the Australian architect and author William Hardy Wilson (1881\u20131950) identified architectural practice within Australia as degenerate and in decline. He attributed this regression not to changing tastes or styles but to the increasing number of native-born architects and their long-term exposure to a subtropical or tropical climate. Wilson believed that Australia\u2019s warmer climates negatively affected the nation\u2019s future capacity for innovation and invention and the development of national style. Central to Wilson\u2019s thesis was the proposition that climate was the primary determinant of artistic agency. The importance of this idea was twofold. First, it enabled Wilson to develop a critique of the White Australia policies which were introduced in 1901 and which grew in influence in the early decades of twentieth-century Australia. Second, it helped Wilson to locate Australian architectural practice within a global theory of civilisation. In documenting the crisis that Wilson saw within the architecture of Australia, the paper considers this aspect of his work in detail for the first time.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68641096, "asset_id": 16153286, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30063777, "first_name": "Deborah", "last_name": "van der Plaat", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "DeborahvanderPlaat", "display_name": "Deborah  van der Plaat", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/DeborahvanderPlaat?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30063777/21497669/20870557/s65_deborah.van_der_plaat.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3722, "name": "Environmental History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31262, "name": "Tropical Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tropical_Architecture?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54201, "name": "Australian architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_architecture?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 65397, "name": "ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY, THEORY AND CRITICISM", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ARCHITECTURAL_HISTORY_THEORY_AND_CRITICISM?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 93550, "name": "White Australia Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/White_Australia_Policy?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 94530, "name": "Climate responsive Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_responsive_Architecture?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 107550, "name": "Settler colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_colonialism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 115996, "name": "Environmental  History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_History-1?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 259204, "name": "British Civilisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Civilisation?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 453528, "name": "Acclimatization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Acclimatization?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 534355, "name": "Architectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectual_History?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 542026, "name": "Climate Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Politics?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 633840, "name": "Georgian Art and Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georgian_Art_and_Architecture?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 905310, "name": "Climatic Determinism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climatic_Determinism?f_ri=60115"}, {"id": 2486686, "name": "Theories of Civilizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Civilizations?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 11905068, "title": "The governor and his convict architect -

that democracy in NSW was won through fierce political battles and street rallies? The Southern Tree of Liberty sheds light on this turbulent and violent period in Australian history.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years, the advocates of democracy mobilised the working class and fought hard to bring popular rule to the colony. The elites, on the other hand, used their legislative powers to halt this march towards liberty, most notably in the Constitution of 1853.\r\n\r\nThere were many colourful characters involved in the push for self-government:\r\n\r\n    Charles Harpur, the native-born poet who wrote \u2018The Tree of Liberty (A Song for the Future)\u2019;\r\n    Johann Lhotsky, the revolutionary who spent five years in an Austrian prison;\r\n    Ben Sutherland, the English upholsterer who formed the first working-class political organisation and edited its newspaper;\r\n    William A Duncan, the Scots Catholic who created a network of radical intellectuals; \u00b7 Henry Macdermott, the Irish-born \u2018friend of the people\u2019; and\r\n    Edward J\r\n    Hawksley, the radical journalist who was part of every democratic campaign from 1840. \r\n\r\nThese characters and more are covered in Irving\u2019s engagingly written and thoroughly researched book. The Southern Tree of Liberty highlights the contribution of the democrats to public life and shows how their struggles made possible the democratic advances that followed after 1856.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76032995, "asset_id": 7844813, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5382209, "first_name": "Terry", "last_name": "Irving", "domain_name": "uow", "page_name": "TerryIrving", "display_name": "Terry Irving", "profile_url": "https://uow.academia.edu/TerryIrving?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5382209/2522282/2928259/s65_terry.irving.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 31886, "name": "Radical Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_Democracy?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42412, "name": "Radical political thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_political_thought?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 118775, "name": "Representative Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representative_Democracy?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1480212, "name": "Early electoral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_electoral_history?f_ri=60115"}]}, {"id": 6341751, "title": "Australian Dress Register: Joseph Brady's white linen shirt", "created_at": "2014-03-08T22:56:35.253-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6341751/Australian_Dress_Register_Joseph_Bradys_white_linen_shirt?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_6341751", "summary": "This garment is a well preserved example of a mid-nineteenth century Irish linen shirt. This shirt, as indicated by a handwritten laundry mark, was owned by Joseph Brady who is considered to be one of the most accomplished civil engineers to work in Australia during the nineteenth century. Brady was twenty-two years old when he came to Australia and eventually married Adelaide Sarah Keck, the daughter of the infamous Henry Keck who was the first Governor of Darlinghurst Gaol in Sydney. Upon his arrival in Australia, Joseph Brady established himself as a successful engineer and surveyor.  Even with its famous owner, the significance of the shirt however lies mainly in its manufacture and gifting. This shirt is a fine example of nineteenth century domestic needlework - it is entirely hand stitched, with broderie anglaise incorporated into the pintucks at the front, and it is made from very fine linen.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3370312, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Bendall", "domain_name": "nestpillmart", "page_name": "SarahBendall", "display_name": "Sarah A Bendall", "profile_url": "https://nestpillmart.academia.edu/SarahBendall?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3370312/1133856/33292180/s65_sarah.bendall.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1437, "name": "History of Dress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Dress?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4759562, "title": "The Bridge Street Explosion of 1866", "created_at": "2013-10-12T19:12:47.986-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4759562/The_Bridge_Street_Explosion_of_1866?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_4759562", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32068083, "asset_id": 4759562, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5757036, "first_name": "Wayne", "last_name": "Johnson", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "WayneJohnson", "display_name": "Wayne  Johnson", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/WayneJohnson?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5757036/2508899/2913038/s65_wayne.johnson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 5892405, "title": "'A Sad Set of Ruffians': Convicts and Morality in the Port Phillip District", "created_at": "2014-01-30T09:12:53.095-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5892405/A_Sad_Set_of_Ruffians_Convicts_and_Morality_in_the_Port_Phillip_District?f_ri=60115", "dom_id": "work_5892405", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6831675, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Rogers", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "ThomasRogers", "display_name": "Thomas Rogers", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/ThomasRogers?f_ri=60115", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6831675/2733168/29866341/s65_thomas.rogers.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60115, "name": "Australian colonial history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 467295, "name": "Australian colonial and convict history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_colonial_and_convict_history?f_ri=60115", "nofollow": false}]}]
