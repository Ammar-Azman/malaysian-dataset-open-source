Young people literature rewrites \u201csocial and cultural history for the purpose of shaping the present\u201d (Stephens 1996, 181) and can thus mediate the transformation of attitudes and values, or confirm existing ones (Macintyre 2011, 352) such as the evolution of multiculturalism. Indeed, Pearce (2003) has argued that multicultural representation is at a third stage in which \u201cethnicity is not a marker of cultural difference but an accepted part of Australian life\u201d (246), having gone beyond two previous stages that had \u201csuperficial or cosmetic\u201d (Fish 1997, 378) depictions of multiculturalism such as stories centred on Anglo-Celtic protagonists benefiting from an exotic ethnic other, or told from the point of view of an \u201cethnic\u201d insider by Anglo-Celtic writers (Stephens 1996). \nHowever, I will argue that multiculturalism and its representations have not reached such a stage. Alice Pung\u2019s young adult fictional novel Laurinda (2014) showcases the covert racism that Australia\u2019s politics of multiculturalism still conceal under its well-intentioned but superficial acceptation of ethnic minorities \u201cby virtue of Othering\u201d (Ang 2001: 139) into its Anglo-Celtic structure. While set in the 90s, the protagonist Lucy Lam, a second-generation Chinese-Vietnamese teenager, is subjected to many instances of covert racism (Dunn et al. 2004) that still occur nowadays. Those instances will be analysed in key extracts that feature food due to its historical use in the articulation of attitudes throughout Australia\u2019s changing relationship with immigration and its Asian neighbours.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57022201, "asset_id": 37070988, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 808561, "first_name": "Astrid", "last_name": "Schwegler Casta\u00f1er", "domain_name": "uib-es", "page_name": "AstridSchwegler", "display_name": "Astrid Schwegler Casta\u00f1er", "profile_url": "https://uib-es.academia.edu/AstridSchwegler?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/808561/20098944/19856610/s65_astrid.schwegler_casta_er.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4255, "name": "Children's and Young Adult Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_and_Young_Adult_Literature?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43678, "name": "Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 37070856, "title": "Asian Australian Representation in New Media: Natalie Tran and YouTube", "created_at": "2018-07-18T06:24:23.034-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37070856/Asian_Australian_Representation_in_New_Media_Natalie_Tran_and_YouTube?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_37070856", "summary": "Media play a significant role as a mediating site where social and cultural perceptions are defined and negotiated in the process of identity construction, both at national and individual levels (Cottle 2000). Media help define national norms by spreading societies\u2019 central ideologies. For that reason, analysing issues of under- and misrepresentation of minorities in media is crucial for a multicultural society such as Australia since those representations are tightly linked to postcolonial concerns over ethnicity and national identity (Law 2009).\nAsian Australians\u2019 non-existent or stereotypical representations that range from the \u201cmodel minority\u201d to the \u201cperpetual foreigner\u201d are often criticized for not providing positive images for the second-generation Asian Australian youth (Guo and Harlow 2014: 285). This is why minorities benefit from using alternative media such as the ones found on the internet, with platforms such as YouTube where users can share self-generated content. This convergent media environment where users are given \u201ccollective negotiating power\u201d can help minorities create their own \u201cmultiple, subaltern counter-publics in which they can articulate their identities and debate ideas\u201d (Guo and Harlow 2014: 284).\nIndeed, YouTube hosts representations of Asians that depart from stereotypes. Several cases have been studied from the Asian American context (Guo and Harlow 2014) but there is a lack of research in the Australian context despite having one of the most famous hyphenated English-speaking Asian on YouTube, Natalie Tran. Tran has appeared in the Australian press under headlines such as \u201cOur Natalie raking in $100,000 a year from YouTube\u201d (Moses 2010) and has worked with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to launch an advisory app. \nI will argue that through her humour of the ordinary, she seems to provide a model for second-generation Asians Australians. She does so by departing from stereotypes and deliberately normalizing her experience of Australianness by simply coming across as an \u201cordinary\u201d person living in Australia as opposed to the Asian other, which she expresses as having \u201ca big impact on who you are as a person [\u2026] because it is the first thing people notice when they see you\u201d (Tran 2015). This might unexpectedly be due to her perspective as daughter of Vietnamese refugees, whom she has credited with giving her a sense of the absurd that highlights what is invisible to the Australian mainstream (Tran 2015). Her humorous depiction of life and awareness can be looked at from the theme of food, which is particularly relevant in Australia\u2019s superficial multiculturalism that uses food as a way to include the other into the white hegemony as the added Asian \u201cspice\u201d (hooks 2006: 366) to the mainstream Australian dish. Many of her videos feature Australian food such as lamingtons and indirectly transmits the message that it is normal for Asian Australians to eat \u201cAussie\u201d food. While Tran provides a relatable non-stereotypical model, she does reproduce Australia\u2019s multiculturalism that leaves the Anglo-Celtic, ethnically-unmarked centre intact.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57022120, "asset_id": 37070856, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 808561, "first_name": "Astrid", "last_name": "Schwegler Casta\u00f1er", "domain_name": "uib-es", "page_name": "AstridSchwegler", "display_name": "Astrid Schwegler Casta\u00f1er", "profile_url": "https://uib-es.academia.edu/AstridSchwegler?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/808561/20098944/19856610/s65_astrid.schwegler_casta_er.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42350, "name": "Youtube", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youtube?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43678, "name": "Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 76995652, "title": "Chinatown unbound: trans-Asian urbanism in the age of China", "created_at": "2022-04-19T14:19:49.015-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76995652/Chinatown_unbound_trans_Asian_urbanism_in_the_age_of_China?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_76995652", "summary": "Chinatown, as a distinctive urban space, exists in almost all major cities in Western countries.

perception of oneself and others as well as of the nation since \u201cattitudes and behaviours are shaped by a confluence of personal characteristics, direct contact with immediate environments and consumption of media products\u201d (Klocker 2014, 39). Australian Communications and Media Authority, which regulates media and communications, seems to be aware of this as television stations must comply with a quota of domestically-produced content in order to develop and reflect \u201ca sense of Australian identity, character and cultural diversity\u201d (Screen Australia 2016). Yet, despite the acknowledgment of the relevance of television in the formation of national identity, which includes cultural diversity, that is, multiculturalism, Australian television has been repeatedly accused of \u201cadhering to a \u2018white Australian policy\u2019\u201d (Klocker 2014, 34; Law 2015; Soutphommasane 2016). \nWhile there has been an increase in the number of Asian-Australians on food-related shows, the realm of dramatic entertainment suffers from a lack of Asian-Australians, who, when they are cast, usually play stereotypical roles that limit them to being \u201cexotic adornments\u201d (Soutphommasane 2016). This type of restricted representation reflects Australia\u2019s multicultural policy, which has a history of welcoming cultural diversity in the form of superficial \u201cpasta and polka\u201d activities (Jupp 2002). Indeed, in its beginning, the \u201cacceptance\u201d of immigrants and minorities was symbolised through the consumption of ethnic food, understood as exotic in opposition to the non-ethnic and \u201cneutral\u201d Anglo-Celtic one, in an attempt to \u201clegitimize multiculturalism\u201d (Teo 2003: 153). This has developed into a superficial type of multiculturalism in which the other, non-white and non-Anglo-Celtic, is included by \u201cvirtue of othering\u201d (Ang 1996, 37), that is, minorities are valued for the cultural enrichment, the exoticism, spice and thus otherness, that they bring to the bland mainstream dish.\nHowever, the TV series SBS\u2019 The Family Law (2016) seems to alter the pattern by having a cast of 90% Asian-Australian characters on a comedy about family life. Indeed, The Family Law is the first TV series where an Asian family is depicted on Australian TV aside from Neighbours (1993). By looking at the TV-series The Law Family and Benjamin Law\u2019s memoir of the same title (2010), it is my purpose to analyse the shift in minorities representations in the media. To do so, I will focus on the appearance of food and foodways, establishing its relation with the culinary rhetoric of Australian multiculturalism. I will also look at Internet-users\u2019 reactions to the TV-series to showcase how its deliberate attempt to avoid the erasing of difference into white mainstream in order to redefine the concept of being Australian is met with racism and resistance.

During the riots, the European miners carried this banner, now owned and exhibited by the Lambing Flat Folk Museum in Young, NSW. Once able to proudly lay claim to \u201cThe Birth of White Australia\u201d, this local museum and country town have struggled to understand themselves and their past as part of a modern multicultural nation.

How do we understand and discuss the historical and contemporary exclusion of particular groups of people in a multicultural society when the primary mode of representation in museums and in commemorations is about inclusion?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38431014, "asset_id": 14813859, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2020417, "first_name": "Karen", "last_name": "Schamberger", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "KarenSchamberger", "display_name": "Karen Schamberger", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/KarenSchamberger?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2020417/666727/827606/s65_karen.schamberger.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16887, "name": "Museums and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums_and_Identity?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 18659, "name": "Australian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_History?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 45176, "name": "Dissonant Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dissonant_Heritage?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 74237, "name": "Cultural Heritage and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_and_Tourism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 113375, "name": "Biography of Objects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography_of_Objects?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 159080, "name": "Australian cultural history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_cultural_history?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 253574, "name": "Chinese-Australian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese-Australian_history?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 445151, "name": "Difficult heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Difficult_heritage?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 1311575, "name": "Young NSW", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_NSW?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 14239168, "title": "An Inconvenient Myth \u2014 The Lambing Flat Riots and the Birth of White Australia", "created_at": "2015-07-20T18:53:14.297-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14239168/An_Inconvenient_Myth_The_Lambing_Flat_Riots_and_the_Birth_of_White_Australia?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_14239168", "summary": "The Lambing Flat riots were a series of violent riots led by European and Australian born miners against Chinese miners from 1860 to 1861 on the Burrangong goldfields in NSW. They led to anti-Chinese immigration legislation in NSW in 1861 and the White Australia policy enacted after Federation in 1901. However, legislation and government policies were not enough to create a shared sense of national identity. After Federation, individual and collective memories of the Lambing Flat riots were re-imagined as a national foundation myth. The town of Young, where the riots had occurred were proud of the role that they played in the foundation of a White Australia. Indeed, residents proudly participated in a film titled \u201cThe Birth of White Australia\u201d (1928) and many memoirs published around this time also refer to the riots as the birth of White Australia. Today, however, pride in this myth has disappeared and the town struggles to redefine itself in a modern multicultural nation, especially when there are increasing interactions with Chinese Australians who want to be acknowledged for the roles they played in the creation of the Australian nation.

The Oriental quest narrative typically features Asia as a redemptive locale for white, masculine figures to alleviate their identity crises. In its touristic form, the Oriental quest offers a metaphor of cultural neocolonialism, whereby the white man's self-analysis is parallelled by his interracial romance with objectified, consumable Asian women. In reading the novel's metafictional and magical-realistic frame, I argue that Bobis adopts strategic exoticism to ironise the therapeutic promise of an Asian journey and portrays alternative heroines who act upon multiple desires. The novel's complication of local-global encounters and modes of story-telling enunciates a transnational ethics of otherness based on empathy. This ethics reflects Bobis's interstitial position as a diasporic-ethnic writer writing within and beyond the Australian literary environment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51419882, "asset_id": 29086392, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3062884, "first_name": "Emily Yu", "last_name": "ZONG", "domain_name": "hkbu", "page_name": "EmilyYuZong", "display_name": "Emily Yu ZONG", "profile_url": "https://hkbu.academia.edu/EmilyYuZong?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3062884/1007029/48397196/s65_emily_yu.zong.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115950, "name": "Exoticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exoticism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 3542992, "title": "Channeling Communities: What uses and gratifications does YouTube offer an Asian Australian Generation Y audience?", "created_at": "2013-05-15T21:37:13.311-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3542992/Channeling_Communities_What_uses_and_gratifications_does_YouTube_offer_an_Asian_Australian_Generation_Y_audience?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_3542992", "summary": "This thesis explores the uses and gratifications offered by YouTube to an Asian Australian generation Y audience so as to understand their needs, and expectations of media. Whilst ethnic media plays a significant role in the Asian Australian community, previous studies suggest that generation Y are turning to alternatives because of differences between their media needs and those of previous generations of diaspora. Lack of Asian diasporic representation in mainstream media, and the popularity of Asian diasporic YouTube channels suggest that an alternative for Asian diasporic youth lies in YouTube, an emerging area in which there is a present lack of research. The investigation consists of a literature review, and an autoethnographic study of the researcher as a member of Asian Australian generation Y, which is analysed using uses and gratifications theory and autoethnography. The findings suggest that YouTube provides an alternative for an Asian Australian generation Y audience through channels run by Asian diasporic creatives, which meets significant social needs of the new generation by bridging the two cultures through the formation of an Asian diasporic identity, and fostering community amongst Asian diasporic youth.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31263375,

Studies as a dynamic and cross-disciplinary field. Previous analytical work relating to Asians in Australia was most often about Asian communities rather than by or with them. Such work concentrated on the sociological and demographic aspects of Asian groups in Australia, while the cultural production of these same groups remained omitted from analyses of Australian art, literature, and performance. \"Australian Studies\" was by no means neglectful of race, but consideration of Asian-Australian material within this field was mostly limited to historical accounts about representations of Asians by (non-Asian) Australian. Similarly, \"Asian Studies\", despite undergoing significant disciplinary growth during the 1980s, focused almost exclusively on modes of Asian impact or influence on Australia, or vice versa. This work was cast in terms of specific regional studies and almost always excluded examination of the cultural practices and/or socio-political concerns. of Australians of Asian descent. That both Australian Studies and Asian Studies implicitly placed Asian peoples in Australia outside their theoretical purview ensured that the terms \"Asian\" and \"Australian\" continued to signify mutually exclusive categories.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64594336, "asset_id": 22898272, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40668844, "first_name": "Helen", "last_name": "Gilbert", "domain_name": "royalholloway", "page_name": "HelenGilbert", "display_name": "Helen Gilbert", "profile_url": "https://royalholloway.academia.edu/HelenGilbert?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40668844/11079290/12363898/s65_helen.gilbert.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 947, "name": "Theatre Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11538, "name": "Postcolonial Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theatre?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34114938, "title": "An Etymology of \" Asian Australian \" Through Associational Histories Connecting Australia to Asia", "created_at": "2017-08-02T23:28:23.928-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34114938/An_Etymology_of_Asian_Australian_Through_Associational_Histories_Connecting_Australia_to_Asia?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_34114938", "summary": "This article explores the contested public uses of the phrase \u201cAsian\nAustralian\u201d and the relationship between Asia and Australia through\nthe lens of local community associations, their objectives,\npublications and activities.

In particular, the novel portrays class as a cultural component mobilised to privilege middle-class and cosmo-multicultural culture over working-class and suburban culture. Such discursive shifts highlight the dynamic definition of minority status while, at the same time, reveal the limits of the imagined nation presumed as white. In my close reading of Teo's narrative, ethnic subjects are captivated in a dialectic of protestation-abjection whereby old and new forms of cultural myths reproduce stereotyped difference and disarticulate ethnic self-delineation. The ideal of cosmo-multiculturalism, with its premise on a consumerist logic, immobilises difference as a fetishised object to be hailed, performed, savoured, but ultimately spat out undigested. Elaborating on contradictions within an ideology of liberal multiculturalism, I illustrate how the novel constitutes a re-signifying project that presents difference and abjection as transformative sources of national legitimacy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55233723, "asset_id": 23070964, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3062884, "first_name": "Emily Yu", "last_name": "ZONG", "domain_name": "hkbu", "page_name": "EmilyYuZong", "display_name": "Emily Yu ZONG", "profile_url": "https://hkbu.academia.edu/EmilyYuZong?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3062884/1007029/48397196/s65_emily_yu.zong.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3764, "name": "Asian American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_American_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 18183, "name": "Discourse of multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse_of_multiculturalism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 28660, "name": "Asian American Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_American_Literature?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 86024, "name": "Model Minority", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Model_Minority?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 41659157, "title": "UNDER REPRESENTATION OF ASIAN-AUSTRALIANS AND INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS IN NSW PARLIAMENT (2015)", "created_at": "2020-01-17T03:47:29.277-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41659157/UNDER_REPRESENTATION_OF_ASIAN_AUSTRALIANS_AND_INDIGENOUS_AUSTRALIANS_IN_NSW_PARLIAMENT_2015_?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_41659157", "summary": "Traditionally Australia has adopted a policy of assimilation towards migrants and ethnic minorities including the Indigenous Australian population.

However, Hsu-Ming Teo\u2019s novel Behind the Moon (2005) presents an ambivalent use of the food metaphor that seemingly exposes the issues of equating food to identity, particularly to ethnic and national identity. The three main adolescent characters, whose development the novel follows, make use of foodways and of food imagery to communicate and express their views in order to belong as well as to, paradoxically, articulate their unsuccessful attempts at said belonging. The ambivalence of food in association to the failure to belong, despite a seemingly optimistic ending, leads to an important questioning of the Australian multicultural discourse, particularly in its shift to a transcultural context. This questioning is particularly relevant in a socio-political context in which the positive aspects of multiculturalism are illustrated through \u201cfood benefits\u201d, that is, the diversification and sophistication of Australian cuisine, as a symptomatic and apt digesting of the non-white immigration and the resulting mixing of cultures, while the fears and oppositions to this ethnic mingling are also expressed through food imagery such as the indigestion, which has replaced and/or combined with the no-longer acceptable tropes such as inundation, contamination, and disorder (Edwards et al. 2000). This positive/negative ambivalence of food in relation to ethnicity is seen through the characters and made explicit through their relation to other issues related to bodies such as skin color, homosexuality in relation to cleanliness and weight, being at its most troubling in a parodic metaphorical cannibalism of Princess Diana, which embodies an act of cultural appropriation (Wagner 2007,44). Indeed, identitary anxieties at both the individual level and the national level can be seen as being represented by the anxiety of the consumer, the \u201cgastro-anomie\u201d as coined by Fischler (1980)\u2013 and the escapism a superficial multiculturalism such as Stanley Fish\u2019s \u201cboutique multiculturalism\u201d (1997), Barry Troyna\u2019s \u201cthree S's\u201d (1984) and Hassan Hage (1997) \u201ccosmo-multiculturalism\u201d, which uses ethnic restaurants as class marker by cosmopolitan consumers. The unquestioned reliance on food metaphors perpetrates \u201cWestern visualizing and rhetorical practices [\u2026] from the normative model of white hegemony\u201d that reproduces and consolidates the differences the \u201cOther\u201d (Morris 2008: 503), including through exotization. Food as a conceptual metaphor (Stockwell 2005) has then a real impact on how people view the world since its metaphorical projections help interpret and structure one\u2019s vision of reality. The observation of the characters\u2019 relation to food, ethnicity and identity through the prism of superficial multiculturalism in a shifting transcultural context focused on textual fragments related to food and bodies metaphors reveals Teo\u2019s attempt at introducing complexities into a simplistic relation between food, ethnicity and identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57021297, "asset_id": 37070091, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 808561, "first_name": "Astrid", "last_name": "Schwegler Casta\u00f1er", "domain_name": "uib-es", "page_name": "AstridSchwegler", "display_name": "Astrid Schwegler Casta\u00f1er", "profile_url": "https://uib-es.academia.edu/AstridSchwegler?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/808561/20098944/19856610/s65_astrid.schwegler_casta_er.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43678, "name": "Food Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29874103, "title": "A Bay of Whispers: Seascape in Simone Lazaroo's The Australian Fianc\u00e9", "created_at": "2016-11-15T20:46:00.595-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29874103/A_Bay_of_Whispers_Seascape_in_Simone_Lazaroos_The_Australian_Fianc%C3%A9?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_29874103", "summary": "The ocean as a border in Australia has been gaining increased attention, not only with the arrival of asylum seekers by boat and the relentless government policies to prevent this, but also the connections with Asia that Australia's part of Oceania suggests. Recent scholarship by critics such as Elizabeth DeLoughrey, Suvendrini Perera, and Elizabeth McMahon explore the way representations of oceans can evoke, on the one hand, this doubled sense of insularity and threat, but on the other possibility and connection. However, while some of this analysis may be new and specifically addressing recent events, depictions of the sea that utilize such a doubled sense of intimacy and conflict have a significant history in Australian literature. One such example is Simone Lazaroo's The Australian Fianc\u00e9, a book that deals overtly with the White Australia Policy and the aftermath of WWII. Existing scholarship has tended to focus on the significant discussions around racism, exclusion, and gender in the novel, but as of yet there has been no sustained discussion of the representation of the sea and its relevance to such debates. Rather than being a simple backdrop, the depiction of the sea in Lazaroo's novel manifests the doubled threat and connection discussed by DeLoughrey, Perera, and McMahon.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50341238, "asset_id": 29874103, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56717759, "first_name": "Rosalind", "last_name": "McFarlane", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "RosalindMcFarlane", "display_name": "Rosalind McFarlane", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/RosalindMcFarlane?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56717759/14912149/15677371/s65_rosalind.mcfarlane.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3773, "name": "Literary Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Criticism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8032, "name": "Cross-Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19064, "name": "Women Writers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_Writers?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25530, "name": "Intimacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intimacy?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 88871, "name": "Feminist Literary Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Literary_Criticism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 255793, "name": "Transnationalism, Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism_Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 271756, "name": "Western Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Australia?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 2570326, "name": "Ocean Imagery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ocean_Imagery?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 2570327, "name": "Sea Imagery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Imagery?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 2570328, "name": "Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 21972347, "title": "Adapting Diaspora: China, Australia, and the American Dream in Mao's Last Dancer", "created_at": "2016-02-14T19:46:34.247-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/21972347/Adapting_Diaspora_China_Australia_and_the_American_Dream_in_Maos_Last_Dancer?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_21972347", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42686569, "asset_id": 21972347, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44936, "first_name": "Jane Chi Hyun", "last_name": "Park", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "JaneChiHyunPark", "display_name": "Jane Chi Hyun  Park", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/JaneChiHyunPark?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44936/14282/3413794/s65_jane_chi_hyun.park.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 390, "name": "American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 75380615, "title": "Disguising desire: Gender and imperialism in Jill Shearer's 'Shimada", "created_at": "2022-04-03T23:27:58.289-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75380615/Disguising_desire_Gender_and_imperialism_in_Jill_Shearers_Shimada?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_75380615", "summary": "Dale, Leigh and Gilbert, Helen (1992).

In popular Western wisdom, the restaurants, pagodas, and red lanterns are intrinsically equated with a self-contained, immigrant Chinese district, an alien enclave of \u2018the East\u2019 in \u2018the West\u2019. By the 1980s, when these Western societies had largely given up their racially discriminatory immigration policies and opened up to Asian immigration, the dominant conception of Chinatown was no longer that of an abject ethnic ghetto: rather, Chinatown was now seen as a positive expression of multicultural heritage and difference. \n\nBy the early 21st century, however, these spatial and cultural constructions of Chinatown as an \u2018other\u2019 space \u2013 whether negative or positive \u2013 have been thoroughly destabilised by the impacts of accelerating globalisation and transnational migration. This book provides a timely and much-needed paradigm shift in this regard, through an in-depth case study of Sydney\u2019s Chinatown. It speaks to the growing multilateral connections that link Australia and Asia (and especially China) together; not just economically, but also socially and culturally, as a consequence of increasing transnational flows of people, money, ideas and things. Further, the book elicits a particular sense of a placein Sydney\u2019s Chinatown: that of an inte-connected world in which Western and Asian realms inhabit each other, and in which the orientalist legacy is being reconfigured in new deployments and more complex delimitations.. As such, Chinatown Unbound engages with, and contributes to making sense of, the epochal shift in the global balance of power towards Asia, especially China.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30135764, "first_name": "Kay", "last_name": "Anderson", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "KayAnderson", "display_name": "Kay Anderson", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/KayAnderson?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30135764/8711990/9730676/s65_kay.anderson.jpg"}, {"id": 125470, "first_name": "Ien", "last_name": "Ang", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "IenAng", "display_name": "Ien Ang", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/IenAng?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/125470/33522/30798/s65_ien.ang.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 1712, "name": "Globalisation and cultural change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_cultural_change?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 13725, "name": "China Going Global", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_Going_Global?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 73676, "name": "Cultural Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Globalization?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 87976, "name": "Chinatowns", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinatowns?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 7119623, "title": "Australian Soldiers in Asia-Pacific in World War II", "created_at": "2014-05-21T19:16:38.346-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7119623/Australian_Soldiers_in_Asia_Pacific_in_World_War_II?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_7119623", "summary": "Half a million Australians encountered a new world when they entered Asia and the Pacific during World War II: different peoples, cultures, languages and religions chafing under the grip of colonial rule.

Abstract: In her second novel, Behind the Moon (2000), Hsu-Ming Teo explores the identity construction of three teenage friends and how they defy the notion of the \" ideal \" Australian as a heterosexual, Protestant, white, English-speaking, Australian-born of British ancestry young adult person. Set in the western suburbs of Sydney in the 1990s, the three friends are an example of the multicultural society of the time: Justin Cheong, the son of a Chinese-Singaporean family who arrived in Australia with the Business Migration Programme; Tien Ho, a refugee girl of Chinese-Vietnamese and Afro-Cajun-Creole-American ancestry; and Nigel \" Gibbo \" Gibson, the son of an Anglo-Australian father and an English mother. The novel tackles different relations among these characters and their families during their teenage years and especially as young adults. This paper seeks to analyse the evolution of the identities of Justin, Tien and \" Gibbo \" through the notions of belonging, gender construction and sexuality. In order to do so, the main theories applied will be the insights on homosexuality and on masculinities of Maria Pallotta-Chiarolli (1995) and Raewyn W. Connell (1995) and Manuel Castells\u02bc (2010) identity construction theory.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41678469, "asset_id": 21029349, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1678184, "first_name": "Caty", "last_name": "Ribas", "domain_name": "cesag", "page_name": "CatyRibas", "display_name": "Caty Ribas", "profile_url": "https://cesag.academia.edu/CatyRibas?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1678184/580892/721937/s65_caty.ribas.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 255793, "name": "Transnationalism, Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism_Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 11011511, "title": "Thailand", "created_at": "2015-02-23T05:29:05.338-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11011511/Thailand?f_ri=141957", "dom_id": "work_11011511", "summary": "An annual review of Thailand-Australia relations", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36738408, "asset_id": 11011511, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3274774, "first_name": "Kevin", "last_name": "Hewison", "domain_name": "unc", "page_name": "KevinHewison", "display_name": "Kevin Hewison", "profile_url": "https://unc.academia.edu/KevinHewison?f_ri=141957", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3274774/1085084/1353289/s65_kevin.hewison.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 121161, "name": "Australia's relations with Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australias_relations_with_Asia?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=141957", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 437730, "name": "Australian-Asian Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian-Asian_Relations?f_ri=141957"}, {"id": 1757742, "name": "Australia-Thailand relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia-Thailand_relations?f_ri=141957"}]}, {"id": 41257973, "title": "Eurasian Deathistory;

Viriya is inspired by dual sources of beauty.

Moving between photography, film, and sculpture, his potent imagery often invites us into an unsettling corporeal zone which lies in that liminal space between seduction and repulsion, detachment and obsession, the familiar and the strange. It is through this field of seemingly contradictory relations that the artist is able to subvert our usual relationship to the corporeal and the socialised identities associated with it. Strongly informed by the philosophies of critical theory, Leong's art harnesses our affective response to the 'abject', that which unsettles conventional concepts of identity and culture. In relation to the body, the abject represents socially-defined 'taboo' elements of the self that are symbolically separated from the subject. Through the use of 'leaky' substances such as blood, milk and honey, Leong's images of the body reinstate the inherent significance of abject elements to the corporeal order. In so doing, he disarticulates our established ideas concerning identity, in particular questioning accepted notions of 'race', 'gender' and 'colour'. He points to the ways in which these socially-defined concepts are sited in and on the body and negotiated via the body's socialised relations with other bodies. In tackling stereotypes of identity, Leong's art is also a critique of fixed and totalising categories of identity, pointing instead to the more complex reality of identity as a fluid and shifting practice encompassing multiple and flexible ways of cultural belonging and being in the world. Within his native Australian cultural landscape, Leong's art has been intimately concerned with explorations of 'Asian-Australian' identity in particular and often based on his personal experiences negotiating hegemonic frames of Australian 'whiteness'. The artist cites early childhood experiences where despite 'feeling Australian' his corporeal difference from the hegemonic white culture would often betray his sense of cultural belonging.

This \u201cprojected life-long\u201d work belongs to the tradition of the \u201clife-poem\u201d which has emerged in late twentieth-century American (and, with Carruthers, Australian) avant-garde writing. Perhaps its most accomplished practitioner is the American poet Rachel Blau DuPlessis, whose five-volume poem Drafts, which ended with \u2018Draft 114\u2019 in 2014, in many ways defined the genre. Charles Olson\u2019s Maximus and Ezra Pound\u2019s Cantos, the most obvious precedents in American literary modernism, are both archaic not only in their subject matter but in their attitude. Wrestling as they do with the writer\u2019s responsibility to continue a tradition and be its next instantiation, they are poetic monuments attesting to great histories. DuPlessis, over more than two decades, took it upon herself to produce a living edifice which is constantly re-writing, re-drafting itself, and that dynamism is possibly her strongest mark on Carruthers in this first volume.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 911493, "first_name": "A.J.", "last_name": "Carruthers", "domain_name": "nanjing", "page_name": "AJCarruthers", "display_name": "A.J.
