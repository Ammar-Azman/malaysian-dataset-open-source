Contributors draw on the seminal work of Donald E. Brown whose major monograph on the sultanate was published in 1970 and marked the beginnings of advanced sociological, anthropological and historical research on Brunei. Among the key issues addressed are status systems, titles and social stratification, Chinese sources for the study of Brunei, Malay oral and written histories and traditions, the symbolism, meanings and origins of coronation rituals, previously unknown sources for the study of Brunei history and the processes of incorporation of minority populations into the sultanate. Contributions by leading scholars of Brunei, Borneo and the wider Indonesian-Malay world, both from within Brunei Darussalam and beyond, address some central preoccupations which Brown raised and which have been the subject of continued debate in Austronesian and Southeast Asian studies. A novel contribution to the study of the history of Brunei Darussalam, this book will be of interest to scholars of Southeast Asian history, Asian history, Colonial and Imperial history and anthropology. Victor T. King is Professor of Borneo Studies at the Institute of Asian Studies , Universiti Brunei Darussalam, and Emeritus Professor of South East Asian Studies, University of Leeds, UK. He is the co-author of The Modern Anthropology of SouthEast Asia (Routledge 2006) and co-editor of the Rou-tledge series Modern Anthropology of SouthEast Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Like the rest of Thai/Malay peninsula, although the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Thailand\u2019s far-south are conservative traditionalists, the size and influence reformist Islam continues to increase. This is particularly the case among urban Malays. While the roots of reformism were sown in the 19th century by luminaries such as Syeikh Daud al-Fatani (1769-1847), and Syeikh Ahmed al-Fatani (1856-1908), the most important reformist personality in the early 20th centuries was Haji Sulong (1895-1945). Since his return from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, Dr Ismail Lutfi Japakiya, the founding of rector of Yala Islamic University (Thailand\u2019s first Islamic university) has emerged as the leader of Saudi style salafism. I conclude by considering the impact of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at, a South Asian revival movement, on Islamic diversity in South Thailand since its arrival in the 1980s. A important point infrequently made in analysis of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at is that both reformists and traditionalists are involved in this important revivalist movement.",

appearances of spirits and ghosts in possession cults, popular rituals and the mass media in contemporary East- and Southeast Asia. The belief in spirits and ghosts, not to mention their magical manipulation, is usually regarded as outspokenly pre-modern. However, the accepted dichotomies such as enchanted tradition \u2013 disenchanted modernity, rationality \u2013 superstition, authentic religion \u2013 magical practices are challenged by the observation that processes of modernization in Southeast Asia are not only accompanied by diverse religious revivals but also by spirit cults and the interventions of gods, ghosts and ancestors. It seems that in progressing economies and highly \u201cmodern\u201d countries, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan or Japan, not only private monetary investments are increasing, but also spiritual investments. Intimate contact to the ancestors is as indispensable as the placation of revengeful ghosts. Against this background, studying spirits and ghosts in Asia\u2019s modernities is perfectly suited for the critical examination of the concept of modernity and its affiliated biased presuppositions themselves.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31601227, "asset_id": 4072136, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2849590, "first_name": "Peter J.", "last_name": "Br\u00e4unlein", "domain_name": "uni-goettingen", "page_name": "PeterJBr\u00e4unlein", "display_name": "Peter J.

Revunenkova and Alexander K. Ogloblin, University year-mates and life-time friends. Since their graduation in 1961 from the Indonesian philology department, Oriental Faculty of St.Petersburg State University, these two powerful characters have dominated St. Petrsburg Indonesian studies. They have shared with their numerous followers and colleagues their brilliant knowledge of Bahasa Indonesia, deep understanding of traditional and modern life of Nusantara and in the best traditions of hereditary St.Petersburg intelligencia. The present collection of papers resulted from a conference in honor of these, our teachers, mounted by their ex-students and colleagues in 2004. We caught our teachers at surprise, knowing their modest ways and opposition to any kind of celebrations in their honor. This is the reason why there are papers by jubilars in this volume.\r\nAfter a long preparation period this collection of papers finally appears just before the 70-year birth anniversaries of Elena V. Revunenkova and Alexander K. Ogloblin.\r\nThe present book starts the new series of publications named \u00abMaclayevsky Sbornik\u00bb for papers and monographs on Insular Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific.\r\nThe book will be of interest for anthropologists, philologists, linguists, historians and the general reader, interested in traditional and modern culture and languages of Southeast Asia and beyond.\r\n\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30643517, "asset_id": 2640172, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2584335, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "V.

Sovyetskaya Etnografiya, 1981, \u2116 5, pp. 72-83 (In Russian). English summary.\n\nThe paper gives a brief account of data available about seven folk epics of Philippine pagan mountain tribes: the Ifugao Hudhud, Alim and a mythological epic; the Kalingga Ullalim, the Sulod Labaw Donggon, the Bagobo Tuwaang and the Ilianon  Agyu. A pre\u00acliminary analysis of the epics in the light of historical typology is given.\n\nThe main attention is concentrated on the study of the epics functional connections, their role in ritual practice. All the situations where these epics are performed are connec\u00acted either with the life cycle, the agricultural cycle, or with head hunting rites. Hudhud, Alim, Labaw Donggon, Agyu and Tuwaang are all connected with the rites both of the agricultural and the life cycle. Besides this, Hudhud and Alim appear to be attached to the prestige rites. The mythological epic of the Ifugaos forms a part of the head hunting ritual. In the past, the Kalingga Ullalim and the Ilianon Agyu were also connected with head hunting rites, but with the disappearance of head hunting practices they became attached to peace-pact ceremonies. Singing epic \u00abfor entertainment\u00bb in more or less pure form is to be met only among the Sulod.\n\nAll the rites with which epic singing is connected are based on a belief in the increase of reproduction by magical means.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34330724, "asset_id": 2564225, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 63625865, "asset_id": 2564225, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2584335, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "V.

This religious group was largely influenced by Buddhism, hence its vegetarian halls are widely regarded by the public and by practitioners as Buddhist. Vegetarian halls and their scriptures are, however, objects of contestation in the studies of Chinese Buddhist history in China and in Southeast Asia, due to their syncretic religious content. Nevertheless, such halls and their religious networks have generated a multidirectional flow of cultural, economic, and religious resources that remains largely unexplored; their vernacular texts (such as precious scrolls \u5bf6\u5377) show how Buddhist ideas were localized, adapted, and circulated. This paper shows how: 1) scriptures of the Three Teachings (sanjiao \u4e09\u6559) were integrated, conceptualized, and reconciled in the local Buddhist scene; 2) the scriptures address issues pertaining to gender and religion; and 3) indigenous Buddhist scriptures were significant.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65881791, "asset_id": 45344283, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81467764, "first_name": "Ying Ruo", "last_name": "SHOW", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "YingRuoShow", "display_name": "Ying Ruo SHOW", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/YingRuoShow?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81467764/19689316/20042030/s65_ying_ruo.show.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2837, "name": "Chinese Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Religions?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2882, "name": "Chinese Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Buddhism?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7014095, "title": "Indic, Islamic and Thai Influences [Extract of Chapter 2 from Muslim Merit-making in Thailand's Far-south]", "created_at": "2014-05-11T12:59:20.529-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7014095/Indic_Islamic_and_Thai_Influences_Extract_of_Chapter_2_from_Muslim_Merit_making_in_Thailands_Far_south_?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_7014095", "summary": "This chapter describes Patani\u2019s Indic, Islamic and Thai pasts. The argu- ment is that the Malay kerajaan of Patani was similar to\u2014rather than distinct from\u2014other port city-states on the peninsula and islands of Southeast Asia where a Sanskrit cosmopolis existed for a millennium before the earliest chapters of Islam\u2019s Southeast Asian expansion. Islam also circulated east and west of Patani through trade between the Middle East and China via the Indian Ocean. This created a range of Indian/Arab/Malay creole communities whose members played key roles in the adoption of, or adhesion to, Islam in Southeast Asian port city-states like Patani. India\u2019s importance to the arrival of Islam to the Thai/Malay peninsula relates to what Islam came to, where Islam initially came from, and who Islam came through. Rather than refer to conversion, I refer to an adhesion to, or adoption of, Islam. The impact of Thai and Islamic influences in Patani/Pattani following its defeat in 1785 is described. The details of the process through which the Malay Kingdom (SM. kerajaan) of   became the Thai Province of Pattani, including Bangkok\u2019s legislative and administrative initiatives are also provided. A central con- cern of this chapter is to highlight the fact that these developments coincided with a period of revolution and reform in the Hijaz. I describe how these developments impacted local religious life and thought through local luminaries such as Shaykh Daud Al-Fatani, Shaykh Ahmad Al-Fatani and Haji Sulong. The methodologies and contributions of present-day reformist revivalist movements are also described.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33674643, "asset_id": 7014095, "asset_type": "Work",

Negritos of Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand, but attention is also paid to other parts of Southeast Asia. I present a survey of current views on the \u201cnegrito\u201d phenotype\u2014is it single or many? If the phenotype is many (as now seems likely), it must have resulted from parallel evolution in the several different regions where it has been claimed to exist. This would suggest (contrary to certain views that have been expressed on the basis of very partial genetic data) that the phenotype originated recently and by biologically well-authenticated processes from within the neighbouring populations. Whole-genome and physical-anthropological research currently support this view. Regardless of whether the negrito phenotype is ancient or recent\u2014and to the extent that it retains any valid biological reality (which is worth questioning)\u2014explanations are still needed for its continued distinctiveness. In the Malay Peninsula, a distinctive \u201cSemang\u201d societal pattern followed by most, but not all, so-called Negritos may have been responsible for this by shaping familial, breeding and demographic patterns to suit the two main modes of environmental appropriation that they have followed, probably for some millennia: nomadic foraging in the forest, and facultative dependence on exchange or labour relations with neighbouring populations. The known distribution of \u201cnegritos\u201d in the Malay Peninsula is limited to areas within relatively easy reach of archaeologically authenticated premodern transpeninsular trading and portage routes, as well as of other non-negrito, Aslian-speaking populations engaged in swidden farming. This suggests that their continued distinctiveness has resulted from a wish to maintain a complementary advantage vis-\u00e0-vis other, less specialised populations. Nevertheless, a significant degree of discordance exists between the associated linguistic, societal-tradition and biological patterns, which suggests that other factors have also been at play.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32873501, "asset_id": 5264122, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 403289, "first_name": "Geoffrey", "last_name": "Benjamin", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "GeoffreyBenjamin", "display_name": "Geoffrey Benjamin", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/GeoffreyBenjamin?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/403289/357126/13699011/s65_geoffrey.benjamin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5504, "name": "Comparative Genomics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Genomics?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5603, "name": "Endangered Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endangered_Languages?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 15406, "name": "Social Organisation (Archaeology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Organisation_Archaeology_?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 32948, "name": "Hunter-Gatherers (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hunter-Gatherers_Anthropology_?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 36595, "name": "Endangered languages/cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endangered_languages_cultures?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 64117, "name": "Orang Asli", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orang_Asli?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 95891, "name": "Mon-Khmer linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon-Khmer_linguistics?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 231456, "name": "Negritos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Negritos?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 419213, "name": "Etnik Orang Asli Di Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Etnik_Orang_Asli_Di_Malaysia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 1848766, "title": "\u201cAnthropology and Fiction: An Interview with Amitav Ghosh,\u201d Cultural Anthropology, Vol. 27, Issue 3, pp. 535\u2013541.

It also considers questions of community in the lead-up to and the aftermath of the catastrophic Pol Pot period. The book's essays have been inspired by the life and works of the late May Ebihara, who was a pioneer in the anthropology of rural Cambodia, and who was a friend and mentor to all of the contributors to the collection. Taken as a whole, like much of Ebihara's pathbreaking work, this book deals with processes of grassroots transformation.

"This chapter aims to both reflect upon my own fieldwork among the Bugis of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, and my engagement with the scholarship of the ethnologist Christian Pelras, who wrote extensively on South Sulawesi culture and history. Explicit about his task of translating one culture to another, Pelras took an 'ethnographic' approach to his research, collecting huge amounts of information that he used in order to describe. His wide focus and attempts to translate one culture to another appear to reflect the European-based attempts to understand the 'other', perhaps like a museum of ethnology. By contrast, scholars of my generation are less concerned with describing, more critical of sources, look to solve particular research problems in a context that may not necessarily be our own, and use skills, approaches and techniques developed elsewhere. In particular, I discuss my engagement with Pelras's work on orality and writing and his attempts to reconstruct the South Sulawesi past. While the chapter is critical of some of Pelras's work on the Bugis, particularly his attempts at writing history, it pays tribute to other aspects.

The project views the bureaucratization of Islam not simply as a formalization, expansion, and diversification of Islamic institutions, but as a social phenomenon that far transcends its organizational boundaries and informs dynamics of social and cultural change alongside transformations of the very meaning(s) of Islam in state and society. It places the state\u2019s \u201cclassificatory power\u201d and its societal co-production and contestation at the centre of attention and aims to synthesize functional approaches with hermeneutic modes of analysis. While the bureaucratization of Islam is always embedded in and shaped by power-political constellations and political processes, it simultaneously produces social and doctrinal meanings that are unique to its specific discursive arenas.\nThe paper first introduces the anthropology of bureaucracy and elaborates on the absence of studies from this field on state-Islam relations in Southeast Asia; it also considers the potential of bringing these two streams of scholarship into a fruitful dialogue. Second, it presents a case study in Brunei, focusing particularly on Islamization policies, the bureaucratization of a national ideology, and their workings on the micro level. Third, the paper moves on to a regional comparison by illustrating how similar matters are treated very differently by Singapore\u2019s Islamic bureaucracy, despite partially shared features. After a brief note on methodology, the paper concludes that the presented work, while anchored in Brunei and Singapore, has implications for a wider study across, and potentially beyond the region.",

the book, to acknowledge, celebrate and evaluate Professor Donald Brown\u2019s pioneering studies on the Brunei sultanate. It is just over 50 years since Professor Brown undertook anthropological research in Brunei (1967\u20131968) for his Cornell University doctorate, which led to his seminal volume Brunei: The Structure and History of a Bornean Malay Sultanate published by The Brunei Museum as a special monograph in 1970 (see Prologue); it too celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. He also wrote more than 20 related papers on the history and social organisation of Brunei. These have become standard references for our understanding and appreciation of the society, culture and history of the Brunei sultanate. The chapter proposes that in any scholarly historical and social-science-based research on Brunei, and on historically and culturally related territories in Borneo and on Malay states more generally, Brown\u2019s work is frequently cited. Though other studies were undertaken after the publication of Brown\u2019s monograph, without his crucial scholarly contribution we would have had no major points of reference before the declaration of the full independence of Negara Brunei Darussalam from the British Crown on 1 January 1984.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65745848, "asset_id": 45144722, "asset_type": "Work",

and performance, as both syntax and poetics, across a wide range of phenomena experienced by speakers. In the Bit language, spoken in Laos and China by approximately 2,400 people, there is a rich vocabulary of expressives, or ideophones, used to depict a lack of movement, action or agency. In doing so, Bit speakers define silence in terms of sound, stillness in terms of potential or past movement, and absence through the experience of expectation or habit. It is widely recognized that silence is not simply the lack of sound, but this analysis shows how culturally specific conceptions of the meaning of silence can be represented with the marked poetic language of expressives to account for the experience of various forms of absence. As such the analysis is an exploration of how ethnopoetics and semiotic ideology intersect in the production of Bit linguistic culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86948653, "asset_id":

"summary": "In spite of a United Nations sponsored transition to democracy and peace in the early 1990s, violence remains a ubiquitous feature of the Cambodian landscape in the posttransitional era. Contra the commonplace Orientalist renderings that suggest an inherently violent and authoritarian culture underpins Cambodia\u2019s failure to consolidate democracy and its ongoing encounters with violence, this study advances an alternative interpretation. Combining (post)Marxian and poststructural theoretical approaches, this study proceeds as a (post)anarchist critique through a series of distinct yet thematically connected chapters that examine the intersections between neoliberalism and violence, and the (re)productions of space that both result from and contribute to their entanglement. This critical approach reveals how neoliberalization plays a paramount role in the continuation of violent geographies in Cambodia\u2019s contemporary political economy. The first half of this study theorizes the geographies of neoliberalism and violence through an analysis of the discursive procession of neoliberalism and the imaginative geographies that position it as the sole providence of nonviolence. In orienting itself as a \u2018civilizing\u2019 project, neoliberalism as discourse actively manufactures the misrecognition of its violences. Struggles over public space are viewed as a necessary reaction against such symbolic violence, allowing us to relate similar constellations of experiences across space as a potential basis for emancipation, and thereby quicken the pace at which neoliberalism recedes into history. The second half of this study examines the violent geographies of neoliberalism in \u2018postconflict\u2019 Cambodia, bringing empirical focus to the (re)visualizations, (re)administrations, and (re)materializations of space that have informed the neoliberalization of violence in the country. The pretext of security under which marketization proceeded, the asphyxiation of democratic politics through ordered productions of space, the discursive obfuscations of the \u2018culture of violence\u2019 thesis, and Cambodia\u2019s ongoing encounters with primitive accumulation are all revealed to inform the exceptional and exemplary violences of neoliberalization. Ultimately, this study illuminates the multiplicity of ways in which the processes of neoliberalization are suffused with violence. A critical appraisal of neoliberalism\u2019s capacity for violence can open geographical imaginations to the possibility of (re)producing space in ways that make possible a transformative and emancipatory politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30655270, "asset_id": 2654259, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 271934, "first_name": "Simon", "last_name": "Springer", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "SimonSpringer", "display_name": "Simon  Springer", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/SimonSpringer?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/271934/56494/36120073/s65_simon.springer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4081, "name": "Khmer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5649, "name": "South-East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South-East_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 13078, "name": "Peacekeeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacekeeping?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 20520, "name": "Peace & Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies-3?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 183540, "name": "Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanitarian_Assistance_and_Disaster_Relief?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 537676, "name": "Stabilization and Reconstruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stabilization_and_Reconstruction?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 931986, "name": "Post Conflict Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Issues?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 48789093, "title": "\u2018The Disease will Come!\u2019 Contingency, Irony, and Challenging Closures in Ethnographic Writing", "created_at": "2021-05-06T02:07:32.918-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48789093/_The_Disease_will_Come_Contingency_Irony_and_Challenging_Closures_in_Ethnographic_Writing?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_48789093", "summary": "Drawing on a brief ethnographic encounter in north-western Laos, this paper argues that fleeting encounters in the field can bring unforeseen topics and phenomena to the fieldworker\u2019s attention \u2013 in this case rumours circulating about an antidote to the impending coronavirus disease.

The Ifugaos are wet-rice cultivators that have preserved the traditional culture better than any neighboring tribe of Northern Luzon, leave alone the lowlanders. They still practice dancing to the music of brass gongs \"gangha\". Despite the fact that the head-hunting is already out of use, ritual practices of the headhunting cycle have survived. In the cases of feud which still occur the Ifugaos use a sacred wooden gong \"balangbang\". The sound of this instrument is believed to trigger the new killings in the headhunting cycle. One can find in Ifugao such an idiosyncratic instrument as earth cither.\r\nPeter the Great Museum has a Jew's harp and three ritual clappers from Ifugao.\r\nThe Jew's harp \"bikong\" (N 2316-82) belongs to the collection of Ifugao objects collected by a missionary Mr.Turnball, purchased by the Museum in 1915. This type of Jew's harp is widely spread in the Philippines and in Indonesia. In Ifugao it is primarily used in courting, but also has a ritual use. It is regarded as an attribute of Halupe deities, most of which are the characters of the \"hudhud\", women's epic poetry.\r\nThree ritual or granary clappers \"palipal\" were collected by R.F.Barton (who worked in the Museum since 1930-1941) during his trip to Bitu, Ifugao in 1937. The clappers are used by dry-rice cultivators in planting. For the wet-rice cultivating population of Kiangan the clapper is an important a ritual instrument used in rice cycle rites.\r\nIn Ifugao mythology the clapper is connected with the deities of the Downstream Region, to whom the Ifugaos of old owe most of their rituals and skills. Interestingly enough, the clapper is to be found among the deities of winds, though it would be more natural to find some aerophone in the list. The Ifugao wording depicting the god of wind is very similar of that of the New Guinea Highlanders re sacred flutes. The Indonesian music instruments that combine the characteristics of aerophone and ideophone give a further hint towards the connection of the clapper and a flute.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37068660, "asset_id": 2973938, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2584335, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "V.

Brilliantly illuminating his narrative and analysis with empirical details sourced from original references and fieldwork material in Java (Mandal's chosen site of investigation), the book is all the more admirable when we consider that the author's national and ethnic backgrounds do not coincide with those of the subjects he has assiduously researched, and with whom he poignantly empathises with.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76220958, "asset_id": 63973274, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 216303, "first_name": "Ahmad Fauzi", "last_name": "Abdul Hamid", "domain_name": "usm", "page_name": "AhmadFauziAbdulHamid", "display_name": "Ahmad Fauzi  Abdul Hamid", "profile_url": "https://usm.academia.edu/AhmadFauziAbdulHamid?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/216303/49340/14242984/s65_ahmad_fauzi.abdul_hamid.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2015, "name": "Middle East Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 6818, "name": "Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 43520, "name": "Middle East", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 81467, "name": "Indonesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 215664, "name": "Political Islam in Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Islam_in_Malaysia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 235694, "name": "Malaysian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_history?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 403234, "name": "History of Malaysia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Malaysia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1007845, "name": "Hadrami Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hadrami_Studies?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 45553609, "title": "Fishing the Uplands: A Linguistic Perspective on the Ethno-ichthyology of Northern Laos", "created_at": "2021-03-16T05:52:08.699-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45553609/Fishing_the_Uplands_A_Linguistic_Perspective_on_the_Ethno_ichthyology_of_Northern_Laos?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_45553609", "summary": "The Bit people of northern Laos sometimes refer to themselves as the People of the Fishing Hook. This is a curious autonym for an upland ethnic group in Southeast Asia, who are most commonly known as forest people, with complex indigenous knowledge systems and worldviews encoded in their diverse languages. As livelihoods become increasingly stressed as a result of socio-economic and ecological transformations, the importance of local languages and local knowledge is paramount for their survival. This paper explores the fishing knowledge and practices of the Bit people of northern Laos \u2013 a rural population of approximately 2,400 people speaking an Austroasiatic language \u2013 discussing the confluence of history, livelihoods, social relations and construction of identity that can be observed through their language, language ideologies and linguistic practices. The prominence of fish is striking in the social, natural and cosmological worlds of the Bit. The natural and social ecologies of upland river systems differ from those of the lowland areas, and have remained unstudied. This paper is an investigation of the entanglements between technology, community and ritual, with a particular interest in how these social institutions are encoded in the Bit language. As a broad ethnographic study, the paper explores: representations of Bit identity, which are tied up with fishing, fish-naming practices, gender marking in aquatic lifeforms, mapping of technology to community institutions, linguistic clues to riverine cultural contact, taboos in linguistic change and expressive language used to describe fish.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66030555, "asset_id": 45553609, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 533099, "first_name": "Nathan", "last_name": "Badenoch", "domain_name": "villanova", "page_name": "NathanBadenoch", "display_name": "Nathan Badenoch", "profile_url": "https://villanova.academia.edu/NathanBadenoch?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/533099/190036/14675321/s65_nathan.badenoch.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1625, "name": "Human-Animal Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human-Animal_Relations?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 4711, "name": "Fisheries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fisheries?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 5715, "name": "Community Based Natural Resources Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Based_Natural_Resources_Management?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 7649, "name": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Ecological_Knowledge?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 8331, "name": "Indigenous Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Knowledge?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 9769, "name": "Sociology of Fisheries and Aquaculture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Fisheries_and_Aquaculture?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 17975, "name": "Cognitive Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Anthropology?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 36514, "name": "Ethnoecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnoecology?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 79742, "name": "Fishing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fishing?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 241104, "name": "Austroasiatic languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austroasiatic_languages?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 376988, "name": "Lao Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lao_Studies?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 26367283, "title": "Visions of prosperity and conspiracy in Timor-Leste", "created_at": "2016-06-21T05:32:31.674-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26367283/Visions_of_prosperity_and_conspiracy_in_Timor_Leste?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_26367283", "summary": "In Timor-Leste, visions of radical societal transformation and future wealth derived from gold and oil are accompanied by concerns that outsiders might be conspiring to rob the country of its riches, as well as conjuring up dysto-pian scenarios of sinister plots and future mayhem.

First, while the concept and term \u201cIslam Nusantara\u201d is new in its current variant \u2013 closely tied to a particular group of thinkers within NU \u2013 most of what the term describes is neither new nor as locally specific to Southeast Asia as the term suggests. The term encapsulates a thousand-year-old practice of plurality and ideals of pluralism that has been historically more typical for Islamicate societies than modern readings often acknowledge. Second, while it describes a lived reality, \u201cIslam Nusantara\u201d has also become a normative call for renewed pride in and support for diversity of practice and belief.

His main argument is that the hereditarily closed ranking system of Brunei\u2019s dominant ethnic group produced, or at least perpetuated, ethnic diversity and the development of an invented historiography in relation to ethnic origins to support the position of the dominant group. Similar relationships between rank, or status, and origins are found throughout much of the Austronesian-speaking world. In most of these societies origins are of fundamental social and political importance, often expressed through complex traditions that through recourse to origins function to establish social difference between individuals, social or ethnic groups in order to justify claims of precedence: a priority, seniority or superiority that can relate to rights over resources, political offices or the political or ritual ascendancy of one group over another. Drawing on data from the wider Austronesian world, particularly ideas of \u2018origin and precedence\u2019, this chapter presents a comparative analysis of various Brunei origin traditions, supplemented by historical, archaeological and linguistic data.

Issue du contexte latino-am\u00e9ricain, puis continuellement reformul\u00e9e au gr\u00e9 des divers avatars des th\u00e9ories et pratiques de l'indig\u00e9nisme [Favre, 1996], cette derni\u00e8re notion s'est vu progressivement conf\u00e9-rer une port\u00e9e universelle par de nombreuses organisations internationales (voir, parmi d'autres, la convention n\u00b0169 du Bureau international du travail, sur les droits des \u00ab Peuples indig\u00e8nes \u00bb). Pourtant, en d\u00e9pit de tentatives pour l'importer en Asie du Sud-Est continentale, tentatives r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9es par des experts \u00e9trangers acquis \u00e0 la cause des indigenous people (ONG, etc.), cette notion, quoique plastique dans son acception, y demeure largement non \u00ab comprise \u00bb, donc pas admise, et dans les faits est jug\u00e9e inadmissible. Comment entend-on la premi\u00e8re notion, et pourquoi la seconde, quelles qu'en soient les traductions, est-elle \u00e0 ce point ind\u00e9-sirable ? En t\u00e2chant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette double interrogation, nous verrons que sont en jeu non seulement la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'autochtonie de certaines populations, donc \u00e0 d'\u00e9ventuels droits territoriaux, mais aussi la persistance d'une dialectique, officiellement valid\u00e9e, de l'arri\u00e9r\u00e9 et de l'\u00e9volu\u00e9, d'un \u00ab grand partage \u00bb, qui com-mande une anthropologie na\u00efve et tr\u00e8s appliqu\u00e9e. Je m'appuie essentiellement sur l'exemple du Laos, d'une part parce que plu-sieurs ann\u00e9es de terrain m'y ont plac\u00e9 quotidiennement face \u00e0 ces questions, d'autre part parce que ce pays permet d'\u00e9voquer-au-del\u00e0 de lui seul-le probl\u00e8me", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63206852, "asset_id": 42951428, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7423005, "first_name": "yves", "last_name": "goudineau", "domain_name": "efeo", "page_name": "yvesgoudineau", "display_name": "yves goudineau", "profile_url": "https://efeo.academia.edu/yvesgoudineau?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7423005/43893867/34732450/s65_yves.goudineau.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 2254857, "title": "(2012).

cuisine, including Malaysian cuisine, is known for its rich diversity and colorful character. Malaysian food culture is comprised of Major Asian cuisines, and it is a source of the tourists and expatriates sensational adventures. Nonetheless, our study shows that when it comes to food choice, the most Iranians in Malaysia approach local foods prudentially and prefer choosing western style fast foods and Iranian restaurants instead of trying the extraordinary local fare. The findings indicate that the difference between the food cultures of the two countries and religious reasons are among the most important causes that shape the Iranians approach to Malaysian food. However, a longer stay in Malaysia meaningfully softens the Iranians attitude to the local foods. This study examines the food behavior of Iranians in Malaysia as based on an embodied cultural sensation. For a theoretical explanation of the findings, the study draws on Bourdieu's concept of habitus and Merleau-Ponty's concepts of habit and embodiment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59004056, "asset_id": 38905163, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 185300, "first_name": "Mehrdad", "last_name": "Arabestani", "domain_name": "tehran", "page_name": "MehrdadArabestani", "display_name": "Mehrdad Arabestani", "profile_url": "https://tehran.academia.edu/MehrdadArabestani?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/185300/60698/38934841/s65_mehrdad.arabestani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4000, "name": "Anthropology of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13025, "name": "Habitus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Habitus?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14169, "name": "Anthropology of Iran", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Iran?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 25594, "name": "Sensory Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensory_Ethnography?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 123764, "name": "Cuisine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cuisine?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 275682, "name": "Anthropology of migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_migration?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 818291, "name": "Food Culture and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Food_Culture_and_Identity?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 78482980, "title": "Islam Nusantara: The Conceptual Vocabulary of Indonesian Diversity", "created_at": "2022-05-04T23:00:48.446-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78482980/Islam_Nusantara_The_Conceptual_Vocabulary_of_Indonesian_Diversity?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_78482980", "summary": "This article focuses on the concept \u201cIslam Nusantara\u201d in debates about Islam in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia.

The purpose of this introduction is to put these so called values in the context of entrepreneurship on the basis of seminal works dealing with South-East Asian entreprises. We will see that in most cases these works oscillate between two poles: first, Max Weber\u2019s sociology of industrial capitalism through the prism of religious ethics, and secondly the substantivist approach of Karl Polanyi. If the analytical tools of these debates have been applied mostly to entrepreneurs from the Chinese Diaspora, it is the question of the entrepreneurs\u2019 dominant ideology through the prism of philosophical and religious currents which serve as benchmarks. How values and ideologies are perpetuated, adapted or implemented by company management? How do they fit also in micro-strategies of local actors? How does entrepreneurial ethics decline in business of various statutes and in entrepreneurs\u2019 families? What images these families do build, and what are the values involved in the construction of this ethics? In other words, we mean to observe existing practices in this part of the world and understand their logic through anthropological analysis. Thus, contri- butions of this issue provide both some answers and open to other ideas to contribute to outline what \u201centrepreneurship ethics\u201d can be in the region of South-East Asia expanded to Sino-Indian margins. \r\n\r\nL\u2019\u00e9thique entrepreneuriale est une notion largement mobilis\u00e9e dans le milieu des affaires et des entreprises en Asie du Sud-Est o\u00f9 elle est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le plus souvent comme un ensemble de pr\u00e9ceptes moraux, id\u00e9ologiques ou religieux que les acteurs locaux rassemblent sous le vocable \u00ab valeurs asiatiques \u00bb. L\u2019objet de cette introduction est de replacer ces valeurs dans le contexte de l\u2019entreprise \u00e0 partir de quelques travaux fondateurs de ce sujet en Asie du Sud-Est. Nous verrons que le plus souvent ils oscillent entre deux p\u00f4les : d\u2019une part la sociologie w\u00e9b\u00e9rienne du capitalisme industriel par le prisme de l\u2019\u00e9thique religieuse et d\u2019autre part l\u2019approche substantiviste de Polanyi. Si les grilles d\u2019analyse n\u00e9es de ces d\u00e9bats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es en majorit\u00e9 aux entrepreneurs issus de la diaspora chinoise, c\u2019est la question de l\u2019id\u00e9ologie des entrepreneurs qui pr\u00e9domine \u00e0 travers le prisme des courants philosophiques et religieux qui leur servent de rep\u00e8res. Comment des valeurs et des id\u00e9ologies sont-elles perp\u00e9tu\u00e9es, adapt\u00e9es ou transpos\u00e9es par les directions d\u2019entreprise ? Comment s\u2019ins\u00e8rent-elles \u00e9galement dans les micro-stra- t\u00e9gies des acteurs locaux ? Comment l\u2019\u00e9thique entrepreneuriale se d\u00e9cline-t-elle dans des \u00e9tablissements de statuts divers et dans des familles d\u2019entrepreneurs ? Quelles images ces derni\u00e8res construisent-elles et quelles sont les valeurs (morales, religieuses, etc.) qui participent \u00e0 la construction de cette \u00e9thique ? En d\u2019autres termes, il s\u2019agit d\u2019observer des pratiques qui ont cours dans cette partie du monde et d\u2019en comprendre les logiques au travers d\u2019analyses anthropologiques. Ainsi, les contributions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans ce num\u00e9ro apportent \u00e0 la fois des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de r\u00e9ponse et ouvrent d\u2019autres pistes de r\u00e9flexion pour concourir \u00e0 esquisser ce que \u00ab \u00e9thique entrepreneuriale \u00bb peut recouvrir dans cette r\u00e9gion du Sud-Est asiatique \u00e9largi aux marges sino-indiennes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34118843, "asset_id": 3738774, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1988623, "first_name": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "last_name": "Soldani", "domain_name": "univ-montp3", "page_name": "J\u00e9r\u00f4meSoldani", "display_name": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Soldani", "profile_url": "https://univ-montp3.academia.edu/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4meSoldani?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1988623/660031/1168771/s65_j_r_me.soldani.jpg"}, {"id": 2628926, "first_name": "Ghislaine", "last_name": "GALLENGA", "domain_name": "univ-amu", "page_name": "GhislaineGALLENGA", "display_name": "Ghislaine GALLENGA", "profile_url": "https://univ-amu.academia.edu/GhislaineGALLENGA?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2628926/1983179/53877294/s65_ghislaine.gallenga.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1436909, "name": "Entrepreneurial Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entrepreneurial_Ethics?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42951457, "title": "Tambours de bronze et circumambulations c\u00e9r\u00e9monielles: Notes \u00e0 partir d'un rituel kantou", "created_at": "2020-05-05T10:20:08.687-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42951457/Tambours_de_bronze_et_circumambulations_c%C3%A9r%C3%A9monielles_Notes_%C3%A0_partir_dun_rituel_kantou?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_42951457", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63206891, "asset_id": 42951457, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7423005, "first_name": "yves", "last_name": "goudineau", "domain_name": "efeo", "page_name": "yvesgoudineau", "display_name": "yves goudineau", "profile_url": "https://efeo.academia.edu/yvesgoudineau?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7423005/43893867/34732450/s65_yves.goudineau.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 605753, "name": "Mon-Khmer people", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon-Khmer_people?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 3705412, "title": "Bone Modifications in an Early Holocene Cremation Burial from Palawan, Philippines", "created_at": "2013-06-13T17:02:40.576-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3705412/Bone_Modifications_in_an_Early_Holocene_Cremation_Burial_from_Palawan_Philippines?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_3705412", "summary": "Fragments of a single human individual recovered from a discrete archaeological context and dating to the Early Holocene from Ille Site, Palawan, Philippines provided a unique opportunity to utilize anthropogenic bone modifications to reconstruct the postmortem history of the body prior to its deposition.

Dr. M\u00fcller will present an original conceptual framework for studying the bureaucratization of Islam. He will apply it to five Southeast Asian cases\u2014Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. State bureaucracies in these countries vary widely, but generally they aim to influence or control trends and meanings in local Islamic discourse. Drawing on current debates in the anthropology of the state, with particular reference to Brunei and Singapore, M\u00fcller will offer an original analytic framework to explain similarities and differences in bureaucratized Islam in Southeast Asia.

Throughout, the focus is on the daily lives and experiences of ordinary people. Most of the essays are original to this volume, while a few are widely taught classics. All were chosen for their timeliness and interest, and are ideally suited for the classroom.\r\n\r\n*********************\r\n\u201cIn recent years, the study of everyday life has offered a fascinating angle for understanding the changing nature of society and culture around the world. Wonderfully comprehensive yet vividly well-written, Kathleen Adams and Kathleen Gillogly's Everyday Life in Southeast Asia offers just such a perspective on society, religion, the arts, gender, and everyday politics in contemporary Southeast Asia. If I were asked to recommend one book that captures both the cultural legacies and emergent complexity of today's Southeast Asia, this gracious and dazzling book would be it.\u201d \u2014Robert W. Hefner, Boston University\r\n\r\n\u201cWith this volume, introducing students to the study of Southeast Asia has just become easier. Adams and Gillogly have assembled a wide-ranging collection of accessible and engaging articles about the region\u2014some new, some classic, and some revised especially for this volume\u2014all of which promise to work well in the classroom. By focusing on \u201ceveryday life,\u201d the book lends itself to a variety of different courses while its helpful section format gives the instructor lots of flexibility in making assignments.

introductory chapter provides the rationale for the book, to acknowledge, celebrate and evaluate Professor Donald Brown\u2019s pioneering studies on the Brunei sultanate. It is just over 50 years since Professor Brown undertook anthropological research in Brunei (1967\u20131968) for his Cornell University doctorate, which led to his seminal volume Brunei: The Structure and History of a Bornean Malay Sultanate published by The Brunei Museum as a special monograph in 1970 (see Prologue); it too celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. He also wrote more than 20 related papers on the history and social organisation of Brunei. These have become standard references for our understanding and appreciation of the society, culture and history of the Brunei sultanate. The chapter proposes that in any scholarly historical and social-science-based research on Brunei, and on historically and culturally related territories in Borneo and on Malay states more generally, Brown\u2019s work is frequently cited. Though other studies were undertaken after the publication of Brown\u2019s monograph, without his crucial scholarly contribution we would have had no major points of reference before the declaration of the full independence of Negara Brunei Darussalam from the British Crown on 1 January 1984.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28184881, "first_name": "Victor", "last_name": "King", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "VictorKing", "display_name": "Victor King", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/VictorKing?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28184881/23856131/22871068/s65_victor.king.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 954, "name": "Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 48574, "name": "Brunei Darussalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Darussalam?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 179193, "name": "Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 247641, "name": "Peoples and Cultures of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peoples_and_Cultures_of_Borneo?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 278481, "name": "history of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Borneo?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 645527, "name": "Sejarah Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Brunei?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 741137, "name": "History of Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Brunei?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1657007, "name": "Brunei Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Studies?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 51081006, "title": "\u0410\u0440\u0430\u043a(\u0430): \u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c \u0432 \u043e\u0431\u0440\u044f\u0434\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043f\u043f\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0418\u043d\u0434\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e \u041a\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0438  \r\nArac(a): alcoholic drink in ritual and social life from the Philippines and Indochina to the Caucasus and Siberia", "created_at": "2021-08-29T09:44:46.959-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/51081006/%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA_%D0%B0_%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C_%D0%B2_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%B5_%D0%B8_%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B8_%D0%BE%D1%82_%D0%A4%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BF%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%B8_%D0%98%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D0%BE_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0_%D0%B8_%D0%A1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8_Arac_a_alcoholic_drink_in_ritual_and_social_life_from_the_Philippines_and_Indochina_to_the_Caucasus_and_Siberia?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_51081006", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68934770, "asset_id": 51081006, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2584335, "first_name": "Maria", "last_name": "V.

A review of the processes through which Islam became an authentically Southeast Asian religion suggests that this merit-making conundrum is a recent example of the adoption and adaptation of Indic terms by Southeast Asian Muslims. These were central to the creation of Islamicate cultures. The concepts Indic and Islamicate are capable of pushing through conceptual cul-de-sacs such as syncretism and shared cosmologies. In addition to the specific generation of merit erroneously assumed as its only meaning, the article reveals that tham bun also denotes undifferentiated religious actions, and is code for a range of feasts unrelated to merit-making. It argues that the co-option of tham bun by Thai-speaking Muslims is an example of a search for equivalents. It also suggests the presence of an authentically Islamic economy of merit in Southern Thailand, confirming Islam\u2019s ability to speak the language of Indic Southeast Asians and to scratch where they itch.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33426080, "asset_id": 6703689, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher",

The core argument is that Indonesia and the polities which once existed in its territory have a long history of cooperation between the ruling elites and the criminal world. The early-modern era bandits, called jago, and the modern gangsters, known as preman, arguably represented an important pillar of the power of political regimes in Java from the pre-colonial Javanese kingdoms to the Netherlands East Indies' colonial state to Soeharto's New Order. In post-Soeharto Indone-sia, political liberation combined with the impact of jihadist Islam(ism) has created conditions in which a number of leather-clad gangsters have turned into vigilante defenders of Islam, who are sometimes co-opted by influential interest groups and sometimes sent back to the political periphery after falling out of favor. While the primary objective of this paper is to analyze the issue of oscillation between incorporation, co-optation, and utilization of criminals and radical Islamic groupings by the powerful, on the one hand, and their elimination, on the other, the paper also looks into how Indonesian historiography has depicted these influential bandits/gangsters/ vigilantes and how historiographical sources tend to legitimize them to create an authoritative nationalist narrative.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65751638, "asset_id": 45169572, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5594844, "first_name": "Tomas", "last_name": "Petru (Tom\u00e1\u0161 Petr\u016f)", "domain_name": "cas-cz", "page_name": "TomasPetru", "display_name": "Tomas Petru (Tom\u00e1\u0161 Petr\u016f)", "profile_url": "https://cas-cz.academia.edu/TomasPetru?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5594844/4735712/28397019/s65_tomas.petru_tom_petr_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8008, "name": "Organized Crime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organized_Crime?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30462, "name": "Vigilantism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vigilantism?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 34701, "name": "Banditry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Banditry?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 37193, "name": "Islam in Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Indonesia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 50003, "name": "Indonesian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Politics?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 44748559, "title": "Editorial: New Area Studies and Southeast Asia - IQAS Special Issue Vol. 51 No. 3-4", "created_at": "2020-12-21T05:28:30.753-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44748559/Editorial_New_Area_Studies_and_Southeast_Asia_IQAS_Special_Issue_Vol_51_No_3_4?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_44748559", "summary": "\u201cDebates on area studies have turned into something of a frenetic scholarly\r\nenterprise,\u201d writes Victor T.

Brunei sultanate. It is just over 50 years since Professor Brown undertook anthropological research in Brunei (1967\u20131968) for his Cornell University doctorate, which led to his seminal volume Brunei: The Structure and History of a Bornean Malay Sultanate published by The Brunei Museum as a special monograph in 1970 (see Prologue); it too celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. He also wrote more than 20 related papers on the history and social organisation of Brunei. These have become standard references for our understanding and appreciation of the society, culture and history of the Brunei sultanate. The chapter proposes that in any scholarly historical and social-science-based research on Brunei, and on historically and culturally related territories in Borneo and on Malay states more generally, Brown\u2019s work is frequently cited. Though other studies were undertaken after the publication of Brown\u2019s monograph, without his crucial scholarly contribution we would have had no major points of reference before the declaration of the full independence of Negara Brunei Darussalam from the British Crown on 1 January 1984.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 954, "name": "Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Anthropology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 48574, "name": "Brunei Darussalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Darussalam?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 179193, "name": "Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 247641, "name": "Peoples and Cultures of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peoples_and_Cultures_of_Borneo?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 278481, "name": "history of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Borneo?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 645527, "name": "Sejarah Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Brunei?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 741137, "name": "History of Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Brunei?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1657007, "name": "Brunei Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Studies?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 54204075, "title": "Introduction \"Probl\u00e9matiques patrimoniales\" -

Substantiating archaeological data with historical and ethnographic accounts, I argue that these gold dental inlays go beyond ornamentation. The explanation for such a custom lies in the early Visayan population\u2019s belief that gold, a mystical metal, transformed teeth into an important body part that had a spiritual dimension.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2262966, "first_name": "Victor", "last_name": "Estrella", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "VictorEstrella", "display_name": "Victor Estrella", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/VictorEstrella?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2262966/720550/31318969/s65_victor.estrella.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3657, "name": "Anthropology of the Body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_the_Body?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 95738, "name": "Teeth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teeth?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 342873, "name": "Dental Decorations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dental_Decorations?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 344942, "name": "Gold Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gold_Archaeology?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 755611, "name": "Visayas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visayas?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 1464325, "name": "Philippine Anthropology and Archeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Anthropology_and_Archeology?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 3011153, "name": "dental inlays", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/dental_inlays?f_ri=41617"}, {"id": 3843913, "name": "History of the Visayas (Philippines)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Visayas_Philippines_?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 49136618, "title": "Minority Looms of Southwest China", "created_at": "2021-06-05T10:46:56.613-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49136618/Minority_Looms_of_Southwest_China?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_49136618", "summary": "China's southwestern provinces, comprising Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan and parts of Hunan and Guangdong, are ethnically diverse and also possess the greatest variety of weaving tools anywhere in East Asia.

This paper reports three critical findings from a material driven approach. Firstly, sites of pan-Asian trade in early Southeast Asia do not necessarily correspond to archaeological settlement sites. Second, communities marginalised as minor and peripheral such as hill tribes and sea nomads must be re-centred at the heart of historical causality in Southeast Asia. Third, ritual and exchange are far more significant as connective factors across Southeast Asia, than evidence of intensive commerce. The research presented here will demonstrate how using new sources and critical approaches change our understanding of Asia and historical causality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54859973,

The volume honors anthropologist Charles F. Keyes and the chapters here address concepts central to Keyes\u2019 own work\u2014ethnicity, religion, and modernity\u2014as they can be applied to the countries of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The volume also reflects recent scholarly interest in \u201ccross-border\u201d issues, as reflected both in the complexity of identity, where ethnic groups extend across boundaries, and in increasing cross-border mobility. The volume is divided into three sections. The first, \u201cThe State and Public Ceremony,\u201d includes chapters on a ceremony of national heritage as celebrated in Vietnam and the United States, Shan novice initiation near the border of Myanmar in Thailand, and the restoration of the monkhood in Cambodia. The second section, \u201cThe Grassroots Negotiation of Modernity,\u201d contains chapters about the concept of \u201csufficiency\u201d in Thai farm production, the ways modernity is conceived among the Lahu in Thailand, and the complexities of the Thai system of identity cards. The final section, \u201cCrossing Borders of State and Nation\u201d focuses on the stateless Lao population in northeastern Thailand, Vietnamese migrants to Laos, and Western (farang) men married to northeastern Thai women. Contributors to the book include scholars based in Thailand, Vietnam, the United States, Australia, and Mexico. The book is an invaluable reference for scholars of Southeast Asia, and will also appeal to the general reader.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 726613, "first_name":

Saya melihat dari sisi pergerakan pekerja. Walaupun lapisan logam semakin sulit dicapai, lokasi tambang emas tersebut telah menjadi lokasi kerja utama bagi masyarakat yang tidak bersekolah tinggi untuk mencari penghidupannya, baik warga lokal dan perantau berasal dari luar kabupaten dan provinsi, termasuk dari pulau Jawa. Namun demikian tambang ini jarang merupakan tujuan terakhir bagi pekerja. Ia hanya jadi tahap sementara pada buruh yang telah mengalami atau merencanakan pekerjaan kasar lain di daerahnya atau di luar negeri. Di samping itu, saya sedang meneliti hal lain menyangkut aspek psikologis dari pekerja yang mempertaruhkan kesuksesat atau kemalangan lewat pekerjaan keras di gunung hujan. Sebagai contoh, tentang rasa malu jika berpangku tangan di kampung, dan rasa gembira kalau sibuk di tempat kerja, tentang hasil usaha yang halal, tentang akibat dari kegiatan yang illegal, berjauhan dari keluarga, dan tanggung jawab dalam hubungan dengan tunangan, istri dan masyarakat. Dalam hal ini saya ingin ceritakan tentang pengalaman yang sedang saya jalani di Aceh Jaya dan mencoba bertukar pikiran dengan mahasiswa dan peneliti muda di Aceh, termasuk tentang topik lain yang relefan. Meskipun penelitian saya belum tuntas, tahap-tahap untuk mendekati masyarakat dan kebudayaannya dan cara untuk mengembalikan hasil penelitian pada rakyat mungkin bisa bermanfaat. Saya juga ingin berdiskusi dengan peneliti dan mahasiswa tentang tujuan penelitian lapangan saya, termasuk dari segi politik, etika dan agama.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors":

The\nethnic Lao, comprising around half of the population, dominate\nthe country economically and culturally. There are, however,\nsome provinces and districts where the number of Indigenous\npeople exceeds that of the Lao and where their culture is prominent.\nThere are four ethnolinguistic families in Laos; Lao-Tai\nlanguage-speaking groups represent two-thirds of the population.\nThe other third speaks languages belonging to the Mon-\nKhmer, Sino-Tibetan and Hmong-Ew-Hmien families and these\nare considered to be the Indigenous Peoples of Laos. Officially,\nall ethnic groups have equal status in Laos, and the concept of\nIndigenous Peoples is not recognised by the government, despite\nthe fact that Laos voted in favour of adopting the UN Declaration\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Lao government\nuses the term ethnic group to refer to Indigenous people.\nThe Lao government currently recognises 160 ethnic subgroups\nwithin 50 ethnic groups. Indigenous Peoples, especially\nthose who speak Hmong-Ew-Hmien languages, are unequivocally\nthe most vulnerable groups in Laos. They face territorial,\neconomic, cultural and political pressures and are experiencing\nvarious threats to their livelihoods. Their land and resources\nare increasingly under pressure from pro-investment government\ndevelopment policies and commercial natural resource\nexploitation. Indigenous people lag behind the majority Lao-Tai\nat all economic levels. They have worse access to healthcare,\nlower rates of education, and less access to clean water and\nsanitation. Indigenous Peoples\u2019 relying on unimproved or surface\nwater ranged from between 20 to 32.5%, compared to just\n8.5% of Lao-Tai, and while only 13.9% of Lao-Tai practice open\ndefecation, that percentage rises to between 30.3 to 46.3%\namong Indigenous Peoples.2\nLaos has ratified ICERD (1974), CEDAW (1981), CRC (1991),\nICCPR (2009). The Lao government, however, severely restricts\nfundamental rights, including freedom of speech (media), association, assembly and religion, and civil society is closely\ncontrolled. Organisations openly focusing on Indigenous Peoples\nor using related terms in the Lao language are thus not allowed,\nwhile open discussions about Indigenous Peoples with\nthe government can be sensitive, especially since the issue is\nseen as pertaining to special (human) rights.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67595314, "asset_id": 49208581, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 82216187, "first_name": "International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs", "last_name": "(IWGIA)", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IWGIA", "display_name": "International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA)", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IWGIA?f_ri=41617", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82216187/19822729/19651972/s65_international_work_group_for_indigenous_affairs._iwgia_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15149, "name": "Indigenous Peoples Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples_Rights?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=41617", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96694, "name": "Ethnic minority groups", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_minority_groups?f_ri=41617"}]}, {"id": 49108900, "title": "Cultivating Communities after Disaster: A Whirlwind of Generosity on the Coasts of Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2021-06-03T07:03:34.744-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49108900/Cultivating_Communities_after_Disaster_A_Whirlwind_of_Generosity_on_the_Coasts_of_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=41617", "dom_id": "work_49108900", "summary": "Community-oriented tools and technologies have become a strategic focus within post-catastrophe humanitarian interventions when supporting affected populations in their efforts to learn to survive.

Instead of developing what was expected \u2013 a common sense of purpose and a collaborative desire to share work-related knowledge and experience - participants manipulated, distorted and reconfigured meanings and identities in order to strategically adapt themselves to the post-disaster situation. The ethnographic analysis demonstrates that the rhetoric of cultivation generated by the community-of-practice approach used in post-catastrophe interventions does not account for the complexity of reality.

It is also a space where the landscape is constructed and utilised to shape its citizens' perception. However, the idea of a nation is not just circumscribed by what is celebrated or visible but also by what is 'silenced'. During the transitional period between the Sukarno and Suharto administrations in the mid 60's, approximately 500,000-1 million suspected leftists, communists and dissidents were incarcerated and disappeared. Thus even 20 years after the downfall of Suharto's authoritarian regime, the incident continues to be an unspeakable 'open secret'. This paper posits that beneath Indonesia's modern veneer lies 'pockets' of spaces that physically mark this hidden history. I ask how Indonesians conceive and tell of this 'unmentionable' history through narratives that surround places of death and violence. I will be looking specifically at sites where dissidents have either been interrogated, imprisoned as well as executed. This research looks at how Indonesians utilise tales of the ghostly and the spectral as a way to bypass the taboo which surrounds the event and at the same time 'narrativise' it. I state that these tales of ghosts, hauntings and the supernatural are attempts by Indonesians to comprehend better what was otherwise an 'incomprehensible' event. Also, despite the state's best efforts in creating a vacuum on the event, I state that these sites of violence, the landscapes which they inhabit and the tales they carry, are part of an invisible landscape where a counter 'imagined community' exists linking these sites as well as the past and present.

His main argument is that the hereditarily closed ranking system of Brunei\u2019s dominant ethnic group produced, or at least perpetuated, ethnic diversity and the development of an invented historiography in relation to ethnic origins to support the position of the dominant group. Similar relationships between rank, or status, and origins are found throughout much of the Austronesian-speaking world. In most of these societies origins are of fundamental social and political importance, often expressed through complex traditions that through recourse to origins function to establish social difference between individuals, social or ethnic groups in order to justify claims of precedence: a priority, seniority or superiority that can relate to rights over resources, political offices or the political or ritual ascendancy of one group over another. Drawing on data from the wider Austronesian world, particularly ideas of \u2018origin and precedence\u2019, this chapter presents a comparative analysis of various Brunei origin traditions, supplemented by historical, archaeological and linguistic data. While not uncritical of Brown\u2019s earlier studies, the chapter aims to both build and expand upon his work in understanding the relationship between social structures and history in Brunei.",
