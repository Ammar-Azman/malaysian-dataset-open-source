There are currently over 130,000 children being educated in Karen schools operated in Myanmar by the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Karen Refugee Council (KRC) in Thailand. These schools are taking advantage of mother tongue-based principles of literacy, which emphasize that literacy starts with the home language. Since the 1980s at least a million people have completed the basic Karen curriculum focused on Karen literacy, with many of those continuing to secondary and post-secondary education where programs are taught in Karen and English. Karen language education continues despite the marginalization of Karen schools in Myanmar since Ne Win's 1962 coup. At that time, Karen schools in the Delta Region were replaced with Burmese language schools from the Burmese Ministry of Education. Since then Karen systems of education have remained strong in border areas outside control of the government. Indeed, Karen programs may have even strengthened after many government-funded schools were shuttered following the emergence of the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) in 2021. Karen education is strong because, in part, it moved into Thailand, where schools continue both in refugee camps, and in migrant schools. The Karen language instruction in Thailand is typically organized by the KRC, which also provides support to schools still operated by the KNU inside Myanmar. The Karen schools in both places reflect Karen education traditions inherited from the Karen schools in Burma, which began in the 19th century. They do this while using teaching techniques and pedagogy adapted from the West, which train students to be \"critical thinkers\" for a Karen democracy. Development since the 1840s Karen education actually began in the 1840s with the development of modern Karen literacy, the establishment of a printing press, and the emergence of schooling. The earliest efforts were in the Irrawaddy River Delta and Rangoon (now Yangon). This led to a rapid expansion of the Karen school systems over the following decades. Karen and English language programs flourished around the large Christian mission compound in Bassein (Pathein, the capital of Ayeyarwady Region) in the Irrawaddy River Delta, as well as in Rangoon. Baptist Mission primary schools among Karen were first opened by American Baptist missionaries in 1852 at Bassein. A Karen secondary school was opened in Koesue in 1854. The Karen Baptist Theological Seminary was already established in 1845 in Rangoon to train pastors literate in Karen and English.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 101561085, "asset_id": 100859039, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3356783, "first_name": "Tony", "last_name": "Waters", "domain_name": "leuphana", "page_name": "TonyWaters", "display_name": "Tony Waters", "profile_url": "https://leuphana.academia.edu/TonyWaters?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3356783/2789764/3252558/s65_tony.waters.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24775, "name": "Anthropology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 72075, "name": "Refugee Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 142061, "name": "Current Education in Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Current_Education_in_Myanmar?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 235184, "name": "Karen people", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Karen_people?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 100858483, "title": "The cosmology of accounting in mid 19th-century Thailand", "created_at": "2023-04-27T05:52:03.074-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/100858483/The_cosmology_of_accounting_in_mid_19th_century_Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_100858483", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 101560780, "asset_id": 100858483, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 202871886, "first_name": "Nooch", "last_name": "Kuasirikun", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "Kuasirikun", "display_name": "Nooch Kuasirikun", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/Kuasirikun?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4167, "name": "Corporate Governance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporate_Governance?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28428, "name": "Marxist philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxist_philosophy?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200604, "name": "V", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/V?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1218440, "name": "Indigenous", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1373296, "name": "Accounting Organizations and Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Accounting_Organizations_and_Society?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 100842351, "title": "The Thai National Education Act in Context", "created_at": "2023-04-26T23:21:38.071-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/100842351/The_Thai_National_Education_Act_in_Context?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_100842351", "summary": "In 1999, the Thai government announced the National Education Act, which promised deep reforms of the school system. The act, which was precipitated by the Asian economic crisis, aimed to rejuvenate the Thai educational system by implementing school-based management, integrating local wisdom into the curriculum, and transitioning from teacher-to student-centered learning. Many academics had high hopes for the success of the reforms; however, by the mid-2000s, the educational system had largely reverted to a pre-reform state. This paper is an attempt to answer the question of why the reforms failed to reach their stated goals. It will first discuss events chronologically. The period of interest begins prior to the 1997 crisis and continues into the mid-2000s. Next, this paper will explore two main themes that run through the literature: the tension between the global and the local and the tension between the urban and the rural.",

The findings showed that the students were excited to have English as the medium of instruction in their classroom. However, they also welcome the L1 (Bahasa Indonesia). In addition, the learners preferred to have English as the medium of instruction in their English classroom. In view of this, the use of both their L1 and L2 should be balanced. Moreover, concerning the subjects taught, the learners need the use of English especially in the Listening and Speaking classrooms.

pandemic intensified border control and disrupted international labor migration, but the complex consequences for migrant workers, including deepened marginalization and countervailing opportunities,

Drawing on the case of Taiwan, this article examines how a host country reorganizes the multiple layers of physical and social borders for the purpose of sanitization, leading to an entanglement of mobilities and immobilities in migrant workers' lives. I illustrate how bordering practices have had uneven impacts on Filipino and Indonesian migrant workers across different circumstances of risk management. The findings highlight the geographic scales and temporal changes of shifting borders, which involve the negotiation of social membership for migrant workers in relation to the public health crisis and labor market shortage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95375461, "asset_id": 92341166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3294924, "first_name": "Pei-Chia", "last_name": "Lan", "domain_name": "taiwan", "page_name": "PCLan", "display_name": "Pei-Chia  Lan", "profile_url": "https://taiwan.academia.edu/PCLan?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3294924/1095486/12582299/s65_pei-chia.lan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52815, "name": "Migrant workers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_workers?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94451, "name": "Taiwan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2979842, "name": "border and migration control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/border_and_migration_control?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557864, "name": "Covid-19", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Covid-19?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 91939245, "title": "On Migrant Workers\u2019 Social Status in Taiwan: A Critical Analysis of Mainstream News Discourse", "created_at": "2022-11-30T10:45:43.144-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/91939245/On_Migrant_Workers_Social_Status_in_Taiwan_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Mainstream_News_Discourse?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_91939245", "summary": "It is estimated that around 20 million Southeast Asians work outside of their home country. In 1991, Taiwan first introduced about 3,000 migrant workers from Thailand.

However, there is scarce research on representations of the south\u2013south international migration. This study critically analyzes mainstream news discourse on migrant workers in Taiwan to discern their relations to their residing society. Four themes emerged: objectification of foreign laborers; differentiated and gendered marginalization; multilevel triangulations over migrant bodies; and imperialistic cultural attitudes toward migrant workers. Through omissions, inferences, and emphases on particular events in news reports, the migrant workers are in an impossible position to exist politically, economically, and culturally in Taiwanese society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 95084627, "asset_id": 91939245, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25787850, "first_name": "Hsin-I", "last_name": "Cheng", "domain_name": "scu", "page_name": "HsinICheng", "display_name": "Hsin-I Cheng", "profile_url": "https://scu.academia.edu/HsinICheng?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25787850/104410698/93598104/s65_hsin-i.cheng.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 859, "name": "Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10633, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 52815, "name": "Migrant workers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_workers?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 830746, "name": "Mainstream", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mainstream?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 91659355, "title": "Affecting the Activity-Based on Learning Approaching Management Through the Stem Education Instructional Method for Fostering the Creative Thinking Abilities, Learning Achievements and Environmental Perceptions in Physics Laboratory Classes of Secondary Students at the 10TH Grade Level", "created_at": "2022-11-26T12:59:20.453-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/91659355/Affecting_the_Activity_Based_on_Learning_Approaching_Management_Through_the_Stem_Education_Instructional_Method_for_Fostering_the_Creative_Thinking_Abilities_Learning_Achievements_and_Environmental_Perceptions_in_Physics_Laboratory_Classes_of_Secondary_Students_at_the_10TH_Grade_Level?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_91659355", "summary": "This study focuses on investigating the effects of students\u2019 activity-based on learning approaching management through the popular instruction; STEM Education Instructional Model on the Second Newton\u2019s Law (spring and conservative law) issue for fostering students\u2019 creative thinking abilities of their learning achievements to their students\u2019 perceptions of their physics laboratory classroom environments.

In order to accord women practitioners better social status and provide them with opportunities for spiritual training, Buddhad\u0101sa avoided committing himself to the reintroduction of bhikkun\u012b ordination. Instead, he proposed the notion of dhammam\u0101t\u0101, which literally means \u2018dhamma mother\u2019. This article postulates that by using the metaphor of the mother, Buddhad\u0101sa invited less conflict, appealing to the high respect which Thai people generally held for women.

It is a lucrative move; increased university costs and access to home countries' courses ensure capable international students now seek affordable degree education in Thailand. Thus, in this paper, we offer empirical findings based on a case study drawn across a longitudinal, year-long investigation. Using examples from a mixed-methods approach, we report a 'cultural mosaic' of multiculturalism resistant to cultural assimilation in our setting, which contrasts themes in Thai HE policy. This policy often embraces nationalist themes, found embedded in General Education (GE) courses and the habitus of Thai HE, which impacts the potential to integrate overseas students effectively into Thai culture and society. With this in mind, we question the nature of multiculturalism in the classroom, suggesting a changing phenomenon with implications for Thai HE's future. Meanwhile, we use this paper to establish the validity of tools needed for critical discussion about learning culture across the Thai HE community as we move towards Thailand 4.0. We aim to describe the cultural integration of a growing base of international students, hoping to inform the development of Thai HE, which could be a world-class and leading platform for education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 83043648, "asset_id": 75164187, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3356783, "first_name": "Tony", "last_name": "Waters", "domain_name": "leuphana", "page_name": "TonyWaters", "display_name": "Tony Waters", "profile_url": "https://leuphana.academia.edu/TonyWaters?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3356783/2789764/3252558/s65_tony.waters.jpg"}, {"id": 184861721, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Day", "domain_name": "xjtlu", "page_name": "MichaelDay", "display_name": "Michael J Day", "profile_url": "https://xjtlu.academia.edu/MichaelDay?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/184861721/80181256/68756937/s65_michael.day.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 957, "name": "Cultural Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Sociology?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1911, "name": "International Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4976, "name": "International Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 5035, "name": "Comparative & International Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_and_International_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 501549, "name": "Sociology of Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Higher_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 75034785, "title": "Thai education beset by poor management, inequality, and high teacher debt | The Isaan Record", "created_at": "2022-03-30T23:40:41.191-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75034785/Thai_education_beset_by_poor_management_inequality_and_high_teacher_debt_The_Isaan_Record?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_75034785", "summary": "It was clear from the moment that Noi Don Kha Pracha Samakkee School in the Khong Chai District of Kalasin Province announced in their advertisement that something was again wrong in Thai education.

This study, therefore, expands the exploration to the investigation among EFL learners in a non-English speaking country, i.e., Thailand by considering the variables at a micro-level across general English courses involving course grade and academic achievement-grade point average (GPA). The analysis involved the data of 2,150 students studying six different English courses from various academic majors. These results revealed significant correlations and strong predictive powers of students' grades in English courses on their GPAs across a year of study and proficiency. The findings sustain the argument that although various factors affect students' academic achievement, English proficiency seems to have predictive power. Nowadays English-medium instruction (EMI) has attracted a myriad of interests from universities in non-English-speaking countries. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that improving students' English proficiency would lead them to obtaining better academic achievement. Resumen Estudios sobre la relaci\u00f3n entre el dominio del ingl\u00e9s y el rendimiento acad\u00e9mico se basan en la preocupaci\u00f3n por el \u00e9xito acad\u00e9mico de los estudiantes internacionales que estudian en pa\u00edses de habla inglesa. Esto plantea la pregunta \u00bfexiste tal relaci\u00f3n en los estudiantes nacionales de ingl\u00e9s como lengua extranjera que estudian en una universidad de su pa\u00eds de origen? As\u00ed, este estudio busca ampliar la investigaci\u00f3n para incluir estudiantes de ingl\u00e9s como lengua extranjera en un pa\u00eds que no habla ingl\u00e9s, , Tailandia, al considerar las variables a un nivel micro en los cursos de ingl\u00e9s general que involucran la calificaci\u00f3n del curso y el rendimiento acad\u00e9mico. El an\u00e1lisis incluy\u00f3 los datos de 2,150 estudiantes que cursaban seis cursos de ingl\u00e9s diferentes de diversas especialidades acad\u00e9micas. Estos resultados revelaron correlaciones significativas y altamente predictivas entre las calificaciones en los cursos de ingl\u00e9s en el promedio de calificaciones ene general a lo largo de un a\u00f1o de estudio. Los hallazgos sustentan el argumento de que, aunque varios factores afectan el rendimiento acad\u00e9mico de los estudiantes, el dominio del ingl\u00e9s parece tener poder predictivo. En la actualidad, la instrucci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s del ingl\u00e9s ha generado inter\u00e9s en universidades de pa\u00edses de habla no inglesa. Por lo tanto, los hallazgos de este estudio sugieren que mejorar el dominio del ingl\u00e9s de los estudiantes los llevar\u00eda a obtener un mejor rendimiento acad\u00e9mico.

Following the mixedmethod approach, data were collected using a questionnaire survey, classroom observation, focus group discussion (FGD), and semi-structured interview. For a comprehensive understanding of the actual scenario, data was collected from secondary schools located in urban, semi-urban, and rural part of Bangladesh. Data retrieved from the questionnaire survey indicates that students' preferred learning styles predominantly overlap with the features of tactile and kinesthetic learning styles. Classroom observation demonstrates that teachers have the tendency to control the class even within the student-centred classroom activities. FGD reveals that students were moving towards independent learning. Triangulated data suggests a lower to moderate level of student-centred classroom practices prevalent in secondary English classes. Findings also seem to direct that while students were showing promises in their readiness towards independent learning, teachers failed to provide them with necessary scopes. One pedagogical implication is that an innovation in the assessment system (in the form of assignment or project) would surely reflect students' preferred learning styles and, at the same time, would enhance student-centeredness in the existing classroom practices.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68218583, "asset_id": 50110195, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 316318, "first_name": "Goutam", "last_name": "Roy", "domain_name": "rajshahi", "page_name": "GoutamRoy", "display_name": "Goutam Roy", "profile_url": "https://rajshahi.academia.edu/GoutamRoy?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/82da414f508b260173360819581ae299?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49545131, "title": "\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e42\u0e22\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e22\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e41\u0e25\u0e19\u0e14\u0e4c 4.0 :  \u0e01\u0e23\u0e13\u0e35\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e13\u0e30\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e43\u0e19\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e49\u0e19\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e40\u0e28\u0e23\u0e29\u0e10\u0e01\u0e34\u0e08\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e40\u0e28\u0e29\u0e20\u0e32\u0e04\u0e15\u0e30\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01 The Adaptation of Colleges to Thailand 4.0 Policy:  Case study Colleges under the Vocational Education Commission in the  Eastern Economic Corridor Area", "created_at": "2021-07-04T22:02:05.217-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49545131/%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%95_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%94_4_0_%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%8D%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B7_%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5_%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%90%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81_The_Adaptation_of_Colleges_to_Thailand_4_0_Policy_Case_study_Colleges_under_the_Vocational_Education_Commission_in_the_Eastern_Economic_Corridor_Area?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_49545131", "summary": "This research is a qualitative research. The purpose of this study were to (1) investigate the adaptation of Colleges under the Vocational Education Commission in the Eastern Economic Corridor Area toward Thailand 4.0 Policy. (2) examine the suggestions and adaptation guidelines of Colleges toward Thailand 4.0 Policy. The data was collected from 27 key informants including 9 administrative directors, and 18 Operative directors of 9 vocational college in Chachoengsao, \nChonburi, and Rayong In-depth interview was employed to gather the data. The study found that all Colleges are ready to adapt themselves toward Thailand 4.0 Policy and Eastern Economic Corridor Area. They had operations in response to policy that has been ordered from the its affiliation as follows. (1) mission and work structure adjustment (2) \nadjustment of the strategic plan, policy, curriculum, teaching and learning, implementation guidelines, projects, and activities (3)personnel development by enhancing knowledge and understanding, creating participation, and providing specialized training. All colleges recognized \nthe importance and benefits that can be gained from adapting to the policy. However, such operations were subject to contextual limitations and the potential of each colleges that is different in terms of budget including the availability of resources for management. These \nresulted in different achievement and operational efficiency. The research suggested that the related agencies should focus on the contextual differences of educational institution. The policy should be clear and concrete that meets each college\u2019 needs. These will encourage educational institutions to be able to adapt themselves with similar operational standards to develop personnel of the country to have characteristics that are consistent with Thailand 4.0 Policy.

Since the coup, the chief aim of the military government has been to bring order to the country by silencing politics. In this paper, I trace the drift from democracy to dictatorship as a set of disagreements about democracy and its redistribution of political capacity. Specifically, I show how debates revolving around the political capacities of the poor reflect both the emergence of a new subject of politics and the anxieties produced by shifting arrangements of the political. 1 Working from the vantage point of urban railway squatter communities in northeastern Thailand, I show how disagreements between residents, non-governmental organization activists, state development agencies and the military reflect unresolved tensions between multiple orderings of the political and the unreconciled question of who is a legitimate political actor. Residents' engagements with development projects preceding the coup expose the ways in which their emergent claims to political capacity provoked new governmental strategies to incorporate their voices but manage their political aspirations. Military rule has once again transformed the shape of the political, narrowing the horizons of political possibility for citizens such as those living along the railway tracks. Yet, even amidst such threats, the military government remains fragile precisely because the political is always contingent, composed of heterogeneous disagreements. By making these processes legible through an ethnography of disagreement, I argue that anthropology and ethnog-raphy are fundamental for understanding the emerging forms of the political in the 21st century.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66232776, "asset_id": 46545211, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2639747, "first_name": "Eli", "last_name": "Elinoff", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "EliElinoff", "display_name": "Eli Elinoff", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/EliElinoff?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2639747/10821521/12077742/s65_eli.elinoff.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3472, "name": "Political Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Anthropology?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99127, "name": "Thai politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_politics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2791986, "name": "Anthropology of Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Democracy?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 45791748, "title": "Maria Montessori and Helen Parkhurst compared", "created_at": "2021-04-07T10:20:45.861-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45791748/Maria_Montessori_and_Helen_Parkhurst_compared?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_45791748", "summary": "What are the differences and similarities between the Montessori Method and the Dalton Plan?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66204021, "asset_id": 45791748, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3707221, "first_name": "Piet", "last_name": "van der Ploeg", "domain_name": "academica-group", "page_name": "PietvanderPloeg", "display_name": "Piet van der Ploeg", "profile_url": "https://academica-group.academia.edu/PietvanderPloeg?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3707221/1323045/103627491/s65_piet.van_der_ploeg.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3753, "name": "Early Childhood Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Childhood_Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4583, "name": "Child Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_Development?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 21289, "name": "Educational reform", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_reform?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 25701, "name": "Progressive Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Progressive_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 172264, "name": "Educational studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_studies?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 221297, "name": "Montessori", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Montessori?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 262429, "name": "Montessori Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Montessori_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 414710, "name": "Montessori Method", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Montessori_Method?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 45623260, "title": "Emile Kok-Kheng Yeoh, Chang Le and Zhang Yemo (2018), \u201cMalaysia-Taiwan Relations and Taiwan\u2019s New Southbound Policy\u201d, Malaysian Journal of International Relations, Volume 6, December 2018, pp. 8-34.", "created_at": "2021-03-26T22:42:02.638-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45623260/Emile_Kok_Kheng_Yeoh_Chang_Le_and_Zhang_Yemo_2018_Malaysia_Taiwan_Relations_and_Taiwan_s_New_Southbound_Policy_Malaysian_Journal_of_International_Relations_Volume_6_December_2018_pp_8_34?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_45623260", "summary": "The main objective of Taiwan's New Southbound Policy is to reduce Taiwan's economic dependence on Mainland China (People's Republic of China/ PRC) and seek new engine for the economic development of Taiwan.

In spite of this challenge, how do educators at the College of Development Communication (CDC), University of the Philippines Los Ba\u00f1os help shape Filipino citizens who have steadfast love for and commitment to the country?

With basic interpretive qualitative study as research design, it selected eight participants from CDC through stratified random sampling, gathered data through depth interviewing, and derived knowledge claims through themeing the data and focused coding.\n\nThe participants\u2019 understanding of nationalism has three aspects: 1) as a character trait; 2) as an action or an undertaking; and 3) as a process of shaping identity and character of a nation\u2019s citizen.

They\nintegrate their understanding and feeling of nationalism in their instruction functions through the following: 1) topics discussed or given emphasis in class; 2) learning activity; and 3) learning approach. This paper hopes for the rekindling of the discourse of nationalism in DevCom among scholars and practitioners of the field as they reflect on how DevCom can better serve marginalized Filipinos and

The participants (N = 461, 77.4% female, 22.6% male) attended a General English (GE) course that required them to learn fifty English words every week. The vocabulary tests took place in the first ten minutes of the class for ten weeks delivered by using Socrative. At the end of the course, this study investigated learner acceptance and perceived risk of cheating using a set of survey constructed based on Davis (1989) and collected the data of vocabulary learning outcomes and proficiency levels. The data were, then, analysed by using independent t-test, correlation, and multiple regression analyses. The results indicated Thai EFL learner acceptance of Socrative with the risk of cheating during vocabulary tests. Learner acceptance was influenced by proficiency level and predicted a small amount of learning outcomes. These results have some implications for instructional course designs adopting online quizzes for testing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64655494, "asset_id": 44277102, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7766834, "first_name": "Asst.

The topic has received significant media attention, and innumerable organizations have released sustainability goals. In 2015, the United Nations published the seventeen interrelated Sustainable Development Goals, that promote economic, social, and environmental sustainability (United Nations, n.d.). The Association of Southeast Asian Nations recently affirmed similar goals in a June 2019 statement (\u201cASEAN leaders\u2019 vision statement,\u201d 2019). This report introduces a project designed in response to this need to introduce students to sustainability and explores the impact of this project on students\u2019 environmental worldview. The project was implemented in an intensive English for academic purposes (EAP) course at a university in Thailand. This 10-week course prepares students to enter an English-medium bachelor\u2019s degree program. The main goals of the program are to develop language proficiency; however, this is accomplished through engagement with meaningful real-world content. This could be classified as the weak form of \u201cContent and Language Integrated Learning\u201d (CLIL), which has the goal of helping \u201clearners develop their target language competency as a primary aim and their subject/theme/topic knowledge as a secondary aim\u201d (Ikeda, 2013, p. 32). The principles of Project-Based Learning (PBL), which is gaining recognition as an effective approach to learning (Chen & Yang, 2019), informed the design of the project. After reviewing relevant literature on PBL, this report explains the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale. It then provides the results of pre- and post-project administrations of the NEP to students in the intensive English program and interprets the results. Finally, it discusses implications for further iterations of the same project and for projects implemented in other contexts.

They are undoubtedly a step in the right direction against a culture pervading Thai institutions that subjects students to strict discipline and obedience to orders, sometimes at the expense of their rights and liberties. However, some doubts linger over whether the implementation of the regulations will actually broaden the choices that students have when it comes to their bodies, let alone stay true to the spirit of protecting their dignity.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63291453, "asset_id": 43029190, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31824421, "first_name": "Netiwit", "last_name": "Chotiphatphaisal", "domain_name": "chula", "page_name": "NetiwitChotiphatphaisal", "display_name": "Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal", "profile_url": "https://chula.academia.edu/NetiwitChotiphatphaisal?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31824421/9454336/10534550/s65__._.jpg_oh_002288d0d124da75f85fb8e481bda415_oe_55ee2e7a___gda___1442139921_5f1b8fca6ee170ecbf263764a908e057"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11256, "name": "School Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Bullying?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34598, "name": "Authoritarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authoritarianism?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 166250, "name": "Conformity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conformity?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 508371, "name": "Curriculum and Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_and_Pedagogy?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 630675, "name": "School Rules", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Rules?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 970013, "name": "Haircut", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Haircut?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 42922482, "title": "EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF TASK-BASED LANGUAGE TEACHING ON UNIVERSITY BUSINESS STUDENTS IN BANGKOK", "created_at": "2020-05-02T09:19:03.506-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42922482/EXAMINING_THE_EFFECT_OF_TASK_BASED_LANGUAGE_TEACHING_ON_UNIVERSITY_BUSINESS_STUDENTS_IN_BANGKOK?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_42922482", "summary": "The purpose of this study was to introduce Task-Based Language Teaching in a bid to energise stagnant English language performances among second-year business students (N = 81), studying a private university in the peripheral areas of Bangkok. Students followed a TBLT learning environment for one semester (16 weeks), and subsequent end-of-term performances were compared with prior attainments achieved under tradition forms of instruction using t-tests (0.05). Overall, TBTL proved to positively influence performance outcomes when compared to the traditional method (TBLT: 60.9 = Grade C+; TRAD: 54.93 = Grade C; p [0.0195] = sig <0.05). Nonetheless, the majority of progress derived from enhancements in speaking skills, as assessments in this domain improved significantly, whereas no significant difference was observed in formal examinations. Further to this however, variability analyses highlighted that upper quartile students significantly improved in both speaking and formal examinations, while the lower quartile cluster failed to show noteworthy forms of progress in speaking, and, formal examination scores exacerbated entirely; concluding therefore that learners' response to TBLT is governed by their linguistic potential. The recommendation therefore would be to arrange two separate groupings based on ability for two reasons: (1) assist accelerated acquisition of more proficient students who thrive in a TBLT environment, and, (2) to provide curricular support for struggling students for whom TBLT is not (yet) developmentally appropriate.

This concern voices calls for increased attention to ESL/EFL learners' sense of self and their positioning with respect to English. This study explored Thai postgraduates' feelings about their taking ownership of English as an International Lingua Franca in ASEAN and how they view themselves in relation to the language. A qualitative approach was applied, using open-ended interview questions asking 44 postgraduates who enrolled on existing courses of the two English-related programmes. No shared sense of ownership is found, but the idea that English is used as a language for communication is highlighted. Since their relation to English is mainly found to be socioeconomic and English is widely recognised for the sake of their educational, economic and social growth and prospects, the assumption that \u2017the West is the world' is still prevalent. Although getting involved in various English-related activities, these students' identity through their national language remains firm, and English is not considered the main determinant of their identity. The study provides suggestions aiming for valuing gains in English proficiency, together with instilling a respect for ASEAN local languages and cultures. \n\nKeywords: English as an international lingua franca, appropriation of English, ownership of English, present-day English", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62192638, "asset_id": 42065917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4317341, "first_name": "Songyut", "last_name": "Akkakoson", "domain_name": "kmutnb", "page_name": "SongyutAkkakoson", "display_name": "Songyut  Akkakoson", "profile_url": "https://kmutnb.academia.edu/SongyutAkkakoson?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4317341/1728873/2070667/s65_songyut.akkakoson.jpg"}, {"id": 25015918, "first_name": "Songyut", "last_name": "Akkakoson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SongyutAkkakoson", "display_name": "Songyut Akkakoson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SongyutAkkakoson?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25015918/7891873/8841820/s65_songyut.akkakoson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 104240, "name": "Genre Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre_Analysis?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42048503, "title": "\u0e17\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e27\u0e19\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21: \u0e27\u0e32\u0e17\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e40\u0e01\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e43\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32: \u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e15\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e08\u0e08\u0e38\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e19", "created_at": "2020-02-23T04:31:40.243-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42048503/%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1_%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A2_%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2_%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B_%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%96%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_42048503", "summary": "\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e17\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e27\u0e19\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e27\u0e32\u0e17\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e40\u0e01\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e43\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e19\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e02\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32 \u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e21\u0e32\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e28\u0e36\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e14\u0e35\u0e15", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62175175, "asset_id": 42048503, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52071008, "first_name": "Lilit", "last_name": "Worawutsunthorn", "domain_name": "chiangmai", "page_name": "LilitWorawutsunthorn", "display_name": "Lilit Worawutsunthorn", "profile_url": "https://chiangmai.academia.edu/LilitWorawutsunthorn?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52071008/23374344/22448272/s65_norberto.worawutsunthorn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41727226, "title": "School autonomy and accountability in Thailand: Does the gap between policy intent and implementation matter", "created_at": "2020-01-24T13:30:02.588-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41727226/School_autonomy_and_accountability_in_Thailand_Does_the_gap_between_policy_intent_and_implementation_matter?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_41727226", "summary": "This article contrasts policy intent and policy implementation in school autonomy and accountability.

A case involving non-developed-countries has been rarely discussed and is relatively unexplored in the field of public service interpreting and translation (PSIT) within the discipline of Translation Studies. The findings obtained by reviewing the relevant literature revealed two views. First, local authorities in Japan have attempted to overcome the challenges of budget constraints and securing human resources, especially due to the limited diffusion of university-trained language interpreters and translators. Secondly, PSIT in Thailand has not been deployed based on language policy because of political instability.

Providing stakeholders with baseline information about who composes the foreign teaching force in Thailand, this paper discusses as well why English has been dubbed as the \"language of the elite,\" making it the leading foreign language studied in Thailand. Although this study initially sought to look into the demographics of foreign English-speaking teachers in Thailand, only one major finding reveals how demographic data can point to a hierarchical practice observed in the existing types of English programs offered to Thai parents and their children. Background The advent of globalization has introduced humankind to a whole myriad of changes, affecting people domestically and internationally. People experience changes that are not only germane to a certain domestic context. Instead, because of globalization, these changes are facilitated and take shape both within an identified milieu and across international borders. Manifested in different forms and from various directions, globalization remains as one of the catalysts for migration, greatly impacting education on various strands. These dimensions range from what is taught, how lessons are taught and who are teaching. This study centers on the third issue, believing that much of what goes on in the classroom is heavily dependent not only on the national curricular directions of a country but also on who has been entrusted to carry out curricular content within the four corners of the classroom. As such, it is imperative that information about the teachers who have been entrusted to engineer", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61505200, "asset_id": 41286166, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 91759, "first_name": "Analiza Liezl", "last_name": "Perez-Amurao", "domain_name": "mahidol", "page_name": "AnalizaLiezlPerezAmurao", "display_name": "Analiza Liezl Perez-Amurao", "profile_url": "https://mahidol.academia.edu/AnalizaLiezlPerezAmurao?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/91759/25484/3215990/s65_analiza.perez-amurao.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 654773, "name": "Teacher demographics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_demographics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41060282, "title": "Chuenwattana, C.

Although this issue has been accepted broadly in educational psychology,further research is required to examine the relationship between learning styles and language learning skills. Thus, the present study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the perceptual learning style preferences and the participants' writing achievement after receiving instruction based on computer-assisted language learning within the activity theory framework. For this purpose, 67 students majoring in English translation at a university in Iran were selected as the participants of the study based on their performance on a version of The Oxford Placement Test. A correlational research design was employed using a writing pretest and posttest and a style preference questionnaire. The writing instruction was based on an e-learning platform designed according to the activity theory framework. The results indicated lack of significant relationship between the participants'learning style preferences and theirwriting achievement. It was also found that there was no significant difference in the writing achievement of the participants across different learning style preferences.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60006980,

The instrument applied for data collection was the questionnaire. The data obtained were analyzed by the applications of percentage, mean and standard deviation. The research results revealed the following: 1) The overview condition of the teachers' competencies in the 21 st century of the pre-service teachers was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 3.61). When considering each competency, the spiritual teacher was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 3.73). The personal development was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 3.57). The teacher characteristic was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 3.53). Based on the overall aspect, the spiritual teacher was the highest average. The lowest average was the teacher characteristics. The overview expectation for the teachers' competencies in the 21 st century of the pre-service teachers was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 4.16). When considering each competency, the expectation for the spiritual teacher was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 4.23). 2) The expectation for the personal development was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 4.18). The expectation for the teacher characteristics was high (\u00ed \u00b5\u00ed\u00b2\u0099 = 4.05) Based on the overall aspect, the expectation for the spiritual teacher was the highest average.

with an application of Toulmin\u2019s model was developed after our concern of encouraging students\u2019 ability to think. This activity is an essential and advanced practice for thought, requiring readers to comprehend the text by identifying the author\u2019s claims under dispute. It requires readers to develop their own views in response to the text with support of evidence. This allowed us to consider whether it is on par with Kuhn\u2019s idea of \u201cthe core sets of intellectual skills\u201d: \u201cinquiry\u201d and \u201carguing\u201d, the skills to prepare students\u2019 minds to be educationally developed. Our conducted study of an opinion with the application of the model revealed that it meets the requirement of Kuhn\u2019s proposed idea. As figured out point by point, the model helps readers to inquire the author\u2019s claim, investigate the author\u2019s clarity, justify the text with a practice of reading between the lines and text interpretation, figure out the readers\u2019 solutions of the existing questions and problems, formulate\nwith clarity their own positions towards the author\u2019s with good reasoning. We conclude that assigning students to read opinions with the application of Toulmin\u2019s model as a teaching activity is worth\npracticing for improving students\u2019 thinking process, and possibly their intellectual achievement.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59292185, "asset_id": 39166938, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

It argues that Ayutthayan kingship was unusually intensively sacralised in terms of two quite different modes simultaneously, the divinised and the righteous. These modes, both in themselves and in conjunction, produced somewhat paradoxical effects as well as forms of authority. The article thereby adopts a global perspective on Ayutthaya kingship while also offering some thoughts as to how and why it developed in the way it did and how Narai strove to manage the

The results indicate that the acquisition of English as an economic lingua franca was considered important regardless of the demographic factors of the company examined. A majority of the respondents expressed the belief\nthat their businesses had provided adequate resource allocation for English preparedness and a majority also indicated that their respective workforces possessed adequate English skills.

The pedagogy designed specifically equips the children the ability to answer basic questions, it also trains them to master basic skills and knowledge in listening and speaking in their daily life. The research begins by collecting and analyzing data from previous related researches, projects, as well as the volunteers\u2019 observations and real-life experiences. Especially, the real experiences of the project participants as voluntary English teachers were emphasized. \nThe findings are as below:\n1.\tListening to sound: those who love music and singing find that learning a language is easy. \n2.\tSpeaking to foreigners is fun, because both parties put in much effort and have to try hard to understand each other. In this regard they use their body languages as well as linguistic skills to convey their thoughts. \n3.\tFrom the collected data, we find that children who stay near the town of Khlong Ngae are more active, open and brave to speak; while the children who live in the village areas are more reserved and shy. Hence, breaking their reservation must be done through using simple and friendly conversations, activities and games to develop trust and confidence in speaking English.\n4.\tFinally, there might be suggestions that learning English should start from developing listening skills. English should be used as a medium in English Class to give students more opportunity to use it, and that body language is an important tool for teaching and learning English. Learning is best done when there is no stress, as it helps to open up the students\u2019 minds, and the individual effort of the students is also a very important factor. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58334437, "asset_id": 38287911, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51574489, "first_name": "Jaroon", "last_name": "Chaibao", "domain_name": "ibc", "page_name": "JaroonChaibao", "display_name": "Jaroon  Chaibao", "profile_url": "https://ibc.academia.edu/JaroonChaibao?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51574489/19152522/21319417/s65_jaroon.chaibao.jpg"}, {"id": 82006508, "first_name": "Chutimadee", "last_name": "Chaibao", "domain_name": "thammasat", "page_name": "\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e15\u0e34\u0e21\u0e14\u0e35\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e32", "display_name": "Chutimadee Chaibao", "profile_url": "https://thammasat.academia.edu/%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B2?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82006508/22308942/21526192/s65__._.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38283370, "title": "\u0e41\u0e19\u0e27\u0e04\u0e34\u0e14\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e35\u0e19\u0e34\u0e22\u0e21\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e34\u0e22\u0e21\u0e43\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e1e - Social Values in Neoliberalism - Jobs and Higher Education in Thailand", "created_at": "2019-02-04T05:51:42.654-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38283370/%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A1_%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A3_%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84_%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%9E_Social_Values_in_Neoliberalism_Jobs_and_Higher_Education_in_Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_38283370", "summary": "Education is one of famous public goods that people should deserve from a government.

From these phenomena, we can see the stealth of revolution of neoliberalism that eroding higher education system and affecting to students who will become more competitive in higher education admission system; moreover, it makes inequality of education accessibility.  \n\nFrom the following problem, this research will explain a relationship between a government and social under the conditions of neoliberalism, which is the stealth of revolution, and find out the mechanism of neoliberalism that\u2019s affected the social values of jobs and higher education. Education is one of famous public goods that people should deserve from a government. Since \u2018Neoliberalism\u2019 approached on political economy, social values of studying in higher education grew up highly and become a one of commodification. Currently, Thailand higher education is facing with the mechanism of neoliberalism that\u2019s created a highly competitive in higher education admission system. From 1970 revolution in Thailand, higher education mobilized from elites to massification, people can access these public goods to serve the globalization.

has played a vital role in Thailand\u2019s development, poli- tics, and society.

From broad issues of enrollment to the specifics of what it is like to attend a Thai university, this chapter provides descriptive and analytical commentary on Thai higher education. It analyzes issues such as the challenges of private universities being treated more like competitors than partners to public higher education, how an increased focus on standardization has led to the homogeneity of higher education institutions, and inequality in Thai society resulting from the higher education system. This chapter describes the evolution of higher education in Thailand with a focus on the major trends of privatization and massification beginning in the late 1960s. It then goes on to describe and analyze a spectrum of issues related to Thai higher education such as policies, funding, quality assurance, and university life.

A total of 1394 Facebook posts by the six universities in 2014 were analysed using content analysis. This study established 12 post types: research, faculty, curriculum, campus, students, alumni, industry, events, products, image and reputation, announcements, and others. The most common post type by USA universities is research, whereas the most common post types by Thai universities are events and announcements. From the findings, the author suggests that HEIs have to be both proactive and strategic on social media.

English is vital to exchange organic farming practices with other farms outside their country and is a necessary skill to promote ecotourism to international tourists (Morrow, 2015; Upayokin, 2007; Wallenberger, 2012).  This research article will use a 2017 visit to a community in Phetchaburi, Thailand as a case study to look at addressing this community\u2019s needs from an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) approach (Belcher, 2004; Swales, 1985).  Because this and similar communities have limited economic resources and less access to English teachers and classrooms, we focus on publicly available materials on the Internet.  After a needs analysis, this article will focus on how YouTube videos can be used to develop and expand a corpus of materials for English acquisition to meet local needs.  Specific attention will be paid to developing media literacy skills (Bloom & Johnston, 2010; Hobbs, 2010; Silverblatt, Miller, Smith, & Brown, 2014) as a way to further empower local teachers and students in their English language acquisition.  The final purpose of this paper is to propose sustainable language development to support sustainable ecotourism and economic vitality.

The informants are 10 elders with age above and equal to 60 years old who live in Bangkok regardless of genders. Data were collected through documents, detailed interview, and non-participant observation of elders to 360\u00b0 virtual reality travel media with data triangulation. 1. From the literature review on appropriate 360\u00b0 virtual reality travel media design for elders, the results found that 1. The creation of 360\u00b0 virtual reality must primarily consider the target consumers on their physics, 2. 360\u00b0 virtual reality must have fluidity on changing view of the camera by calibrating with the target consumers, 3. The image displayed must not move too fast to prevent dizziness and improve comfort of the target consumers. It is also highly recommended to implement a function to customize movement rate for the customer, 4. The resolution of the display should be high and if the target consumers have visibility problems, they would use eyeglasses too to achieve best immersion, 5. The quality of sound effects and soundtracks must be high and clear enough. The sound should be stereo for the target consumers to recognize the direction of the sound. 2. From the in-depth interview of the target consumers, the results found that 1. They are worried and not used to the equipment, but they are interest in the equipment and did not feel fear, 2. They have no idea where to look, 3. They are dizzy, 4. They feel excited, 5. They are interest in what is more to see, 6 They feel like they did actually travel there, 7. They can hear sound clearly, 8. They do not like when the camera is moving and find still camera more comfortable. 3. From the non-participant observation, the researchers continuously observed the target consumers and found that they are always excited, laughed, and smiled when watching the media. They always asked where this is and why they cannot see anything when turning around. Some participants cannot hear the sound clearly and some even have nausea like when they have got car sickness so they have to remove the equipment and rest before trying again. From the comparison, there are 9 out of 10 elders who have nausea from watching moving 360\u00b0 virtual reality media but there is only 1 person who got nausea when watching still 360\u00b0 virtual reality media.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57083240, "asset_id": 37132749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21274538, "first_name": "The International Journal of Multimedia & Its Applications", "last_name": "(IJMA) - ERA Indexed", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "journal", "display_name": "The International Journal of Multimedia & Its Applications (IJMA) - ERA Indexed", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/journal?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21274538/5930840/74440279/s65_the_international_journal_of_multimedia_its_applications._ijma_-_era_indexed.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2151, "name": "Virtual Reality (Computer Graphics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_Reality_Computer_Graphics_?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3419, "name": "Multimedia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimedia?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12417, "name": "Multimedia Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimedia_Learning?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12697, "name": "Virtual Art & Virtual Reality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_Art_and_Virtual_Reality?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 50642, "name": "Virtual Reality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_Reality?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 64283, "name": "Elderly", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elderly?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 88908, "name": "Elderly People", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elderly_People?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1019262, "name": "Virtual Reality Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Virtual_Reality_Technology?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 2998123, "name": " Koh Rattakosin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Koh_Rattakosin?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 37108111, "title": "Forgotten Voices: The policy-practice gap in Thailand's education system through the perspectives of its teachers", "created_at": "2018-07-23T23:58:49.526-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37108111/Forgotten_Voices_The_policy_practice_gap_in_Thailands_education_system_through_the_perspectives_of_its_teachers?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_37108111", "summary": "Ever since the overhauling National Education Act 1999, Thailand's formal basic education has undergone what is perceived an endless 'reform era' up until the present day. Despite countless policy attempts to rectify the situation, the notion of a 'quality crisis' has prevailed and intensified in policy discussions and criticisms by all parties concerned. In this light, this research seeks to uncover the perhaps overlooked factors underlying the ineffectiveness and inefficiencies of education policy and reform, by exploring the gap between policy and practice through the often unheard voices of teachers within the system. Taking the policy enactment approach, which recognises the indispensability of practice-level contexts and variations in policy output, the research obtained qualitative empirical data from interviews conducted with four secondary-school teachers in Bangkok. Through their accounts, it has been demonstrated that the policy-practice gap cuts across all stages of the policy process, from inception to delivery, in turn undermining potential for policy success as well as disempowering teachers as enactors of policy. Such mismatch include policy expectations vs practical limitations, policy generalisability vs practical specificity, and policy overload vs practical capacity, to name a few. The dissertation argues that such pitfall has played a significant role in hindering envisioned improvements to the education system, and that efforts from both policy and practice needs to be sought in order to foster a more collaborative and constructive relationship between them. Recommended areas for further research are offered towards the end of the thesis, as well as a proposition for a non-governmental organisation which could function to bridge such gap, in order to facilitate a healthier policy ecosystem for education in Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57059640, "asset_id": 37108111, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14182739, "first_name": "Thornchanok", "last_name": "Uerpairojkit", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "ThornchanokUerpairojkit", "display_name": "Thornchanok Uerpairojkit", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/ThornchanokUerpairojkit?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14182739/3895082/19878053/s65_thornchanok_joyce_.uerpairojkit.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 798, "name": "Policy Analysis/Policy Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Analysis_Policy_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111537, "name": "Educational Policy Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Policy_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 123896, "name": "Teachers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teachers?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 383762, "name": "Thailand Education, Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand_Education_Education_Policy?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 468679, "name": "Teaching Profession", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_Profession?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 2996219, "name": "Policy-practice gap", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy-practice_gap?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 37101040, "title": "Education Policy Research Series Education Systems in ASEAN+6 Countries: A Comparative Analysis of Selected Educational Issues", "created_at": "2018-07-23T00:05:08.084-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37101040/Education_Policy_Research_Series_Education_Systems_in_ASEAN_6_Countries_A_Comparative_Analysis_of_Selected_Educational_Issues?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_37101040", "summary": "UNESCO, Bangkok 2014\nEducation Policy Research Series\nDiscussion Document No. 5", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57052452, "asset_id": 37101040, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8134403, "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Franco", "domain_name": "astate", "page_name": "AlexanderFranco", "display_name": "Alexander Franco", "profile_url": "https://astate.academia.edu/AlexanderFranco?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8134403/13129521/18099171/s65_alexander.franco.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38972, "name": "ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 183140, "name": "ASEAN Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ASEAN_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 309620, "name": "Asean Economic Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asean_Economic_Community?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 37069259, "title": "Wondering Monks.pdf", "created_at": "2018-07-18T01:33:29.354-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37069259/Wondering_Monks_pdf?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_37069259", "summary": "A review of a book which portrays monks in the forest tradition of Thailand inaccurately.

Without suggesting that language\r\nrepresents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue\r\nthat anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand\u2019s southern\r\nimpasse must be more informed about language policy, linguistic justice, and how\r\nlinguistic repertoires are linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

thesis:\r\nhttps://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/17747\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\nThis thesis is a contribution to two bodies of scholarship: first, the historical understanding of the modernisation process in Siam; second, one of the central bodies of scholarship used to analyse sport sociologically \u2013 Norbert Elias and Eric Dunning\u2019s study. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies of the emergence of a more civilised form of manner in modern Siam highlight the imitation of Western civilised conducts, overlooking the continued role of violence in this change in Siamese behaviour from the pre-modern to modern periods. According to evidence, from around the 1900s, Siamese elites engaged in deliberate projects to civilise prevalent non-elites\u2019 aggressive conducts. This, in turn, has implications for the Eliasian understanding of sports and civilising process, which emphasises their unplanned development in Europe, at the expense of grasping the deliberate interventions of the Siamese elites. To fill this gap, I apply the concept of the \u201ccivilising offensive\u201d to underline the planned process of civilisation. \r\n\r\nThe thesis discusses how aggressive masculinity was expressed legitimately during the pre-modern age, and how this violent behaviour was transformed by the elites\u2019 promotions of civilising plans and sports under contexts of colonisation and nation-state building processes. I examine how civilised self-images were produced from interactions between Siamese elites, non-elites and Westerners. I use autobiographies, government documents, newspapers, match reports, chronicles, poems, travel writings and so on to explore first-hand accounts of behaviours, identities and values related to the presence of violence in sports and politics. \r\n\r\nFrom the 1820s onward, Westerners used what they perceived to be their higher civilisation standards as an excuse to interfere in Asia. In response to the Westerners\u2019 perceptions of the Siamese as barbarous, Siamese elites promoted civilised identities through sports and education. In the 1900s, to avoid being shamed, the non-elites learned to act in a civilised manner temporarily when interacting with elites and Westerners in sports fields. The civilising effect of interdependence between these actors showed that planned and unplanned processes of civilisation coexisted in Siam.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55979914, "asset_id": 36090339, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5902926, "first_name": "Charn", "last_name": "Panarut", "domain_name": "chiangmai", "page_name": "CharnPanarut", "display_name": "Charn Panarut", "profile_url": "https://chiangmai.academia.edu/CharnPanarut?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5902926/3299189/65246962/s65_charn.panarut.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51135, "name": "Civility and the Civilising Process", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civility_and_the_Civilising_Process?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 856211, "name": "Civilizing Process", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civilizing_Process?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1206236, "name": "Sportization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sportization?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 35873364, "title": "DANG 080218-CrossingBordersandShiftingBoundariesinJointMA.pdf", "created_at": "2018-02-08T14:07:21.643-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35873364/DANG_080218_CrossingBordersandShiftingBoundariesinJointMA_pdf?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_35873364", "summary": "This contribution addresses the complexity in establishing Erasmus Mundus joint master\u2019s\nprogrammes between European and Asian universities.

examines the teacher education space in Ghana, highlighting the key challenges and the way forward. The paper begins with reforms in the teacher education sector from the late 1980s, identifies the structure of the teacher education sector including quality issues that has bedeviled the field. It argues that improving teacher education and professional learning opportunities for in service and preservice teachers is a crucial step in transforming schools and improving academic achievement. By drawing on the experiences of other contexts, the paper concludes there is the need to improve teacher skills and knowledge to ensure that every teacher is able to teach increasingly diverse learners, knowledgeable about student learning, competent in complex subject matter content, and skillful at the craft of teaching.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54476388, "asset_id": 34610560, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1631608, "first_name": "Prince", "last_name": "Armah, PhD", "domain_name": "aberdeen", "page_name": "PRINCEHARMAH", "display_name": "Prince H .

The Internet allows us to realise trauma of people being placed in violent incident. Three main considerations are worth taking for granted. First, the Internet leads to a convergence of the past and the present. The Internet illuminates a trauma supposedly buried in and by the past to the present recognition. Second, the Internet underlines a distinction between life that is worth remembering and life that is not as if time makes a decision to remember or to forget a traumatised life. If time permits a memorisation of some deadly people, such life will be a particular form of life that time chooses to remember, which is different from life that time chooses not. Third, the violent image does travel beyond one border as the Internet displays trauma globally. Those considerations are conditions for a reflection of the politics of the Internet philosophically. That is to say, the Internet creates a so-called \u2018a zone of proximity\u2019 in threefold. First, it highlights the proximity between the survivor from the atrocious incident and the listener. Second, it shows an attempt to forget trauma yet hardly possible to remove it from mind; this is implied that trauma exists eternally. Third, the last zone of proximity points out to the irony of modern society. The use of technology in a harmful way reflects how humans are heading towards becoming-animals.

instructional method on the photosynthesis issue, 4) to analyze of students\u2019 associations between  their learning achievements and their systematic thinking abilities with the post learning activities that based on learning conceptual approach with the STEM Education instructional method on the photosynthesis issue. Data administrations with a sample size consisted of 21 upper secondary educational students at the 11th grade level from Mahawichanukul School under the Maha Sarakham Secondary Educational Service Area Office 26 with the purposive sampling random technique was selected. The research instruments were determined with a main-STEM Education instructional method\u2019s lesson plan to management of the activity-based learning conceptual approach in 15 hours, the Learning Achievement Assessing Test, and the Systematic Thinking Ability Measuring Test were used. Statistically significant with the average mean score, standard deviation, percentage, independent variable t-test were analyzed, simple and multiple correlations, standardized regression weight validity, and coefficient predictive value (R2) were associated.    \n        The results of these research findings have revealed as:\n1.\tStudents were evaluated to determine performance criteria with the efficiency of the processing performance and the performance results (E1/E2) of the STEM Education instructional method\u2019s lesson plan to management to the activity-based learning conceptual approach indicated that of 77.16/75.24, which was higher than standardized criteria of 75/75. \n2.\tStudents\u2019 learning achievements of their pre-test and post-test assessing differences were also found evidence of statistically significant at the 0.01 level.\n3.\tStudents\u2019 responses of their systematic thinking abilities to their previous and lately learning with the STEM Education instructional method\u2019s lesson plan to management of the activity-based learning conceptual approach were differentiated evidence of 0.01, significantly.\nAssociations between students\u2019 performances of their learning achievements and their systematic thinking abilities toward their activity-based learning conceptual approach with the STEM Education instructional method on the photosynthesis class were considered together, there was a significant evidence of the 0.01 with the systematic thinking abilities, relatively.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53254340,

mark in the history of Ayutthaya. She lived across four reigns as royal daughter, queen, and royal mother. In the Thai chronicles, the account of her is minimal. French and Dutch residents in Siam, however, were fascinated by her. Although they never saw her in person, they recorded fragments of information. Though the resulting record is fragmentary and fragile, it shows how the elite women of Ayutthaya suff ered the limitations of their position and yet explored the possibilities of their access to wealth, knowledge, and power.]", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54855520, "asset_id": 33002360, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6772017, "first_name": "Surachet", "last_name": "Sukhlabhkich", "domain_name": "chula", "page_name": "surajeshthasukhlabhkich", "display_name": "Surachet  Sukhlabhkich", "profile_url": "https://chula.academia.edu/surajeshthasukhlabhkich?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6772017/2639962/81656252/s65_surachet.sukhlabhkich.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1726, "name": "Women's History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_History?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2701629, "name": "History of Ayutthaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Ayutthaya?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32978687, "title": "DESIGNING THE INNOVATIVE LEARNING MANAGEMENT PLANS IN FORM OF THE STEM EDUCATION INSTRUCTIONAL METHOD TO DEVELOP THE PRIMARY STUDENTS OF THEIR CREATIVE  THINKING LEARNING PROCESSES IN SCIENCE CLASS  AT THE 2ND GRADE LEVEL", "created_at": "2017-05-12T03:42:43.148-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32978687/DESIGNING_THE_INNOVATIVE_LEARNING_MANAGEMENT_PLANS_IN_FORM_OF_THE_STEM_EDUCATION_INSTRUCTIONAL_METHOD_TO_DEVELOP_THE_PRIMARY_STUDENTS_OF_THEIR_CREATIVE_THINKING_LEARNING_PROCESSES_IN_SCIENCE_CLASS_AT_THE_2ND_GRADE_LEVEL?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_32978687", "summary": "The purposes of this research study for designing the innovative learning management lesson plans in the form of the STEM Education Method (STEMe) on Magnetic Force Issue in science class which were to develop an innovative learning management lesson plan that based on the model of learning management with the STEMe, students\u2019 learning achievements of their assessing pretest and posttest techniques based on the STEMe were compared, students\u2019 creative thinking abilities (CTA) of their pre-CAT and post-CAT based on the model of learning management with the STEMe were assessed, and students\u2019 learning achievements of their assessing posttest and their creative thinking abilities based on the model of learning management with the STEMe were associated.

Research instruments were assessed with the 20-item Scientific Process Skill Test (SPST) that it was the 4-option multiple choice and the discriminative value (r) was ranged from  0.31 to 0.94, and with the confidence of both the 0.90 test achievement of four characters. Selecting the 30-item Learning Achievement Test (LAT) that it was the 4-option multiple choices, which deals of the discriminative value (r) was ranged from 0.27 to 0.80 and a confidence score of 0.92. The results of these findings have found and followed as: The E1/E2 efficiency was 77.07/76.97, which is higher than the standard set of 75/75 performance criteria. Comparisons between students of their SPST and the 75-percent criterion was 77.10 (= 15.42, = 1.35) and the differences between mean score of SPST and the 75-percent was differentiated at .05 levels, significantly. Comparisons between students\u2019 learning achievements of their post LAT was 76.96 (= 23.09, = 1.91), and differences indicated at the .05 level, significantly. Associations between students\u2019 encouragements of their SPST and their post LAT, the coefficient predictive value indicated that 31% that was contributed to enhance the science process skills and the achievements and had a statistically significant at the .05 level (R2 = 0.3121, \u01bf<.05), relatively. The results reflect that learning management with the STEM education method for encouraging science process skills and learning achievements of secondary students at the 10th grade level in physics class are successful at a certain level in the context of this research framework.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52698366, "asset_id": 32512473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

underlying factors in the cause of the economic and financial crisis that has hit the country over recent years very poor. This research reports on a study that investigated the role that Thai administrators\u2019 interpersonal relationships with their teachers play in enhancing the teachers\u2019 teaching plan and students\u2019 achievement in the subject and in forming or changing the teachers\u2019 attitudes to teaching arrangement. The questionnaires were administered to a sample of 716 teachers in 80 schools under the Office of Basic Education Commission (OBEC) throughout of Thailand. Administrator-teacher interactions were assessed with the 48-item Questionnaire on Administrator Interaction (QAI) which was adapted version from the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) (Wubbles & Levy, 1993). This questionnaire has an Actual and Preferred Forms. Teachers\u2019 attitudes were assessed with the Test of Administrator-Related Attitudes (TOARA) which was based on the Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA) (Fraser, 1981). Statistically significant differences were found between the teachers\u2019 perceptions of actual and preferred administrator interpersonal behaviours. It was found that administrator interpersonal behaviour was high on factors such as Leadership, Helping/Friendly, Understanding and Teacher Responsibility/Freedom behaviour, while factors such as Uncertain, Dissatisfied, Admonishing, and Strict behaviours were far less prominent. Significant differences were found between teachers\u2019 perceptions of actual and preferred administrator interpersonal behaviours, and a typology comparison of teachers\u2019 perceptions of Thai administrators could be classified as Authoritative in both the actual and preferred administrators\u2019 interpersonal behaviours. Associations between teachers\u2019 perceptions of their administrators\u2019 interpersonal behaviour with their attitudes to their school administration were found. The multiple correlations were significant for the Actual Form of the QAI and the TOARA, 39% of the variance in teacher\u2019s attitude to their schools was attributable to their perceptions. Based on the findings, suggestions for determining and effecting the school administrations by school\u2019s administrator interpersonal behaviour for improving sustainable educational development in school\u2019s administration in Thailand with teachers\u2019 perceptions are provided.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52217513, "asset_id": 31939391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29518315, "first_name": "Open Access Publishing", "last_name": "Group", "domain_name": "open", "page_name": "OpenAccessPublishingGroup", "display_name": "Open Access Publishing  Group", "profile_url": "https://open.academia.edu/OpenAccessPublishingGroup?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/29518315/8465646/13139675/s65_open_access_publishing.group.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1077, "name": "Educational Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Leadership?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2334, "name": "Educational Administration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Administration?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 20471, "name": "Leadership Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership_Development?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 31469, "name": "Interpersonal Relationships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interpersonal_Relationships?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 51625, "name": "Educaci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educaci%C3%B3n?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 54727, "name": "Educational Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Sciences?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 54819, "name": "Educational science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_science?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 65733, "name": "Educational management and leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_management_and_leadership?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 77802, "name": "School Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Leadership?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 84578, "name": "Educational", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 93811, "name": "Educa\u00e7\u00e3o", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educa%C3%A7%C3%A3o?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 130005, "name": "Educazione", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educazione?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 172264, "name": "Educational studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_studies?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 469249, "name": "Education Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Studies?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 473562, "name": "Educational Leadership Styles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Leadership_Styles?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 533100, "name": "Leadership Styles of School Administrators", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership_Styles_of_School_Administrators?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 565128, "name": "School management and leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_management_and_leadership?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1031715, "name": "Educacion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educacion-2?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1357303, "name": "Teachers\u2019 Perceptions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teachers_Perceptions-1?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 2663263, "name": "interpersonal behaviours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/interpersonal_behaviours?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 2663264, "name": "basic education schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/basic_education_schools?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 2663265, "name": "Office of Basic Education Commission ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Office_of_Basic_Education_Commission?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 30655718, "title": "Thailand -

In this brief paper, China, Bulgaria and Thailand serve in part as an illustration.\nThe broader frame for these comments is the need to strive for equity, in the profession, in our world  -- how to advance from an economics of competition and greed in the profession (and wider society) to an economics of equitable cooperation, and an ELT community of practice that is more democratic and sustainable.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50483627, "asset_id": 30028033, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6972608, "first_name": "Bill", "last_name": "Templer", "domain_name": "shu-bg", "page_name": "BillTempler", "display_name": "Bill Templer", "profile_url": "https://shu-bg.academia.edu/BillTempler?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6972608/13668869/14806214/s65_bill.templer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 302696, "name": "Teaching English as a foreign language (TEFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_foreign_language_TEFL_?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 355088, "name": "English as a lingua franca (ELF)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_a_lingua_franca_ELF_?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2507932, "name": "Teachers as workers in ELT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teachers_as_workers_in_ELT?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2574058, "name": "Equity in Remuneration in TEFL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equity_in_Remuneration_in_TEFL?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29949860, "title": "Beyond the Assimilation Fixation: Skinner and the Possibility of a Spatial Approach to Twentieth-Century Thai History", "created_at": "2016-11-18T18:27:16.727-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29949860/Beyond_the_Assimilation_Fixation_Skinner_and_the_Possibility_of_a_Spatial_Approach_to_Twentieth_Century_Thai_History?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_29949860", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62254736, "asset_id": 29949860, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3279186, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Montesano", "domain_name": "iseaslib", "page_name": "MichaelMontesano", "display_name": "Michael Montesano", "profile_url": "https://iseaslib.academia.edu/MichaelMontesano?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 93755, "name": "History and archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_archaeology?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 351894, "name": "Chinese Overseas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Overseas?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 523853, "name": "System modeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/System_modeling?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 29885940, "title": "(2017) Why monolingual mind-sets, linguistic justice, and language policy are all central to a peaceful, political resolution to Thailand's southern impasse", "created_at": "2016-11-16T07:21:57.236-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29885940/_2017_Why_monolingual_mind_sets_linguistic_justice_and_language_policy_are_all_central_to_a_peaceful_political_resolution_to_Thailands_southern_impasse?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_29885940", "summary": "No credible claims can be made that the role of language \u2013 specifically Malay \u2013 has been entirely overlooked by those studying conflict dynamics in South Thailand. Nevertheless, those concerned with religious factors dwarf the number of studies interrogating language issues. Without suggesting that language represents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue that anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand's southern impasse must be more informed about language policy, monolingual mind-sets, and linguistic justice, namely how linguistic repertoires and linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are theoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper's two substantive sections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and how the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states between South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok's policies towards southern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking Buddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South Thailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact with recent treatments of how language and religion are involved in constructions of ethno-nationalisms, and linguistic injustice that leads to inequality among linguist minorities. I conclude suggesting reasons for anyone seeking peaceful political resolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority possesses close connections to the Malay cosmopolis \u2013 needing address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand's (deeply entrenched) monolingual mind-set and discriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.",

Ageism in employment involves setting arbitrary mandatory age limits for employees, such as teachers or civil servants, or practicing discrimination, often hidden, in hiring or retaining employees even in their 40s and 50s. It may be especially insidious directed against older women. A survey by the author of EFL job openings posted in Thailand in March 2004 indicates that some ads specify that candidates over a set age (often 45, sometimes 30, in one case 58) need not apply.\nThe article argues for the need to change this discriminatory practice in TEFL staffing and career trajectories.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47777273, "asset_id": 27521967, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6972608, "first_name": "Bill", "last_name": "Templer", "domain_name": "shu-bg", "page_name": "BillTempler", "display_name": "Bill Templer", "profile_url": "https://shu-bg.academia.edu/BillTempler?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6972608/13668869/14806214/s65_bill.templer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13055, "name": "Ageism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ageism?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2507932, "name": "Teachers as workers in ELT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teachers_as_workers_in_ELT?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2507933, "name": "Equity on the job", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equity_on_the_job?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 27483823, "title": "ADVANTAGES OF K-12 EDUCATION", "created_at": "2016-08-02T17:22:26.711-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27483823/ADVANTAGES_OF_K_12_EDUCATION?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_27483823", "summary": "The program aims to uplift the quality of education in the Philippines in order for graduates to be easily employed.

of \u2018runaway\u2019 migrant contract workers in Asia has attracted considerable media attention. Drawing on a qualitative study in Vietnam and Taiwan, I examine the critical links between the neoliberal governmentality rationalities and technologies, the structural vulnerabilities that they produce, and the migrant worker's \u2018technologies of the self\u2019. In so doing, I point out that the \u2018manufacturing\u2019 of the \u2018ideal\u2019 migrant subject is a multi-actor and multilayered process that involves not only state and market actors but also the migrants themselves through their internalisation of subordination. I emphasise that illegality is not just a legal status but also a political tool for the state and its proxies to discipline neoliberal subjects and a social image that informs individual practice in the context of transnational labour migration.

In this paper, I will focus on how the civilised self-image of Thai elites was constructed to interact with the Westerners and non-elites, rather than on the elites' imitations of the civilised behaviours of the westerners. I will also discuss how the previously-legitimate, aggressive masculinity, conducted in traditional warfare and war-like pastimes, were transformed and negotiated, with the softened masculinity. The gentle masculinity was gradually built up in the colonial era when the Thai elites attempted to monopolise the use of violence. This study helps to transcend the limits of previous researches, which considered the masculinity as the single and static form and the concept unrelated to other genders. The narrative analysis is utilised to explore first-hand accounts of experiences, behaviours, in-group identifications and values on the use of violence in sports and day-to-day events. The expression of their masculinities will be considered with regards to the long-term change in social interdependencies, from the universal monarchical regime in the eighteenth century to the nation-state since the 1820s and onward. Rather than the unplanned civilising process experienced in Europe, the evidence shows that Thai elites planned to soften the aggressive masculinity of the untamed non-elites under nation-state building processes. To avoid being ashamed, the non-elites learned to temporally curb aggressive masculinity and act in a civilised manner when doing sports and interacting with elites and the Westerners.",

"dom_id": "work_15585503", "summary": "Abstract: This research project is based on two prime objectives:  1) to construct and validate a learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster in universities in the north of Thailand and 2) to try out the learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster in universities in the northern part of Thailand and to study the results of the implementation of the learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster. Research methods consisted of two steps.  Firstly, the learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster was developed from a review of related documents and a field study using focus groups was conducted along with summarizing using content analysis techniques.  Secondly, the developed learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy was validated using multi-case studies of teaching profession course cluster in three institutions of higher education in northern Thailand.\nThe research result found that \n1. The developed learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster following the guidance of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej  has important implications for educational management focusing  on education to help individuals search for an appropriate way of  life leading to conventional progress and happiness as well as leaning management in  line with King Bhumibol\u2019s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, Constructivist Theory, Social Cognitive Learning Theory, and Information Processing Theory, and using the B.Joyce, M.Weil, and E.Calhoun\u2019 models of teaching concepts. The components of the developed learning management model include 1. orientation to the model: theories, concepts, and principles, and goals focusing on the principle of encouraging students to apply the sufficiency economy philosophy for self development in all behaviors in economics, ethics, learning, physical health, social systems, personality/personal habits, natural resources and the environment, and technology  with  modesty, reasonableness, and immunity from bad influences based on knowledge and morality and    2. the model of teaching: syntax, social system, principles of reaction, support system, application, and instructional and nurturant effects. The principle of the model has five important aspects: 1)  instruction and learning is highlighted and to achieve learning as a process where the learner must manually construct knowledge there must be  a good environment which can accommodate  learning, 2) the learning process emphasizes students\u2019 reflective thinking,  problem solving, and implementation with the sufficiency economy philosophy  using critical reflection to impact thinking and acting, 3) learners develop skills that encourage learning ability, 4) instruction is managed systematically, and   5)  the  learning process focuses on a child centered approach with diversity in practices. The model\u2019s objective has three attributes:  1) good, it is the spirit of being a teacher with the use of the sufficiency economy philosophy to control  thinking and acting, 2) smart, it is intelligence and mastery in the science of learning management using skill to encourage learning ability such as analytical skills, synthesis, evaluation, problem solving, and the application of knowledge in the teaching profession, and 3) happy, it is the person who maintains learning as a process and learns continuously throughout life, questing and wanting  to know. A learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy in teaching profession course cluster has five processes of learning or the \u201cPLRCA Model\u201d as follows:  1) Preparing: P 2) Learning: L 3) Reflecting: R 4) Constructing: C , and 5) Assessing: A. The result of verifying the model using \u2018Connoisseurship\u2019 with five educators from three higher education institutes as stakeholders indicated that the developed learning management model has good quality and can be used appropriately with a learning management  model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster in universities in the northern part of Thailand  \n2. The result of multi-case studies of the implementation of the learning  management model for teacher education based on the sufficiency economy philosophy carried out in the faculties of education at three universities in the northern part of Thailand using teacher education subjects (Naresuan University four subjects, Chieng Mai University one subject, and Uttaradit Rajabhat University two subjects) showed that the  learning management model based on the sufficiency economy philosophy for teaching profession course cluster led to improved learning outcomes for students studying all seven subjects at the three institutes of higher learning in northern Thailand.\n \nKeywords: learning management model, the sufficiency economy philosophy, \nteaching profession", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38730215, "asset_id": 15585503, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32275795, "first_name": "Wareerat", "last_name": "Kaewurai", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "WareeratKaewurai", "display_name": "Wareerat Kaewurai", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/WareeratKaewurai?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32275795/9656511/30832221/s65_wareerat.kaewurai.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 14712953, "title": "Education for Coexistence", "created_at": "2015-08-06T05:15:29.413-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14712953/Education_for_Coexistence?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_14712953", "summary": "Coexistence has always been a key societal issue.

Although his interests may appear unsurprising for someone hailing from the north which is widely regarded as Thailand\u2019s most ethnically diverse region, Thailand\u2019s ethnic diverse has been ignored or downplayed by foreign and Thai scholars alike. Thai citizens of Chinese descent were once regarded as Thailand\u2019s largest and most successfully assimilated ethnic minority, and Peter Vail (2007) has referred to the one million Khmer residents of Isaan as an invisible minority. The largest, least assimilated \u2013 not to mention most problematic \u2013 ethnic constituency in Thailand are the Malays of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat. The cultural geography of the Malay World in Thailand might have once extended as far north as Rayong, and Malay-speaking communities in Central Thailand still exist, but there has been unprecedented violence in the restive south. This chapter revisits the role of ethnicity and religion in one of the world\u2019s deadliest subnational conflicts. Vaddhanaphuti, in his analysis of ethnic conflict between upland and lowland communities in North Thailand, argued for multi-causality in which access to natural resources and uneven development were important factors. I ask what an acceptance of multi-causality, and the inadequacies of framing Thailand\u2019s southern violence as a religious and/or ethnic conflict contributes to an analysis of the south. This chapter develops Imtiyaz Yusuf\u2019s proposal that violence in South represents a conflict between the competing chauvinistic ethno-religious worldviews of Thai satsanaa and Malay agama. In it, I propose moving beyond rounding up the \u201cusual suspects\u201d in two ways. Firstly, I remind readers of the presence of uncivil Buddhism constituencies within Thailand. Although Islam and Christianity are commonly be associated with violence, people unfamiliar with Buddhist initiated violence against Muslims in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and South Thailand may be surprised by the concept of Buddhist warfare coined by commentators such as Michael Jerryson (2010). Secondly, I ask new questions for the usual suspects. I argue that increased assimilation among urban Malays and reformist activism throughout the south are has led to unprecedented diversity. Not only have (mainly urban) Malay communities benefited from time modernity, but the fragmented nature of the Muslim leadership has undermined its ability to discredit religiously motivated attacks against both fellow Muslims and the Thai state. My analysis of the Islamic credentials of the insurgency distinguishes between jihadi rhetoric, and a coherent jihadi rationale. I argue that local actors have adopted the former from movements sharing their concern to defend Islam. While it is undeniable that these adhere to a highly ethnocized version of Islam, they clash with uncivil Buddhist elements at a time when the role of the Thai military  in public life shows no signs of abating", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37877928, "asset_id": 12913162, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 39796385, "asset_id": 12913162, "asset_type": "Work",

Three major research methods are applied, including questionnaire survey, participant observation and regression analysis. Data will be obtained from the questionnaire answers of local inhabitants and analysed via SPSS10.3 statistical methods. The main outcomes of this study are as follows: 1) In Tainan City, Kaohsiung City and Taichung City, we have found that the partitioning of urban space has begun to become. Among this, the outcome of Taichung City is much stronger than that of the two other cities. 2) In the impacts of migrant workers\u2019 gathering on commercial streets, community inhabitants also have more tolerant attitude than shop keepers. The community inhabitants of Taichung City have more hostile than those of the two other cities. 3) In comparison of South-eastern Asian migrant workers\u2019 gathering in urban commercial area and its relations between the partitioning of urban space, from the viewpoint of local inhabitants, we have found different influential factors among Tainan City, Kaohsiung City and Taichung City. We can say that these factors will be valid predictable variables on divided cities resulted from migrant workers\u2019 gathering/consumption activities in the paper. In the meantime, we can obtain these influential factors among these three cities through two variables: 1) community inhabitants\u2019 socio-economic attributes and 2) community inhabitants\u2019 responses to migrant workers\u2019 gathering/consumption activities in commercial area.

This study tries to answer 2 research questions; i) What are the characteristics of entrepreneurs who make use of NFE\u2019s curriculum? And ii) What factors drive\nentrepreneurs to start up their own businesses. The survey was conducted on through 52 entrepreneurs who passed NFE\u2019s curriculum and established their own businesses since 2011 - 2012. Interview and questionnaires were used as tools to collect data. Statistics shows that most entrepreneurs are married men between the ages of 45-50 years old or women between 30 \u2013 50 years old, and most were not university educated. Most of their businesses are micro enterprises and are owned by single entrepreneurs. Pair sample t-testing illustrates that gender, married status, and education level were significantly\nrelated to entrepreneur starting up businesses. Furthermore, sizes of the firm, type, form of enterprise, location were also positive contributors. Moreover, Pair sample T-testing indicates that factors driving entrepreneurs running and starting\nup their own businesses correlated with capital, knowledge which was obtained from NFE, while personal and socio-culture factors were ignored.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37581399, "asset_id": 12296154, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

"The purposes of this study were to investigate the learning style preferences of education students at a government university in Thailand and to discover whether differentiated learning exists in Thai education institutions. To achieve these dual aims the researcher used a Thai language version of the perceptual learning style questionnaire and surveyed Thai teachers on their knowledge and use of differentiated learning. It was found that the Thai students\u2019 most preferred style is kinesthetic and individual their least. This is different from students from North-East Asia and the author expresses doubts whether the epistemology of perceptual learning styles is applicable to Thai culture. There is no significant difference in learning styles according to gender and home region of Thailand, however there is between learning styles and course of study. This study uncovered no institutional barriers to using differential learning in the Thai classroom, but it is not widely known, nor practiced. \n\nKeywords: culture, differentiated learning, perceptual learning styles Thailand\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37339913, "asset_id": 11997391, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8202823, "first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Kiddle", "domain_name": "ramkhamnheang", "page_name": "RichardKiddle", "display_name": "Richard Kiddle", "profile_url": "https://ramkhamnheang.academia.edu/RichardKiddle?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8202823/2864964/3346112/s65_richard.kiddle.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 176506, "name": "Learning Styles and Multiple Intelligences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_Styles_and_Multiple_Intelligences?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 11518950, "title": "\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e09\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e19\u0e39\u0e0d\u0e43\u0e19\u0e41\u0e07\u0e48\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e0f\u0e34\u0e27\u0e31\u0e15\u0e34 2475\r\nA Look at the Cultural Politics of the Constitution Fairs after 1932 Revolution", "created_at": "2015-03-18T23:29:47.108-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11518950/%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%90%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%8D%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%87_%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%92%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%8F%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4_2475_A_Look_at_the_Cultural_Politics_of_the_Constitution_Fairs_after_1932_Revolution?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_11518950", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37029115, "asset_id": 11518950, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17510233, "first_name": "Preedee", "last_name": "Hongsaton", "domain_name": "linnaeus", "page_name": "PreedeeHongsaton", "display_name": "Preedee Hongsaton", "profile_url": "https://linnaeus.academia.edu/PreedeeHongsaton?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17510233/7924837/52204449/s65_preedee.hongsaton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4487, "name": "Revolutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Revolutions?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6749, "name": "Cultural Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Politics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11213732, "title": "Transformative Language Education: The English of Sustainability", "created_at": "2015-03-02T17:20:25.875-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11213732/Transformative_Language_Education_The_English_of_Sustainability?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_11213732", "summary": "As the countries of South-East Asia continue to broaden their horizons and coalesce into a single ASEAN community, numerous transformations are taking place that will radically alter the educational landscape. The ASEAN Secretariat emphasizes sustainable development as a goal to permeate the changes ahead, which will require the voices and experiences of all the stakeholders involved. Current university students in Thailand will graduate during the integration of the ASEAN Economic Community and will face social change in all aspects of society. Preparing students for the challenges ahead is the context for this paper\u2019s focus: a term-long project that combines business studies and EFL. The project uses content-based language instruction and transformative pedagogy to engage students in study of the Triple Bottom Line framework developed by John Elkington. In addition to improving students\u2019 language skills, the aim of the project is to provide students with a richer understanding of social responsibility and business ethics \u2014 an understanding that they develop themselves through exploration and critical thinking. Determining the successfulness of a company by researching and analyzing its effects on the environment and society in addition to its profitability offers students the opportunity to rethink corporations\u2019 role in society as well as their own. Student autonomy is emphasized through independent research, peer editing, and negotiating meaning of sustainability. The project described in this paper can be adapted to suit a wide range of content and should therefore be of interest to language teachers in diverse contexts.

Students transitioning from this educational system to liberal arts universities in Thailand and beyond face serious disadvantages. The liberal arts model, which emphasizes enquiry, problem solving, and critical analysis, stands in stark contrast to teacher-centered models of education, which value passivity, obedience, and memorization. This paper presents various educational technologies that are utilized to prepare students to enter an English-medium liberal arts program at a Thai university. These tools include online resources such as Google Drive, Hangouts on Air, and VoiceThread. These technologies have the potential to change many aspects of language teaching. Students collaborate to conduct research and to create content that is relevant to their own experience, practicing their language skills and engaging meaningfully with their peers. In the process of researching, discussing, and presenting their findings, students construct their own understanding of contentious topics and controversial current events. Through this process of exploration and interaction, students are empowered to take greater responsibility for their own learning, beginning a personal transformation that will continue throughout their time in the liberal arts program. This paper will present several applications of educational technology in the EFL classroom and, using the RAT \u2014 Replacement, Amplification, and Transformation framework, assess the degree to which these applications transform learning.

This pilot project sets out to develop both of these skills among students at an international college preparation center using online teaching tools. The participants are between the ages of 17-20, are both male and female, and the overwhelming majority are of Thai ethnicity. We aim to look at the practice of discretely teaching critical thinking skills, at the same time as teaching basic to intermediate English skills, to see whether students learned how to communicate successfully and meaningfully. Communicating meaningfully requires students to be able to find data, analyze and evaluate it, come to a reasoned decision about that data, and be able to clearly communicate this process to others both verbally and in writing. This pilot project is the first step in examining the practice of teaching the multiple stages of critical thinking through an online platform. After further refinements and piloting, we expect to see a demonstrable increase in meaningful communication after the addition of discrete critical thinking skills in the curriculum.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61740712, "asset_id": 11196393, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10022245, "first_name": "Alexander", "last_name": "Nanni", "domain_name": "mahidol", "page_name": "AlexanderNanni", "display_name": "Alexander Nanni", "profile_url": "https://mahidol.academia.edu/AlexanderNanni?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10022245/4106054/52382440/s65_alexander.nanni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1003, "name": "Educational Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Technology?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1005, "name": "English for Specific Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Specific_Purposes?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1006, "name": "English for Academic Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Academic_Purposes?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 3457, "name": "Learning and Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_and_Teaching?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 4474, "name": "Critical Thinking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Thinking?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 7585, "name": "ICT in Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICT_in_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 15439, "name": "Teaching English As A Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_As_A_Foreign_Language?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 15869, "name": "Online Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_Learning?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 51126, "name": "English Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 99517, "name": "English as a Foreign Language (EFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_a_Foreign_Language_EFL_?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 202887, "name": "ICT in teaching  and learning English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICT_in_teaching_and_learning_English_language?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 295014, "name": "Flipped Classroom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Flipped_Classroom?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 827606, "name": "English As a Second Language (ESL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_As_a_Second_Language_ESL_?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 11196224, "title": "Assessment of ELLs\u2019 Critical Thinking Using the Holistic Critical Thinking Scoring Rubric", "created_at": "2015-03-02T00:59:14.841-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11196224/Assessment_of_ELLs_Critical_Thinking_Using_the_Holistic_Critical_Thinking_Scoring_Rubric?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_11196224", "summary": "A significant proportion of students entering international colleges in Thailand lack both the English language skills and critical thinking skills necessary for them to succeed in higher education. The ability to think critically has been correlated with successful reading comprehension and grade point average (GPA); however, many high schools in Thailand fail to develop this ability. This paper is part of an ongoing investigation into the use of Facione\u2019s Holistic Critical Thinking Scoring Rubric to assess the critical thinking skills of students enrolled in an intensive English program for students entering a Thai university. Students\u2019 critical thinking was assessed at the beginning and end of a 10-week term, during which students received explicit instruction on critical thinking.

The research also showed that in addressing the second research question, teachers could support children learning EAL by using a variety of teaching aids and methods, awareness of Thai culture, and working with a native Thai teacher. The third research question suggested that teachers support teaching methods that encourage child-centred learning and reciprocity among students. However, can be a challenge in the Thai context due to cultural differences.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36763698, "asset_id": 11067032, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10432904, "first_name": "Seb", "last_name": "Jefferies", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SebJefferies", "display_name": "Seb  Jefferies", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SebJefferies?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10432904/3615641/4241201/s65_seb.jefferies.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 145787, "name": "EAL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/EAL?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1109060, "name": "Quality of Education In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quality_of_Education_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 11012748, "title": "Dalton School, Dalton Plan, Dalton Education", "created_at": "2015-02-23T06:20:57.767-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11012748/Dalton_School_Dalton_Plan_Dalton_Education?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_11012748", "summary": "(published in: SAGE, Encyclopedia of Educational Theory and Philosophy 2014)\r\n\r\nThe American teacher Helen Parkhurst (1886-1973) developed at the beginning of the twentieth century the Dalton Plan to reform the then current pedagogics and the then usual manner of classroom management.

After descendants of Chinese immigrants, widely regarded as Thailand\u2019s largest and most successfully assimilated ethnic minority, Malays residing south of Satun and Songkhla are over three times more numerous that the Northern Khmer of southern Isaan, its next most populous ethnic minority. Practically all Thai citizens self-identifying as Melayu are Muslims, and Islam is Thailand\u2019s largest religious minority. Nevertheless, not all Muslims self-identify as Malays, and Islam has long been acknowledged as being anything but a monolith. In addition to being an ethnically diverse ecumene, its sectarian divisions mirror those present throughout Southeast Asia. Some surmise Thailand\u2019s Muslims being divided between \u201cMalay-Muslims\u201d, and \u201cThai-Muslims\u201d who are either traditionalist or reformist in orientation. This paper proposes perspectives on Thailand\u2019s Muslim mosaic based multi-sited fieldwork among Sufi orders (Ar. turuq, tariqa [sg.]) with visible and viable followings from among the Central Thai-speaking, Southern Thai-speaking, and Malay-speaking Muslim communities. This paper seeks to articulate alternatives to the double-barreled binaries that have provided the theoretical ballast in previous explorations of Muslim ethnic and religious diversity. Whilst relevant details of these hereunto unstudied Sufi orders are provided, this paper\u2019s considers the significance of their presence in three cultural milieu between Ayutthaya and Narathiwat over the details of the spiritual lineages (Ar. silsilah) or litanies (Ar. wird) of individual orders. Rather than where these orders have come from, I concentrate on both their adoption by Central Thai, Southern Thailand, and Malay-speaking Muslims, and the manner in which they have been adapted in ways that reflect these regional identities. Most tariqa might remain within the cultural milieu where they have been localized, but boundaries between these are far from fixed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36208298, "asset_id": 10084819, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Joll", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "ChristopherJoll", "display_name": "Christopher M Joll", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/ChristopherJoll?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/667449/851788/1060921/s65_cm.joll.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 12978, "name": "Muslim Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Minorities?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 13099, "name": "Islam in the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 15473, "name": "Muslims in Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 28459, "name": "Tariqa Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tariqa_Sufism?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 99127, "name": "Thai politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_politics?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 120972, "name": "Muslims", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 132080, "name": "Thai Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Language?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 177375, "name": "Cosmopolitan Sufism & Religiosity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Sufism_and_Religiosity?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 184350, "name": "Ethnogenesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnogenesis?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 282897, "name": "Islam and Sufism in South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_and_Sufism_in_South_Asia?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 499449, "name": "Thai Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Study?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 599915, "name": "South Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1222787, "name": "Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_East_South_Asia_and_Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1223711, "name": "Contemporary Muslim society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Muslim_society?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1375815, "name": "Patani", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Patani?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1383602, "name": "Malayness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayness?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1750941, "name": "Muslims in South Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_South_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 9950591, "title": "Connecting the Disconnected Background, practices and motives of labour brokers in Isan, Thailand -

Nowadays around 192 million people work outside their country of birth, about three percent of the world's population. This rapidly increasing phenomenon is examined in a large number of studies on migration. Most of these studies, however, focus on the experiences and practicalities of migrants at the place of destination. In this study, we provide insight into the other side of the migration coin by investigating the experiences, motives and pathways of a carefully selected group of labour brokers living in the northeast of Thailand. Thailand is one the major suppliers of migrant workers who mostly come from the north-eastern part of Thailand, from a region called Isan. Local labour brokers are the heart of the whole labour migration system in Thailand but we do not really know why and how people become labour brokers, what they do and how they operate. By studying large issues in small places, as Eriksen (1995) phrased it, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the process of migration in general, and more specifically the supply end of the migration chain. Our main findings suggest that Isan labour brokers have often been migrants themselves. They want to become labour brokers in order to improve their social position, or to help their relatives and friends. They succeed because of some unique qualifications: overseas experience, entrepreneurial skills, access to information, overseas and local networks and, above all, embeddedness and status in the community in which they live.

The reasons for this neglect are complicated. Beyond (non-negligible) methodological constraints and difficulties in attaining access to some orders not open to outsiders, a double marginalization is observable. In addition to being located at the periphery of Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201cIslamic arc\u201d (Tagliacozzo 2013), those studying Islam in Thailand have focused on but more has been written on religiously motivated violence, and the (revivalist) Tablighi Jama\u2019at and (reformist) Salafiyyah which developed mass followings during the twentieth century, than the turuq they replaced. These range from those violently resisting Bangkok\u2019s project of assimilation in the far-south since 2014, to the revivalist Tablighi Jama\u2019at and reformist Salafiyyah that are now found throughout the country. This paper redresses such neglect by presenting a historical anthropology of Thai tariqa based on fieldwork among sufi orders in Thailand since late 2012. I begin by introducing some of the most important sufi personalities who, during the twentieth century, returned from educational sojourns in the Middle East, Java, and Kelantan, with permission (ijazah) to initiate or revive a range of sufi orders in Central Thailand (Ayutthaya and Bangkok), the Southern Thai-speaking upper south (Pang-nga Bay and Songkhla), and parts of the Malay-speaking far-south (Narathiwat). I describe ways in which orders widely distributed throughout the Muslim World such as the Qadriyyah, Shadhiliyyah, and Ahmadiyyah-Idrisiyyah, have been localized by Muslim communities in Thailand. I argue that successful doctrinal and ritual innovations are frequently championed by familiar people advocating and embodying something strange. The variety of localized global turuq that I present, challenge a number of assumptions about the cultural geography of Islamic diversity in contemporary Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments":

While schools and universities are trying to put efforts in developing English education in Thailand, a number of studies have shown that the achievement of Thai learners was unsatisfactory. As English is being used as an international medium of communication, numerous factors hamper the success of English language learning. Emphasis is given more to reading, writing, and grammar than to listening and speaking. Students had very minimal opportunities to exercise spoken English resulting to having a poor listening and speaking skills. The findings indicated that most participants encountered English listening problems related to the listening text, the speaker, and the listener at a high level. Other factors contributing to listening difficulties of EIC learners were the lack of opportunity to practice and use their English skills.\n\nCubalit, A, (2016).

Here I will give particular attention to the religious life and work of Khunying Yai Damrongthammasan, who appears to have produced one of the first significant Buddhist treatises ever authored by a Thai woman. In addition, I will also examine how her major teacher Somdet Phra Buddhaghosajarn Jaroen \u00d1\u0101navaro conveyed and reflected on Buddhist knowledge. In order to add further evidence to the major arguments I intend to develop in this article, I will also investigate, albeit only briefly, or refer to relevant aspects of the religious life of a number of female Buddhist practitioners of the same time period, many of whom did not come from a privileged social stratum as Khunying Yai did; she belonged to the nobility. The case studies will allow\nme to examine the significance of orality and memory for female Buddhist practice and education in early 20th century Thai Buddhism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Compared to traditional classic theatre, community theatres are different because they are rather political in their views and ideology. Contemporary Thai theatre NGO Makhampom Theatre Group has been working on development for the last 30 years, stating they are a Theatre for Development (TfD). This thesis explores the possibilities and limitation of providing Human Rights Education and social reformation through the community theatre process. For the study, one of the Youth Theatre projects of Makhampom, named Dao Loog Gai, in Pitsanulok province has been studied as a case study. \r\n\r\nThis Thesis argues that the development theatre implemented by the Makhampom Theatre Group develops community culture but it has not developed a rights based approach to participation and thus empowerment. In this context Makhampom Theatre Group as conveyer of Human Rights Education is not as strong as it could be, and their potential for being an agent for social change or \r\nreformation has been compromised. Finally this thesis concludes with some suggestions for the theatre process of Dao Loog Gai, i.e. Makhampom Theatre Group for updating practices and developing a more interactive relationship with the communities and audience.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34806453, "asset_id": 8342481, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8793745,

This project that has currently under the management of Ministry of Education is to promote students to practise Buddhism by directly learning the Buddhist subject from the monks. Mahamakut Buddhist University, Kalasin Buddhist Academic College has run the Teacher Monks in School Project according to the government policy since 2010. There has no any research about students\u2019 morality who have learnt from the monk teachers because the monk teachers, from the study of personal data, do not mostly finish a bachelor\u2019 degree. Are they ready in teaching morality in schools? Therefore, the objectives of this research were to study the basic morality of students who had learned the Buddhist subject from monk teachers and to study the relationships between monk teachers\u2019 roles and students\u2019 basic morality. 553 samples in three provinces: Kalasin, Nakhonpanom and Sakonnakhon, consisted of 106 monk teachers, 213 educational personnel, and 214 students from grade 1 to grade 12. The research instrument was the questionnaire. The statistics utilized for analyzing the data were frequency, mean, standard deviation and Pearson product moment correlation. The results of this research were found that students who learned from the monk teachers followed the basic morality at the high level and monk teachers\u2019 roles and students\u2019 basic morality had significant correlation with the monk teachers\u2019 roles.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34600983, "asset_id": 8164272, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6922799, "first_name": "Pinayo", "last_name": "Prommuang", "domain_name": "spu-th", "page_name": "PinayoPrommuang", "display_name": "Pinayo Prommuang", "profile_url": "https://spu-th.academia.edu/PinayoPrommuang?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6922799/2646699/5620474/s65_pinayo.prommuang.gif"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2570, "name": "Religion and Thai Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Thai_Culture?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217023, "name": "School ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_ethics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 223289, "name": "Ethics in TV dramas \"Monk\" and \"House, M.D.\"", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics_in_TV_dramas_Monk_and_House_M.D._?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 672224, "name": "Thai Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Buddhism?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 919530, "name": "Thai School-aged Children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_School-aged_Children?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 1032336, "name": "Educational Reform In Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reform_In_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}]}, {"id": 8164244, "title": "The Try Out of Kalasin Buddhist Academic College Lecturers\u2019 Teaching and Learning Evaluation Online Form", "created_at": "2014-09-01T20:44:17.208-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8164244/The_Try_Out_of_Kalasin_Buddhist_Academic_College_Lecturers_Teaching_and_Learning_Evaluation_Online_Form?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_8164244", "summary": "PhraKru Sutheevorasarn   (chantum51@gmail.com) \nPinayo Prommuang  (pinayo2001@yahoo.com)\nThongkham Ketchan  ((thongkam_199@hotmail.co.th)   \nSurasak Buddha  (mordindang_s@hotmail.com)\n\nAbstract  \nOver ten years, Mahamakut Buddhist University, Kalasin Buddhist Academic College (MBU. KBAC.) had used the pencil and paper teacher evaluation questionnaire. Nowadays, students are increasing of numbers years by years. Therefore, recording the data from the pencil and paper teacher evaluation questionnaire concerning the university lecturer\u2019s teaching and learning into the program uses much of time. In 2012, the researchers of MBU. KBAC. had developed the online form and studied the students\u2019 opinion on the evaluation of lecturers\u2019 teaching and learning via the online-form because of being a new thing in a Buddhist university in Thailand. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to study student\u2019s opinion on lecturers\u2019 teaching and learning through the Online Evaluation Form. The samples were 100 students who studied in the 1st to the 4th years. The research instruments were the questionnaire. The statistics utilized for analyzing the data was frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. The results of this research were found that students had opinion on the Online Evaluation Form at a moderate level in the overall picture, especially in the aspects of the alphabets to be easy to read, the online form showing as a universalized higher educational institution and log-in system before accessing into the form.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34600971, "asset_id": 8164244, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6922799, "first_name": "Pinayo", "last_name": "Prommuang", "domain_name": "spu-th", "page_name": "PinayoPrommuang", "display_name": "Pinayo Prommuang", "profile_url": "https://spu-th.academia.edu/PinayoPrommuang?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6922799/2646699/5620474/s65_pinayo.prommuang.gif"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 176591, "name": "Teacher Evaluation and Supervision", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Evaluation_and_Supervision?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8056075, "title": "\u0e44\u0e2a\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e48\u0e27", "created_at": "2014-08-22T21:33:54.365-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8056075/%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%AA_%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1_%E0%B8%A7?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_8056075", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34512762, "asset_id": 8056075, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15528863, "first_name": "NamFon", "last_name": "Muah", "domain_name": "phayao", "page_name": "NamFonMuah", "display_name": "NamFon Muah", "profile_url": "https://phayao.academia.edu/NamFonMuah?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15528863/4191036/4880025/s65_namfon.muah.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 684778, "name": "\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19\u0e27\u0e34\u0e08\u0e31\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5_%E0%B8%99_%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%88?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8044444, "title": "Anucha - The Younger Brother in Ramakien and Thai Historical Narratives", "created_at": "2014-08-21T15:29:32.181-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8044444/Anucha_The_Younger_Brother_in_Ramakien_and_Thai_Historical_Narratives?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_8044444", "summary": "This paper analyzes the role of the younger brother in Ramakien with three characters examined: Phra Lak, Sukhrip, and Phiphek. This study finds that there is common behavior depicted among these three characters with respect to their relationship with their older brothers in terms of four traits: loyalty, obedience, respect and deference. Furthermore, these characters can be classified as \u2018ideal\u2019 because they are depicted never deviating from their younger brother behavior, and consistently demonstrate all four traits in their relationship with their older brothers, even when presented the opportunity to stray. Accordingly, this study concluded that the portrait of an \u2018ideal\u2019 younger brother in Ramakien is one of unwavering loyalty, unquestioned obedience, unshakable respect and unflinching deference toward their older brother.\r\nA second part of this paper examines the portrayal of three royal younger brothers in Thai historical narratives: Ekathotsarot, brother of Naresuan; Prince Surasih, brother of Rama I; and Pinklao, brother of Rama IV. This study found that these three historical royal younger brothers are portrayed in the historical narratives as loyal companions, obedient servants, respectful attendants and deferential followers of their older brothers, the same qualities identified as defining the \u2018ideal\u2019 younger brother in Ramakien. \r\nThe findings from this study indicate that an important aspect of traditional Thai society has been the desire to project and uphold the \u2018ideal\u2019, as represented by the behavior shown in younger brother characters in Ramakien and paralleled in the portrayal of the younger brothers in Thai historical narratives.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34503797, "asset_id": 8044444, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

The document shows how education interfaces with social, cultural, economic, and political spheres of a nation as an integrated system, and how the lack in one sphere, disrupts the coherence of another sphere. It is critical that Thailand is included in this discussion series, as it has been in the Asian vanguard for the past three decades in terms of economic and social development, humanitarian efforts, and policy development. \r\nThailand is a natural choice to study education and Learning to Live Together since it has undergone an on-going educational reform process, has participated and cooperated with UNESCO and other major educational organizations in conducting international education initiatives and evaluations, and embraces the concepts embedded in the LTLT philosophy. The nation understands the essential value of education as indicated by its national budget for education - perhaps the highest percentage of its GDP in the world. It has developed a sophisticated educational plan with well-reasoned policies. Its cultural emphasis on King, culture, and Buddhism are naturally inclined to learning, diversity, inclusiveness and peaceful living. With the coming ASEAN integration, it is only natural that Thailand would demonstrate leadership and initiative since Thailand was an original ASEAN member and has been a leader amongst the ASEAN community in its development. It has not only influenced the region, but has made its mark in the larger world.\r\nIncluded in this discussion document are short summaries of Thailand\u2019s socio-economic and political contexts, the issues that have recently arise or have been long-standing concerns \u2013 most of them intertwined with education and the associated objectives linked to LTLT - and they certainly all figure heavily in current economic, political, and educational policies and debates. Issues most pressing are the disparities and inequalities found in the social and economic spheres, but also crossing into the educational sphere. \r\nThe past success of family planning has led to a greying society with labor shortages, rural to urban migration, and a glut of college graduates. The large number of refugees and migrant workers, their high fertility, lack of social nets, basic education, and recognition by the state are also assimilating into unintended factors that beg for attention. The sometimes wide chasm between education policy and classroom practice is great and hindered by economic disparity, teacher shortages, preferences for bureaucratic management styles, cultural narrowness, social stratification, urban draw, and political self interest. Overcoming these obstacles does not yet make bridging the idealistic intentions of educational reform with the traditional ways of teaching and learning a particularly graceful process. Yet, with the resilient and tenacious qualities inherent in Thai people, the chances of a better, brighter future are within reach if the nation can extend its philosophical goodness beyond the inconsistent urge to aggrandize the superficial that now handcuffs it.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35049621, "asset_id": 7786815, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4786, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Jones", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MichaelJones334", "display_name": "Michael E Jones", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MichaelJones334?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4786/1872/23555511/s65_michael.jones.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 933, "name": "New Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Media?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8280, "name": "Media Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15473, "name": "Muslims in Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 15735, "name": "Media Literacy Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Literacy_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 20031, "name": "Migrant labour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_labour?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 20520, "name": "Peace & Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies-3?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 20604, "name": "Migrant Children's Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Childrens_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 25411, "name": "Peace Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 46666, "name": "Human Rights in Asia / ASEAN", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_in_Asia_ASEAN?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 49459, "name": "Income inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Income_inequality?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 52815, "name": "Migrant workers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_workers?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 96933, "name": "Politics in Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_in_Thailand?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 97208, "name": "Rights of Migrant Workers, labour rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rights_of_Migrant_Workers_labour_rights?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 122125, "name": "Rights of migrant children & refugees", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rights_of_migrant_children_and_refugees?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 243943, "name": "regional integration in ASEAN and EU", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/regional_integration_in_ASEAN_and_EU?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 247377, "name": "Migrant Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Education?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 309620, "name": "Asean Economic Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asean_Economic_Community?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 309621, "name": "Asean Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asean_Integration?f_ri=1032336"}, {"id": 366267, "name": "Thailand Social and Political Conflcit;

chapter describes Patani\u2019s Indic, Islamic and Thai pasts. The argu- ment is that the Malay kerajaan of Patani was similar to\u2014rather than distinct from\u2014other port city-states on the peninsula and islands of Southeast Asia where a Sanskrit cosmopolis existed for a millennium before the earliest chapters of Islam\u2019s Southeast Asian expansion. Islam also circulated east and west of Patani through trade between the Middle East and China via the Indian Ocean. This created a range of Indian/Arab/Malay creole communities whose members played key roles in the adoption of, or adhesion to, Islam in Southeast Asian port city-states like Patani. India\u2019s importance to the arrival of Islam to the Thai/Malay peninsula relates to what Islam came to, where Islam initially came from, and who Islam came through. Rather than refer to conversion, I refer to an adhesion to, or adoption of, Islam. The impact of Thai and Islamic influences in Patani/Pattani following its defeat in 1785 is described. The details of the process through which the Malay Kingdom (SM. kerajaan) of   became the Thai Province of Pattani, including Bangkok\u2019s legislative and administrative initiatives are also provided. A central con- cern of this chapter is to highlight the fact that these developments coincided with a period of revolution and reform in the Hijaz. I describe how these developments impacted local religious life and thought through local luminaries such as Shaykh Daud Al-Fatani, Shaykh Ahmad Al-Fatani and Haji Sulong. The methodologies and contributions of present-day reformist revivalist movements are also described.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33674643, "asset_id": 7014095, "asset_type": "Work",

A review of the processes through which Islam became an authentically Southeast Asian religion suggests that this merit-making conundrum is a recent example of the adoption and adaptation of Indic terms by Southeast Asian Muslims. These were central to the creation of Islamicate cultures. The concepts Indic and Islamicate are capable of pushing through conceptual cul-de-sacs such as syncretism and shared cosmologies. In addition to the specific generation of merit erroneously assumed as its only meaning, the article reveals that tham bun also denotes undifferentiated religious actions, and is code for a range of feasts unrelated to merit-making. It argues that the co-option of tham bun by Thai-speaking Muslims is an example of a search for equivalents. It also suggests the presence of an authentically Islamic economy of merit in Southern Thailand, confirming Islam\u2019s ability to speak the language of Indic Southeast Asians and to scratch where they itch.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33426080, "asset_id": 6703689, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher",

The ethnographic material presented is based on the author\u2019s ten years living and working among bilingual urban Malays, and a year making regular visits to rural communities in Narathiwat. One of the few things that informed analysts of South Thailand agree on is that a range of factors contributed to the resumption of violence in 2004. In addition to the role of political legitimacy, there is consensus that progress towards peace is complicated by the involvement of uncivil constituencies from two highly ethnicised religious communities. Despite the importance of ethnoreligious issues this paper argues that ethnolinguistic dynamics\u23afspecifically language loyalty, loss, and angst\u23afhave much to contribute to the return of peaceful co-existence and reconciliation. Although religious freedom in Thailand is promised and present, few minority languages in Thailand are strong now than they were before policies promulgated in the 1930s. I introduce the range of positions on the role of language and multi-lingualism in the construction of difference and the achievement of peaceful co-existence. I describe the range mono-lingual and bilingual communities in South Thailand. I also recount the variety of ways that Southern Malays have responded to the decline of Malay and the importance of Thai for those wishing to engage in Thai modernity. There is a need to as informed by ethno-linguistic angst as ethno-religious rebellion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32924081, "asset_id": 5960398, "asset_type": "Work",

It describes and analyses how online peer-based health counseling integrated HIV education and prevention alongside access to justice through free university-based clinical legal education (CLE) works to empower transgenders. It argues that a community-based approach that integrates HIV prevention and education and access to justice within a wider sexual health programme, through digital technologies, is a sustainable approach for other populations disproportionately at risk of HIV. Furthermore digital media offer strategic opportunities to overcome on-going political violence alongside entrenched stigma and discrimination that disrupt denial of access to justice.",

During the past two centuries, Thailand has faced a progression of events threatening its self-definition requiring very conscious educational and cultural reform policies to offset the advances of globalized movements. The first series of reforms began to take place in the late 19th century and served as a defensive measure to fend off the onslaught of European colonial activity and to unify a disjointed society. This reform was used to primarily centralize the cultural and religious authority and power of the kingdom, while assimilating the local/regional/rural areas through education. The most recent reform in late 20th century was devised to fend off global market forces and to unify a disjointed society through a strategy of decentralization and educational reform. Both these reforms were countered with strong resistance movements that reflect a resistance heritage that aspires to civil society.\r\n\r\nThis chapter examines some of the similarities of the past two eras of globalization in Thailand, their reforms, and how assimilation and extensive revisions to the cultural and spiritual elements of Thai society have provoked resistance movements. This chapter also suggests that the current alternative education movement in Thailand belongs to this heritage of resistance to national and international hegemony and envisions an inclusive and moral society that is attempting to prepare its citizens for a future in the globalized world. In that Thailand has invaluable experience dealing with the global and maintaining its independence, its story may be instructive for other developing countries as globalization will surely continue its unfoldment as will humanity\u2019s movement toward a civic world.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30630896, "asset_id": 2628932, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Like the rest of Thai/Malay peninsula, although the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Thailand\u2019s far-south are conservative traditionalists, the size and influence reformist Islam continues to increase. This is particularly the case among urban Malays. While the roots of reformism were sown in the 19th century by luminaries such as Syeikh Daud al-Fatani (1769-1847), and Syeikh Ahmed al-Fatani (1856-1908), the most important reformist personality in the early 20th centuries was Haji Sulong (1895-1945). Since his return from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, Dr Ismail Lutfi Japakiya, the founding of rector of Yala Islamic University (Thailand\u2019s first Islamic university) has emerged as the leader of Saudi style salafism. I conclude by considering the impact of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at, a South Asian revival movement, on Islamic diversity in South Thailand since its arrival in the 1980s. A important point infrequently made in analysis of the Tablighi Jama\u2019at is that both reformists and traditionalists are involved in this important revivalist movement.",

handful of cases in world history has female rule been seen by contemporary observers as desirable and been sustained for long periods of time. Drawing on European, Malay and Chinese sources, this article investigates the reasons for the institutionalisation of female rule in the Malay sultanate of Patani (presently in southern Thailand) for most of the period between c. 1584 and 1711. It is concluded that the results of previous research, in which the Patani queens are characterised as powerless front figures and/or promiscuous, have insufficient support in the contemporary\nsources. Furthermore, the problems of female rule for dynastic stability are\ndiscussed comparatively. Finally, the decline of female rule in Patani after the midseventeenth century is explained with reference to the larger political, economic and military changes in maritime Southeast Asia at the time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 28192544, "asset_id": 1950979, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2536366, "first_name": "Stefan", "last_name": "Ekl\u00f6f Amirell", "domain_name": "linnaeus", "page_name": "StefanEkl\u00f6fAmirell", "display_name": "Stefan  Ekl\u00f6f Amirell", "profile_url": "https://linnaeus.academia.edu/StefanEkl%C3%B6fAmirell?f_ri=1032336", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2536366/790017/3089178/s65_stefan.ekl_f_amirell.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12332, "name": "Women and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Politics?f_ri=1032336", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1897632, "title": "Governing Other Labor: Thai Migrant-workers in Taiwan and the Ethnic Segmentation of Labor Markets", "created_at": "2012-08-30T03:28:27.703-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1897632/Governing_Other_Labor_Thai_Migrant_workers_in_Taiwan_and_the_Ethnic_Segmentation_of_Labor_Markets?f_ri=1032336", "dom_id": "work_1897632", "summary": "\"The Thai and Taiwanese states structure the flow of transnational contract labor migration to benefit goals of national economic development. Migrant-workers from the northeastern Thailand are produced at the intersection development policies and processes of Other-definition. Neoliberal populist policies induce participation in consumer markets as a primary mode of development, and as an expression of Thai nationalism. Growth pole policies directed at attracting foreign investment have served to introduce wage labor to rural northeasterners. However, these policies have failed to generate sustained development and long-term employment for rural populations, and have increased rural-urban and rural-overseas labor migration. Stereotypes of northeastern Lao ethnics are used to justify their exploitation in the export labor market through the extraction of massive fees by recruiters, brokers, employers and states.\r\n\r\nThe Taiwanese state also exploits migrant labor to upgrade its infrastructure and to externalize some costs of labor market transitions. The import labor regime legally codifies a segmented labor market along ethnic-national boundaries. These segments of labor, previously attended by marginalized aborigines, are devalued as menial. These transnational overlaps of ethnic subjugation are used as tools of labor discipline, and to devalue the labor of migrant-workers. This enables circuits of migration capital, based on the movement of migrant-worker bodies, to extract future surpluses from migrants, which are capitalized as formal debts and land mortgages.
