The principal theses are that:\n(a)\tThe failure of the formal sector in many African countries to contribute to economic growth with equity has been due to its largely static and inflexible character;\n(b)\tDynamic adaptation of the informal sector to changing conditions in both domestic and international arenas has been an important domestic contributor to economic survival in those same African countries;\n(c)\tA superficial understanding of the arguments propounded by both the advocates and critics of dual economy theories (during the 1950's and 1960's in particular) contributed to the establishment of counterproductive formal sector economic development policies in African countries; which, in turn,\n(d)\tContributed to the absence of sufficient attention being paid to the dynamic contribution of the informal sector to those economies;\n(e)\tThe inadequate performance of the formal sector in both economic and political terms resulted in the alienation of formal government structures from the political communities they were expected to serve; and, given that alienation; \n(f)\tThe requirements of the informal sector (parallel economies) reinforced historically rooted authority structures and/or resulted in the creation of \"parallel governments.\"\nGiven the experience of the last two decades, increasing attention is being given to redressing the imbalance in our understanding of the relative roles of the formal and informal sectors.  However, much of that new attention remains too narrowly focused on conventional economic premises.  Therefore, this paper argues that reconsideration of those respective roles requires broader consideration of the political and cultural dimensions of the issue.  The most important institutional policy implication derived from the above analysis is that legitimating the informal sector (from the perspective of the formal sector) will require:\n(a)\tIntermediaries/interlocutors between culturally rooted practices and those of the internationally sanctioned formal sector; and\n(b)\tAttention to the legitimacy of informal sector quasi-governmental institutions which are an inherent part of that sector's economic role and behavior.\nBecause current thinking about the role of the informal sector and its relationship to the formal sector in Africa (and elsewhere) is yet in its early stages, this paper is limited to: (i) providing a critique of both the proponents and critics of previous dual economy theories; (ii) outlining the elements of a new, more appropriate, conceptual framework; and (iii) suggesting some implications for applying the suggested conceptual framework to both policy and operational aspects of economic development in Africa.  Thus, this paper is limited to setting forth the conceptual argument.  Testing the hypotheses of that framework will need further empirical work.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63354064, "asset_id": 43099961, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 105342791, "first_name": "Jerry", "last_name": "Silverman", "domain_name": "conflictanddevelopment", "page_name": "JSilverman", "display_name": "Jerry Silverman", "profile_url": "https://conflictanddevelopment.academia.edu/JSilverman?f_ri=685172", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 685172, "name": "Social and Political History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Political_History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3659478, "name": "Comparative History of World Bank, IMF, UNDP", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_History_of_World_Bank_IMF_UNDP?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35332421, "title": "Drost, A.

While West Papuan nationalists argue that the \u201cAct of Free Choice\u201d was a fraudulent process undertaken with the tacit agreement of the international community that denied them the right to self-determination, successive Indonesian governments have considered the Act binding and legal and rejected any possibility of West Papuan self-determination. The chapter begins with an overview of West Papua\u2019s integration into the Dutch East Indies and early Dutch policy in relation to the territory. This is followed by a discussion on the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands over the future and status of West Papua. The chapter then turns to West Papua\u2019s integration into the Republic of Indonesia, which represents the first major incompatibility in the conflict. The remaining parts of the chapter focus on the post integration period and examines how successive Indonesian governments have attempted to manage the conflict, and various West Papuan initiatives, up to the present day", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63902887, "asset_id": 43599700, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=685172", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 14370, "name": "Conflict Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Management?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 16211, "name": "Ethnic Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 36160, "name": "Ethnicity & Ethnic Conflicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Ethnic_Conflicts?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 53954, "name": "West Papua", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Papua?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 636840, "name": "Conflict and Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_and_Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 685172, "name": "Social and Political History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Political_History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=685172"}]}, {"id": 39623997, "title": "Camb.

Yet few documentary records remain from early 17th century Aceh. Given the Sultanate\u2019s significance to regional history, it is essential that surviving records from that early period be subjected to dedicated research. \n     One manuscript held in Cambridge University Library offers a rare window into that period of Acehnese history, and raises a myriad of questions. Cambridge MS. OR. Ii.6.45 contains the earliest substantial portion of exegesis on the Qur\u2019an in the Malay language, presenting extended commentary upon Sura 18 (al-Kahf). It can be dated to around 1600, and was most likely collected by one of the earliest Dutch maritime expeditions to Aceh. \n     Apart from its historical significance as an early document, Camb. MS. OR. Ii.6.45 is important for other reasons. It provides information on the theological concerns of Malays at a crucial period of Islamisation of the Malay world. Furthermore, it includes material considered by some as Isra\u2019iliyyat, which had become controversial in centres of learning in the Arab world at the time of the production of the MS. This raises questions about convergence and divergence between theological directions in Arabia and the Malay world at the time.\n     This paper will consider the history of MS Ii.6.45 within its Acehnese context, its sources and theological orientation. It summarises a major project I am undertaking in preparing a detailed study of this MS for publication.

In this considerably diverse region, composed of countries with different cultural and civilizational backgrounds and often multi-ethnic ones, the Russian Revolution exerted a mixed impact. It inspired anti-colonial freedom movements (in Southeast Asia, as in East Asia Marxism was understood mainly via the nationalistic prism) while at the same time being limited by hostility towards religion and by opposition to the control of the communist movement from Moscow. Thanks to many similarities with Confucianism  the influence of the Russian Revolution proved to be most long-lasting in Vietnam (and\nin Laos). In Buddhist Burma and Cambodia local political elites tried to mix Marxism with Buddhism (\u201cBuddhist socialism\u201d) but finally embarked on indigenous, autarchic models of socialist development. The impact of the Russian Revolution on other parts of Southeast Asia was much weaker. Only in Indonesia until 1965 communists enjoyed\nwidespread support, but it was later annihilated (the same happened, although for different reasons, in Malaysia after 1948 and in East Timor after 1975). The influence of the Russian Revolution on Thailand, Philippines, and Singapore remained minimal. Finally, the October Revolution partially influenced the ideology of the non-alignment movement which still has important impact on Southeast Asian countries.\n\n\u041d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0432

The existing literature focuses almost exclusively on the bilateral exchanges between Europeans and various Asian groups, paying little attention to the ways that Chinese migrants constructed and adjusted their own group identity in response to the multilateral cultural interactions that were an inescapable part of life in overseas port cities. This study examines how elite Chinese merchants managed to carve out a political and legal constituency in Batavia (modern Jakarta), the capital of the Dutch East India Company in Asia, and how they and their subjects turned that constituency into a forum for the negotiation of what constituted proper Chinese behavior. First, I use Dutch administrative documents to show how a Chinese council staffed by wealthy male merchants solidified their control over a constituency composed of nominally \u201cChinese\u201d households, although most female members were of Indonesian descent. Second, I show how elite men on the Chinese council attempted to use Dutch legal codification projects to impose a highly patriarchal vision of proper gendered behavior within those households. Finally, using the minutes of the law court administered by the Chinese council, I explore the ways that ordinary male and female litigants articulated their own notions of justice, and how the judges of the Chinese council used their privileged position as judges to intervene in the lives of their subjects. The image of the Chinese elite that emerges is one consumed by anxieties over the supposed failure of Chinese-status women to conform to elite standards of behavior: seeking divorces, behaving disgracefully in public, and engaging in interethnic sexual relationships. This paper illustrates the tension between a Chinese political elite whose jurisdiction was predicated on a relatively distinct Chinese community and the widespread tendency of their subjects to blur the lines between ethnic groups and articulate counterhegemonic constructions of Chinese customs.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48304215, "first_name": "Luther", "last_name": "Cenci", "domain_name": "stanford", "page_name": "LutherCenci", "display_name": "Luther Cenci", "profile_url": "https://stanford.academia.edu/LutherCenci?f_ri=685172", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48304215/17582272/17642011/s65_luther.cenci.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2272, "name": "Gender History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_History?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3772, "name": "Legal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_History?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6612, "name": "Legal Pluralism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legal_Pluralism?f_ri=685172", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26850, "name": "Chinese history (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_history_History_?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 33831, "name": "History of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Migration?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 43434, "name": "Overseas Chinese", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Overseas_Chinese?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 65024, "name": "Chinese Legal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Legal_History?f_ri=685172"}, {"id": 685172, "name": "Social and Political History of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Political_History_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=685172"}]}]
