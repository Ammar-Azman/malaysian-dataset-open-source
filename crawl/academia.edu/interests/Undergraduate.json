The purpose of this article is to examine how internship course curriculum compares to the industry employers\u2019 internship expectations. The results show the disconnect between curriculum for internship courses and what industry employers desire for internships. The findings show that undergraduate hospitality management programs in the same region vary in requirements, and these requirements do not meet industry employers\u2019 internship expectations",

The marks obtained in medical Entry Test and 1st Professional MBBS were compared using Pearson Correlation. Data was obtained from appropriate sources and then its evaluation was done. Findings: This study found that there is a Pearson Correlation of 0.303(moderate) between Entry Test marks and the first professional MBBS marks. The scatter plot shows a positive relation between the two, which means that if one increases, so will the other. The p value of less than 0.000 was obtained. Conclusion: Student\u2019s performance in entry test can be a predictability factor for success later on during his undergraduate years. However, there is still, room for improvement in the entry test format.

"First-generation and low-income students have been an important subject of research in the sociology of higher education due to the particular struggles and needs that these groups face. Diversification of elite campuses have called into question the experiences that these types of students have-many of whom come from working-class backgrounds. Understanding elite institutions of higher education as platforms for social mobility, lower-income students are provided with the opportunity to escalate in the socioeconomic ladder. In this research paper, I study the social identity of working-class students at Harvard College. I begin with the assumption, provided by the literature, that working-class students undergo a transformation of social class identity. My key question is how these students navigate their social class at a place as diverse and as wealthy as Harvard. I interviewed ten students who self-identified as first-generation and in the lower side of the socioeconomic ladder. I found that most students relate to people who share their social class background, that their social class identity while in college is hard to define, and that they prioritize financial stability over giving-back when thinking of post-graduation jobs. I also found that they are very critical about the values and morals someone who goes into a high-paying job must have. Families are not part of their social class transformation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67522495, "asset_id": 49132106, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 17397595, "first_name": "Pablo", "last_name": "Zamorano", "domain_name": "harvard", "page_name": "zamorano", "display_name": "Pablo Zamorano", "profile_url": "https://harvard.academia.edu/zamorano?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/17397595/4825747/46083106/s65_pablo.zamorano.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2824, "name": "Working Classes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Classes?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 8577, "name": "Social Stratification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Stratification?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 26879, "name": "Social Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Class?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 33481, "name": "Social Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Mobility?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 46644, "name": "Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inequality?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 47327, "name": "Working Class Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Class_Studies?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 48442, "name": "Working Class Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Class_Identity?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 88022, "name": "Sociology of elites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_elites?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102674, "name": "College Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College_Students?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 138920, "name": "Low Income College Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Low_Income_College_Students?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 175427, "name": "Undergraduate Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Education?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 195817, "name": "Harvard University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Harvard_University?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 461038, "name": "Social Stratification and Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Stratification_and_Inequality?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 1487107, "title": "Raising achievement through teacher research: a collection of teachers\u2019 research projects from \u2018Best Practice Research Scholarships\u2019", "created_at": "2012-03-26T06:40:43.058-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1487107/Raising_achievement_through_teacher_research_a_collection_of_teachers_research_projects_from_Best_Practice_Research_Scholarships_?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_1487107", "summary": "\"Between 2000-2004, a number of practising teachers in the West Midlands were awarded \u2018Best Practice Research Scholarships\u2019 from the DfES.

talked about by Muslims from all sects of Islam. Many have taken the word of the Quran out of context and, mis clearly indicated that some words in Arabic may have many interpretations which, has caused an array of confusion for many scholars, and contemporary Muslims. Although, there seems to be a variety of misconceptions about both the treatment and status of women in Islam. Scholars have tried to clearly illustrate to contemporary Muslims these misconceptions and misunderstandings that have been talked about for many centuries after the passing of the prophet. Many scholars have tackled these misunderstandings and, have tried to break down the laws set out by the Quran, Hadiths, Prophet Muhammed and his Caliphates. Numerous scholars have questioned whether Islam is compatible with gender equality and, this has been a question for many centuries in the field of Islamic Studies. Critics have criticized the gender inequalities in Muslim major societies, especially with the implementation of Sharia law in countries such as: Saudi Arabia. Many feminist Islamic scholars struggle to find a more modern meaning to the traditional interpretation of the Quran. Amina Wadud is among many that try to reinterpret the Quran from a gender-inclusive perspective. The new interpretations are supposed to be more relevant to women in the Modern World. These \"new\" interpretations take out the middle man of historical patriarchal interpretation of Islam and bring out the new more holistic understanding of the Quran through new lenses. This paper is intended to clearly articulate the role, status, and treatment of women that is set up in laws given out by Allah through the many sources given to Muslims in the contemporary world.

Methods: Sixty-one final year dental students at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya in Malaysia were administered a Multiple Intelligence Inventory (MII), David Larear, 1991) after their final written examinations. MII comprised 80 4-point likert items assessing eight types of multiple intelligences: Verbal/Linguistic, Visual Spatial, Logical Mathematical, Musical Rhythmic, Intra Personal, Body Kinesthetic, Inter Personal and Naturalist. These intelligences were correlated with six academic performance scores: Amalgam Class II, Composite, Crown & Bridge, Endodontic, Problem Based Learning and the Final Written Exam. The data were analysed by Pearson Product Moment Correlation and t-test. Results: Significant correlations were found between Intrapersonal intelligence and Composite (r = .32; p < .05) and between Body Kinesthetic and Composite scores (r = .26; p < .05). High Amalgam Class II scorers obtained significantly higher scores on Intrapersonal Intelligence than low scorers (t = 2.49; p < .05). High Composite scorers have significantly higher Body Kinesthetic intelligence than low scorers (t = .29; p < .05). Low endodontic scorers obtained significantly higher scores on Visual Spatial intelligence than high scorers (t = 2.06; p < .05). High PBL scorers obtained significantly higher Interpersonal (t = 2.06; p < .05) and Naturalist Intelligence (t = 3.57; p < .05) than low scorers. Conclusions: There appears to be no significant correlations between the various types of multiple intelligences and achievement in dentistry except for the correlations between Composite scores and Intrapersonal and Body Kinesthetic Intelligence. Generally, there were no significant multiple intelligence differences among high and low performers.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 25799815, "asset_id": 1844445, "asset_type": "Work",

Its implications for intervention have also been noted (Henry et al., 2010). However, questions about key components of the model, such as the role of meaning-making in automatically leading to meaning made, and the assumption that meaning made gives way to adaptive outcomes (see Bonanno, Papa, Lalande, Zhang, & Noll, 2005; Davis, Wortman, Lehman, & Silver, 2000), have been neither adequately explored nor answered. Most recently, meaning-making was also found to only partially mediate the relationship between belief and goal violations and individuals\u2019 perceived change in their life philosophy (Lim, Park & Slattery, 2012), suggesting that factors other than meaning-making help to produce meaning made.\r\n\r\nThis study proposed that personal coping resources might mediate or moderate the relationship between meaning-making and meaning made, and took self-efficacy as one example. Self-efficacy has been found to be a separate, but related construct to meaning-making (van den Heuvel, Demerouti, Schreurs, Bakker, & Schaufeli, 2009). Although empirical comparisons of the two are limited, the expectancy-value theory (Bandura, 1995) suggests that self-efficacy would act as a motivational resource in guiding people to achieve a goal or aim.\r\n\r\nDemographics: 280 undergraduates in a Singaporean university filled in a questionnaire that asked them to indicate a stressful event that had occurred recently. The majority of the sample was female (59%) and Chinese (85%); others identified as Indian (6%) and other ethnicity (9%). A majority (70%) affiliated themselves with a religion (34% Christianity, 19% Buddhism, 17% other faiths).\r\n\r\nMeasures: Participants answered questions about their worldview change after the event, meaning-making assessed through the Core Beliefs Inventory (CBI; Cann et al., 2010; used in Park, 2008) and their trait self-efficacy (Generalised Self-Efficacy Scale; Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995).\r\n\r\nResults: Self-efficacy moderated the relation between meaning-making and meaning made, but only among individuals with similar levels of trait meaning-making. Among individuals with higher levels of trait meaning-making, the relationship between meaning-making and meaning made was strongest in the case of high self-efficacy, and weakest for low self-efficacy, reflecting our predictions. However, the opposite effect was observed for individuals with lower levels of trait meaning-making: meaning-making and meaning made were most strongly correlated when self-efficacy was low.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: We argue that: 1) the asymmetrical moderation effects of self-efficacy for individuals with different levels of trait meaning-making imply that meaning-making may also constitute a coping style, in addition to its being a process; 2) producing meaning may not necessarily be important, especially for individuals who score lower on trait meaning-making; 3) these results suggest that meaning-making has a controlled, cognitive character that could be further explored through metacognitive theories of rumination and worry (e.g. Watkins, 2004; Wells, 1995) in which individuals\u2019 beliefs and appraisals about cognitive processes underlie pathological worry and repetitive thinking. Further research linking rumination and meaning-making may help to illuminate the elusive line between maladaptive and adaptive cognitive coping with stress and trauma.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38156642, "asset_id": 4369777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 38156644, "asset_id": 4369777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3991415, "first_name": "Haikel", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "duke-nus", "page_name": "HaikelLim", "display_name": "Haikel Lim", "profile_url": "https://duke-nus.academia.edu/HaikelLim?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3991415/1508477/10801659/s65_haikel.lim.jpg"}, {"id": 5394845, "first_name": "Huiying", "last_name": "Ng", "domain_name": "lmu-munich", "page_name": "HuiyingNg", "display_name": "Huiying Ng", "profile_url": "https://lmu-munich.academia.edu/HuiyingNg?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5394845/6542268/19681250/s65_huiying.ng.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3102, "name": "Coping Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Coping_Strategies?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6390, "name": "Self-Efficacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-Efficacy?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9729, "name": "Stress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stress?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30291, "name": "Undergraduate Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Research?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 35689, "name": "Religious Coping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Coping?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 39858, "name": "Meaning Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Meaning_Making?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 86917, "name": "Emotional Distress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotional_Distress?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 128783, "name": "Stress and coping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stress_and_coping?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 312038, "name": "Psychological distress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychological_distress?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 785336, "name": "Spiritual/religious coping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spiritual_religious_coping?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 43967597, "title": "Examining the Relationship between Self- Compassion and Social Media Addiction among undergraduate students", "created_at": "2020-08-28T00:40:24.407-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43967597/Examining_the_Relationship_between_Self_Compassion_and_Social_Media_Addiction_among_undergraduate_students?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_43967597", "summary": "Social media has become one of the most widely used means for communication as it connects individuals worldwide. However, over use of social media may have a negative impact on the individual's life. Self-compassion is an attitude which is found to be a powerful coping mechanism when dealing with the difficulties of life. It is the ability to comfort o neself when one is stressed, hurting emotionally and in need of care and solace. Studies have shown that individuals use of social media often increases when they are going through negative and stressful life experiences. The need to seek reassurance and compassion from others increases when an individual is feeling low or negative. Most of the time, people tend to seek compassion and validation from external sources rather than being self-compassionate and the easiest way in today's fast paced, technological world is to seek this support through social media. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the relationship between self-compassion and social media addiction. To understand, if acts of self-compassion has any significant relationship with social media addiction. The study was done on undergraduate students of private colleges from Bangalore city in the age range of 18-21 yrs. Two questionnaires, namely: Self compassion scale by Dr. Neff and Social media addiction scale by Tutgun-Unal were used. Results of Pearson's correlation showed that there was no significant relationship between self-compassion and social media addiction. Independent t-test showed no significant gender difference in self-compassion and social-media addiction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64295690, "asset_id": 43967597, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31024619, "first_name": "Deepika", "last_name": "Nambiar", "domain_name": "bcwcc", "page_name": "deepikanambiar", "display_name": "Deepika Nambiar", "profile_url": "https://bcwcc.academia.edu/deepikanambiar?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31024619/45453194/35440187/s65_deepika.nambiar.jpg"}, {"id": 169573171, "first_name": "madhura", "last_name": "sampath", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "madhurasampath", "display_name": "madhura sampath", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/madhurasampath?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2483, "name": "Addiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Addiction?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11097, "name": "Self Compassion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Compassion?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59533, "name": "Internet Addiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet_Addiction?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 357676, "name": "Social Media Addiction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media_Addiction?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 41735691, "title": "Critically assess the extent to which the character of James Bond exhibits a dominant representation of masculinity.

area, to a new Isan. This article aims to identify some aspects of restrictions and proposals for change to help support the new Isan. Aspects of capitulation are explained, and opposite-vertical aspect discourse negotiated between Isan-ness and urban-ness. Self-identity was examined in eight young people from Isan youths who traveled to Bangkok for undergraduate studies. Data was gathered by in-depth interviews from May to September 2017 and analyzed.\nResults were that the power of opposite-vertical aspect discourse influences restriction of change in the Isan region insofar as quality of life for samples improved in Bangkok. At the same time, the power of opposite-vertical aspect discourse also affects urban identity disclosure, unlike online media space in which samples revealed more of their personal identity. Samples used narrative to negotiate their Isan identities in real life and in online spaces, to emerge from the opposite-vertical aspect discourse in order to argue for acceptance of people from Isan in an un hierarchical national community and build a hybrid Isan identity as a mixture of Isan-ness and urban-ness.\n\nKeywords: Identity, Changing, Isan, Undergraduates.   \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64436607, "asset_id": 44089843, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4417146, "first_name": "Ukrit", "last_name": "Chalermsan", "domain_name": "ru", "page_name": "UkritChalermsan", "display_name": "Ukrit Chalermsan", "profile_url": "https://ru.academia.edu/UkritChalermsan?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4417146/1796672/52311454/s65_ukrit.chalermsan.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 206, "name": "Social Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Change?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 90982, "name": "Rural Urban Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Urban_Relations?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 12019788, "title": "Internship Report of BSS in Media Studies and Journalism", "created_at": "2015-04-20T01:23:23.710-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12019788/Internship_Report_of_BSS_in_Media_Studies_and_Journalism?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_12019788", "summary": "This is a report on my six-credit internship course MSJ-498 and MSJ-499 under the school of Media Studies and Journalism, ULAB.

The implications of these findings to criminal behavior tendency of undergraduates were discussed. \n\nKeywords: Parenting style, Gender, Socio economic status, undergraduate, Criminal \t\n\t        behaviour tendency.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36317133, "asset_id": 10222127, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12081150, "first_name": "International Journal of", "last_name": "Youth Empowerment and Entrepreneurship Development", "domain_name": "unn-ng", "page_name": "IJYEEDJOURANL", "display_name": "International Journal of Youth Empowerment and Entrepreneurship Development", "profile_url": "https://unn-ng.academia.edu/IJYEEDJOURANL?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12081150/3892508/5959282/s65_ijyeed.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4545, "name": "Parenting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Parenting?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31467, "name": "Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_and_Social_History_of_the_Ottoman_Empire?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41346846, "title": "Lolita", "created_at": "2019-12-18T03:57:27.978-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41346846/Lolita?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_41346846", "summary": "An exploration of the themes within the relationship between Lolita and Humbert Humbert: Can art say the unsayable? Lolita tackles perhaps the most uncomfortable taboo of human existence. The questionable Mr. Humbert Humbert is characterised by Nabokov as the true definition of an anti-hero. It could be argued that he is problematised to the point in which his sense of self as anything redeemable can be questioned. When exploring Lolita, it is important to question who the story and plotline truly focuses on. Often the character who is placed at the forefront or narrates the story is seen as the one whom the plotline follows. In essence, the main character is the focus of the story on a first reading of a text due to the nature of storytelling and especially with first person texts. However, I would like to refocus this text as more than Humbert's story, but instead look at the whole relationship. As such, the question of Lolita as a piece of art is indeed an interesting idea, as it asks questions about the text and Lolita herself as a character and a representation of ideals. The text is art, but Lolita herself is also art in the eyes of Humbert. Representing such a skewed and dangerous love story as art creates a strange world where taboos of nature can be partially excused, at least for the purpose of a novel. To read this novel, I have previously used another text to uncover some questions regarding forbidden love and strange romances. I studied Warm Bodies by Isaac Marion which is a contemporary adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Reading this novel closely and analysing the themes, questions of love were raised. The idea of everlasting love, love that transcends the realm of normality and attraction beyond societal norms were the themes raised in my research. These subjects relate strongly to Lolita which allows for a direct comparison of the themes. Therefore, these intricacies were integrated into my planning for this thesis. Both texts challenge ideologies about sexuality and morality. Lolita encapsulates many themes, such as pedophilia, forbidden love, references to mythology and childhood.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61549401, "asset_id": 41346846, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 60390492, "first_name": "Madison", "last_name": "Hawley", "domain_name": "winchester", "page_name": "MadisonHawley", "display_name": "Madison Hawley", "profile_url": "https://winchester.academia.edu/MadisonHawley?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/60390492/45512076/35466872/s65_madison.hawley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 885, "name": "English Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6463, "name": "History of Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Sexuality?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10232, "name": "Intertextuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intertextuality?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 28977, "name": "Comparative mythology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_mythology?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 33988, "name": "Vladimir Nabokov", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vladimir_Nabokov?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 83952, "name": "Morality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Morality?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 112634, "name": "Sexual Deviant Behaviour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexual_Deviant_Behaviour?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 278197, "name": "Lolita", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lolita?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 575300, "name": "History of values, norms, and morality, particularly the relationship of power and sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_values_norms_and_morality_particularly_the_relationship_of_power_and_sexuality?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 987078, "name": "Love and Death", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Love_and_Death-1?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 1635520, "title": "Guidelines for the supervision of undergraduate qualitative research in psychology", "created_at": "2012-06-08T20:40:54.980-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1635520/Guidelines_for_the_supervision_of_undergraduate_qualitative_research_in_psychology?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_1635520", "summary": "\"Project Summary\r\n \r\nIn brief, we wanted to develop the student guidelines that we had already drafted in ourdepartment, mainly by listening to colleagues and identifying areas of best practice. In addition,we wanted to hear students talk about their experiences of supervision and theirrecommendations for improving quality. Our aim was to produce a set of guidelines that could beused by colleagues across the UK. Once we secured the funding from the LTSN, we collecteddata from both supervisors and students.A key feature of the project was the supervisor workshop (April, 2002). We were pleased that50 colleagues came to participate in the workshop from all over the UK (36 institutions wererepresented). We were fortunate also in having Professor Wendy Hollway (Open University) givethe keynote address, which usefully focussed on the regulatory climate surrounding qualitativeresearch in psychology. She also urged the audience to think carefully about theory in qualitativeresearch, notably with regard to generalisation, subjectivity and ethics. The day\u2019s programmethen centred around small group discussions of the following key questions:\r\n \r\nWhat makes a good undergraduate qualitative project? Give examples of good and badwork\r\n \r\nWhich qualitative methods are most appropriate for undergraduate level projects, and why?\r\n \r\nHow much data should students collect at this level, and

A distinct pronunciation variant that is widely used and \u2018has recently been noted as spreading through non-standard accents in England\u2019 (cf. Trudgill, 1988: 43), is that of th-fronting. The form th- fronting has become more and more integrated into the speech patterns of many speakers across the United Kingdom although it has \u2018not \u2018officially\u2019 entered RP yet\u2019 (Altendorf, 1999: 5). This study focused on whether or not gender is associated with variation in the usage of th-fronting in the urban and multicultural locality of Nottingham, United Kingdom. The analysis was undertaken in order to assess how urban youth culture in Nottingham utilizes and applies the form th-fronting in everyday dialogue such as day-to-day conversations, and whether their mode of expression varies according to gender. The study aimed to gain an insight into the relationship between spoken language and identity, and to recognise whether the social backgrounds/ cultural practices people have influence their use of ethnically and age-coded variables. From the results, it was established that th-fronting does vary according to gender and that increased formality does limit the amount of th-fronting used.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

apprehension and nervousness are common problems voiced out by second or foreign language learners in acquiring the speaking skills in a second or foreign language. Such feelings are said to have a potentially negative and debilitating effect on oral performance. This study aimed to examine the level of English language learning anxiety of undergraduate ESL learners, its causes and relationship with the learners' oral performance in English. This study employed both quantitative and qualitative approaches in data gathering. Data were collected via the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS) questionnaire (Horwitz, Horwitz & Cope, 1986), a structured interview, as well as class oral assessment tasks. Participants of the study comprised 70 undergraduate ESL learners of Universiti Putra Malaysia. Findings of the study revealed that the undergraduate ESL learners experienced a medium level of anxiety. English classroom anxiety, communication apprehension, fear of negative evaluation, and test anxiety, were identified as factors that significantly contributed to the language anxiety experienced by the learners. The findings suggest that anxiety is a learner variable that needs to be minimised so as to enhance optimal learning of a target language.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56494881, "asset_id":

The new entry points through which the book revolves are-sources of Mughal state's legitimacy , the evolution and meaning of court etiquette , the world of the imperial Mughal family and the interaction between folklore and court culture. It can be perceived that there is a constant attempt to co-relate the dynasty's inner world with popular perception.

It may also affect their school performance and completion rate. In spite of this fact, magnitude of pre-marital sexual practice is increasing from time to time.\nObjective: To determine the magnitude and predictors of premarital sexual practice among unmarried undergraduate Arba\nMinch University, students, 2015.\nMethods: Institution based cross sectional study design was used. A total of 575 students were selected by multi-stage sampling technique from six Colleges. Data was collected by using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Data entry was done by using epi info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistics, binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses used to identify factors associated with pre-marital sexual practice.\nResults: A total of 575 students were participated in our study. Four hundred thirty two (75.2%) and 143 (24.8%) were Males and Females respectively. The majority of study participants 382 (66.4%) were in the age group of 21 to 25 years with mean age of 21.25 \u00b1 1.732 years. Three hundred forty one (59.3%) were orthodox by religion; 196 (34.1%) were Amhara by ethnicity.\nPredictors of pre-marital sexual practice include; Male sex [AOR = 1.329, 95% CI = 1.129, 3.880], Academic year [AOR = 0.540, 95% CI = 0.187, 1.556], Pocket money [AOR = 0.096, 95% CI = 0.010, 0.888], Exposure to Reproductive health information [AOR = 0.995, 95% CI = 0.988, 1.012], Family discussion about sexual issues [AOR = 0.818, 95% CI = 0.852,1.218], Exposure to pornographic films [AOR = 3.854, 95% CI = 0.945, 11.055] and others.\nConclusion: More than one third of participants had premarital sexual practice and it is higher in males than females. Factors affecting pre-marital sexual practice include; Male sex, Pocket money, Exposure to Reproductive health information, Exposure to pornographic films, Alcohol use, Chat chewing and attending religious services. Appropriate interventions should be done by responsible bodies to reduce premarital sexual practice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52979682, "asset_id": 32830949, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34122754, "first_name": "International Journal of Reproduction,", "last_name": "Fertility & Sexual Health (IJRFSH)", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "InternationalJournalofReproductionFertilitySexualHealthIJRFSH", "display_name": "International Journal of Reproduction, Fertility & Sexual Health (IJRFSH)", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/InternationalJournalofReproductionFertilitySexualHealthIJRFSH?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34122754/10013483/11168701/s65_international_journal_of_reproduction_.fertility_sexual_health_ijrfsh_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21361, "name": "Ethiopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethiopia?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 906317, "name": "Unmarried", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unmarried?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2694611, "name": " Premarital Sexual Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Premarital_Sexual_Practice?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 2694612, "name": "Arba Minch", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arba_Minch?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 9310893, "title": "pygmalion", "created_at": "2014-11-14T15:02:12.771-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9310893/pygmalion?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_9310893", "summary": "by George Bernard Shaw", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35571114, "asset_id": 9310893, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 21174726, "first_name": "rashi", "last_name": "agarwal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "rashiagarwal5", "display_name": "rashi agarwal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/rashiagarwal5?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4807442, "title": "Library Instruction and Academic Performance of Undergraduate at Babcock University, Nigeria", "created_at": "2013-10-17T23:24:06.622-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4807442/Library_Instruction_and_Academic_Performance_of_Undergraduate_at_Babcock_University_Nigeria?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_4807442", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32104837, "asset_id": 4807442, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 261115, "first_name": "Dr. Saturday", "last_name": "Omeluzor", "domain_name": "fupre", "page_name": "SaturdayOmeluzor", "display_name": "Dr. Saturday U Omeluzor", "profile_url": "https://fupre.academia.edu/SaturdayOmeluzor?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/261115/55022/16910978/s65_dr._saturday.omeluzor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1011, "name": "Library Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Library_Science?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5727, "name": "User Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/User_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13767, "name": "Library Instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Library_Instruction?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76424, "name": "Academic Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Performance?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 401558, "name": "User Orientation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/User_Orientation?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 9403477, "title": "Discussion on Franz Kafka: The Metamorphosis", "created_at": "2014-11-19T19:29:43.505-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9403477/Discussion_on_Franz_Kafka_The_Metamorphosis?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_9403477", "summary": "In the following essay I will be discussing two excerpts from Gilles Deleuze\u2019s Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, in relation to Franz Kafka\u2019s short story \u201cThe Metamorphosis\u201d.

Taking into account the perverse manifestations of the sexual life of students and the potential consequences of the sprouting dating culture on campus, the study attempted finding answers to impending dating and sexuality questions by adopting both the qualitative and quantitative research techniques. The study was guided by four research objectives: to investigate the views of students on sexuality; to examine their dating experiences; to examine the dating patterns prevalent among university undergraduates and to examine the socio-cultural factors influencing dating relationship among students. Using three research instruments, the questionnaire, in-depth interview and focus group discussion, the study collected data from 219 respondents in three campuses of the University cutting across 12 faculties. Findings revealed that the experiences of students in dating relationships are two-fold: healthy experiences and unhealthy experiences. For example, healthy experiences could be in the form of mutual benefits from one\u2019s dating partner while unhealthy experiences could take the form of abuse and exploitation. It also revealed that the dating patterns among students are diverse, varying from on-campus dating, off-campus dating, dating between students and staff of the university as well as multiple concurrent dating relationship. The study recommended that adequate sexuality education and counseling of students before they begin dating will be a critical step towards enacting social engineering.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56240464, "asset_id": 36332840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35009649, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Michael", "domain_name": "uniuyo", "page_name": "MichaelMichael", "display_name": "Michael N Michael", "profile_url": "https://uniuyo.academia.edu/MichaelMichael?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35009649/10191577/11373374/s65_michael.michael.jpg_oh_5ca6aaede491f8d936a1995a89f4320c_oe_569cbc2a"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16456, "name": "Romantic Relationships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romantic_Relationships?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21318, "name": "Nigeria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nigeria?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56132, "name": "Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Students?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 110204, "name": "Dating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dating?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 41244842, "title": "Teaching derivatives using Bloomberg: An experiential learning approach", "created_at": "2019-12-09T17:41:46.752-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41244842/Teaching_derivatives_using_Bloomberg_An_experiential_learning_approach?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_41244842", "summary": "The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature on experiential learning in finance by discussing the instructional design of an undergraduate derivatives course.

This paper discusses issues of decolonization and transformation of Geography curricula at different universities in South Africa, and whether issues such as decolonization and transformation are being addressed in these curricula. The University of the Witwatersrand is used as a case study, (1) discussing strategies and progress with respect to decolonization and transformation at the university as a whole; and then (2) presenting evidence for strategies and progress in decolonization and transformation of the Geography curriculum, based on semi-structured interviews with four key stakeholders from the Geography department. These results show the contested meanings, scope and goals of decolonization and transformation at all levels, and that these issues are commonly linked to or conflated with a range of other factors including access to bursaries, employability and institutional culture.

now than ever. The international education surge is possibly due to the fact that the 21st century requires vastly different skills from those of the past. Students entering the workforce are now confronted with the need for highly specialized skill sets that were once not necessary, but are now essential to stay competitive for jobs in the global economy. The purpose of this preliminary research is to gain a better understanding of the current level of student awareness regarding global perspective and whether pursuing international studies will prepare students to be more open to diverse attitudes than other majors at Texas State University-San Marcos. This research will use Robert G. Hanvey's, An Attainable Global Perspective, as the basis for what an international studies curriculum should include to foster student perspective change and willingness to understand global interdependence and its implications. This will be done by operationalizing Hanvey's article into a usable survey questionnaire. The questionnaire was created by taking each of Hanvey's five dimensions and breaking them down into measurable categories.\n\nThe results of the questionnaire show that both groups of students are often equal in their awareness of global perspectives. The questions that showed significant differences between the groups did favor the International Studies students as more cognizant of the topic discussed. However, this did not occur often enough to prove that International Studies premajors at Texas State University have a better grasp of global perspective than the other group of students.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7410604, "asset_id": 1195479, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1087737, "first_name": "Texas State PA", "last_name": "Applied Research Projects", "domain_name": "txstate", "page_name": "TexasStateUniversityPublicAdministrationAppliedResearchProjects", "display_name": "Texas State PA Applied Research Projects", "profile_url": "https://txstate.academia.edu/TexasStateUniversityPublicAdministrationAppliedResearchProjects?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1087737/384081/465952/s65_texas_state_university_public_administration.applied_research_projects.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3321, "name": "Global Civil Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Civil_Society?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16997, "name": "Globalization And Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Higher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18231, "name": "International and interdisciplinary studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_and_interdisciplinary_studies?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 38506067, "title": "IJMET_10_02_103.pdf", "created_at": "2019-03-07T03:08:46.769-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38506067/IJMET_10_02_103_pdf?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_38506067", "summary": "Gamification is a concept in which elements of the game in the environment are not\ngames.

Hence, we begin to experience the birth of new trends in the communication of ideas. The paper examines selected slangy expressions that are used among university students as communicative tool in social discourses between interlocutors. It works with the framework of Speech act theory by J.L. Austin (1962). In the bid to obtain information on the slang expressions among undergraduates of universities in Nigeria, the University of Ibadan was used as the subject area. The 200 respondents who were 100 level students in their 2nd semester cut across different faculties, that is, Arts, Education, Sciences and Social Sciences; and the investigation was carried out during the period they were under the researcher's tutelage in the teaching of GES 101 (Use of English). The research opines that the entertainment industry plays a vital role in the hybridization of lexical items and expressions. The paper discovers that in making use of slangy expressions, interlocutors perform specific speech acts, such as informing, warning etc. On the final note, it was observed that students use slangy expressions in order to be unique, 'belong to a particular class', and equally be able to appropriate certain indigenous/nativised words such as 'Ajepaki', 'Ashi' into their communication. Introduction Few studies have been carried out on slangy expressions especially in this part of the world where it is not really given the desired recognition especially among adults. Some of such studies include Ademola-Adeoye (2004), Adeyanju (2007) among others. Out of the existing literature accessible to the writer, it seems it is only Adeyaanju (2007) that has applied the Speech Act theory which was espoused by Austin (1962) and developed upon by Searle (1969) and others, to the analysis of slangy expressions. However, Adeyanju \" s work seems a bit broader than ours since it considers the use of slangy expressions in educated Nigerian English. In this study, we are limited to the undergraduate students. In other words, we intend to examine the use of slangy expressions among the university undergraduates with emphasis on the meaning, form and function assigned to such slangy expressions. It is therefore believed that this work will contribute to the existing literature on slang usage in Nigerian English particularly with respect to the function of such slangy expressions among undergraduate students.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48131371, "asset_id": 27846708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31661969, "first_name":

Interest value, social value, economic value, development value and application value have been considered as the independent variables for the study. To investigate the potential employer selection decision of management undergraduates, 345 final year management undergraduate students from university of Sri Jayewardenepura, University of Colombo, University of Ruhuna and University of Sabaragamuwa were surveyed. The collected data is analyzed by using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS), whereby the demographic data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, while the hypotheses are tested by using correlation analysis and regression analysis. The research findings showed that four determinants, which are interest value, social value, development value and application value, have a significant positive relationship with potential employer selection decision, while the economic value has no positive significant relationship with the dependent variable. The results of this study are expected to aid corporate recruiters, so that more competent candidates can be attracted; university's management faculty and career advisors so that the recruiting schedules could be better tailored to appropriately match students' preferences; also, professional bodies in the formulation of strategies to achieve a desired number of managerial professionals.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62167151, "asset_id": 42040308, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 146805036, "first_name": "Nisansala", "last_name": "Medagoda", "domain_name": "ruhuna", "page_name": "NisansalaMedagoda", "display_name": "Nisansala Medagoda", "profile_url": "https://ruhuna.academia.edu/NisansalaMedagoda?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/146805036/40273851/33040123/s65_nisansala.medagoda.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 38, "name": "Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Management?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1681, "name": "Decision Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decision_Making?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2102, "name": "Career Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Career_Management?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6416, "name": "Human Resource Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Resource_Management?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17580, "name": "Human Resources", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Resources?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 29563, "name": "Candidate Selection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Candidate_Selection?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 227599, "name": "University Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/University_Education?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 733970, "name": "Reward Programs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reward_Programs?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 22069063, "title": "Cardiorespiratory Fitness Profile of Undergraduate Biomedical Students in a Nigerian University", "created_at": "2016-02-16T14:18:49.116-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22069063/Cardiorespiratory_Fitness_Profile_of_Undergraduate_Biomedical_Students_in_a_Nigerian_University?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_22069063", "summary": "SUMMARY The transition from youth to adulthood has been reported to be a high risk period for developing sedentary habits, which could lead to reduced cardiorespiratory fitness. There is a dearth of published studies on the cardiorespiratory fitness profile of college students in this environment. This study therefore examined the cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) profile of undergraduate biomedical students of the University of Jos, Nigeria. One hundred and six biomedical students (76 males; 30 females) of the University of Jos participated in this study. Age, height (Ht), weight (Wt), body mass index (BMI) and exercise heart rate (HRex) to predetermined exercise intensity were measured and recorded. A modified sub-maximal cycle ergometer protocol was used to estimate maximal oxygen consumption. The estimated value was then compared against the American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) standard reference for age and sex. Data obtained was analysed using descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation and inferential statistics of the student's independent t-test. When compared with the reference norm, the results showed that 69.8% had excellent CRF status, 16.0% had good CRF, 13.2% had average CRF and only 1% had poor CRF status. Male students had significantly higher CRF compared with female students. The study showed that most of the students had excellent CRF according to ACSM age and sex matched classification, but further study may be needed to monitor the trend of CRF over time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42744096, "asset_id": 22069063, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25402121, "first_name": "Ayodele", "last_name": "Akinremi", "domain_name": "fnu", "page_name": "AyoAkinremi", "display_name": "Ayodele  Akinremi", "profile_url": "https://fnu.academia.edu/AyoAkinremi?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25402121/7067524/14382330/s65_ayodele.akinremi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 66744, "name": "Biomedical Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biomedical_Research?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1393925, "name": "Cardiorespiratory Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cardiorespiratory_Medicine?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 76662462, "title": "\u2018Come with me, sweetest sister\u2019: Unravelling the Enigma of Sacred Sisterhood in Aurora Leigh by Elizabeth Barrett Browning and \u201cGoblin Market\u201d by Christina Rossetti", "created_at": "2022-04-16T19:23:52.377-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76662462/_Come_with_me_sweetest_sister_Unravelling_the_Enigma_of_Sacred_Sisterhood_in_Aurora_Leigh_by_Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning_and_Goblin_Market_by_Christina_Rossetti?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_76662462", "summary": "Throughout the Victorian era, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Christina Rossetti occupied a prominent position in a newly emerging female literary movement.

The study adopted the survey research design and the population consisted of 25,232 regular undergraduate students in 7 faculties which a sample size of 380 respondents were selected using proportional random sampling technique. Self-developed questionnaires were distributed among sample undergraduate students. However, only three hundred and forty one 341 (89.73%) questionnaires were returned in good shape and analyzed using frequency distribution, percentage and mean. The findings of the study revealed that user education positively impacted the undergraduate students' use of library resources and the academic performance. The method employed in teaching user education includes lecture method, independent assignment, and practical exercises among others. The study identified some problems that includes; over population, lack of instructional materials, poor monitoring of staff, inadequate qualified staff, limited time allocation, inadequate accommodation and space. The strategies that can be adopted to enhance effective user education to undergraduate students as indicated in the findings includes; provision of adequate staff, proper ventilation and illumination of venue, regular monitoring and control of user education procedures, adjustment of user education time to suit students, positive attitude of staff to the program among others. The study concludes that the library occupies a central place in the achievement of educational objectives of the students and this has made user education indispensable in the library.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56293959, "asset_id": 36384061, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33384065, "first_name": "European Scientific Journal", "last_name": "ESJ", "domain_name": "euinstitute", "page_name": "EuropeanScientificJournalESJ", "display_name": "European Scientific Journal ESJ", "profile_url": "https://euinstitute.academia.edu/EuropeanScientificJournalESJ?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33384065/9874609/19912051/s65_european_scientific_journal.esj.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5727, "name": "User Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/User_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 272474, "name": "Makurdi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Makurdi?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 32031069, "title": "ASSESSMENT OF GENDER DIFFERENCE ON STUDENTS' PERCEPTION OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH PROJECT SUPERVISOR", "created_at": "2017-03-24T14:02:52.906-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32031069/ASSESSMENT_OF_GENDER_DIFFERENCE_ON_STUDENTS_PERCEPTION_OF_UNDERGRADUATE_RESEARCH_PROJECT_SUPERVISOR?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_32031069", "summary": "Determining the extent of difference between male and female supervised students' perception on relationship; commitments of Undergraduate Research Project South East geo political zones of Nigeria.

We introduce the concept of \\emph{topological invariants} and their relations to the innate symmetries in topological insulators. Lastly, we synthesize these concepts together to present the band inversion in HgTe/CdTe quantum wells and the existence of 3-dimensional spin Hall insulators.

This essay aims to examine possible links between the concepts of social skills and academic adjustment to college. The term social skills defines the set of behaviors required for social competence as criteria specifically associated with this construct. Academic adaptation involves an integration and accommodation of academic experiences to the demands of the university context. an analysis of empirical studies on the two issues and, based on the correlations they highlighted was made, it was concluded that this association may suggest that: (a) a good social skills could contribute to the quality of academic experiences and academic achievement facilitating the process of adaptation to the University; (B) the situations and demands of life at the University are learning opportunities, not only academic, but also interpersonal, contributing to the development of important social skills for university, both at present and in future careers. Keywords: Social skills, social competence, academic Experiences, college students, academic adaptation.\n\nRESUMO. Este ensaio visa analisar poss\u00edveis rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre os conceitos de habilidades sociais e de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o acad\u00eamica \u00e0 Universidade. O termo habilidades sociais define o conjunto de comportamentos requeridos para a compet\u00eancia social, conforme crit\u00e9rios especificamente associados a esse construto. A adapta\u00e7\u00e3o acad\u00eamica envolve uma integra\u00e7\u00e3o e uma acomoda\u00e7\u00e3o das viv\u00eancias acad\u00eamicas \u00e0s demandas do contexto universit\u00e1rio. Foi feita uma an\u00e1lise de estudos emp\u00edricos sobre os dois temas e, com base nas correla\u00e7\u00f5es por eles evidenciadas, conclui-se que essa associa\u00e7\u00e3o pode sugerir que: (a) um bom repert\u00f3rio de habilidades sociais poderia contribuir para a qualidade das viv\u00eancias acad\u00eamicas e o rendimento acad\u00eamico facilitando o processo de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Universidade; (b) as situa\u00e7\u00f5es e as demandas da vida na Universidade constituem oportunidades de aprendizagem, n\u00e3o somente acad\u00eamicas, mas tamb\u00e9m interpessoais, contribuindo para o desenvolvimento de habilidades sociais importantes para o universit\u00e1rio, tanto no presente quanto no futuro profissional.

identify the nature of multiple intelligences among dental students and investigate the relationship between these intelligences and performance in the various skill areas of dentistry. Methods: Sixty-one final year dental students at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya in Malaysia were administered a Multiple Intelligence Inventory [(MII), David Larear, 1991)] after their final written examinations. MII comprised 80 4-point likert items assessing eight types of multiple intelligences: Verbal/Linguistic, Visual Spatial, Logical Mathematical, Musical Rhythmic, Intra Personal, Body Kinesthetic, Inter Personal and Naturalist. These intelligences were correlated with six academic performance scores: Amalgam Class II, Composite, Crown & Bridge, Endodontic, Problem Based Learning and the Final Written Exam. The data were analysed by Pearson Product Moment Correlation and t-test. Results: Significant correlations were found between Intrapersonal intelligence and Composite (r = .32; p < .05) and between Body Kinesthetic and Composite scores (r = .26; p < .05). High Amalgam Class II scorers obtained significantly higher scores on Intrapersonal Intelligence than low scorers (t = 2.49; p < .05). High Composite scorers have significantly higher Body Kinesthetic intelligence than low scorers (t = .29; p < .05). Low endodontic scorers obtained significantly higher scores on Visual Spatial intelligence than high scorers (t = 2.06; p < .05). High PBL scorers obtained significantly higher Interpersonal (t = 2.06; p < .05) and Naturalist Intelligence (t = 3.57; p < .05) than low scorers. Conclusions: There appears to be no significant correlations between the various types of multiple intelligences and achievement in dentistry except for the correlations between Composite scores and Intrapersonal and Body Kinesthetic Intelligence. Generally, there were no significant multiple intelligence differences among high and low performers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 8462965, "asset_id": 1361053, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1171818, "first_name": "Noor Hayaty", "last_name": "Abu Kasim", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "NoorHayatyAbuKasim", "display_name": "Noor Hayaty Abu Kasim", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/NoorHayatyAbuKasim?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1171818/416112/511553/s65_noor_hayaty.abu_kasim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56132, "name": "Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Students?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 137728, "name": "Dental", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dental?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 372434, "name": "Malaysian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 387466, "name": "Multiple", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiple?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 387467, "name": "Intelligences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intelligences?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 35044194, "title": "EXPLORING LIBRARY ANXIETY AMONG STUDENTS OF UiTM", "created_at": "2017-11-03T08:52:34.076-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35044194/EXPLORING_LIBRARY_ANXIETY_AMONG_STUDENTS_OF_UiTM?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_35044194", "summary": "The objective of the current study was to examine library anxiety level among Universiti Technologi Mara (UiTM) undergraduate and Postgraduate students.

Given the rising rates of mental disorders, it seems pertinent to examine factors that influence formal help-seeking behaviors (FHS). Research has suggested that personality traits are predictors of FHS (Rickwood et al., 1994; Tijhuis, 1990); recent studies have started to suggest that mindfulness influences academic help-seeking behaviors in college undergraduates (Howell et al., 2011). Further, other studies have shown that rumination is not only related to lowered help-seeking behaviors (e.g., Kakhnovets, 2011), but also lowered levels of mindfulness (Raes & Williams, 2010). Because of the complex interplay between rumination and mindfulness no study has yet investigated the impact of mindfulness on the relationship between rumination and FHS. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the relationship, and hypothesized that (1) mindfulness positively correlate with FHS, and that (2) rumination would mediate the mindfulness\u2013FHS relationship.  \r\nMethod: 179 healthy undergraduates from National University of Singapore (21.8 \u00b1 1.6 years of age; 56% female; 88% ethnically Chinese) participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants filled out a pen-and-paper questionnaire comprising validated measures of (1) mindfulness, the Five-factor Mindfulness Questionnaire \u2013 Short Form (FFMQ-SF; Bohlmeijer et al., 2011); (2) rumination, the Ruminative Response Style Questionnaire, (RRS; Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991); and (3) FHS, the vignette version of the General Help-seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ-V; Wilson et al., 2005).\r\nResults: Inconsistent with our first hypothesis, a preliminary look presented no significant relationship between mindfulness and FHS; however, further analyses revealed that this was because only two of the FFMQ-SF subscales, observing and non-judging, were correlated to GHSQ-V, rs = \u2212.02 and .17, respectively. While rumination was negatively correlated with FHS, we discovered that only the reflection subscale of the RRS was correlated with aspects of the FFMQ-SF and the GHSQ-V. Mediation analyses revealed a full significant positive mediation of reflection on the link between non-judging and FHS (Sobel\u2019s z = 2.46, p = .01) but a partial significant negative mediation of reflection on the link between observing and FHS (Sobel\u2019s z = -2.10, p = .03). \r\nDiscussion and Conclusions: The results of our study preliminarily suggest that there are differential roles of both rumination and mindfulness on FHS. Clinicians and practitioners alike should be wary of wholeheartedly embracing all aspects of mindfulness-based interventions: the non-judging aspect of mindfulness improves FHS, while the observing aspect seems to lower FHS. Further, reflective, and not brooding, rumination seems to be the conduit through which mindfulness influences FHS. As such, in the interest of improving FHS, there is a greater urgency in emphasizing reflective rumination in the context of being non-judgmental, but not in that of being observant.

argued that depending on gender language is used in different ways in society, and the fact that language is surveyed differently leads to the thesis that men and women have \u2018differentiated communicative competence\u2019 (Coates, 2004). A distinct pronunciation variant that is widely used and \u2018has recently been noted as spreading through non-standard accents in England\u2019 (cf. Trudgill, 1988: 43), is that of th-fronting. The form th- fronting has become more and more integrated into the speech patterns of many speakers across the United Kingdom although it has \u2018not \u2018officially\u2019 entered RP yet\u2019 (Altendorf, 1999: 5). This study focused on whether or not gender is associated with variation in the usage of th-fronting in the urban and multicultural locality of Nottingham, United Kingdom. The analysis was undertaken in order to assess how urban youth culture in Nottingham utilizes and applies the form th-fronting in everyday dialogue such as day-to-day conversations, and whether their mode of expression varies according to gender. The study aimed to gain an insight into the relationship between spoken language and identity, and to recognise whether the social backgrounds/ cultural practices people have influence their use of ethnically and age-coded variables.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 16174282, "asset_id": 1622177, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1395612,

In order to support global learning, some universities introduce summer programmes in the form of edutourism to learners around the world. The main objective of this study is to explore the influence of edutourism on learners from visiting countries. Specifically, this study investigates how learners are influenced by the authenticity of the language activities. Next, this study also looks into how context influences students' perception of the language activities. Finally, this study is done to explore the students' perception on their cultural experience. This pilot study employs a qualitative approach. The research randomly analysed the open-ended responses of 5 male and 5 female Japanese students who took part in a 5-week summer programme in a public university in Malaysia.

We discuss first the \"in-between\" opportunities of learning development as a \"third space profession\" that enables us to work in creative partnership with students. We further set the scene by exploring the third space potential of learning development per se and then examine the successful development and administration of a learning development module, Becoming an Educationist, at a medium-sized university in the United Kingdom. We conclude by arguing for third space partnerships not just alongside the curriculum, but in and through the curriculum as well.

family can be difficult for most college students. To alleviate the transition, students look to family support. While this is rather universal across most populations, the importance of family in the Latinx subgroup is poorly understood. A survey-driven study was conducted on a sample of USC students (N=123) to obtain self-reported information on happiness and emotional wellness. The data for the Latinx subgroup (N=18) was compared to the overall sample of USC students to determine whether family played a greater role in the development of happiness for the Latinx subgroup. Results indicate that Latinx students who come from two parent households and are the middle children in the family are the most satisfied with their academic programs. Although results were inconclusive due to limitations, some data showed a link between family support, family structure, and perceived happiness. This study should therefore serve as a baseline for further studies to investigate the effect of family structure on students with high levels of family attachment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67521591, "asset_id": 49130947, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49529517, "first_name": "Jocelyne", "last_name": "Maestro", "domain_name": "usc", "page_name": "JocelyneMaestro", "display_name": "Jocelyne Maestro", "profile_url": "https://usc.academia.edu/JocelyneMaestro?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/49529517/13024631/14370734/s65_jocelyne.maestro.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 14818, "name": "Happiness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Happiness?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36621, "name": "Happiness and Well Being", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Happiness_and_Well_Being?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102674, "name": "College Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College_Students?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 187354, "name": "Social and Emotional Wellbeing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Emotional_Wellbeing?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 836992, "name": "Family structure and academic performance of students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_structure_and_academic_performance_of_students?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 983834, "name": "Supporting Social Development and Emotional Well being at School", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Supporting_Social_Development_and_Emotional_Well_being_at_School?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 2763100, "name": "Chicana/Latina/Latinx", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chicana_Latina_Latinx?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 48990562, "title": "Exploring Chemistry Professors\u2019 Methods of Highlighting the Relevancy of Chemistry: Opportunities, Obstacles, and Suggestions to Improve Students\u2019 Motivation in Science Classrooms", "created_at": "2021-05-19T22:53:55.557-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48990562/Exploring_Chemistry_Professors_Methods_of_Highlighting_the_Relevancy_of_Chemistry_Opportunities_Obstacles_and_Suggestions_to_Improve_Students_Motivation_in_Science_Classrooms?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_48990562", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67379485, "asset_id": 48990562, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 167067049, "first_name": "Education", "last_name": "Sciences", "domain_name": "mdpi", "page_name": "EducationSciencesEditorialOffice", "display_name": "Education Sciences", "profile_url": "https://mdpi.academia.edu/EducationSciencesEditorialOffice?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/167067049/46785679/38837216/s65_education.sciences.png"}, {"id": 194635557, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "George", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AnnaGeorge64", "display_name": "Anna George", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AnnaGeorge64?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 194628429, "first_name": "Ozcan", "last_name": "Gulacar", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "OzcanGulacar", "display_name": "Ozcan Gulacar", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/OzcanGulacar?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122130, "name": "Chemistry Curriculum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chemistry_Curriculum?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 141638, "name": "Socio-Scientific Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socio-Scientific_Issues?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3980112, "name": " real-world applications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/real_world_applications?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 43661783, "title": "Lived Experience in Simulation: Student Perspectives of Learning From Two Lenses", "created_at": "2020-07-19T06:17:03.681-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43661783/Lived_Experience_in_Simulation_Student_Perspectives_of_Learning_From_Two_Lenses?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_43661783", "summary": "Background: This article explores undergraduate nursing students' lived experience of learning during high-fidelity simulation (HFS). Literature is conflicting regarding the learning experience in different roles. Method: An interpretive phenomenological qualitative study was completed to gain a better understanding of the lived experience of student learning in HFS. Data collection included both written reflections and semi structures interviews regarding student learning in simulation and factors that affected that learning. Results and Conclusions: A supportive learning environment is a key for learning in HFS. Anxiety and stress can impact student learning, and measures to keep anxiety at optimal levels need to be continual focus in HFS. Observers in this study preferred the observer role and describe it as ''pressure off'' learning. Doing simulation more often in the program and having an opportunity for a ''do-over'' in simulation were identified as areas that would enhance student learning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63962296, "asset_id": 43661783, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59575581, "first_name": "Heather", "last_name": "MacLean", "domain_name": "mtroyal", "page_name": "HeatherMacLean", "display_name": "Heather MacLean", "profile_url": "https://mtroyal.academia.edu/HeatherMacLean?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 48636, "name": "Simulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Simulation?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37753414, "title": "Polarimetry and stereochemistry: the optical rotation of Vitamin C as a function of pH", "created_at": "2018-11-12T08:01:51.118-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37753414/Polarimetry_and_stereochemistry_the_optical_rotation_of_Vitamin_C_as_a_function_of_pH?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_37753414", "summary": "A novel experiment was prepared to help chemistry educators to improve the stereochemistry curriculum of secondary school students and undergraduate students.

On the crossing for the work context: social skills training with undergraduate students. Considering the current challenges concerning the insertion in the work context and the growing valorization of the interpersonal\ncompetence by employers, this paper describes a group program of social skills training with 10 undergraduates attending the final stages of their courses, all from  exact area. The program, with a A-B-A design, lasted thirty-six hours, with two weekly sessions of about two hours each. The whole program was planned\nin theoretical and practical modules, both occurring in a single session. The program was evaluated with the application of a self-report inventory (HIS-Del-Prette) before and after the intervention and with a peer evaluation at the final session. The results indicated significant differences (Wilcoxon test) between the first and final intervention scores for most of the participants with peer positive evaluations about these changes. Key words: social skills training; interpersonal relationships at work; social competence; professional preparation.\n\nRESUMO.

We followed a quasi-experimental with pretest-posttest and with control group design method. The experimental group comprised 205 and the control group comprised 75 college students. Seven supervisors with Ph.D. or MD degree in mental health professions provided weekly supervision to 120 counselors-in-training who provided individual counseling services to the participants. Each client in the experimental group received in average five sessions, each for 45-55 minutes. We have used an adapted version of Beck Anxiety Inventory for Turkey to examine the clients\u2019 anxiety levels. Throughout the counseling process, we have collaborated with the psychiatry department at the university when it was necessary. Additionally, in order to conduct the complex quasi-experimental study in a smooth process, we utilized the contextual clinical counseling model developed by the first author; as such models are utilized in some of the best counseling departments in the USA. The model facilitated to conduct the complex and dynamic research and providing the services with limited resources. That means optimized the resources through the model and got significant results. As a result, receiving counseling service seems significantly decreasing anxiety level for this sample. The current study meets some important gaps in mental health. We discussed the findings from an ecological systems theory perspective and suggested some implications in mental health.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64419025, "asset_id": 44074768,

article revises the effects of technology transfer offices (TTOs) on capacity building within the university, from the perspective of\r\ncreativity, innovation and entrepreneurship. The objective of the article is to understand clearly and deeply how TTOs build capacity in\r\ncreativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship for all the stakeholders, researchers, faculty members, SMEs, incubators, undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students, and attorneys. Particular focus is given for analysing TTOs activities in order to comprehend the strategy of TTOs in\r\ndelivering and building capacity for innovative products and services. The author concludes that the universities and TTOs should have a\r\ncommon strategic plan and policy to empower and to increase efficiently and effectively the impacts TTOs activities have on the\r\ndevelopment of the technology-based innovative products and services.\r\nKeywords: Technology Transfer Offices, creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Academic reading is \u2018tricky business\u2019 especially for those widening participation students not necessarily familiar with the forms and processes of Higher Education. To foster these students\u2019 academic literacies and practice, rather than the decontextualised teaching of \u2018skills\u2019, we create empowering social spaces for authentic collaborative reading. To facilitate this, we present text \u2018differently\u2019: text as scroll. A textscroll can be made by taping article or chapter pages together, side-by-side. Textscrolls open up the contested bookspace and make the written word accessible.

Policies aimed at increasing the diversity of the national STEM student population and workforce have recently focused on fostering inclusive learning environments that can positively impact the experi- ences of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in STEM, thus increasing their retention. While research on inclusion in STEM in higher education is relatively new, inclusion research has a rich history in several other disciplines. These fields have developed theoretical frameworks and validated instruments to conceptualize and assess inclusion. Self-determination theory (SDT) is a well-established theoretical framework in edu- cational psychology that states that ones\u2019 internal motivation is strongly correlated with the satisfaction of three specific psychological needs: autonomy, competency, and relatedness. In this paper, we introduce SDT and discuss how it relates to inclusion and to ongoing efforts to increase retention of STEM URM students in higher education environments. We argue that grounding inclusion initiatives in the SDT framework in- creases our understanding of the mechanisms mediating their impact, thus facilitating their reproducibility and generalizability. Finally, we describe how this theoretical framework has been adapted by the field of Industrial and Organizational Psychology to define and assess inclusion in the workplace as an example of how STEM education researchers can use this framework to promote and assess inclusion in their fields.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63264893, "asset_id": 43001585, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10255737, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Moore", "domain_name": "ualr", "page_name": "MichaelMoore", "display_name": "Michael E Moore", "profile_url": "https://ualr.academia.edu/MichaelMoore?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10255737/3140985/19582647/s65_michael.moore.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 17802, "name": "Diversity & Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity_and_Inclusion?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28493, "name": "STEM Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/STEM_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37270, "name": "Biology Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biology_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3023715, "name": "Dber", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dber?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 17261104, "title": "A discursive analysis of how the leaders of parties on either side of the political spectrum discuss their loss in relation to the different participants in the 2015 General Election in their resignation speech", "created_at": "2015-10-24T16:08:08.083-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/17261104/A_discursive_analysis_of_how_the_leaders_of_parties_on_either_side_of_the_political_spectrum_discuss_their_loss_in_relation_to_the_different_participants_in_the_2015_General_Election_in_their_resignation_speech?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_17261104", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39405092, "asset_id": 17261104, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9575487, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Eggleston", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DEggleston", "display_name": "Daniel Eggleston", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DEggleston?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1288, "name": "Labour Party (UK)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_Party_UK_?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 87408, "name": "UKIP", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/UKIP?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 105673, "name": "Essay", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Essay?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 2326444, "title": "Hugh-Jones, S.A., Madill, A.

Whilst most students produce qualitative projects of a good standard, there is evidence that both students and supervisors of such research experience demands specific to this methodology.\r\n\r\nStudent anxiety with qualitative methods\r\n\r\n Following a national workshop exploring the supervision of undergraduate qualitative research, Madill, Gough, Lawton and Stratton (in press) report that students experience anxiety around their ability to deploy qualitative methods despite teaching on and practice in such methods at Levels 1 and 2. This is echoed in supervisors' concerns about student preparedness for designing qualitative research, interviewing participants and conducting qualitative analyses, which often translate into heavy time-demands on both final year students and their supervisors.\r\n\r\n Student satisfaction with supervision\r\n\r\n The project supervision system within the Department of Psychology at Leeds is typical of most UK psychology departments in offering one-to-one project supervision with final year students. Student feedback (June 2005) evidences satisfaction with the supervision process; students, however, also report anxiety about their projects and a need for more reassurance about their project management and further opportunities to \u2018chat through\u2019 their progress.\r\n\r\n Seeking to enhance the experience\r\n\r\n Whilst the Department is entirely satisfied with the quality and quantity of supervision to final year students (many students report supervision as \u2018excellent\u2019 and supervision is part of the Department\u2019s teaching observation system), there is a case for seeking to enhance the student experience, and potentially the final written product, in relation to project work. We are seeking to achieve this by establishing, monitoring and evaluating ReGrouP (Research Groups in Psychology), a series of trial discussion groups to facilitate peer interaction in the design, implementation and analysis of qualitative project work. The project, running from October 2005, has received funding from the Higher Education Academy Psychology Network, under its Departmental Teaching Enhancement Scheme.\r\n\r\n Collaborative work is good for students\r\n\r\n Despite student caution about group work, there is evidence that when students participate as stakeholders, the reported benefit is high. Mitchell-Williams et al (2004) report that collaborative work, rather than diluting the research experience, contributes to students\u2019 ownership of their projects. They become more responsible for absorbing ideas and processes useful to their own project (McMichael, 1992) without having to \u2018surrender power to the experts\u2019 (Ashworth, 2004, p 157).\r\n\r\nAims of the group work project\r\n\r\n As well as enhancing student learning, the groups aim to promote the development and subsequent articulation of research skills (e.g. interviewing, data analysis) and group skills (e.g. managing criticism, progressing a discussion, etc). \r\n\r\nThe timings and aims of the discussion groups reflect both the pivotal times in the research process and the usual focus of one-to-one supervision meetings. A sample of these groups will be systematically observed over the year and, in conjunction with formal student feedback and focus groups, the researchers hope to isolate how students:\r\n\u2022engage with group work whilst maintaining responsibility and ownership of personal project work;\r\n\u2022 manage group discussions that require a disclosure of independent, personal work;\r\n\u2022 seek and receive peer feedback on their work;\r\n steer group discussions to a level at which they can participate in and benefit from;\r\n\u2022 evidence learning that occurs through the discussion;\r\n utilise group work to enhance their own research;\r\n\u2022 combine the learning available in one-to-one supervision with that available through group work.\r\n\r\nThe groups will run throughout the current academic year, and analysis of group activity will be conducted by the end of Summer 2006. The outcomes of the study will be available by September 2006.\r\n\r\n References\r\n\r\n Ashworth, P. (2004) Understanding as the transformation of what is already known.

"\"Abstract: This paper reports on the analysis of data fromundergraduate nursing studentswho participated in the Primary\r\nHealth Care Intensive Programme (PHCIP) in far west New South Wales between 2006 and 2008. This analysis\r\nlooks specifically at pre/post confidence levels of participants in relation to their grasp of underlying principles\r\nassociated with primary health care practice and Indigenous health care delivery. Bachelor of nursing curricula\r\nremains heavily weighted towards acute care in large metropolitan facilities however; universities actively\r\nseek clinical fieldwork experiences in rural/remote and Indigenous communities for their students. The PHCIP\r\nwas developed and delivered through the Broken Hill University Department of Rural Health, University of\r\nSydney, and sought to address the disparity in student preparedness for practice in these settings through\r\nthe provision of a structured and educational rural and remote clinical placement experience. Pre/post\r\nquestionnaires, focus groups and three month post-placement phone interviews provided data on levels\r\nof participant confidence in the areas of primary health care delivery and culturally knowledgeable practice.\r\nThis study indicates that structured preparation for practice, underpinned by authentic learning experiences\r\nand aligned with comprehensive education programmes can have a positive impact in the areas of\r\nskills, knowledge and attitudes and enhance the confidence of undergraduate nurses undertaking clinical\r\nplacements in these settings. These findings are relevant to contemporary nursing education and evolving\r\nmodels of health care delivery for rural and remote communities.\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\nIndigenous health, Curricula, Confidence, Student nurse, Rural/remote, Undergraduate, Primary Health Care, Clinical placement experience\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30560217, "asset_id": 1487181, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14661, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "PaulBennett", "display_name": "Paul Bennett", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/PaulBennett?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14661/4905/14977659/s65_paul.bennett.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2974, "name": "Primary Health Care", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primary_Health_Care?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3084, "name": "Indigenous Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Health?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10868, "name": "Confidence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Confidence?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 321290, "name": "Curricula", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curricula?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 440551, "name": "Student nurse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_nurse?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 440552, "name": "Clinical placement experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clinical_placement_experience?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 440553, "name": "Rural/remote", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_remote?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 1121494, "name": "Student", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 80421841, "title": "Enhancing higher education student attendance through classroom management", "created_at": "2022-05-31T22:42:48.009-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80421841/Enhancing_higher_education_student_attendance_through_classroom_management?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_80421841", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86809093, "asset_id": 80421841, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19163372, "first_name": "Zaid", "last_name": "Al-Shammari, Ph.D.", "domain_name": "kuniv", "page_name": "ZaidAlShammariPhD", "display_name": "Zaid Al-Shammari, Ph.D.", "profile_url": "https://kuniv.academia.edu/ZaidAlShammariPhD?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19163372/5337557/6138884/s65_zaid.al-shammari.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1601, "name": "Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23875, "name": "Classroom Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Management?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 49426, "name": "Attendance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Attendance?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 52209, "name": "Kuwait", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kuwait?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 93869, "name": "Student Attendance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Attendance?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102674, "name": "College Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College_Students?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 175427, "name": "Undergraduate Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Education?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 242024, "name": "College", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 77969298, "title": "Third space partnerships with students: Becoming educational together", "created_at": "2022-04-29T08:06:47.600-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/77969298/Third_space_partnerships_with_students_Becoming_educational_together?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_77969298", "summary": "This case study discusses how we harnessed a University Teaching Fellowship to open a collective third space partnership with \u201cnon-traditional\u201d students to enable them to draw on their experiences of transition into higher education and to produce resources designed to help other students find their place, voice, and power at university.

How cuts have increased in frequency since the beginning of cinema and how their arrangement form structure across groups of shots is the focus of this study. In order to examine this, films were obtained from 3 genres (action, comedy, drama) and 4 years (1945, 1965, 1985, 2005), one film per genre per year. Luminance and color information were digitally sampled and imported into a Matlab-programmed \u2018cut detector\u2019 to predict where cuts occurred within the given film. The program detected hard and soft cuts, which were then manually confirmed or rejected. Additionally, ranges of flagged frames were  processed to identify missed cuts, resulting in a list of all the frame numbers at which cuts occur in each film. The results show that mean shot length has decreased over the years. Auto-correlation computation of shot length pairs shows that shot pairs are positively correlated, across both variables of genre and year; this reveals that structure is present across groups of shots in the same pattern of shot length sequences.

Activated hepatic stellate cells, portal fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts of bone marrow origin have been identified as major collagen-producing cells in the injured liver. These cells are activated by fibrogenic cytokines such as TGF-\u1d5d1, angiotensin II, and leptin. Reversibility of advanced liver fibrosis in patients has been recently documented, which has encougaged researchers to continue their research for potent and safer antifibrotic drugs.

However, both novices and experts are prone to misinterpret this notational form. A difficulty with reasoning with cladograms is that intuitive narrative conceptions of evolution as a linear progression interfere with perceiving the hierarchical relationships that tree diagrams are intended to convey. We challenge the use of standard cladograms to teach phylogenetic reasoning and attempt to disentangle the effects of content beliefs, conceptual metaphors, and visual structure. We explain how and why students misinterpret cladograms and investigate the effects of alternative, more intuitive representations and approaches. Through clinical interviews with 24 undergraduate students. Study 1 describes students\u2019 invented representations for depicting the concept of relatedness and investigates the impacts of recontextualizing their representational activities within non-evolutionary contexts. Study 2 examines the effects on students\u2019 reasoning with the standard cladogram after they first invent a diagram of their own. Findings from our mixed quantitative and qualitative analyses display the range of representational resources that students bring to the task of reasoning about relatedness. They suggest potential value in building upon such representations when teaching novices to reason about phylogenies.

The study therefore assessed the nature of HIV/AIDS information shared on social media sites\nby undergraduate students in southwestern Nigeria. Structured questionnaire copies were administered to 355\nundergraduate students in Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), University of Lagos (Unilag) and University\nof Ibadan (UI). Data gathered from the administered questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive and\ninferential statistics. Result showed that 71.3% of the students across the selected universities were aware of\nsocial media and made used of it. Facebook was the most favourite social media platform followed by\nInstagram and WhatsApp, while Kinschat, LinkedIn, Skype and BBM were least preferred social media sites.\nIndependent samples test result showed there was no significant gender difference in the preference of social\nmedia sites (t = 1.039, p>0.05). The result showed that 81.4% of the students had come across HIV/AIDS\ninformation on social media, while only 24.8% had shared HIV/AIDS information on social media. Prevention\nmethods and general HIV/AIDS knowledge were the main types of information shared. ANOVA result further\nrevealed significant variation in the type of HIV/AIDS information shared on social media among the three\nuniversities (F = 5.177; p<0.05). The Post Hoc Test of multiple comparison indicated that type of HIV/AIDS\ninformation shared in UI differed significantly from those shared in OAU and UNILAG respectively.

It is particularly important to investigate the conception of text in digital context, by means of the study of updated semiotic resources in the production of undergraduate students using a computer with internet access in the process of semi-present Distance Learning (DL). The collected material comprises 29 (twenty nine) texts which were produced by students of the semipresent Pedagogy Course from Univesp (Universidade Virtual do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Virtual University from the state of S\u00e3o Paulo), who were studying \u201cEducation and Language\u201d, in 2010. This qualitative analysis aims to show that regarding the institution there is a prevalence of structural and procedural aspects for the accomplishment of the proposed activity and, regarding the undergraduate student it is noticed that the production is characterized by a traditional conception of text, mainly recognized by written verbal text, although the proposal prioritized the relation between verbal and non verbal language. Regarding discursive-linguistic studies, it is important to reflect about a text conception that privileges the integration of multiple semiosis by taking into account the socio-historical interlocution character established within utterances of others.\n\n[PT] A exemplo  do que prop\u00f5e Corr\u00eaa (2011) na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de textos produzidos por universit\u00e1rios e pr\u00e9-universit\u00e1rios em duas diferentes situa\u00e7\u00f5es de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o, procuro, neste trabalho, aproximar aspectos \u201cocultos\u201d no ensino de escrita na universidade (Street, 2009) de reflex\u00f5es produzidas no \u00e2mbito dos estudos da linguagem, em particular, aquelas propostas por Voloshinov/Bakhtin (s/d: 1926) no que se refere \u00e0 no\u00e7\u00e3o de \u201cpresumido social\u201d.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a deliberate focus on relationship building in the undergraduate classroom at the United States Military Academy. Using a teacher-as-researcher method, the instructor asked students to make personal introductions for 4 classes (semester 1), 8 classes (semester 2), and 11 classes (semester 3) to support class cohesion and improve classroom participation by enhancing student-student and student-teacher relationships. The study used qualitative data to assess the impact of introductions on student participation and satisfaction and to facilitate the development of student enthusiasm.", "downloadable_attachments":

Universities offer a selection of research-intensive pathways at the graduate level, which provides opportunities for independent inquiry and intellectual autonomy. Undergraduate students, however, are somewhat short-changed in their experience in research. They are exposed to a variety of areas and disciplines, which forms a general cluster of knowledge, but students graduate without obtaining the skills associated with research and inquiry. Digital communication networks and the ways in which information is disseminated in modern society play an important role in the way people live and learn. At the same time, younger generations are emerging with greater skills in digital literacy, which bears an impact on how knowledge is produced and information is shared. This prompts to question, are undergraduate students acquiring the generic attributes that will help them to cope with the complexities of an information-driven society? The following article is based on the premise that undergraduate students need to be empowered to construct their own knowledge as potential producers rather than mere consumers of knowledge. It provides a synthesis of cross-disciplinary perspectives and educational debates that support the argument for, and benefits of, providing research-enriched learning for undergraduate students. This article adopts a framework for the dimensions of research in undergraduate learning. The different models presented in this article aim to illustrate the various ways that research can be integrated with teaching to benefit learning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31656654,

Twenty-three interviews were conducted with eleven British medical students intercalating in psychology. Forty emotionally resonant key moments were identified for analysis. Our analysis illustrates students\u2019 use of the professional genre to present their training as emotionally neutral. However, we show how medical training can be framed in more unofficial and affective-laden ways in which threshold moments of crisis are presented as space-time breaches characteristic of the genres of adventure-wonder and adventure-ordeal. This affect was often depotentiated in the narratives through brief allusion to the professional genre. This cycling between genres suggests that the students were searching for an appropriate way in which to frame their experiences, a central dilemma being the extent to which medical training makes sense within an immediate and affect-laden, or future-orientated and affect-neutral, pedagogy. Finally, we identify how consultants are an important aspect of the affective experience of medical training who, at their best, offer inspiring exemplars of flexible movement between official and unofficial ways of being a doctor. In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential of genres to make sense, and to organize the experience, of medical training spatially in terms of moving between personal and impersonal contact, temporally in terms of moving between the extraordinary and routine, and affectively in terms of moving between potent and neutral affect. Learning to use the professional genre is part of enculturation as a doctor and can be helpful in providing a framework restoring coherence and composure through engaging with, and reformulating, difficult experiences. However, it is important to take seriously the resistance many of the students demonstrated to the professional genre as a possible barometer of its acceptability to the general public.",

The shift from primary burial (i.e., initial interment) to secondary burial (i.e., disarticulation, curation, and burning of the corpse) facilitated the transformation of the deceased\u2019s gender identities and personhoods. Specifically, at tholos tombs the Minoans actively used these stages of death as opportunities to restructure gender identities and distinctions previously held in life. In this article, I will address how the funerary architecture of the tholos tombs and the secondary stages of burial reveal the mutability, or fluidity, of gender identities and personhoods in Minoan death.

This paper demonstrates how modernism can be seen to begin before the twentieth century (the conventional understanding of the start of modernism). The article argues that Wilde fuses the formal features of realism and aestheticism, a new formula that is significant to the development of modernism. This fusion of realism and aestheticism manifests itself in two ways. The first is how Wilde stylises reality, whilst the second concerns how Wilde mixes the messages of aestheticism with the didactic properties of realism.

In the minds of the fighting soldiers, chaplains necessitated and supported the notion that death was conquerable only through divine salvation. This mindset, in turn, allowed soldiers who accepted this salvation to, at least to some extent, shed their fear of death and dismemberment.  In short, they fought harder knowing they would go to an afterlife if they died in battle.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76479654, "asset_id": 64127739, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 126453067, "first_name": "Jeremiah", "last_name": "Snyder", "domain_name": "aiuoline", "page_name": "JeremiahSnyder", "display_name": "Jeremiah Snyder", "profile_url": "https://aiuoline.academia.edu/JeremiahSnyder?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/126453067/57132390/45346768/s65_jeremiah.snyder.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 54673432, "title": "Resonating Ontologies: The Illusory Nature of the Confrontation Between \u017di\u017eek's Ontology and Speculative Realism", "created_at": "2021-10-01T11:44:31.358-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54673432/Resonating_Ontologies_The_Illusory_Nature_of_the_Confrontation_Between_%C5%BDi%C5%BEeks_Ontology_and_Speculative_Realism?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_54673432", "summary": "There are two main currents of thought in Continental philosophy emerging today \u2013 the speculative realists (via: Graham Harman and Meillassoux) and the post-continental Marxists (via: \u017di\u017eek and Badiou).

However, it is challenging to ensure the fostering of these traits because, for example, in Dutch liberal arts colleges, the curriculum model is such that the study path depends largely on each student\u2019s particular subject choices. In this paper, I argue that a way of meeting this challenge would be to include an ethics course in the academic core that is mandatory for all students. I support this addition by showing how the study of ethics promotes fundamental skills such as inquiry upon the good life, reconsideration of foundational values, awareness of oneself as an individual embedded in a society, and accommodation of a diversity of viewpoints, which all relate to the learning outcomes associated with citizenship, leadership, and well-roundedness. My analysis concludes that an ethics course in the academic core would offer a curricular strategy for cultivating these traits. Moreover, I suggest that the study of ethics in general should be considered of essential importance in liberal arts education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64440415, "asset_id": 44093985, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39537925, "first_name": "Patr\u012bcija", "last_name": "Kei\u0161a", "domain_name": "lu-lv", "page_name": "PatricijaKeisa", "display_name": "Patr\u012bcija Kei\u0161a", "profile_url": "https://lu-lv.academia.edu/PatricijaKeisa?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/819a321a45f9761764191aaba7660669?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80629, "name": "Liberal Arts Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Arts_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 1028997, "name": "Teaching of Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_of_Ethics?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 43064513, "title": "Outsiders looking in?

To foster these students\u2019 academic literacies and practice, rather than the decontextualised teaching of \u2018skills\u2019, we create empowering social spaces for authentic collaborative reading. To facilitate this, we present text \u2018differently\u2019: text as scroll. A textscroll can be made by taping article or chapter pages together, side-by-side. Textscrolls open up the contested bookspace and make the written word accessible. They foster dialogic and multimodal interaction with texts and, if woven into a developmental embodied sequence of learning activities, help develop an understanding of academic reading as a wider social practice. Student and staff feedback show that scrolls are liberating. Scrolls, in embodied ways, make university reading meaningful and can authentically scaffold entry into epistemic communities. Scrolls help learners access the written word - and enjoy reading.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63324458, "asset_id": 43064513, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Each form of agency is then characterized by the female characters of the lower, middle, or upper classes within the novel. Burney\u2019s uncouth characterization of the lower classes corresponds with physical agency, or the physical ability to create agency outside of social expectations, while elite agency allows upper-class and aristocratic women to act as they wish without public censure. Middle-class Evelina\u2019s emotional agency, accessible to readers through the epistolary format of the novel, relies on her understanding of propriety, sensibilities, and interpersonal connections as a means of navigating social situations and class mobility.

The political agitator is the literary \u201cself\u201d displayed in both texts. The significance of examining the political agitator is to see who Cugoano and Walker appear to be when writing their political documents. In essence, Cugoano and Walker use a polemical self in order to state their claims. Some of the major questions I will address are, why use a political agitator self to convey a message, and what was at stake for the African race during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and if proven human, what would happen to slavery?

Although employed traditionally at postgraduate level, this strategy can be used in undergraduate students coming for clerkships in clinical departments. There are many challenges to workplace learning such as, unfavorable physical environment, lack of interest by clinical staff and teachers, and lack of student motivation. Clinical teachers can help bridge this gap and improve workplace learning through individual and collaborative team effort. Knowledge of various educational theories and principles and their application at workplace can enhance student learning and motivation, for which faculty development is much needed. Different teaching and learning activities can be used and tailored according to the clinical setting. Active reflection by students and constructive feedback from the clinicians forms the backbone of effective workplace learning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68317097, "asset_id": 50266571, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40060476, "first_name": "Dr. Madiha", "last_name": "Sajjad", "domain_name": "riphah", "page_name": "DrMadihaSajjad", "display_name": "Dr. Madiha Sajjad", "profile_url": "https://riphah.academia.edu/DrMadihaSajjad?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40060476/111621044/100877937/s65_dr._madiha.sajjad.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 887, "name": "Teaching and Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_and_Learning?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3457, "name": "Learning and Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_and_Teaching?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16004, "name": "Learning in the Workplace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_in_the_Workplace?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17951, "name": "Learning And Teaching In Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_And_Teaching_In_Higher_Education?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 18129, "name": "Workplace Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Workplace_Learning?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 26327, "name": "Medicine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medicine?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 62445, "name": "Medical Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Students?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 175427, "name": "Undergraduate Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Education?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 953716, "name": "Informal Workplace Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Informal_Workplace_Learning?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 3763225, "name": "Medical and Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_and_Health_Sciences?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 45616353, "title": "E-LEARNING: CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS AMONG THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CRISIS", "created_at": "2021-03-25T21:49:06.023-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45616353/E_LEARNING_CHALLENGES_AND_PROSPECTS_AMONG_THE_UNDERGRADUATE_LEVEL_STUDENTS_DURING_THE_COVID_19_PANDEMIC_CRISIS?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_45616353", "summary": "E-learning technologies have the potentialities to spread learning to a great mass at a time by providing the learners with a wide aspect of knowledge and information and to learn with their own pace.

Methodology: This is an analytical study conducted in Khyber Medical College, Peshawar from 3rd April, 2016 to 30th May, 2016. The marks obtained in medical Entry Test and 1st Professional MBBS were compared using Pearson Correlation. Data was obtained from appropriate sources and then its evaluation was done. Findings: This study found that there is a Pearson Correlation of 0.303(moderate) between Entry Test marks and the first professional MBBS marks. The scatter plot shows a positive relation between the two, which means that if one increases, so will the other. The p value of less than 0.000 was obtained. Conclusion: Student's performance in entry test can be a predictability factor for success later on during his undergraduate years. However, there is still, room for improvement in the entry test format. It should be redesigned to inculcate humanities subjects as well, along with mathematics. That will then judge a wider aspect of a student's capability.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54284003, "asset_id": 34402559, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42524402, "first_name": "The Journal of Middle East and", "last_name": "North Africa Sciences", "domain_name": "jomenas", "page_name": "jomenas", "display_name": "The Journal of Middle East and  North Africa Sciences", "profile_url": "https://jomenas.academia.edu/jomenas?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42524402/11464591/17877831/s65_the_journal_of_middle_east_and.north_africa_sciences.jpg"}, {"id": 68081769, "first_name": "Umema", "last_name": "Zafar", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ZafarUmema", "display_name": "Umema Zafar", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ZafarUmema?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/68081769/39437503/32637239/s65_umema.zafar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 595, "name": "Medical Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Sciences?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4455, "name": "Medical Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medical_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30291, "name": "Undergraduate Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Research?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81504, "name": "Correlation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Correlation?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 133432, "name": "Undergraduate Thesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Thesis?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 175427, "name": "Undergraduate Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Education?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 765463, "name": "Nust entry test", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nust_entry_test?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 34326207, "title": "\" This Is Your Quest: How to Win Intro to Theatre Preamble \"", "created_at": "2017-08-23T09:31:30.545-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34326207/_This_Is_Your_Quest_How_to_Win_Intro_to_Theatre_Preamble_?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_34326207", "summary": "The remainder of this article was published on the Theatre Topics website for Volume 27, Number 2, July 2017.

First-year studio classes should be where design is demonstrated as more than enhancing content visually. Design framed as investigating and inquiring through the needs and motivations of the diverse range of humans that interface with it is more aligned with contemporary and future needs of both the design profession and societies at large. Essentially we want our students to be able to analyze a situation/opportunity/issue and be able to determine which method(s) will best serve the investigations and explorations they will need to undergo in a given context.

This research aimed to characterize the social skills repertoire among Psychology students from 4 Brazilian places: S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Bahia (BA), Minas Gerais (MG)e Rio de Janeiro (RJ), also examining their differences and the influence of sex and age on their patterns. Five hundred sixty four Psychology undergraduates completed a self-report inventory (IHS-del-Prette) with a structure of 5 factors: F1) coping and assertion; F2) expressing positive affection; F3) talking and self-confidence; F4) dealing with unknown people and new situations; F5) aggressiveness self-control. The samples were compared considering general (GS) and factorial (F1, F2, F3, F4 e F5) scores as well as sex and age influence in each one (ANOVA, followed by t or Scheff\u00e9 test). The results showed that: a) Psychology students presented higher scores than normative sample in the GS, F1, F3 and F4 and lower in the F2 and F5, but sex differences were similar to the normative pattern; b) place, sex and age significantly affected the scores, with place-sex and place-age interactions; c) samples from MG, BA, RJ and SP presented similar profiles, with higher values for RJ in the F1 and for MG and SP in the F2 and F5; d) students from BA presented the highest sex differences and from RJ the lowest ones; e) age differences occurred in the F4 (favorable to younger students for SP) and in the F5 (favorable to older ones for BA and RJ). The meaning of these differences and similarities are discussed as well as some explanatory hypotheses and questions for further studies.\n\nResumo Habilidades sociais que ocorrem com alta freq\u00fc\u00eancia e pouca variabilidade podem ser consideradas como padr\u00f5es, sugerindo caracter\u00edsticas da cultura ou subcultura que s\u00e3o importantes na sele\u00e7\u00e3o de instrumentos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e no planejamento de interven\u00e7\u00f5es. Este trabalho buscou caracterizar o repert\u00f3rio de habilidades sociais de estudantes de Psicologia com base em amostras de 4 localidades: S\u00e3o Paulo (SP), Bahia (BA), Minas Gerais (MG) e Rio de Janeiro (RJ), verificando diferen\u00e7as entre elas, inclusive em termos da influ\u00eancia do sexo e idade. Quinhentos e sessenta e quatro estudantes responderam 1 invent\u00e1rio de auto-relato IHS-Del-Prette & A. Del Prette, 2001, cujos itens agrupavam-se em 5 fatores: F1) enfrentamento e auto-afirma\u00e7\u00e3o; F2) express\u00e3o de afeto positivo; F3) conversa\u00e7\u00e3o e desenvoltura social; F4) auto-exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a desconhecidos e situa\u00e7\u00f5es novas; e F5) autocontrole da agressividade. Com base no escore geral (EG) e escores fatoriais (F1, F2, Fe, F4 e F5), foram efetuadas an\u00e1lises comparativas por localidade e, em cada uma delas, por sexo e idade (ANOVA seguida de teste t ou Scheff\u00e9). Os resultados indicaram que: a) os estudantes de Psicologia apresentaram escores mais altos que os da amostra normativa no EG, F1, F3 e F4 e inferiores no F2 e F5, mas as diferen\u00e7as de sexo seguiram os padr\u00f5es normativos; b) houve influ\u00eancia da localidade, sexo e idade sobre os escores, com intera\u00e7\u00e3o local-sexo e local-idade; c) as amostra de MG, BA, RJ e SP apresentaram perfil semelhante para F3 e F4, mas RJ apresentou escores mais altos no F1, MG e SP no F2 e F5; d) houve mais diferen\u00e7as de g\u00eanero na BA e menos no RJ; e) as diferen\u00e7as de idade ocorreram no F4 (favor\u00e1veis aos mais novos para SP) e no F5 (favor\u00e1veis aos mais velhos para BA e RJ). Discute-se as diferen\u00e7as e semelhan\u00e7as encontradas, levantando-se hip\u00f3teses e quest\u00f5es para pesquisa adicionais.

Park\u2019s (2010) meaning-making model states that when people perceive major discrepancies between how the world really is, and how they think it should be (belief violation; BV), or want it to be (goal violation; GV), they experience distress and lower levels of well-being; Finding meaning in the stressful experience (through the reconciliation of violations) would result in comparatively higher levels of well-being (Park & Gutierrez, 2013).\r\n\r\nWhile this model has been empirically validated (Lim, Park, & Slattery, 2012), no work has yet examined the impact of positive meaning-making (PMM) and its relationship with this model. Because attempts at making positive meaning from stressful situations have been associated with better coping responses (e.g., Bower et al., 2005), this study thus sought to investigate if PMM would fully mediate the relationship between appraised violations (BV/GV) and changes in an individual\u2019s worldview (WC). \r\n\r\n280 students (59% female; 85% ethnically Chinese; Mage = 20.9 years, range: 18-26 years) from National University of Singapore participated in this ethics-approved study. Participants were asked to complete a self-report specific to their most stressful experience in the past 6 months. In line with past research on Park\u2019s model (Lim et al., 2012; Park, 2005a, 2008), we assessed (a) the degree to which the students\u2019 stressful resulted in BV and GV; the degree of meaning-making that students engaged in (Situational Meaning-Making; SMM) measured by the Core Beliefs Inventory (Cann et al., 2010); and (c) the amount of meaning made from the stressful event (WC). Positive Meaning-Making (PMM), the amount of positive SMM, was measured using the positive reframing subscale of the COPE (Stanton, Danoff-Burg, & Huggins, 2002). \r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, while PMM was related to WC, correlations at the bivariate level suggested that there was no statistically significant relationship between PMM and BV/GV. We found, however, that PMM, SMM, and WC were all positively correlated (range of rs: .18-.29, ps < .01). Mediation analyses (Baron & Kenny, 1986) revealed that PMM partially positively mediated the relationship between SMM and WC, R2 = .23, F(15,249) = 5.04, p < .001; Sobel\u2019s z = 2.19, p < .05.\r\n\r\nOur results suggested that while PMM was not immediately related to helping individuals transition from appraised violations to meaning made from a stressful event, it seems to be the partial conduit through which SMM results in WC. In other words, simply making meaning is enough to result in meaning made; the positive valence of which, however, facilitate this to some degree. Because this is a novel proposal, to the best of our knowledge no studies have investigated this particular mechanism, although, as previously mentioned, many seem to support PMM as indicators of more meaning made. Future studies should replicate these results before concrete implications can be drawn. Regardless, these results suggest a more intricate relationship between PMM and SMM than previously assumed, providing preliminary evidence for a more comprehensive model of meaning making.

Twenty-nine students participated in piloting peer group learning using materials developed by the researchers. Students were allocated to groups and provided with workbooks to help orient and structure six meeting over the academic year (2005-6). Observations of selected meetings were recorded by postgraduates using a pre-structured form. Supervisors of participating students attended a focus group after projects had been marked to discuss how the peer group sessions had impacted supervision.\r\nEvaluation ratings of sessions were high, except for the third session (towards the end of semester 1), which also had poor attendance. A meeting between students and the researchers revealed that session timing may have triggered this problem so rescheduling of semester 2 sessions was implemented. Written responses on evaluation forms showed that students valued the opportunity to discuss aspects of project work, to share anxieties, and to monitor relative progress. However, they also reported discomfort with the lack of supervision and some difficulties running the groups, particularly with regard to timings.\r\nThe observational data indicated that students were generally willing to learn from each other and appeared competent in negotiating the level of group discussion. Although willing to discuss many aspects of their research, contribution to the group did become restricted when discussing decisions already made with the supervisor. Supervisors noted that occasional questions were brought to supervision that had originated from the sessions and that sections in the written reports linked directly to issues discussed in the groups. \r\nFeedback from students and staff has led us to make small, but appropriate, amendments to the meeting handouts. We are continuing to develop peer group learning in the department and have secured further co-operation from supervisors of qualitative projects. This year (2006-7), participating students have been clustered in groups according to supervisor in order to increase group cohesiveness and avoid confusing differences in reports of supervisor advice.\r\nThe project has allowed us to develop and refine worksheets supporting peer group learning for final year students conducting qualitative research in psychology which could also be adapted to form the basis of lectures, seminars, or tutorials. These have been sent to the HEA to be made available to other interested departments, two conference presentations have been made (by end of January 2007), one publication is in the process of invited resubmission, and one HEA workshop contribution has been made with both researchers available for further dissemination of the project materials.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31245512,

Student engagement was observed in six structured collaborative learning sessions and students' evaluation of them was collected with regards to how useful the sessions were to them and the extent to which they felt able to contribute. Findings indicate that students benefited from the general support afforded by the group and were willing to learn from each other, except when faced with uncertainty about reliability of peer advice or with unequal contributions from group members. Notably, students were defensive about research decisions made with their project supervisor. This study offers tentative evidence that collaborative learning can address student anxieties about independent work, but that it does not necessarily challenge authority-dependence.",

Creating a diverse workforce requires improving access to STEM education for historically underrepresented students, including low-income students and first-generation students. However, significant challenges and barriers exist. The purpose of this paper is to showcase an innovative approach to mentoring historically underrepresented STEM students which integrates photovoice and photo-elicitation. This new approach in mentoring takes student participation one step further by asking students to document and share their lived experiences through photographs (e.g., photovoice). Then, photo-elicitation is used to further engage students in discussing what led to their subsequent empowerment in leveraging successes or overcoming barriers.

To help bridge the gap between concept and application, students were required to select either a single brand or a retail establishment. Students individually completed ten research assignments focusing on the brand or retailer, with each assignment paralleling course material as the class progressed. This approach allowed students to \u201cpersonalize\u201d theories and core concepts and thus develop a better appreciation for the usefulness of what they learned about consumer behavior. Completion of the overall assignments required that students employ a variety of research methods ranging from personal observation, interviews with managers and consumers, content analysis of advertisements, to secondary research from articles in the business press. This range of methods helped students gain a better grasp of how consumer research is conducted, reinforcing material presented throughout the course. In addition to promoting student awareness of behavioral research methods, the integrated assignments compelled students to apply key consumer behavior concepts to the selected business. Activities included: 1) demographic study of consumers of the selected brand or retailer; 2) analyses of cultural values as they related to shopping and consuming; 3) perceptual mapping of the business and its competitors; 4) critical examination of perceptual influences either in-store or in promotional pieces; 5) study of target markets according to household decision making and stages in the household life cycle; and 6) PRIZM lifestyle analysis of customers. A final course requirement was an end-of-term oral presentation from teams of students who had selected the same business for focus throughout the semester. This let students to share their various perspectives and collaborate on what they had learned. This approach to teaching consumer behavior was beneficial in several respects. First, concentration on a single brand or business allowed participants to gain a deeper knowledge of how businesses operate and how they make use of consumer information. This helped students see the real-world value of the course material, as well as the interconnected nature of marketing activities. Secondly, the assignments became the basis for class discussion with students jumping in to share their observations and experiences on each assignment. This promoted class involvement and seemed to heighten student interest in the course. Thirdly, by having assignments completed over time and in smaller \u201cchunks,\u201d students had more time to absorb and connect individual course concepts than would be the case with a single term project. Finally, because they had to complete a series of individual assignments before working as a team on a final presentation, students were more likely to develop a sense of personal expertise and ownership of knowledge. As a consequence, the instructor experienced surprisingly few group issues due to \u201cslacking off.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 190357089, "first_name": "Susan",

This paper is merely a glimpse into the development of Participant Bar Theory as well as a catalyst for further investigation of this alternative syntactic theory.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81094168, "asset_id": 71971148, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 109599322, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Packer", "domain_name": "fau", "page_name": "DanielPacker", "display_name": "Daniel Packer", "profile_url": "https://fau.academia.edu/DanielPacker?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 422, "name": "Computer Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Computer_Science?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 66128994, "title": "Prostitution and the Construction of Female Identity", "created_at": "2021-12-27T10:36:35.756-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66128994/Prostitution_and_the_Construction_of_Female_Identity?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_66128994", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 134536528, "first_name": "Khrystine", "last_name": "Kelsey", "domain_name": "pacifica", "page_name": "KhrystineKelsey", "display_name": "Khrystine Kelsey", "profile_url": "https://pacifica.academia.edu/KhrystineKelsey?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://gravatar.com/avatar/f6e3f9f9bc0374b949780448408d115e?s=65"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 65280419, "title": "Exploring Library Anxiety Among Students of UiTM", "created_at": "2021-12-21T03:41:04.275-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/65280419/Exploring_Library_Anxiety_Among_Students_of_UiTM?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_65280419", "summary": "The objective of the current study was to examine library anxiety level among Universiti Technologi Mara (UiTM) undergraduate and Post-graduate students.

Immersive virtual reality (IVR) employs headsets and computer software to create an artificial environment containing three-dimensional images in which the user perceives full immersion. Individual virtual reality accessory devices allow the user to interact with the computer-generated environment and manipulate objects within the virtual setting. Immersive virtual reality is a mainstay in the gaming industry, with many new virtual reality games being released each month on multiple gaming systems. Gradually, the education research literature is accumulating evidence on the positive effects of the use of virtual reality technologies in educational settings with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and special education leading the way. Widespread usage of virtual reality in STEM must involve the development of readily accessible virtual reality subject-specific software and clear pedagogical plans and measurement systems designed to ensure fulfillment of virtual reality-based objectives (VROs) in the laboratory and classroom. A fusion of inquiry-focused learning strategies such as problem-based learning and virtual reality modules will improve virtual reality usage and student outcomes. Exploration of problem-based learning, potential uses, and limitations of virtual reality technology as well as the health hazards associated with integrating immersive virtual reality in STEM courses will be highlighted.

M. Flinders Petrie \u2013 a renowned British Egyptologist and pioneer of systematic methodology-to the field of archaeology. I will be focusing more specifically on the ways in which general archaeological practice and thought has changed over time in response to his work, along with briefly recognising and highlighting some of the criticism he has faced both posthumously and during his life\u2013looking particularly at the overshadowing of Margaret Murray and her work as an Egyptologist and archaeologist. It can be argued with a considerable amount of support that \" the whole attitude towards archaeology has undergone a complete change, due in large measure to the work of Flinders Petrie \" (Murray, 1961:9). Some of his most noteworthy contributions include the surveying of prehistoric monuments in order to get a better understanding of their geometry. This led to his accurate survey of Stonehenge at the age of 19, which prompted further work and led to his surveys of the pyramids of Giza. However, Petrie's most influential contribution to archaeology is perhaps his work with predynastic graves in Diospolis Parva, during which time he pioneered a new method of dating known as contextual seriation, and as a result began to teach archaeologists the importance and general need for context within archaeology to provide meaning and purpose.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52926879, "asset_id": 32772383, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 54975239, "first_name": "Heather", "last_name": "Barrass", "domain_name": "york", "page_name": "HeatherBarrass", "display_name": "Heather Barrass", "profile_url": "https://york.academia.edu/HeatherBarrass?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/54975239/16554091/16880063/s65_heather.barrass.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 65166, "name": "Flinders Petrie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Flinders_Petrie?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1030288, "name": "History of Archaeological Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Archaeological_Theory?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 30921906, "title": "Taking Students Outside: Inspiring Exploration in Nature", "created_at": "2017-01-13T22:34:32.668-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30921906/Taking_Students_Outside_Inspiring_Exploration_in_Nature?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_30921906", "summary": "2016 New England Biolabs Passion in Science Award (Mentorship and Advocacy) lecture. \n\n\"Chris works to reinvigorate student\u2019s interest in botany through non-traditional methods in order to reveal the rich biodiversity that often goes unappreciated.

Yet, we know little about the processes involved\u2014that is, the details of students\u2019 understandings and experiences, intersectional differences by race and first-generation-student background, and changes over students\u2019 college careers. Based on students\u2019 narratives, this article addresses these gaps in the literature by developing the concept of pathways to financing college to capture race- and class-based inequalities in the financial, cultural, and social capital students draw on as they navigate college costs and how these resources change over time. We find four pathways: (1) white students whose parents attended college relied on their parents\u2019 financial and cultural capital; (2) white first-generation students initially received financial help from parents, but these resources ran out, leaving a burden on students in the later years of college; (3) black students whose parents attended college pieced together capital from multiple sources, including social capital from parents\u2019 networks; and (4) black and Latina/o first-generation students shouldered the burden themselves. Our qualitative, intersectional, and longitudinal approach sheds new light on the social reproduction of inequalities by documenting inconsistencies in financial, cultural, and social capital provided by parents and counselors throughout students\u2019 college careers and how students lacking such resources often muddle through alone.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3533607, "first_name": "Janice", "last_name": "McCabe", "domain_name": "dartmouth", "page_name": "JaniceMcCabe", "display_name": "Janice McCabe", "profile_url": "https://dartmouth.academia.edu/JaniceMcCabe?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3533607/1214433/13040968/s65_janice.mccabe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12514, "name": "Financial Aid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Financial_Aid?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13339, "name": "Cultural Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Capital?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26879, "name": "Social Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Class?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 295144, "name": "College Costs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College_Costs?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 19320032, "title": "Final Project for ENGL 334W, Technical Writing", "created_at": "2015-12-01T14:00:29.753-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19320032/Final_Project_for_ENGL_334W_Technical_Writing?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_19320032", "summary": "This is a description of the final project given to students.

Although a variety of programmes and promotional campaigns have been organized and promoted by the agencies responsible for handling the organ donation, the number of donors is still at a discouraging level. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the perceptions of younger generation have about organ donation. Random samplings of 387 respondents consisting of undergraduate students at the University of Malaya were selected for this study. The study found that young people's perception was very much influenced by their family members and friends, as well as family history. There is significant difference between mean of gender and willingness towards organ donation and transplantation (t = -2.60, df = 385, p = <.05). The Spearman correlation showed a positive but a weak correlation between the intention of surveyed students towards registering as a donor and their perceptions about organ donation and transplantation (r = .354, p <0.05). In summary, discussions on the issue of organ donation and transplantation should be held regularly in Higher Learning Institutions in order to change the misperception and misconceptions of the younger generation about organ donation and transplantation.\n\nKeyword: Perception, organ donation and transplantation, University of Malaya, younger generation", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39050414, "asset_id": 16559737, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3203048, "first_name": "Hasmah", "last_name": "Zanuddin", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "HasmahZanuddin", "display_name": "Hasmah Zanuddin", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/HasmahZanuddin?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 554406, "first_name": "THAM", "last_name": "JEN SERN", "domain_name": "upm", "page_name": "THAMJENSERN", "display_name": "THAM  JEN SERN", "profile_url": "https://upm.academia.edu/THAMJENSERN?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/554406/199833/6112755/s65_asst._prof._dr._tham.jen_sern.jpg"}, {"id": 36503508, "first_name": "Siti Nur Shahira", "last_name": "Zakaria", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SitiNurShahiraZakaria", "display_name": "Siti Nur Shahira Zakaria", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SitiNurShahiraZakaria?f_ri=102079", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 867, "name": "Perception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perception?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17378, "name": "Organ Donation and Transplantation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organ_Donation_and_Transplantation?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 545681, "name": "University of Malaya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/University_of_Malaya?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 10803954, "title": "APPRAISAL OF RESEARCH METHODOGY COURSE FOR UNDERGRADUATE EDUCATION STUDENTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT", "created_at": "2015-02-15T00:05:49.458-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10803954/APPRAISAL_OF_RESEARCH_METHODOGY_COURSE_FOR_UNDERGRADUATE_EDUCATION_STUDENTS_IMPLICATIONS_FOR_CURRICULUM_DEVELOPMENT?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_10803954", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36641532, "asset_id": 10803954, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26073812, "first_name": "Professor Vivian", "last_name": "Nwogbo", "domain_name": "unizik", "page_name": "NwogboVivianNgozi", "display_name": "Professor Vivian Nwogbo", "profile_url": "https://unizik.academia.edu/NwogboVivianNgozi?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26073812/7244588/8153899/s65_vivian.ngozi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1609, "name": "E-learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/E-learning?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2065, "name": "Research Methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research_Methodology?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4738, "name": "Academic Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Writing?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 18911, "name": "Curriculum Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_Development?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 84032, "name": "Appraisal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Appraisal?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 9616005, "title": "The Courage to Believe in Aristotle's Virtues", "created_at": "2014-12-03T20:40:21.839-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9616005/The_Courage_to_Believe_in_Aristotles_Virtues?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_9616005", "summary": "Many have argued faults stemming from the virtues, and two strong points conveying this are the impossibility of conditional situations, and the possibility of tragic outcomes regardless of a virtuous choice.

The programme emphasizes Electronics, Computing, Instrumentation, Signal and Image Processing, and hopes to produce graduates who can face the medical electronics industry, post graduate and research institutions with confidence.\r\nAdequate background in mathematics is ensured. By restricting the eligibility to students who have studied biology in their plus two program, we can obviate the need for teaching detailed courses on anatomy and physiology. Courses such as artificial organs are best avoided, being subjects highly interdisciplinary in nature\r\nand hence, offered at an UG level, become purely descriptive in nature. I do not, however, say that awareness of these areas is unnecessary. Adequate exposure to such topics can be provided by arranging invited lectures by doctors and researchers working in related areas.

This violation initiates a reexamination of these assumptions, coupled with an attempt to integrate the unexpected experience into the individual\u2019s existing assumptive world (see Park, Mills, & Edmondson, 2010, and Brewin & Holmes, 2003, for reviews).\r\n\r\nResearch also suggests that a highly stressful event disrupts goals (e.g. Smith & Lazarus, 1993), consistent with motivation research (e.g. Ryan & Deci, 2000), postulating that psychological needs directing behavior are in fact driven by goals. Park and her colleagues (e.g.. Park et al., 2010; Park & Folkman, 1997) expanded this notion, positing that an individual\u2019s meaning system comprises goal hierarchies along with central beliefs. \r\n\r\nIt would therefore seem that traumatic events violate this meaning system (assumptive worldviews) consisting of beliefs and goals, resulting in a cognitive reappraisal (meaning making) of the event, which would lead to meaning made (Park, 2010). However, little research has validated this meaning making model of belief and goal violations. \r\n\r\nIn this study, we examine these violations following a highly stressful event. We predict belief and goal violations will be related to (1) one another, and (2) meaning made (change in an individual\u2019s spiritual or philosophical worldviews). We also speculate that this relationship between individuals\u2019 violations and worldview change will be mediated by meaning making.\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n392 undergraduates from an introductory psychology course at the University of Connecticut participated in this study; the majority were female (71.4%) and Caucasian (79.4%); other participants identified as Asian (8.9%), African American (4.8%), multiracial (3.8%), and another racial group (3.9%). \r\n\tStressful event. We asked participants to list their \u201cmost stressful experience\u2026 in the past 2 years\u201d. \r\n\tBelief Violation (BV). Per Park (2008), BV was assessed with five questions following the stem, \u201cWhen you think about how you felt before and after this stressful experience, how much does this occurrence violate your sense\u2026. \u201d (\u201cof the world being fair or just?\u201d; \u201cthat the world is a good and safe place?\u201d; \u201cof being in control of your life?\u201d; \u201cthat God is in control\u201d; and \u201cthat other forces have control in the world?\u201d), answered on a 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale. \r\nGoal Violation (GV). GV was assessed by asking participants to rate how much the \u201cstressful event interfere[d] with [their] ability to accomplish\u201d each of 12 goals (e.g., companionship, social support, self-acceptance, financial security), answered on a 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) scale. This is based on previous work (Park, 2005), previously showing high inter-correlations (Park, 2008).\r\n\tMeaning Making (MM). The Core Beliefs Inventory (CBI; Cann et al., 2010) assessed MM (i.e., the reexamination of an individual\u2019s core beliefs, initiated because of their self-reported salient stressor). The CBI measure nine items of assumptive world disruption on a 1 (not at all) to 6 (a very great degree) scale, following the stem \u201cBecause of the event, I seriously examined\u2026\u201d (e.g. \u201cmy beliefs about my own value or worth as a person\u201d; \u201cthe degree to which I believe that things that happen to people are controllable\u201d).\r\n\tWorldview Change (WC). We asked participants \u201chow much the stressful event changed [their] life philosophy or spiritual or religious life\u201d on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 5 (great changes) as a way of identifying the extent to which meaning was made from the event. In the qualitative complement to this question, participants described their changes. \r\n\r\nResults and Discussion\r\nBoth BV and GV were significantly positively correlated with one another (r = .50, p < .001), and with MM (rs = .60 and .57 respectively, ps < .001). These results are consistent with our hypotheses that violations would be related to distress, initiating or maintaining meaning making. Further, as expected, both BV and GV were correlated with WC (rs = .36 and .33 respectively, ps < .001).  Examples of WC participants reported were that the event taught them that \u201cprayer isn\u2019t the answer to everything\u201d, or that it helped them to \u201cappreciate family more\u201d, typical types of meaning made (see Park, 2010).\r\n\r\nMM was significantly positively correlated (r = .42, p < .001) with WC. Upon entering MM in the regression models with both violations as separate predictors of WC, there was a significant drop in the variance accounted for by both BV and GV (final \u03b2s = .18 and .14 respectively, R2 = .06 and .08 respectively, ps < .001). These results were consistent with our hypotheses suggesting that MM partially mediated the links between violations and meaning made.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nOur results support Park et al.\u2019s (2010) meaning making model: both belief and goal violations were related to distress. These findings corroborate research on assumption violation upon the experience of a traumatic event (Janoff-Bulman, 1992), verifying research on PTSD and post-traumatic growth (PTG; Calhoun & Tedeschi, 2006; Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Foa, Steketee, & Rothbaum, 1989; Janoff-Bulman, 2006; Joseph & Linley, 2008). They also reify that a stressful event also disrupts goals, consistent with our past research (Park, 2008; Park et al., 2008; 2010; Park & Folkman, 1997). \r\n\r\nWe also discovered that meaning making partially mediated the relationship between both belief and goal violations and individuals\u2019 perceived change in their life philosophy. Although these are only preliminary cross-sectional results, they attest to violations of the assumptive world as initiating meaning making, which may result in accommodation of reexamined beliefs into the worldviews and self-concept.\r\n\r\nThese findings have important implications in the treatment of trauma-related stress. They highlight the need for interventions that address the goal violations in addition to the insult to central beliefs and endorse the issue of salience in the perception of everyday stressors as more indicative of stress symptomatology than current diagnostic criteria.\r\n\r\nFuture research might perhaps closely examine the violations, and differentiate between aspects or types,of a salient stressful experience, in order to better understand PTSD, PTG and resilience. Further, when examining goal violations, future research should include measures of perceived efficacy and other associated motivational measures. Future research needs to also longitudinally explore the effects of violations on aspects of wellbeing, and if meaning making mediates the perceived resolution of the stressor.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31218820, "asset_id": 3463306, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3991415, "first_name": "Haikel", "last_name": "Lim", "domain_name": "duke-nus", "page_name": "HaikelLim", "display_name": "Haikel Lim", "profile_url": "https://duke-nus.academia.edu/HaikelLim?f_ri=102079", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3991415/1508477/10801659/s65_haikel.lim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 30291, "name": "Undergraduate Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate_Research?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35686, "name": "Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39858, "name": "Meaning Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Meaning_Making?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 98134, "name": "United States", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_States?f_ri=102079", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102079, "name": "Undergraduate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undergraduate?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 128783, "name": "Stress and coping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stress_and_coping?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 803666, "name": "Belief Violations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belief_Violations?f_ri=102079"}, {"id": 803667, "name": "Goal Violations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Goal_Violations?f_ri=102079"}]}, {"id": 3463278, "title": "Ruminators, being mindful, helps: Mindfulness mediates the link between rumination and help-seeking.", "created_at": "2013-05-04T11:53:05.339-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3463278/Ruminators_being_mindful_helps_Mindfulness_mediates_the_link_between_rumination_and_help_seeking?f_ri=102079", "dom_id": "work_3463278", "summary": "Previous research has suggested that a construct similar to mindfulness might be adaptive for ruminators.
