The version of Christianity they accepted was not the one offered (or imposed) by coastal Tobelo-speaking communities with whom they share kinship and affinal ties, but was brought to the region by the American-based New Tribes Mission. This essay examines the factors and motivations behind this change, and offers an explanation that takes into account local histories, larger political and economic changes, such as deforestation and land encroachment, and the rarely examined topic of missionary methodologies. The Forest Tobelo decision to convert is best understood as an attempt to maintain their distinct identity from coastal communities with whom they have a long history of poor relations; the methods used by the New Tribes Mission made conversion an attractive option at that time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 27785161, "asset_id": 1933030, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2488484, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Duncan", "domain_name": "newark-rutgers", "page_name": "ChristopherDuncan", "display_name": "Christopher Duncan", "profile_url": "https://newark-rutgers.academia.edu/ChristopherDuncan?f_ri=471382", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6995, "name": "Anthropology of Christianity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Christianity?f_ri=471382", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7664, "name": "Religious Conversion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Conversion?f_ri=471382", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=471382", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55426, "name": "Maluku", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maluku?f_ri=471382", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55431, "name": "Eastern Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eastern_Indonesia?f_ri=471382"}, {"id": 136998, "name": "Evangelical missionary networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evangelical_missionary_networks?f_ri=471382"}, {"id": 471382, "name": "Global Religious Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Religious_Change?f_ri=471382"}, {"id": 593896, "name": "Halmahera", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Halmahera?f_ri=471382"}, {"id": 593905, "name": "New Tribes Mission", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Tribes_Mission?f_ri=471382"}, {"id": 593906, "name": "Forest Tobelo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forest_Tobelo?f_ri=471382"}]}, {"id": 6053585, "title": "(2014) Mobile mediators and inbetweener importers: The normalization of strangeness in Muslim Southeast Asia.

In Aceh, for example, did recently arrived Arabs from Aden play key roles in the processes of \"Islamisation?\" While few claim rank outsiders to have been crucial in chapters of significant religious change, in this paper I argue that neither are individuals\u23afalbeit inadequately\u23afdescribed as insiders. Accounts provided by historians done with dissecting the dynamics of religious change note the presence of multi-lingual and mobile mediators, who have been described as \"inbetweeners\", who were adept at importing new ideas\u23afincluding ways of dealing with the divine. Commerce across the Indian Ocean both before and after the rise in European presence centred on ports where being different was normal. Pre-colonial port-cities produced ethnolinguistical \u201ccreole\u201d or \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d communities whose comfort with ethnoreligious diversity is lamentable scarce in present-day South and Southeast Asia. This paper considers the role of \u201cmobile mediators\u201d and \u201cinbetweeners\u201d in the importation of a range of Islamic movements in Thailand. I make suggestions about the personalities and processes through which ideas espoused by Imam Al-Ghazali (1058\u20131111), Sheikh Ahmad Ibn Idris (1760-1837), and Muhammad \u2018Abduh (1849-1905) become known in Thai/Malay Peninsula. I describe the contributions and discuss the identity of local luminaries including Shaykh Ahmad al-Fatani, Ishmael Lutfi Japakiya, Direk Kulsriswasd, and Conrad Laurens Coolen to the spread of mystical, modernist, reformist, and revivalist Christian and Muslim movements.
