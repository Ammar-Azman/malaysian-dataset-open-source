Focusing on the semantic domain of emotions, this study offers insights into how creole languages select and organize semantic meanings, and to what extent this results in lexical loss or retention. I spell out the exact nature of the lexical resemblances between the two languages, and highlight major differences as well. The conclusions of the study are twofold. Firstly, I show that the Barunga Kriol emotion lexicon shares a great many properties with the Dalabon emotion lexicon. As a result, speakers in Barunga Kriol and Dalabon respectively are often able to package meaning in very similar ways: the two languages offer comparable means of describing events in the world. From that point of view, language shift can be considered to have a lesser impact. Secondly, I show that the lexical resemblances between Barunga Kriol and Dalabon are not limited to simple cases where the lexemes in each language share the same forms and/or meanings. Instead, lexical resemblances relate to a number of other properties in semantics and combinatorics, and I devise a preliminary typology of these 2 lexical resemblances. Beyond the comparison between Barunga Kriol and Dalabon, this typology may tentatively serve as a grid to evaluate lexical resemblances between languages more generally.", "downloadable_attachments":

A review of the processes through which Islam became an authentically Southeast Asian religion suggests that this merit-making conundrum is a recent example of the adoption and adaptation of Indic terms by Southeast Asian Muslims. These were central to the creation of Islamicate cultures. The concepts Indic and Islamicate are capable of pushing through conceptual cul-de-sacs such as syncretism and shared cosmologies. In addition to the specific generation of merit erroneously assumed as its only meaning, the article reveals that tham bun also denotes undifferentiated religious actions, and is code for a range of feasts unrelated to merit-making. It argues that the co-option of tham bun by Thai-speaking Muslims is an example of a search for equivalents. It also suggests the presence of an authentically Islamic economy of merit in Southern Thailand, confirming Islam\u2019s ability to speak the language of Indic Southeast Asians and to scratch where they itch.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33426080, "asset_id": 6703689, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher",

1931, the Soviet architect Ivan Il\u2019ich Leonidov was sent 2,800km northeast of Moscow to help to design the Soviet Union\u2019s new arctic port, Igarka: a pioneering something, inscribed into the vast nothing of Northern Siberia; that, anyway, is how the act was represented.  The Igarka region was, however, traditional territory of the indigenous, isolate Ket language, which is entirely unrelated to the Indo-European family that dominates architectural discourse.  Ket is spoken today \u2013 to any degree of fluency \u2013 by fewer than 70 people.  When it is used to represent an interpretation of architecture, the structures by which it organises experience, the distinctions it inscribes into the landscape, the specific relationships it establishes between facets of reality \u2013 the selections, in other words, that it makes in encoding information \u2013 are as with all languages, unique.  Yet until 2013, academic discussion of Leonidov\u2019s fantastical, utopian architecture had never taken place in the medium of the Ket language.  This is an omission.  What alternative insight might be overlooked?\nLeonidov\u2019s City of the Sun itself evades certain definition, provoking multiple and irreconcilable interpretations: the obscure drawings of which it is comprised do not show a fixed vision for which to aim, but intricate us in the perpetuated contestation of what the future could, or should, be.  The City is an invitation to cant.  If it be utopia, it is utopia not as destination, but as fractious, negotiated journey.  This same irresolvability emerges in the act of translation, which as a research practice is my attempt to enact Leonidov\u2019s proposed leap into a void of constant, productive uncertainty \u2013 to destabilise any ossified perspective or assumptions when approaching his work.  Or to perpetually attempt to.  This paper exposes some of the shards that have resulted from a collision provoked between Ivan Leonidov\u2019s City of the Sun, and the grammar of Ket.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38132334, "asset_id": 13808659, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3294836, "first_name": "N", "last_name": "Drofiak", "domain_name": "westengland", "page_name": "NDrofiak", "display_name": "N Drofiak", "profile_url": "https://westengland.academia.edu/NDrofiak?f_ri=150106", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3294836/16781373/36052030/s65_n.drofiak.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=150106", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=150106", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4498, "name": "Utopian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Utopian_Studies?f_ri=150106", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4972, "name": "Psycholinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psycholinguistics?f_ri=150106", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5974, "name": "Linguistic Relativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Relativity?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 7655, "name": "Architectural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_History?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 9733, "name": "Siberia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Siberia?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 11370, "name": "Na-Dene languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Na-Dene_languages?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 20165, "name": "Den\u00e9-Yeniseian Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dene-Yeniseian_Linguistics?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 20200, "name": "Yeniseian Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yeniseian_Languages?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 24360, "name": "Culture in the Soviet Union", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_in_the_Soviet_Union?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 24907, "name": "Sapir-Whorf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sapir-Whorf?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 26138, "name": "Utopianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Utopianism?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 33893, "name": "Experimental Psycholinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experimental_Psycholinguistics?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 49043, "name": "Utopia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Utopia?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 63148, "name": "Paper Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paper_Architecture?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 93969, "name": "Cognitive Psycholinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_Psycholinguistics?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 108699, "name": "Soviet Design and Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Design_and_Architecture?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 127039, "name": "Siberian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Siberian_Studies?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 150106, "name": "Linguistic Relativity in Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Relativity_in_Translation?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 154521, "name": "Projection", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Projection?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 231551, "name": "Ket Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ket_Language?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 277272, "name": "Benjamin Lee Whorf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Benjamin_Lee_Whorf?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 505489, "name": "Russian and Soviet art and culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_and_Soviet_art_and_culture?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 505767, "name": "Yeniseian linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yeniseian_linguistics?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 709239, "name": "History of Soviet Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Soviet_Architecture?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 834540, "name": "Soviet and Post-soviet Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_and_Post-soviet_Architecture?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 1084930, "name": "Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sapir-Whorf_Hypothesis?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 1225849, "name": "Soviet Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soviet_Architecture?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 1345818, "name": "Thinking for Speaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thinking_for_Speaking?f_ri=150106"}, {"id": 1461589, "name": "Ivan Leonidov", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ivan_Leonidov?f_ri=150106"}]}]
