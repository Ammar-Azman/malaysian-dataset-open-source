However, disagreement remains between archaeologists and art historians as to the precise dating of this shift from prehistory to history. This article focuses on the Dvaravati period and re-evaluates evidence in Thai and Western language publications. A growing number of sites excavated over the past two decades in particular show occupation from c. the fourth to fifth century onwards while others provide a continual sequence stretching back well into the Iron Age. I argue that evidence from these sites makes a strong case for postulating a proto-Dvaravati period spanning c. the fourth to fifth centuries. In doing so this article proposes this period as the timeframe within which the nascent traits and characteristics of what becomes Dvaravati in the seventh to ninth centuries are present and gradually developing.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51879447, "asset_id": 31537878, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 958, "name": "Historical Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 35103493, "title": "Monastery, Monument, Museum: Sites and Artifacts of Thai Cultural Memory.

Eschewing issues of dating, style, and iconography, historian Maurizio Peleggi addresses distinct types of artifacts and artworks as both the products and vehicles of cultural memory. From the temples of Chiangmai to the Emerald Buddha, from the National Museum of Bangkok to the prehistoric culture of Northeast Thailand, and from the civic monuments of the 1930s to the political artworks of the late twentieth century, even well-known artworks and monuments reveal new meanings when approached from this perspective.\nPart I, \u201cSacred Geographies,\u201d focuses on the premodern era, when religious credence informed the cultural alteration of landscape, and devotional sites and artifacts, including visual representation of the Buddhist cosmology, were created. Part II, \u201cAntiquities and National History,\u201d covers the 1830s through the 1970s, when antiquarianism, and eventually archaeology, emerged and developed in the kingdom, partly the result of a shift in the elites\u2019 worldview and partly a response to colonial and neocolonial projects of knowledge. Part III, \u201cDiscordant Mnemoscapes,\u201d deals with civic monuments and artworks that anchor memory of twentieth-century political events and provide stages for both their commemoration and counter-commemoration by evoking the country\u2019s embattled political present.\n\nMonastery, Monument, Museum shows us how cultural memory represents a kind of palimpsest, the result of multiple inscriptions, reworkings, and manipulations over time. The book will be a rewarding read for historians, art historians, anthropologists, and Buddhism scholars working on Thailand and Southeast Asia generally, as well as for academic and general readers with an interest in memory and material culture.\n\nhttp://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-9828-9780824866068.aspx\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54964956, "asset_id": 35103493, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62407, "first_name": "Maurizio", "last_name": "Peleggi", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "MaurizioPeleggi", "display_name": "Maurizio Peleggi", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/MaurizioPeleggi?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62407/17746/28527148/s65_maurizio.peleggi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2570, "name": "Religion and Thai Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_and_Thai_Culture?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6733, "name": "Buddhist Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 432635, "name": "Heritage Conservation Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Conservation_Thailand?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 791595, "name": "Thailandia Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailandia_Art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 16804584, "title": "\"The Plot of Thai Art History: Buddhist Sculpture and the Myth of National Origins.\" A Sarong for Clio, Chap. 4 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University SEAP Publications, 2015)", "created_at": "2015-10-14T18:40:01.168-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16804584/_The_Plot_of_Thai_Art_History_Buddhist_Sculpture_and_the_Myth_of_National_Origins_A_Sarong_for_Clio_Chap_4_Ithaca_NY_Cornell_University_SEAP_Publications_2015_?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_16804584", "summary": "Uncorrected proofs--NOT FOR CITATION.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39192176, "asset_id": 16804584, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62407, "first_name": "Maurizio", "last_name": "Peleggi", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "MaurizioPeleggi", "display_name": "Maurizio Peleggi", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/MaurizioPeleggi?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62407/17746/28527148/s65_maurizio.peleggi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42044, "name": "Archaeology of India and South East Asia Based on Buddhism,religious History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_India_and_South_East_Asia_Based_on_Buddhism_religious_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 98845, "name": "Southeast Asian Culture History, Theravada Buddhism, Thai Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Culture_History_Theravada_Buddhism_Thai_Language?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 327417, "name": "Buddhism, Thai studies, Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism_Thai_studies_Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 43958021, "title": "Traumatised Topologies: An Examination of Map Art And The Revealed Psychic Subjectivities of War Trauma and States of Alienation", "created_at": "2020-08-26T17:11:04.530-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43958021/Traumatised_Topologies_An_Examination_of_Map_Art_And_The_Revealed_Psychic_Subjectivities_of_War_Trauma_and_States_of_Alienation?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_43958021", "summary": "This thesis examines certain map art and mapping projects by Tiffany Chung, Tintin Wulia and MAP Office within a framework called \u201ctraumatised topologies\u201d and shows how these three artists counter-map by layering onto their map art specific psychic \u201csubjectivities\u201d related to two geographical constructs: (1) war-related trauma as experienced by survivors as depicted within war-torn topologies and battle zones of the Vietnam War;

With respect to Malaysia and Indonesia, scholars have rightly focused on traditional and contemporary forms of wayang (shadow theatre) as a form of satire\u2014particularly through Semar, the clown (variously named). In comparison, there is relatively little scholarship about satire in other forms of contemporary theatre, notably urban. In addition to the dominance of wayang in theatre scholarship about Malaysia and Indonesia, several dominant narratives may be said to exist, with attendant assumptions about audiences and censorship such that their relations might best be described as a \u2018push me, pull you\u2019 negotiation; a kind of \u2018back and forth-ing\u2019 or \u2018tugging\u2019 of negotiation and exchange that belies the eye, occupying different territory yet occurring within the same space. This paper has two parts; the first will present dominant narratives and then argue that existing \u2018counter-narratives\u2019 serve to challenge those narratives as norms.

A second visit (late December 1898 to March 1899) provided another opportunity for him to record observations. The musical instruments he collected are now in the Ethnology collection (Department of Anthropology) of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. The information presented here adds to the relatively few 19th-century primary sources for the ethnography and music of southern Thailand. This article also notes similarities between some of these village instruments and the elaborately decorated but structurally similar ones produced under royal patronage for the Thai court, represented within the same Smithsonian collection by other musical instruments received as royal gifts from Thai monarchs.

Yet for both Thais and Americans these gifts truly are historic, artistic, and scientific treasures, through which the Kings of Thailand represented their nation, and its alliances with America through time. Nearly all sets of gifts, from the courtly nielloware, silks, musical instruments and weapons to the everyday basketry, tools, agricultural samples and fish traps, were accompanied by a Royal Letter listing the contents of the gift (in Thai and English), and explaining its significance. This catalog introduces those Royal Letters and their lists, for the first time, into the interpretation of the gifts. This book will interest art-, social-, and diplomatic historians; anthropologists, linguists, and ethnomusicologists; students of Thai theater and culture; and all those who will appreciate the aesthetic quality of the gift objects or the very good stories those objects were meant to tell.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57000760, "asset_id": 37050144, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12785, "name": "History of International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Relations?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 924450, "name": "Thai Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 36829967, "title": "Art in Traditional Societies [chapter in \"Visual Art\" volume, \"Indonesian Heritage\" series]", "created_at": "2018-06-12T08:00:40.220-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36829967/Art_in_Traditional_Societies_chapter_in_Visual_Art_volume_Indonesian_Heritage_series_?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_36829967", "summary": "[Book chapter:] Pp. 22-23 (+ integrated photo credits, p. 144) in: \"Visual Art\" ed. by Dr. Hilda Soemantri [vol. 7 in series:] \"Indonesian Heritage\" (Sian Jay, General Editor).  Singapore & Jakarta:  Editions Didier Millet. 1998. \r\n= = = = = = \r\n     In traditional societies of Indonesia, there is little or no art for art's sake. Instead, we can say that beauty (aesthetics) follows function, because the aesthetic quality of an object helps it carry out its function. Traditional artists from throughout Indonesia have imbued functional objects - those made for purposes other than being aesthetically pleasing - with aesthetic value. Yet it is difficult to identify any traditional Indonesian object that was made solely as 'art ', that is: to elicit an aesthetic response. \r\n     Indonesia 's traditional artworks often embody remarkable aesthetic uses and modifications of materials, and today many are recognised as great works of art with high art-market values. Yet, deciding whether particular objects are 'works of art' (let alone separating 'art' from 'craft') is only problematic for art markets or museums. These questions do not correspond to the thinking that originally created the objects, and these distinctions have never been important to the artists.\r\n     Throughout Indonesia, we find strong emphasis on the divinely regulated or moral aspects of aesthetics and the notion that violation of these canons will negate the social function of the object. Rather than creating a functional object then adding decorations, the maker includes the decorations as fundamental elements of an object - the absence of which would impair its ability to function.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56781894, "asset_id": 36829967, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 808, "name": "Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16903, "name": "Traditional Crafts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_Crafts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 25370, "name": "Contemporary Indigenous Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Indigenous_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 29906, "name": "Craft Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Craft_Theory?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 36130, "name": "Prehistoric And Tribal Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prehistoric_And_Tribal_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 43613, "name": "Craft", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Craft?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 53409, "name": "Arts and Crafts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_and_Crafts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 65038, "name": "Tribal studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tribal_studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 250543, "name": "Primitive Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primitive_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 475178, "name": "Anthropology of Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Aesthetics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1000113, "name": "Indigenous Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Visual_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 37943433, "title": "' Lost Kingdoms.

While its inclusion in prestigious international exhibitions and recognition from various award-giving bodies might suggest that video art is now part of mainstream contemporary art practices in the Philippines, this thesis asserts that it still remains very much on the periphery. These global turns have served to highlight the current dearth of art historical scholarship on video art from the Philippines. This study therefore seeks to shed light on the following key questions:  1) How did video art emerge in the Philippines? 2) How is it being supported locally? 3) How can it continue to develop in the future?  \n\n\tThrough primary interviews with key contemporary artists and curators who have consistently worked with the medium of video, this thesis traces video art\u2019s emergence from the alternative visual cultures of experimental film and conceptual art from the late 1990s till the present.  It also analyzes the ecosystem supporting video art to identify the factors that have fueled Philippine video art\u2019s successes or served to limit its wider acceptance amongst local audiences. \n\n\tOver the past 20 years, video has been used in various ways to reflect not just social issues but also to explore notions of time and space, memory and identity, performativity and process. Video art\u2019s development over this period was sustained by the established educative and commercial infrastructure for film and visual arts, as well as financial and organizational support provided by public and private institutions. On the other hand, video art\u2019s wider appreciation by audiences was challenged by the local market\u2019s continued preference for painting and concerns on the medium\u2019s reproducibility, the economic and logistical difficulties of organizing dedicated video art exhibitions, and the absence of an institution to drive archiving and research initiatives. \n\n\tIn light of these structural challenges, what can the future be for video art in the Philippines?  Can these \u201cinterruptions\u201d even be overcome?  Recent initiatives by artists and independent curators suggest that the path towards this future must first be grounded in the past. Such artist-run initiatives can become the common ground by which the various players in the ecosystem might piece together the origins of video art, from anecdotes of lost files and past exhibitions, and begin to build the discourse that will sustain its future. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57207769, "asset_id": 37255034, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59768073, "first_name": "Lourdes", "last_name": "Samson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LourdesAbelaSamson", "display_name": "Lourdes A Samson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LourdesAbelaSamson?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/59768073/15593170/18664947/s65_lourdes.abela-samson.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6100, "name": "Video Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 42298, "name": "Film and Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_and_Media_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2199773, "name": "Philippine Contemporary Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Contemporary_Arts?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19449983, "title": "The Artists Village and the birth of contemporary art in Singapore- Koh Nguang How in conversation with Iola Lenzi", "created_at": "2015-12-04T00:32:13.881-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19449983/The_Artists_Village_and_the_birth_of_contemporary_art_in_Singapore_Koh_Nguang_How_in_conversation_with_Iola_Lenzi?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_19449983", "summary": "2014.

Relatively unknown in the West, the outer islands include all of Indonesia's islands except Java (including nearby Madura) and Bali, the better-known inner islands that border the Java sea. \r\n\r\nThrough the chapters of this book, the reader will travel from Nias in the far west to Irian Jaya in the east, encountering artworks that are exemplars of indigenous Indonesian aesthetics as well as masterpieces as defined by a Western collector's aesthetic. These works and the accompanying discussions will also introduce the peoples who produce them. Throughout this region, art links village life with the supernatural; it honors ancestors, cements alliances, affirms political power, social rank and kin relationships, and, of course, it simultaneously surrounds with beauty the peoples who create it. Yet each regional style presents topics and problems peculiar to it. The format of this presentation will allow readers to understand the similarity as well as the diversity, finding in the art of each region recurring themes and styles that reflect the closely related histories of the peoples and the similar purposes for which all Indonesians create art.\r\n= = = = =\r\n\r\nNote:  Book is out of print; available from used-book dealers, e.g.: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sts=t&cm_sp=SearchF-_-home-_-Results&an=taylor&tn=beyond+the+java+sea&kn=&isbn=\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57080326, "asset_id": 36715193, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1386, "name": "Art Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Theory?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 55426, "name": "Maluku", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maluku?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 181544, "name": "Papua", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Papua?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 188347, "name": "Sulawesi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sulawesi?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 220936, "name": "Nusa Tenggara", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nusa_Tenggara?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 221325, "name": "Sumatra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sumatra?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 231304, "name": "Melanesian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melanesian_studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 604747, "name": "West Papua - Irian Jaya - Indigenous and Nationalistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Papua_-_Irian_Jaya_-_Indigenous_and_Nationalistic_Anthropology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 862905, "name": "Modern Indonesian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Indonesian_art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1341641, "name": "Indonesian Visual Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Visual_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1522903, "name": "Dongson Bronze Drum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dongson_Bronze_Drum?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 36442437, "title": "Revisiting the Bujang Valley: A Southeast Asian entrep\u00f4t complex on the maritime trade route", "created_at": "2018-04-19T03:02:27.610-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36442437/Revisiting_the_Bujang_Valley_A_Southeast_Asian_entrep%C3%B4t_complex_on_the_maritime_trade_route?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_36442437", "summary": "In the early 1830s and 1840s, a British colonial official by the name of Colonel James Low uncovered evidence for an early culture with Indic traits in a river system known as the Bujang Valley. On the west coast of the Thai-Malay peninsula, the Bujang Valley is today located in the Malaysian state of Kedah. However, it wasn't until just before World War II that excavations took place, conducted by H. G. Quaritch Wales and his wife Dorothy. Their discoveries and subsequent publications led to the first real attempts to explain the origins and extent of this civilisation and its place within the larger South and Southeast Asian world. In the intervening years between Quaritch Wales's excavations and the present day, considerably more research has taken place within the Bujang Valley, though this has not been without controversy. Recently claims and counter-claims regarding the antiquity of Hinduism and Buddhism at the site have arisen in some quarters within Malaysia. It therefore seems pertinent that this material be re-evaluated in light of new scholarship and discoveries as well as the prevailing paradigms of interactions between South and Southeast Asia. This paper presents an updated reading of this material and argues that the Bujang Valley should be seen as a cosmopolitan trading port with substantive evidence for the presence of Hinduism and Buddhism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56356839, "asset_id": 36442437, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 113, "name": "Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhism?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 114, "name": "Hinduism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hinduism?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6888, "name": "Indian Ocean History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 65544, "name": "Indian Ocean Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 770848, "name": "Malaysian archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_archaeology?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 38686077, "title": "Chapter 9: Metrology and Metal Analysis of the Kushana, Gupta and Western Kshatrapa coinage, from the book 'Treasures of the Gupta Empire'", "created_at": "2019-04-01T13:59:18.593-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38686077/Chapter_9_Metrology_and_Metal_Analysis_of_the_Kushana_Gupta_and_Western_Kshatrapa_coinage_from_the_book_Treasures_of_the_Gupta_Empire?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_38686077", "summary": "Chapter 9 from the book is provided here to researchers and scholars for easy reference.

The book lays emphasis on the mobile networks of human agents ('Masters'), textual sources ('Texts') and images ('Icons') through which Esoteric Buddhist traditions spread.\n\nCapitalising on recent research and making use of both disciplinary and area-focused perspectives, this book highlights the role played by Esoteric Buddhist maritime networks in shaping intra-Asian connectivity. In doing so, it reveals the limits of a historiography that is premised on land-based transmission of Buddhism from a South Asian 'homeland', and advances an alternative historical narrative that overturns the popular perception regarding Southeast Asia as a 'periphery' that passively received overseas influences. Thus, a strong point is made for the appreciation of the region as both a crossroads and rightful terminus of Buddhist cults, and for the re-evaluation of the creative and transformative force of Southeast Asian agents in the transmission of Esoteric Buddhism across mediaeval Asia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48678806, "asset_id": 28345616, "asset_type": "Work",

"This is one of the first texts on developments of contemporary Performance Art in Indonesia, as well as an in-depth critical reading of the 9th Jakarta Biennial. The original abstract to my dissertation (2011) is incredibly inadequate and inaccurate (see below). The main and overarching  issues in this dissertation contend with critical analyses and arguments of  'contemporary' art - how seni kontemporer was discussed and defined in Indonesian art discourses and practices 1973-1990s. The Pivotal object that serves as a catalyst is the curatorial premise, exhibition event, international network, and art works associated with 9th Jakarta Biennial. \r\n\r\nKey terms and themes:\r\nPerformance and installation art in Indonesia 1970's-1990s\r\nExhibition Histories\r\nJakarta Biennial IX (9th Jakarta Biennial, 1993)\r\nCritique of Jakarta Biennial IX\r\nJim Supangkat\r\nSanento Yuliman\r\nNew Order cultural policy\r\nIssues of a postmodernism in an Indonesian discourse\r\nSeni Eksperimental / Seni Alternatif\r\nArtists and artist groups under discussion include:\r\nSumber Waras, Marintan Sirait, Andar Manik, Arahmaiani, Semsar Siahaan, Krisna Murti, FX Harsono, Moelyono, Heri Dono, Pameran Eksperimental (Binal), Jeprut, Tisna Sanjaya, Isa Perkasa, Nandang Gawe, Wawan Hussin, Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru Indonesia, Kelompok Lima.\r\n\r\nOriginal abstract: I offer a history and genealogy of concepts of critical artistic practice, examining to what purpose strategies of a contemporary art have been put and from what conditions they emerged. I examine how these have been interpreted to possess criticality in Indonesia. Taking the controversial curatorial essay published for the 9th Jakarta Biennale of Art (1993) as a catalyst rather than as a point of reference, I rethink the possibility and value of a construct of an avant-garde and postmodern in seni rupa kontemporer.I propose a kind of avant-garde without modernism\u2019s tradition of transgressive poetics. The mode of marginality I have in mind is a critical position possible only on this side of the political sea change and depoliticization of the cultural field in Indonesia after 1965. This entails tracing shifting notions of art\u2019s and artistic autonomy, which were largely dependent upon the relation art had with politics and the spheres in which artistic practice was seen to reside. My argument for a kind of pascamodernisme (postmodernism) in contemporary art in Indonesia posits its position also as one of a critical marginality, whose experiences with modernity are specific and distinct from those of the Euro-North-American context. I argue that a pascamodernisme in contemporary art articulates critical artistic practice as a postcolonial critique of modernity-as-development, and the mutilating forces of modernization. A key aspect in this discussion is those practices that sought to assume alternative traditions, realities, and futures within modernity. In this regard, an important subtext is notions of collaborative work and the artist as members of artists\u2019 collectives and collaborative type of work as a primary and critical artistic solution. I am interested in those artistic collaborative and collective projects that helped to establish installation and performance art into art-historical categories in Indonesia, and whose activities and projects have had a discernible impact on the development of seni rupa kontemporer and how it would be defined vis-\u00e0-vis the terms and concepts generated by them.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2681289, "first_name": "Amanda Katherine", "last_name": "Rath", "domain_name": "uni-frankfurt", "page_name": "AmandaKatherineRathPhD", "display_name": "Amanda Katherine  Rath", "profile_url": "https://uni-frankfurt.academia.edu/AmandaKatherineRathPhD?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2681289/909597/13704209/s65_amanda_katherine.rath.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 261663, "name": "Indonesian contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_contemporary_art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 341695, "name": "Exhibition Histories", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exhibition_Histories?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 727416, "name": "Concepts of Modernism and Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Concepts_of_Modernism_and_Postmodernism?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 998284, "name": "Southeast Asia Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1985269, "name": "Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gerakan_Seni_Rupa_Baru?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 4095378, "name": "Performance Art Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Art_Indonesia?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 37646744, "title": "Terminologies of \"Modern\" and \"Contemporary\" \"Art\" in Southeast Asia's Vernacular Languages", "created_at": "2018-10-25T04:23:06.555-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37646744/Terminologies_of_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art_in_Southeast_Asias_Vernacular_Languages?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_37646744", "summary": "This research report offers introductory accounts of the terminologies of \"modern\" and \"contemporary\" \"art\" in nine Southeast Asian languages.

There are many discrepancies in the nature of these nine languages, as well as in the sources available on them, and the style, tone and scope of each author\u2019s contribution.

The circumstances of the Visnu\u2019s rediscovery in the early 1950s, as well as its subsequent \u201crestoration\u201d and preservation at Wat Dong Sak, are examined through reappraisal of documentary evidence, new field reconnaissance, interviews of local residents, and systematic examination of the sculpture itself. Detailed stylistic analysis and conjectural reconstruction of the sculpture\u2019s original appearance place the image within the broader development of the mitred Visnu iconographic type known from sites throughout Southeast Asia. With particular emphasis on the details of the headdress and garment, specific comparisons are made to related sculpture from Thailand, Arakan (Myanmar), Preangkorian Cambodia, and the Cham civilization of Vietnam. The Phong Tuek Visnu\u2019s idiosyncratic features and geographically dispersed stylistic relationships suggest a probable early 8th century date following the mid-to-late 7th century expansion of Khmer elites out of the Kampong Thom area of Cambodia.

Its development cannot be viewed as separate from a global phenomenon nor from a local one for it is on one hand circumscribed by global aesthetic trends and on the other by local socio-economic developments. Its consecration also took place in tandem with the State\u2019s effort to develop a global arts industry such that it is difficult to map a local stylistic discourse without reference to a global context.

The thirty-two essays that make this book unfold many layers of the temples\u2019 imagery, taking a broad view and traversing religious, cultural, and temporal boundaries. While a majority of these are rooted in India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tibet, Nepal, Cambodia, and Vietnam also figure prominently.\nPreceded by valuable insights into M.A. Dhaky\u2019s encyclopaedic writings, the volume is configured along six sub-themes inspired by his contributions to the discipline. These include the architectonics of temples, their varied materials and milieus, stylistics, patronage and transregional connections; studies of architectural elements in culture-specific contexts; inter-relationships between sculpture and architecture in the temple\u2019s larger narrative; the embodiment of cult icons; other, non-cultic manifestations on the temple; ritual observances and performance traditions. Several of the essays move in and out of M.A. Dhaky\u2019s writings, building upon themes addressed by him, extending his methods to newer materials, regions, and time-frames, and charting fresh paths that extend the orbit of temple studies. \nScholars and interested readers will find in this volume a thoughtful and cohesive collection of the most recent and insightful research on art historical aspects of South and Southeast Asian temples by the finest minds engaged in the field.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42691612, "asset_id": 21508057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 43083580, "asset_id": 21508057, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4623270, "first_name": "gerd", "last_name": "mevissen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "gerdmevissen", "display_name": "gerd mevissen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/gerdmevissen?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4623270/1933634/2288500/s65_gerd.mevissen.jpg"}, {"id": 332132, "first_name": "Parul Pandya", "last_name": "Dhar", "domain_name": "du-in", "page_name": "ParulPandyaDhar", "display_name": "Parul Pandya  Dhar", "profile_url": "https://du-in.academia.edu/ParulPandyaDhar?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/332132/521279/29795141/s65_parul_pandya.dhar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 24047, "name": "Indian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 512813, "name": "Indian Temple Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Temple_Architecture?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 973406, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Temple Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Temple_Architecture?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 72986218, "title": "Recasting Tradition- materials, heritage and the everyday as critical devices of Southeast Asian Contemporary art.

published as 'The Photographic Conditions of Contemporary Thai Art', in the Taipei Fine Arts Museum Journal, no. 34, 2017.***\r\nThis paper takes as a point of departure, Rosalind Krauss\u2019 essay \u2018The Photographic Conditions of Surrealism\u2019, in which she describes the relationship between photography\u2019s indexical function and its position as the example par excellence of Surrealist artistic practice. In the same way, this paper examines changing attitudes in Thailand towards photography\u2019s artistic status and presumed indexicality as paradigmatic examples of a transformation from the modern to the contemporary. Photography\u2019s crucial role in this shift is located in key alterations to the medium\u2019s functions and perceptions of its artistic legitimacy. On the one hand, the acceptance of photography as an art form reflects developments in imbricated networks of legitimation, occurring with the rise of international education and exhibition opportunities in the post-Cold War period. On the other hand, the conditions of photography itself, or rather its ontology, produce a conceptualisation of the contemporary as manifested in a desire for proximity with difference. In examining works by a number of contemporary Thai artists, I argue that photography\u2019s visualisation of the \u2018optical unconscious\u2019  allows one to fulfil this desire for contemporaneity, while also pointing to the limits of representation as a means of asserting coevality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57027049, "asset_id": 35105104, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 793098, "first_name": "Clare", "last_name": "Veal", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "ClareVeal", "display_name": "Clare Veal", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/ClareVeal?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/793098/270230/2185437/s65_clare.veal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1589, "name": "Photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Photography?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7513, "name": "Archives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archives?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45994, "name": "Biennales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biennales?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 924450, "name": "Thai Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 4199018, "title": "R\u0101k\u1e63asas and puru\u1e63am\u1e5bgas in the South-Western Corner of the Air\u0101vate\u015bvara Temple at Darasuram", "created_at": "2013-08-08T06:44:32.938-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4199018/R%C4%81k%E1%B9%A3asas_and_puru%E1%B9%A3am%E1%B9%9Bgas_in_the_South_Western_Corner_of_the_Air%C4%81vate%C5%9Bvara_Temple_at_Darasuram?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_4199018", "summary": "The design of the south-western corner of the Air\u0101vate\u015bvara Temple at Darasuram, Tamil Nadu, reveals a few unusual features, which seem to indicate its specific treatment in accordance with the dreadful character of the south-western direction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31693683, "asset_id": 4199018, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3341677, "first_name": "Corinna", "last_name": "Wessels-Mevissen", "domain_name": "institutfutur", "page_name": "CorinnaWesselsMevissen", "display_name": "Corinna Wessels-Mevissen", "profile_url": "https://institutfutur.academia.edu/CorinnaWesselsMevissen?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3341677/1119343/104671230/s65_corinna.wessels-mevissen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3389, "name": "Indian studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80929, "name": "Hindu temples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hindu_temples?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 44499399, "title": "The Project of Nationalism: Celebrating the Centenary in the Philippines Contemporary Art", "created_at": "2020-11-14T07:14:17.962-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44499399/The_Project_of_Nationalism_Celebrating_the_Centenary_in_the_Philippines_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_44499399", "summary": "Surveying and critiquing the projects that was played out for the Philippines' centenary in 1998, Labrador observes the mainly literal and hackneyed renderings of nationalism and national identity.

tradition, temporality and an image of the nation in the neo-traditional art of post-socialist Laos. Looking at modern Lao art in the long 20th century, the article highlights that the references to tradition were continuously used in imagining Lao modernity. Colonial, aspiring capitalist, socialist and post-socials modernities were subsequently naturalised as Lao through their application to local cultural heritage and Buddhist conceptions. Post-socials condition in Laos, in turn, has an additional engagement with temporality. The socialist party is in need of re-legitimising its rule since its promise of building the socialist future is no longer viable. The re-legitimising motivation of the party also precludes its critical engagement with the countries' modern history. In this context, neo-traditional art promoted at the state-sponsored exhibitions allows for imagining the Lao nation as out of time. Rendering the nation as a festive multi-ethnic village in perpetual celebration of cultural tradition, the neo-traditional art of post-socialist Laos removes both the future and the historical part of the nation from sight. Furthermore , using the allegory of woman and vista for the nation, the neo-traditional art constructs the image of the Mother-Land as gendered and passive, justifying the masculine rule over it.\n\nThe article is available at Open Access of Project Muse at https://muse.jhu.edu/article/752968/pdf ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62904823, "asset_id": 42693456, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62890533, "first_name": "Anna", "last_name": "Koshcheeva", "domain_name": "cornell", "page_name": "AnnaKoshcheeva", "display_name": "Anna Koshcheeva", "profile_url": "https://cornell.academia.edu/AnnaKoshcheeva?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62890533/18472227/18433355/s65_anna.koscheeva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 181377, "name": "Laos, southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_southeast_Asia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 376988, "name": "Lao Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lao_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 472947, "name": "Laos area studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_area_studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1126123, "name": "French Colonial History In Laos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Colonial_History_In_Laos?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1487747, "name": "History of Laos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Laos?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 28519501, "title": "Carving at the Capital: A stone workshop at Harihar\u0101laya, Angkor", "created_at": "2016-09-15T20:49:20.909-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28519501/Carving_at_the_Capital_A_stone_workshop_at_Harihar%C4%81laya_Angkor?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_28519501", "summary": "Between the 9th and 15th centuries CE the builders and artisans of Angkor and its territories furnished their landscapes with thousands of temples and tens of thousands of sacred sculptures, yet the operational behaviour of these craft specialists is little known. This article presents the results of excavations and materials analysis from a centre of sandstone production for the classic period Angkorian city of Harihar\u0101laya and appraises the procurement of raw materials, manufacturing methods, and sites of production for the makers of temples and sculptures. A production site associated with the temple of Bakong was identified by surface remains of sandstone debitage and unfinished sculptures. Excavation revealed a 9th-century building associated with large-scale sandstone waste deposits and another phase of sculpture production in the 12th and 13th centuries. A study of sandstone characterisation was applied to in situ production waste, unfinished sculptures from the workshop, and on completed works. Comparison of samples from the workshop and associated temples with sculptures from Cambodian and international collections suggest the site was likely used as a dump for construction of nearby temples and later to produce images of the gods destined for veneration. Moreover, the workshop was part of a network of craft specialists who sourced many thousands of tons of specific sandstone across the Angkorian landscape.\n\nPolkinghorne, M., Douglas, J..and Car\u00f2, F., 2015. \u201cCarving at the Capital: A stone workshop at Harihar\u0101laya, Angkor\", in Bulletin l\u2019\u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Extr\u00eame-Orient (BEFEO), vol. 101: 55 - 90.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55013143, "asset_id": 28519501, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2604512, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "Polkinghorne", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MartinPolkinghorne", "display_name": "Martin Polkinghorne", "profile_url": "https://flinders.academia.edu/MartinPolkinghorne?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2604512/821657/17093036/s65_martin.polkinghorne.jpg"}, {"id": 6301216, "first_name": "Federico", "last_name": "Car\u00f2", "domain_name": "metmuseum", "page_name": "federicocaro", "display_name": "Federico  Car\u00f2", "profile_url": "https://metmuseum.academia.edu/federicocaro?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6301216/6986720/13008740/s65_federico.caro.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34756383, "title": "Locating the Domestic in Vann Molyvann\u2019s National Sports Complex", "created_at": "2017-10-03T16:59:12.415-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34756383/Locating_the_Domestic_in_Vann_Molyvann_s_National_Sports_Complex?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_34756383", "summary": "Published in \"ABE Journal: Architecture Beyond Europe\" 11 (2017). Special issue \"Paradoxical Southeast Asia\" guest-edited by Caroline Herbelin. Open-access version available free online. \nThis essay concerns the construction and interpretation of post-independence architecture in Cambodia, taking as an exemplary case study the National Stadium in Phnom Penh, completed in 1964 and designed by Vann Molyvann. To date, most accounts of the Stadium\u2014and of Molyvann\u2019s work and modern Cambodian architecture more generally\u2014have emphasized Angkorian stylistic references. Considered historiographically, this focus on the temples of Angkor constructs a narrative which is teleological, and nationally bound. My counter-reading centres instead on the trope of the domestic, which enables greater attention to coeval architectural forms and broader regional intersections. The essay is based in three related approaches to the Stadium, which correspond to three interlinked understandings of the domestic. The first considers the politico-historical context of the building\u2019s construction, proposing the Stadium as emblematic of Cambodia\u2019s policy of Cold War non-alignment, under Prince Sihanouk\u2019s rule.

This mode of independent curating now constitutes an important base for exciting new research\u2014making use of diverse archives as well as other methodologies\u2014to study the often little-known histories of the region's modern arts, including its architecture, cinema, and photography. That such research is taking place in the context of independent contemporary curatorial practice is significant because it locates modern art history largely outside of large and state-funded institutions, including museums and universities, thus enabling the development and proliferation of art historical research in areas of Southeast Asia, including its mainland sub-regions, which have comparatively little funding and official infrastructure for the arts. This article explores the emerging practice of independent curating as (expanded) art history in Southeast Asia, through comparative discussion of three case studies: the Roung Kon Project in Phnom Penh, which researches histories of cinema in Cambodia; the Buddhist Archive of Photography in Luang Prabang, which researches histories of photography in Laos; and Spirit of Friendship in Ho Chi Minh City, which researches histories of artist groups in Vietnam.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63752175, "asset_id": 43445912, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2721218, "first_name": "Roger", "last_name": "Nelson", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "RogerNelson", "display_name": "Roger Nelson", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/RogerNelson?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2721218/876732/1094557/s65_roger.nelson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4950, "name": "Modern Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6815, "name": "Laos (Lao PDR)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_Lao_PDR_?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 7655, "name": "Architectural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 15352, "name": "Historiography  (in Art History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historiography_in_Art_History_?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 20079, "name": "History of photography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_photography?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 22832, "name": "Curatorial Practice (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curatorial_Practice_Art_?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 86123, "name": "Artist Collectives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artist_Collectives?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 182228, "name": "History of Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Cinema?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 546460, "name": "Inter-Asia Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Inter-Asia_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 998980, "name": "Laos and Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Laos_and_Cambodia?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1019477, "name": "Architectural Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architectural_Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1240986, "name": "Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 37255079, "title": "Pondering Religion from a Few Steps Out of It: The Contemporary Art of Norberto Roldan", "created_at": "2018-08-17T20:12:03.796-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37255079/Pondering_Religion_from_a_Few_Steps_Out_of_It_The_Contemporary_Art_of_Norberto_Roldan?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_37255079", "summary": "The multiplicity of religious objects -- crucifixes, priests\u2019 vestments, devotional prayer cards, and carvings of saints-- in Norbert Roldan\u2019s assemblages embody religious meanings that seem to be opposed to prevailing notions of contemporary art. After all, as art historian Joan Kee stresses, \u201cfor art to be contemporary, it must appear to be a product of free will, unmediated by any external power, whether religious or secular in nature.\u201d   In Roldan\u2019s works, the conscious inclusion of religious imagery is not propaganda for heightening spirituality but rather a strategy that draws meaning from these familiar forms to offer new narratives with which the issue of religion in the Philippine context can be viewed. \n\n\tPhilippine art historian Alice Guillermo referred to Roldan as one of the \u201crevolutionary clergy\u201c of the late 1980\u2019s that sought to understand the tension between spirituality at the grassroots level and the doctrines taught by the Catholic Church.   His practice can be seen within postcolonial discourses that seek to make sense of the uneven forces of cultural representation imposed by colonialism.   This paper aims to show that  through an examination of the material culture of Philippine Catholicism and folk spirituality, Roldan\u2019s art reveals the how religion was used as a tool for colonization and also as a form of resistance to Spanish dominance.  By employing a representational strategy based on anthropological displays, Roldan re-contextualizes the objects from their sacred functions, thereby providing the distance necessary, as art historian James Elkins puts it, to \u201cponder religion from a few steps outside of it.\u201d   \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57207823, "asset_id": 37255079, "asset_type": "Work",

the immediate aftermath of the death of Norodom Sihanouk on October 15, 2012, photographic portraits of the King-Father flooded the visual landscape of Cambodia. Photographs were displayed in public places and photo-montages were purchased and shared in markets, pagodas, and streets, and in the aterritorial spaces of the internet, particularly Facebook. The display of portraits of Sihanouk was not just a posthumous phenomenon; however, access to new photographic technologies radically altered the manufacture, sharing, and consumption of images. This article pays particular attention to the photo-posters of collected portraits that circumvented official channels, arguing that beyond just beautifying the king, these portraits became illustrative, didactic expressions of ideal leadership. Digital manipulation of photographs, assembled into montages, resulted in recontextualizations of the figure of Sihanouk, mediated via nostalgia, memory, and socio-political imperatives.",

Bearers of indianized auspicious symbols and deities, these objects are rich in information. An unusual and exceptional amulet showing the abhi\u1e63eka of Gaja-Lak\u1e63m\u012b goddess was recently unearthed at Angkor Borei. This religious theme is very rare for pre-Angkorian Cambodia. The iconographic study reveals an original and syncretic composition combining the Indian theme of \u015ar\u012b-Lak\u1e63m\u012b being anointed with a central element of the old animist aborigenous Khmer tradition, the buffalo sacrifice. A comparative analysis with various examples of depictions of Gaja-Lak\u1e63m\u012b from the Indian Subcontinent and from the Mon Dv\u0101ravat\u012b culture brings some additional data to apprehend this document in its global context. Finally, we can hypothesize that the dating of this item may be related to the first three centuries AD. The issuing of this amulet seems to be a local response to a religious movement affecting the entire indianized world during that early historic period.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57118490, "asset_id": 13321826, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10547873, "first_name": "Guillaume", "last_name": "Epinal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GuillaumeEpinal", "display_name": "Guillaume Epinal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GuillaumeEpinal?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10547873/3191025/8061254/s65_guillaume.epinal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 75663, "name": "Southeast Asian Numismatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Numismatics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 110012, "name": "Indian Archaeology and History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Archaeology_and_History_of_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 122884, "name": "Cambodian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 227736, "name": "Tin Mining and Metallurgy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tin_Mining_and_Metallurgy?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 688895, "name": "Khmer art and architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_art_and_architecture?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 837571, "name": "Mekong Delta Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mekong_Delta_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1209502, "name": "Dvaravati Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati_Period?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1236729, "name": "Oc Eo culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oc_Eo_culture?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1807538, "name": "Preangkorian Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Preangkorian_Period?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1807540, "name": "Angkor Borei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor_Borei?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1807588, "name": "First Indianized States of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Indianized_States_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1808324, "name": "Mon Khmer Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mon_Khmer_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1808328, "name": "Archaeology of Funan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Funan?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 41957212, "title": "Dv\u0101ravat\u012b from the Bottom Up (Essays from the U Thong International Workshop 2017).", "created_at": "2020-02-12T15:49:36.919-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41957212/Dv%C4%81ravat%C4%AB_from_the_Bottom_Up_Essays_from_the_U_Thong_International_Workshop_2017_?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_41957212", "summary": "Scale of observation with archaeological phenomena has a profound impact, even though this factor is not always explicitly recognized and accounted for in research and interpretation.

These grave markers, locally known as plang-pleng, provide evidence for the formation and disappearance of an early form of vernacular Muslim material culture in Southeast Asia. We documented over 200 of these gravestones during a large-scale archaeological landscape survey. In this article, we present a typology of these gravestones based upon shape, morphology and ornamentation. We then discuss their geographical distribution and periodisation based on examples with dated Arabic inscriptions. Our results show that these gravestones were initially a cultural product of the historic trading settlement of Lamri dating from the early 15th century. By the middle of the 15th century, variations of these stones started to appear widely near the Aceh river. The plang-pleng tradition was displaced in the early 16th century by the batu Aceh gravestones associated with the Aceh sultanate, which became a standardised part of Muslim material culture in the region for the next two centuries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65668037, "asset_id": 45103708, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74355, "first_name": "R.

Yet the more we learn, the less useful those concepts seem to be. This collection deliberately complicates the binary of colonizer and colonized in order to establish a more effective framework for understanding. The contributors address a wide range of questions, rooted in specific colonial experiences: How can a controversy about forms of deference in Java reveal tensions around colonial policies and the rise of nationalism? What was Vietnamese about the French colonial governor\u2019s palace in Hanoi? What can the circulation of jazz in Asia tell us about its evolution, circuits of exchange, colonial culture, and its appropriation? Through such inquiries, the volume traces the multilinear trajectories of the flow of decorative objects, architectural styles, photographs, sartorial practices, music, deference rituals, and ethnographic knowledge, in a transimperial framework within and beyond Southeast Asia and Europe.

Countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand carry the impression that they are the origins of cheap, sometimes easily exploitable, migrant labor for employers in Taiwan. Many people in Taiwan also see the former two countries as sources of brides for lower-income men. These same countries, along with Cambodia and, to a lesser degree, Malaysia, are locations where Taiwanese capital is invested in factories for low-cost labor, proximity to Taiwan and China, and the relative absence of political contentiousness for being Taiwanese. With the advent of cheap air travel, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also offer the middle class in these areas options for quick holiday getaways. These interactions and the condescension toward Southeast Asia that sometimes accompany them belie the rich history of interactions that Taiwan and Southeast Asia share.\n\nhttp://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=831", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55538728, "asset_id": 35667987, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

and Art Now at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Taipei. Both arguably exchanged a more precise use of each other\u2019s mantles: the former mounted a historical survey of subcultural interests and functioned as representation; while the latter avowed a diverse selection of themes for a broad context (\u201cAsia\u201d) where terms such as LGBT and \u201cqueer\u201d remain rhetorically and politically insecure. And thus provocative. Indeed, Queer British Art was one of a number of events organized to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the decriminalization of male homosexuality in the UK, while Taiwan\u2019s recent recognition of a ban on same-sex marriage as unconstitutional was but one touchstone for Spectrosynthesis.\n\nThis article considers a range of queer-related contemporary art exhibitions and curated events in Asia\u2013dating from the early 1990s-in relation to examples of LGBT organizing and linked to theorizations of what has been termed Asia\u2019s \u201cdisjunctive modernities.\u201d That is, models of modernity that are non-linear and non-teleological. Inquiring into how these curatorial projects may be read in terms of the localized conditions of their production, issues of identity politics per se are examined for distinct queer lineages and contexts. And queer is elaborated as not definitively imbricated with LGBT and an essential politics of recognition, assimilation and rights.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56915325, "asset_id": 36965358, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6006231, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Curtin", "domain_name": "chula", "page_name": "BrianCurtin", "display_name": "Brian Curtin", "profile_url": "https://chula.academia.edu/BrianCurtin?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6006231/9572963/10663828/s65_brian.curtin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2080, "name": "Installation Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Installation_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 4195, "name": "Cultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Theory?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 13966, "name": "History of Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 264788, "name": "Art History, Exhibition History, Museum and Curating Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History_Exhibition_History_Museum_and_Curating_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 445622, "name": "Curating contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating_contemporary_art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 454886, "name": "Emerging Asian Artists", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emerging_Asian_Artists?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 728294, "name": "Curating As Critical Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating_As_Critical_Practice?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1035820, "name": "Museums and Curating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museums_and_Curating?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1820644, "name": "Queer Theory in Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory_in_Visual_Arts?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 19449569, "title": "Lost and found: tracing pre-modern cultural heritage in Southeast Asian contemporary art", "created_at": "2015-12-04T00:20:06.844-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19449569/Lost_and_found_tracing_pre_modern_cultural_heritage_in_Southeast_Asian_contemporary_art?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_19449569", "summary": "2013.

Through the unlikely coupling of Amron\u2019s and Suryodarmo\u2019s art, I explore how each artist \u2013 differently, but also similarly \u2013 negotiates the discomforting tension between the body and the self. In connecting the two artists, I also attend to unexplored methodological discomfort in developing contemporary Southeast Asian art history. This article challenges such epistemic discomfort, purposely invoking uncommon alignments to explore their generative potential for new readings of Southeast Asian art history and, therefore, help expand existing approaches and methods for engaging with Southeast Asian art, regionally.

from a forthcoming article: Njoto, H.\n\u2018On the origins of the \u201cJavanese Mosque\u201d\u2019, BEFEO 100 (in press, 2014). \nAbstract of the BEFEO paper: \n\nOn the origins of the \u00ab Javanese Mosque \u00bb \n\nThe genesis of the type known as the \"Javanese mosque\", with a concentric pattern and superimposed roofs, common in Java but also in the Malay world, is a subject of debate. For some specialists, this architectural type was copied from an early Indian type of mosques. For others, it was developed in Java before Islamization and adopted for the purpose of the new Muslim faith around the fifteenth century. \nIn continuity of a reflection outlined by some historians and architects this article proposes to shed more light on this latter hypothesis, on the basis of new archaeological and iconographical sources. While these materials show indeed the anteriority of buildings with a concentric pattern, spread during the Hindu-Buddhist period in Java, they also allow to determine that this type was used for Hindu and Buddhist cults from the seventh century onwards.

Studies\" 3 (December 2015). Special journal issue theme: \"The Place of Performance\" \nhttp://www.stedelijkstudies.com/issue-3-place-performance/\nThis essay considers three distinct forms of performance in Southeast Asia, each in relation to their engagement with pathways of various kinds. The essay begins by discussing a 1959 dance performed to celebrate the opening of a highway, which adapted classical Cambodian choreographic forms in distinctly modern ways. Then, a number of performances made by visual artists in Southeast Asia in the last half-decade are introduced. The essay concludes by looking to political demonstrations in Cambodia during the historically significant 2013 national elections; the actions of opposition demonstrators are considered in light of performative intersections with pathways of various kinds.\nThe essay does not attempt a comprehensive survey, and its intention is not to sketch a linear history. Rather, the focus is on repeated gestures and actions within these various performances. This attentiveness to recurring embodied forms aims to facilitate a comparison that spans generations and encompasses disparate modes of performance.

It focuses on the desire to travel and the experiences of being mobile in the mobile lives and works of Tintin Wulia (b. 1972) and an artist couple, Irwan Ahmett (b. 1975) and Tita Salina (b. 1973), hereinafter referred as a single entity as Ahmett Salina. Tintin\u2019s and Ahmett Salina\u2019s reasons to be always on the move are contingent on the globalization of contemporary art (both its market and discourse) as well as their personal history and individual aspirations. The subjects of this article seem to be stationed in what James Clifford called \u201ctransit lounge\u201d, a space in which translocal existences are \u201cdwelling in travel and submit their identities to \u2018routes\u2019 rather than \u2018roots\u2019 in a moving picture of a world that doesn\u2019t stand still\u201d.4 Clifford\u2019s image of a continually moving world runs parallel to the increase of mobility within the globalizing artworld. Here, travel and mobility performed by Tintin and Ahmett Salina are considered to have diasporic dimensions in their practices of displacement and interconnection with different cultural contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63488253, "asset_id": 43218917, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6857076, "first_name": "Brigitta", "last_name": "Isabella", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BrigittaIsabella", "display_name": "Brigitta Isabella", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BrigittaIsabella?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6857076/3936788/14293702/s65_brigitta.isabella.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 261663, "name": "Indonesian contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_contemporary_art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 37943429, "title": "\u2018The Intan shipwreck: a 10th century cargo in South-east Asian waters\u2019", "created_at": "2018-12-09T10:25:04.697-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37943429/_The_Intan_shipwreck_a_10th_century_cargo_in_South_east_Asian_waters_?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_37943429", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57957000, "asset_id": 37943429, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75954386, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Guy", "domain_name": "metmuseum", "page_name": "JGuy", "display_name": "John Guy", "profile_url": "https://metmuseum.academia.edu/JGuy?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75954386/37837103/31871642/s65_john.guy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3079743, "name": "Trade Ceramic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_Ceramic_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19988700, "title": "The Art of Living Dangerously: Semsar Siahaan (1952--2005)", "created_at": "2016-01-03T14:56:29.378-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19988700/The_Art_of_Living_Dangerously_Semsar_Siahaan_1952_2005_?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_19988700", "summary": "Siahaan was the foremost artist of the progressive movement in Indonesia. In 1975, after graduating from high school, Siahaan studied painting at the San Francisco Art Institute before returning to Indonesia in 1977 to pursue sculpture at the Institute of Technology in West Java. In 1978, Siahaan joined Group '78, an anti-Suharto student movement demanding that then-President Suharto not be re-elected. Suharto's rule was experienced by Indonesian artists, intellectuals and the populace as a whole as an oppressive and corrupt regime. After a 1981 protest criticising modern Indonesian art, which Siahaan felt implemented the military government's systematic control of, and interventions in, art and culture, he was expelled from the institute. He then led the institute's fine art students in a strike for freedom of expression. As a result, he was denied a solo exhibition at the institute in 1983. From there, he went to the Netherlands and became active with Indonesian expat political dissidents, publishing a bulletin called For the Sake of Democracy and Human Rights in Indonesia. Upon returning to Indonesia in 1984, Siahaan lived in the slums of Jakarta. Despite the very poor conditions, he kept working, sometimes using the street as his studio. By this time an internationally-recognized artistic voice, Siahaan received an invitation to show in the Contemporary Art Exhibition in Kassel, Germany; but due to the escalating violence and political upheaval in Indonesia, he refused both that and a subsequent 1998 artist-in-residency in Khazakstan. It was in 1998 that Indonesian military squads began kidnapping pro- democracy activists. Dozens of youths were shot and killed in terror operations across the country that spring, including street- style executions by military snipers on the 12th of May. The next day, Jakarta exploded in riots. Activists in Siahaan\u2019s circle learned of the military\u2019s training of 4,000 criminals to make war on civilians. Leaving his ruined house in Jakarta open and unlocked\u2014it had already been ransacked by the military as an intimidation tactic\u2014 Siahaan informally bequeathed all of his possessions to looters or squatters and once again escaped to Singapore; it was from there in 1999, through a professional affiliation with the University of Victoria, that he arranged his immigration to Canada, where he was granted political asylum. On February 23, 1952, Siahaan passed away as a result of a (possibly criminally induced) heart attack. He had recently returned to Indonesia and was setting up a gallery in Tabanan, Bali.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40946766, "asset_id": 19988700, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12374567, "first_name": "Yvonne", "last_name": "Owens", "domain_name": "vwu", "page_name": "YvonneOwens", "display_name": "Yvonne Owens", "profile_url": "https://vwu.academia.edu/YvonneOwens?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12374567/17161443/19026203/s65_yvonne.owens.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 9030, "name": "Canadian art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 14067, "name": "Literature and Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature_and_Visual_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 18707, "name": "Political Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 24825, "name": "Activist Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Activist_Ethnography?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 28372, "name": "Activist Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Activist_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 29360, "name": "Indonesian education development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_education_development?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 50003, "name": "Indonesian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Politics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 92504, "name": "Pacific Rim", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pacific_Rim?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 267161, "name": "Radical Politics in Live Art, Political and social sciences, philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_Politics_in_Live_Art_Political_and_social_sciences_philosophy?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 45202216, "title": "Book Review: Defining Dvaravati.

This study documents for the first time a group of artifacts whose meaning and significance have, until now, been inadequately understood by scholars, and sometimes even misunderstood by the recipients of the gifts themselves-the presidents and people of the United States. Yet for both Thais and Americans these gifts truly are historic, artistic, and scientific treasures, through which the Kings of Thailand represented their nation, and its alliances with America through time. Nearly all sets of gifts, from the courtly nielloware, silks, musical instruments and weapons to the everyday basketry, tools, agricultural samples and fish traps, were accompanied by a Royal Letter listing the contents of the gift (in Thai and English), and explaining its significance. This catalog introduces those Royal Letters and their lists, for the first time, into the interpretation of the gifts. This book will interest art-, social-, and diplomatic historians; anthropologists, linguists, and ethnomusicologists; students of Thai theater and culture; and all those who will appreciate the aesthetic quality of the gift objects or the very good stories those objects were meant to tell.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56726588, "asset_id": 36778580, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12785, "name": "History of International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_International_Relations?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 924450, "name": "Thai Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 12503951, "title": "Max Crosbie-Jones, \"MONTIEN BOONMA: Unbuilt/Rare Works,\" BLOUIN ARTINFO, 21 May 2013", "created_at": "2015-05-21T01:43:23.269-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12503951/Max_Crosbie_Jones_MONTIEN_BOONMA_Unbuilt_Rare_Works_BLOUIN_ARTINFO_21_May_2013?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_12503951", "summary": "Feature article on the exhibition \"Montien Boonma: Unbuilt/Rare Works,\" co-curated by Gregory Galligan, Dir., THAI ART ARCHIVES, and Gridthiya Gaweewong, Artistic Director, Jim Thompson Art Center, at the Jim Thompson Art Center on the occasion of the would-be 60th Birthday of Montien Boonma (1953-2000).

Serialised in Le Tour du Monde, a popular French magazine devoted to expeditions abroad, it had been rewritten by a ghostwriter and illustrated with engravings based on Mouhot\u2019s own drawings. It quickly caused a sensation, not for its descriptions of the flora and fauna of Southeast Asia, but for its tales of a lost civilisation hidden in the tropical jungles of Cambodia. \n\nMouhot\u2019s publications set the tone for how France, and the Western world in general, would view and imagine Angkor. They initiated the ways in which Angkor has been presented to the world over the past century and a half, with the lure of the exotic orient and enduring fantasies of discovering \u201clost civilisations\u201d taking centre stage. This essay looks at to what extent these perceptions remain today and how much they have changed. It does so by exploring the paintings, photographs, architectural drawings, museum displays, and colonial expositions dedicated to the topic, and by contextualising those against the colonial mindset of the time, which framed the West\u2019s understanding and representation of Angkor. It concludes with a look at Angkor in post-independence Cambodia, and an examination of how much the images, tropes, and exoticising stereotypes of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century are still being perpetuated.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64027257, "asset_id": 43719674, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13218188, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Murphy", "domain_name": "soas-uk", "page_name": "StephenMurphy", "display_name": "Stephen A Murphy", "profile_url": "https://soas-uk.academia.edu/StephenMurphy?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13218188/3725165/14622189/s65_stephen.murphy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40413, "name": "Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 77281, "name": "Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonization?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 245915, "name": "Political history of Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_history_of_Angkor?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1100198, "name": "Cambodian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Politics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1143877, "name": "Angkor Wat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Angkor_Wat?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 38458179, "title": "Book Flyer, Picturing Commerce  in and from the East Asian Maritime Circuits, 1550-1800, edited by Tamara Bentley", "created_at": "2019-02-28T13:14:29.413-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38458179/Book_Flyer_Picturing_Commerce_in_and_from_the_East_Asian_Maritime_Circuits_1550_1800_edited_by_Tamara_Bentley?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_38458179", "summary": "Title:  Picturing Commerce in and from the East Asian Maritime Circuits, 1550-1800\nVolume Editor: Tamara H. Bentley\nPublisher: Amsterdam University Press\nSeries: Visual & Material Culture, 1300-1700\n\nCombining strikingly new scholarship by art historians, historians, and ethnomusicologists, this interdisciplinary volume illuminates trade ties within East Asia, and from East Asia outwards, in the years 1550 to 1800. While not encyclopedic, the selected topics greatly advance our sense of this trade picture. Throughout the book, multi-part trade structures are excavated; the presence of European powers within the Asian trade nexus features as part of this narrative. Visual goods are highlighted, including lacquerwares, paintings, prints, musical instruments, textiles, ivory sculptures, unfired ceramic portrait figurines, and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian ceramic vessels. These essays underscore the significance of Asian industries producing multiples, and the rhetorical charge of these goods, shifting in meaning as they move. Everyday commodities are treated as well; for example, the trans-Pacific trade in contraband mercury, used in silver refinement, is spelled out in detail. Building reverberations between merchant networks, trade goods, and the look of the objects themselves, this richly-illustrated book brings to light the Asian trade engine powering the early modern visual cultures of East and Southeast Asia, the American colonies, and Europe.\n\nTable of contents: \nChapter One:  People and Things in Motion: The View from the East\nby Tamara H.

The objective is to present an integrated reading of four objects of art evoked and prompted by the theme and curatorial design of this exhibition, Intersecting Histories, within the trajectory of art history and to foreground the iconographical connections contemporary artworks have with preceding sources of art in developing intra-regional perspectives.

It is divided into three main sections. The first situates Latiff's artistic philosophy and identity in the context of the academy, in this case the Academy of Fine Arts in West Berlin, Germany. His work is placed in context of some of the conditions in which artistic practice developed in post-war West Germany, including a recuperation of German Expressionism banned by the Nazi's. The second section deals with the label of Abstract Expressionism/ist in relation to Malaysian painting. This entails a brief discussion of these terms in their Western cold war context, and further transformation in Malaysia. The final section further differentiates Latiff's work in dissimilarity to many accounts of his work. Here, I articulate some of the salient features of his aesthetic approach and philosophy of the art making process", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36285489, "asset_id": 10185129, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2681289, "first_name": "Amanda Katherine", "last_name": "Rath", "domain_name": "uni-frankfurt", "page_name": "AmandaKatherineRathPhD", "display_name": "Amanda Katherine  Rath", "profile_url": "https://uni-frankfurt.academia.edu/AmandaKatherineRathPhD?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2681289/909597/13704209/s65_amanda_katherine.rath.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14546, "name": "Modernism (Art History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernism_Art_History_?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43965, "name": "Malaysian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 159045, "name": "Malaysian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 793219, "name": "Modern Malaysian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Malaysian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 811942, "name": "Malaysian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 2649911, "title": "Socially Engaged Art Practices and Urban Commons", "created_at": "2013-02-25T18:55:44.076-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2649911/Socially_Engaged_Art_Practices_and_Urban_Commons?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_2649911", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30654616, "asset_id": 2649911, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 101119, "first_name": "Pelin", "last_name": "Tan", "domain_name": "batman", "page_name": "PelinTan", "display_name": "Pelin Tan", "profile_url": "https://batman.academia.edu/PelinTan?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/101119/27856/357572/s65_pelin.tan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 863, "name": "Visual Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7455, "name": "Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 16655, "name": "Vietnam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vietnam?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 17158, "name": "Japan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japan?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 208825, "name": "Urban movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_movements?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 295952, "name": "Enclosure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Enclosure?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 333858, "name": "Urban Commons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Commons?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 632564, "name": "Socially Engaged Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socially_Engaged_Art-1?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 757627, "name": "Comparative Modernities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Modernities?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 72617509, "title": "The Angkorian city: From Hariharalaya to Yashodharapura", "created_at": "2022-02-28T11:27:42.263-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/72617509/The_Angkorian_city_From_Hariharalaya_to_Yashodharapura?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_72617509", "summary": "HAL is a multi-disciplinary open access archive for the deposit and dissemination of scientific research documents, whether they are published or not.

As Phimai is confirmed to be a temple for Esoteric Buddhist practices according to the inscriptions attributed to various kings of the Khmer Empire, this deity unquestionably belongs in the Tantric Buddhist pantheon. While most agree that the deity is Tantric, some scholars have mixed opinions about the identity of the deity, which has been thought of as either Cakrasam\u0323vara or Trailokyavijaya. Hence the primary objective of this paper is to verify the identity of this deity through the studies of Sanskrit texts on Tantric Buddhist iconography.

Published as part of the special issue \"Contemporary Art Worlds and Art Publics in Southeast Asia\" for World Art, coedited by Michelle Antoinette and Francis Maravillas. \n\nThis essay positions the rapidly changing field of contemporary art in Southeast Asia, and the shifting structure, dynamics and influence of the region's contemporary \u2018art worlds' and \u2018art publics\u2019. It seeks to open up new horizons and frameworks for understanding the particular character of art worlds and art publics in Southeast Asia by being especially attuned to the local contexts and histories of contemporary art in the region and their particular ecologies. We contend that while contemporary art worlds and art publics in Southeast Asia might bear similar structures and dynamics to contemporary art worlds and publics elsewhere, they are nevertheless indicative of culturally specific and localised developments. Indeed, the various past and present practices and mediation of art and its publics in the region are suggestive of the ways in which art worlds take on nuanced character and meaning in Southeast Asia, are diversely configured and imagined, and are multiply located and complexly interconnected. The worldliness of these practices are, moreover, indicative of the ways in which Southeast Asian artists continue to respond to the exigencies of the everyday and the political economy of survival in an increasingly challenging world.\n\nKeywords: Southeast Asian art, contemporary art, art worlds, art publics, regionalism, world-making", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64955331, "asset_id": 44514313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56956258, "first_name": "Dr Michelle", "last_name": "Antoinette", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "DrMichelleAntoinette", "display_name": "Dr Michelle Antoinette", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/DrMichelleAntoinette?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56956258/16482365/16829335/s65_dr_michelle.antoinette.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53583, "name": "Art Worlds", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Worlds?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 175825, "name": "Art and publics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_and_publics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 508108, "name": "South and Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1240986, "name": "Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1842019, "name": "Southeast Asian contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_contemporary_art?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 37703275, "title": "The Nerve That Eats Itself: A Solo Exhibition by Be Takerng Pattanopas", "created_at": "2018-11-05T00:52:51.409-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37703275/The_Nerve_That_Eats_Itself_A_Solo_Exhibition_by_Be_Takerng_Pattanopas?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_37703275", "summary": "Introduction to new sculptures by Be Takerng Pattanopas that draws on writings by Sara Ahmed and Kaja Silverman.

"summary": "Title: Art and Ocean Objects of Early Modern Eurasia: Shells, Bodies, and Materiality\nAuthor: Anna Grasskamp\nSeries: Connected Histories in the Early Modern World\nPublisher: Amsterdam University Press\n\nDuring the early modern period, objects of maritime material culture were removed from their places of origin and traded, collected and displayed worldwide. Focusing on shells and pearls exchanged within local and global networks, this monograph compares and connects Asian, in particular Chinese, and European practices of oceanic exploitation in the framework of a transcultural history of art with an understanding of maritime material culture as gendered. Perceiving the ocean as mother of all things, as womb and birthplace, Chinese and European artists and collectors exoticized and eroticized shells' shapes and surfaces. Defining China and Europe as spaces entangled with South and Southeast Asian sites of knowledge production, source and supply between 1500 and 1700, the book understands oceanic goods and maritime networks as transcending and subverting territorial and topographical boundaries. It also links the study of globally connected port cities to local ecologies of oceanic exploitation and creative practices.\n\nFor more info, see https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463721158/art-and-ocean-objects-of-early-modern-eurasia", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77453443, "asset_id": 66146571, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28141903, "first_name": "Erika", "last_name": "Gaffney", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "ErikaGaffney", "display_name": "Erika Gaffney", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/ErikaGaffney?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28141903/7972035/23310501/s65_erika.gaffney.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1727, "name": "Early Modern History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Modern_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8228, "name": "Chinese Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8539, "name": "Eurasia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eurasia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13334, "name": "Global History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 35160, "name": "Maritime and Oceanic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_and_Oceanic_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 50951, "name": "Visual and Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_and_Material_Culture?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 208052, "name": "Oceanic art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oceanic_art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 209188, "name": "Chinese art history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_art_history?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 416979, "name": "Global Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 43957954, "title": "Between the Feminine and the Feminist: The Interplay of Identity and Space in the Aesthetic Strategies of Pinaree Sanpitak and Titarubi Essay 407 28", "created_at": "2020-08-26T16:40:48.187-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43957954/Between_the_Feminine_and_the_Feminist_The_Interplay_of_Identity_and_Space_in_the_Aesthetic_Strategies_of_Pinaree_Sanpitak_and_Titarubi_Essay_407_28?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_43957954", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64284820, "asset_id": 43957954, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42455318, "first_name": "E.P.", "last_name": "Chiew", "domain_name": "lasalle-sg", "page_name": "EPChiew", "display_name": "E.P.

I begin by considering the limitations and the afterlife of Anderson's famed 1983 study of nationalism. What happens to the imagined community when the media paradigm of the printed word is supplanted by the new lingua franca of the electronic image, and what might this mean for art? This transition implies a certain internationalisation, but at the same time it reflects novel ways of picturing the world and the changing values of the international itself. My research on Southeast Asian art is framed as a history of the contemporary; the international is a key currency of that contemporary. But far from serving as a universal mark of attainment, the international turns out to stand for a set of aspirations and delusions just as diverse as the region's 'mottled' national imaginaries. This has implications for the biennale, itself a lucrative source of 'contemporary'\u00a0currency and a form that has reformatted and streamlined modern art for a widening neoliberal and 'global' exchange. Southeast Asia has been a minor tributary of that global catchment for decades, but the biennale as a properly international platform has only emerged there more recently. And its worldly currency has been converted in many different ways. So how can we begin to historicise biennale-making in this region? With reference to the current postures of Southeast Asian biennales and the projections they facilitate, I will argue that local and contingent \nhistories of\u00a0the international will be an important prerequisite to any history of the biennale form itself.

Ancient \u00d0\u1ed3ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng participated in a network of contacts between India, China, and Southeast Asia. A grand Buddhist monumental complex, patronized by an ancient Camp\u0101 polity, stood there during the late 9th\u2013early 10th centuries. Ravaged by time and war, its art remains now lie scattered in various Vietnamese and European museums, offering a unique view into the fragmented history of Vietnam\u2019s Buddhist heritage. While Buddhism was the dominant religion, a close study of the art and inscriptions from \u00d0\u1ed3ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng reveals that \u015aaivism and local beliefs mingled inextricably with it, questioning the current tendency of creating a Buddhist-Hindu divide in the study of Asian religions. Some enigmatic sculptures from \u00d0\u1ed3ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng are difficult to identify and require going beyond established iconographic formulae to address cross-cultural issues such as hybridization and localization. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67663231, "asset_id": 7993347, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

Asian Art World\u201d (pp. 57-110).]\r\nWhen asked by the Editor of \"Arts of Asia\" to select one artwork for the 50th anniversary edition of this journal, I knew immediately that I should choose the \u201cRoyal Seal\u201d, or coat of arms, of King Chulalongkorn, Rama V, of Thailand, from the Smithsonian collections for which I serve as curator. This object had not been located during prior research about the Smithsonian\u2019s Thai royal gifts to the USA; Arts of Asia played a role in our recently finding it.\r\nGifted by the King of Siam (Thailand) to the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876, this large so-called \u201cRoyal Seal\u201d (as it was named in the original 1876 Exposition\u2019s gift lists) is made of lacquered wood with layers of gilded plating. It is in composition a very Western-style coat of arms, whose component elements, however, are all traditional Thai royal symbols. Its escutcheon\u2019s three subdivisions show Erawan, the three-headed elephant, a single elephant , and the crossed kris daggers, representing respectively central, northern, and southern Thailand. Above the shield are the seven-tiered royal umbrellas; below is a Pali motto sometimes translated \u201cUnity brings happiness\u201d. The elephant lion is seen on the royal seal\u2019s dexter side (on the left as we view it), while on the opposite (sinister) side is the king of lions. These mythical animals represent respectively the Ministry of Defence (military) and the Ministry of Interior within the royal government. \r\n*See publisher's website for information on purchasing full journal:  https://www.artsofasianet.com/back_issues/", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61542723, "asset_id": 41254840, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1234, "name": "Thai Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2473, "name": "Material Culture Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4347, "name": "Pali literature & language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pali_literature_and_language?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 6683, "name": "Museum Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Anthropology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 7063, "name": "History of Museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Museums?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 12177, "name": "Thai History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 31227, "name": "Cultural Diplomacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Diplomacy?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 78350, "name": "Museum and Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_and_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 99127, "name": "Thai politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_politics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 143887, "name": "Chinese and Southeast Asian Art History and Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_and_Southeast_Asian_Art_History_and_Archaeology?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 148083, "name": "World's Fairs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Worlds_Fairs?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 204034, "name": "Sacred and divine kingship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sacred_and_divine_kingship?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 348188, "name": "Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 517050, "name": "Thai monarchy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thai_monarchy?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 39091065, "title": "Globalisation as a motor of new visual art languages in turn of the century Southeast Asia", "created_at": "2019-05-10T22:55:07.259-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39091065/Globalisation_as_a_motor_of_new_visual_art_languages_in_turn_of_the_century_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_39091065", "summary": "Comparative study of contemporary art in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia showing the impact of local conditions on emerging contemporary art.

In his longstanding dedication to the arts and culture of the Philippines, Roldan has established himself as not only a groundbreaking artist with a penchant for history reflected through imposing installations of found objects, but also a cultural agent in the communities in various parts of the archipelago, facilitating social and political awareness through art.

This session seeks to explore the contemporary museum practices of Asia, responding to the call from MacDonald and Fyfe (1996) to retheorise museums in terms of their contexts, contests and contents. A recent study by Evans and Rowlands (2015) shows how \u2018universal\u2019 Western heritage values have been appropriated and renegotiated through local museum initiatives in China, highlighting the complexity and fluidity of these processes. These grounded realities suggest a pressing need for rethinking and reconceptualising the ideas of \u2018heritage\u2019 and \u2018the museum\u2019 in local contexts. The panel seeks to identify key emerging themes in Asian heritage and museology for critical debates and discussions, and reconsider whether a conceptual border really exists between the west and the rest in the discipline of heritage and museum studies from this vantage point.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55047173, "asset_id": 33184518, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

We contend that none of the three objects are imports, but that all were cast locally, in imitation of more sophisticated Javanese models. We argue that the importance of the three bronzes goes well beyond their intrinsic interest as objects, in that their manufacture suggests a transfer of ideas and religious practices from East Java around the year AD 1000. Such a hypothesis is compatible with the shift from flexed burials to cremated burials by the Makasars, which occurred at about the same time.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34050905, "asset_id": 7476637, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12017842, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Caldwell", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "IanCaldwell", "display_name": "Ian Caldwell", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/IanCaldwell?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12017842/3737801/23478314/s65_ian.caldwell.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2150, "name": "Indonesian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246810, "name": "South Sulawesi Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Sulawesi_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246811, "name": "South Sulawesi History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Sulawesi_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 8659014, "title": "Em Sokha and Cambodian Satirical Cartoons", "created_at": "2014-10-06T09:02:45.553-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8659014/Em_Sokha_and_Cambodian_Satirical_Cartoons?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_8659014", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35123711, "asset_id": 8659014, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 726613, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Marston", "domain_name": "colmex", "page_name": "JohnMarston", "display_name": "John Marston", "profile_url": "https://colmex.academia.edu/JohnMarston?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/726613/248384/7896725/s65_john.marston.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22807, "name": "Political cartoons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_cartoons?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25845, "name": "Southeast Asian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Politics?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 254011, "name": "Cambodian contemporary art and visual culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_contemporary_art_and_visual_culture?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 903920, "name": "Satirical Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Satirical_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1100198, "name": "Cambodian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_Politics?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 77125526, "title": "Centralized power/decentralized production?

exhibition, BAGYI AUNG SOE (1923\u20131990), scheduled at Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne - Centre Pompidou in Galerie 0 from December 2020 to February 2021. The exhibition was rescheduled to February 10 \u2013 May 3, 2021 [and extended till August 23, 2021] due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with various setbacks thwarting the realisation of the anticipated publication. Independently of the exhibition\u2019s hosting institution, a decision was made to electronically publish this curatorial essay for four reasons: in line with Bagyi Aung Soe\u2019s credo, to make widely accessible this text on the appreciation and legacy of his practice and oeuvre three decades after his passing; to spur reflection, discussion and further research; to register this exhibition marking a milestone in the history of modern Burmese art with which Aung Soe\u2019s life and work is intertwined; and finally, to explore new possibilities of knowledge-making via alternative publishing with fellow students of art and art history: Issa Sng Yi Xian, Toby Wu and Zune Ei Htet.

Traditional methods of production change to meet the needs of a voracious outside market, and in some cases demand for authenticity and antiquity causes the veritable strip-mining of a region's artistic heritage. This has occurred in many Southeast Asian communities. \n   \"Fragile Traditions\" focuses on the complex effects of the primitive art market and various kinds of private and institutional collecting on the vibrant art traditions of Indonesia. It explores the historical context and impact of Indonesia's transformation from colonial to national government, together with the massive effects of the introduction of popular education and the accompanying religious conversions and reformations. The contributors bring to this volume a wealth of first-hand experience and diverse backgrounds in anthropology, art history, museum curation, and development. The result is one of the most succinct yet broad-ranging examinations available on any single country of the current transformation of indigenous art forms within the communities that create them. \n= = = = \n\nNote: Covers, table of contents and sample pages only uploaded. \nBook is out of print; copies may be obtained from libraries or purchased at out-of-print book outlets, e.g.:\n\nhttps://www.abebooks.com/Fragile-Traditions-Indonesian-Art-Jeopardy-TAYLOR/16674368397/bd\n\nhttps://www.asiabookroom.com/pages/books/149139/paul-michael-taylor/fragile-traditions-indonesian-art-in-jeopardy\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Fragile-Traditions-Indonesian-Art-Jeopardy/dp/B007K4VW9W", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56655490, "asset_id": 36714949, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81878957, "first_name": "Paul Michael", "last_name": "Taylor", "domain_name": "si", "page_name": "PaulMichaelTaylor", "display_name": "Paul Michael Taylor", "profile_url": "https://si.academia.edu/PaulMichaelTaylor?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81878957/19760627/19605816/s65_paul_michael.taylor.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22830, "name": "Arts and Heritage Marketing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_and_Heritage_Marketing?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25370, "name": "Contemporary Indigenous Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Indigenous_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 28069, "name": "Art Market", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Market?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 31300, "name": "Folk arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Folk_arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 250543, "name": "Primitive Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primitive_Arts?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 36248093, "title": "Sentieri per il paradiso: percorsi spirituali tra Europa e India", "created_at": "2018-03-24T23:11:47.207-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36248093/Sentieri_per_il_paradiso_percorsi_spirituali_tra_Europa_e_India?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_36248093", "summary": "The pages of medieval manuscripts reveal a dynamically interconnected world filled with real and imagined ideas about foreign peoples and places.

However, some conservation practitioners on the ground have been slower to recognise the importance of seeing their own contexts from a 'glocal' point of view. The future of cultural heritage conservation relies on increasing intra-regional dialogue, while continuing to share findings and best practices with the conservation community internationally. Heritage, as an institutional practice, aims to preserve selected remains from the past (Esposito, 2014:20) that can then be presented in the future as important to the understanding of these remains' original context(s). One of the many ways in which this is done is through the collection or acquisition of objects identified as being important to, or representative of, that context. These specimens of specific time/places are then strung together to form an approximation of a narrative of history and heritage through cultural objects and sites. Arguably, the human agency involved in this highly subjective process can be problematic when one object or even one culture's recognition is privileged over another. In particular, the context of this decision-making \u2013 the intersection(s) of socio-historical influences and individual preferences \u2013 often goes unremarked, much less examined. This is potentially contentious, especially given that these fragments are then retroactively woven into a narrative that becomes a part, if not all, of a culture's self-identity. This desire to collect and acquire objects \u2013 essentially, the drive behind the institutional practice of heritage as we now understand it \u2013 was born in Western Europe and was later 'exported' to its colonies, including those in Asia, beginning in the second half of the 19 th century (Esposito, 2014: 20). Notions of 'heritage' in this sense are currently understood worldwide, this is mainly based on material authenticity, aesthetic qualities and historical values (Chan et. al, 2014: 22). This bears the trappings of its original cultural backgrounds, and may not necessarily be representative of how individual cultures perceive, experience, and choose to embody their own ideas of heritage. Whilst the practice of collection and acquisition has its roots in Western European values and belief systems, scholars working in contexts outside the region have played a paramount role in engaging with and deconstructing the basic assumptions underlying established practices in heritage management. Conservation as a Contextual Discipline: Conservation as a discipline has, quite naturally, mirrored to a large extent the institutional practice of heritage in terms of its historical trajectory and development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56031638, "asset_id": 36138936, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5543167, "first_name": "Diana", "last_name": "Tay", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "dianatay", "display_name": "Diana Tay", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/dianatay?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5543167/3737702/33732480/s65_diana.tay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6735, "name": "Heritage Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Conservation?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 33132656, "title": "National Gallery Singapore (National Art Gallery de Singapour): contenu ou emballage?", "created_at": "2017-05-21T18:55:21.719-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33132656/National_Gallery_Singapore_National_Art_Gallery_de_Singapour_contenu_ou_emballage?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_33132656", "summary": "In French. \nNational Gallery Singapore's ambitious project to represent complex regional art histories.

By SUCHANDRA GHOSH Temple Architecture and Imagery of South and Southeast Asia, Prasadanidhi (temple's treasure) celebrates the life and scholarship of Professor Madhusudan Amilal Dhaky, best known the world over for his works on the subject of Indian temple architecture and Jain art and literature. Those of us who are not art/architectural historians as such, or did not have the privilege and opportunity to be associated with him, do have an idea of his profound erudition through the mega volumes of Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, which was a vast undertaking of inestimable importance by M.A. Dhaky along with Michael Meister and Krishna Deva. He was the real force behind the success of the Encyclopaedia. The editors, Parul Pandya Dhar and Gerd J.R. Mevissen, deserve our congratulations for this well\u00adproduced and well\u00adonceived felicitation volume. As expected, the volume in honour of Dhaky has contributions from well\u00adknown scholars of South and South\u00ad Eeast Asian temple art and architecture both from India and abroad. Indeed, as the editors correctly stated, \" the thirty\u00adtwo essays reflect the most recent and revised research in South and South\u00adEast Asian art history by some of the finest minds engaged in the field \". The volume begins with a foreword by Kapila Vatsayan. Her close association with Dhaky Saheb, as he was often called, helps to her underline the facets of Dhaky's personality, which she characterises as strong, tenacious and unwavering with a kind of flexibility. Devangana Desai's \" Dhaky Saheb: Reminiscences \" is a vibrant journey down memory lane. The editors' introduction gives us an insight into the succeeding pages, which they have curated with great care. It is really the call of the day to not only look at the temple arts and architecture from the perspective of India but also include the art historical traditions of other regions of South Asia and South\u00adEast Asia. This broadening of horizon goes well with Dhaky's own understanding of the art and architecture beyond India, which for him is a dialogue, a kind of conversation with Indian art and architecture. In keeping with the master's own endearing engagement, temple obviously gets the first preference as a theme in this volume. But there are essays related to other issues, such as patronage, rituals and memorial monuments, which are significant and form essential elements of a religious and social landscape. It was imperative that this book should have an essay dedicated to the academic journey that Dhaky had undertaken for years for his passion, the temple. Parul Pandya Dhar has been immensely successful in presenting a representative discussion of his writings on temples, offering readers his research methods, his critical art historical construct, his emotional attachment with temple yet maintaining a scientific temper. This reading into the works of Dhaky sets the stage for reading and understanding the 32 essays in the next section. Hemant Dave illuminates us about Dhaky's penchant for writing in regional languages, particularly Gujrati, his mother tongue. He gives us a succinct account of the invaluable treasures that came from the master's pen in Gujarati and a few in Hindi. The book is laid out into six sub\u00adthemes: Architectural Styles, Modes, Materials, and Milieus\u037e Architectural Elements\u037e Architecture and the Configuration of Imagery\u037e Embodying the Deity\u037e Inhabiting the Temple\u037e and Piety, Society and Ritual Performance. All these themes are linked some way or another to Dhaky's contribution to the disciplines of art and architecture. The first section is directly related to the field to which Dhaky substantially contributed. It opens with an essay by Walter M. Spink on the development of the vihara shrines from Bagh to Ajanta. Taking the two sites together, he weaves a wonderful narrative of the interface between them \u2014Bagh as a source for the development of the stupa shrines at Ajanta and Ajanta for the introduction of Buddha imagery in Bagh caves.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49075350, "asset_id": 28687624, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 332132, "first_name": "Parul Pandya", "last_name": "Dhar", "domain_name": "du-in", "page_name": "ParulPandyaDhar", "display_name": "Parul Pandya  Dhar", "profile_url": "https://du-in.academia.edu/ParulPandyaDhar?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/332132/521279/29795141/s65_parul_pandya.dhar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 451785, "name": "Indian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 512813, "name": "Indian Temple Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Temple_Architecture?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 24826569, "title": "Astri Wright, \"Mella Jaarsma & Nindityo Adipurnomo\" (Jakarta Post, 1990)", "created_at": "2016-04-27T18:27:17.591-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24826569/Astri_Wright_Mella_Jaarsma_and_Nindityo_Adipurnomo_Jakarta_Post_1990_?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_24826569", "summary": "As a PhD student doing fieldwork, I wrote about the artists I interviewed in the Jakarta Post, Indonesia's main English language newspaper read widely by the professional and culture-aware class.

During this period no less than ten artists\u2019 collectives were launched in the major cities of Java. Aside form their political activities these collectives consolidated technical expertise and materials and nurtured philosophical and artistic discourse.

"Petroglyphs were discovered in the Birir valley of district Chitral, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan, on an ancient route connecting the Kalasha valleys with Nuristan, lower Chitral and Central Asia. The petroglyphs were engraved on a solitary schist stone. The rock, with associated structures, occupies a strategic location in the landscape, possibly representing a hunting outpost. The petroglyphs consist of 29 figures, including human, animal, geometric and indistinct figures. These figures seem to have been created through the use of a metal stylus/burin. The figures were produced through the percussion method, utilizing a stippling technique. The depiction of a dog, a goat and stylized human figures suggest a possible link to the subsistence and hunting strategies of the protohistoric people in the region. Based upon the limited archaeological knowledge of the region, the present petroglyph site may tentatively be dated to the 1 st millennium BCE.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66135481, "asset_id": 45640396, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 311210, "first_name": "Muhammad", "last_name": "Zahir", "domain_name": "educationlahore", "page_name": "Zahir", "display_name": "Muhammad Zahir", "profile_url": "https://educationlahore.academia.edu/Zahir?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/311210/76831/83668/s65_muhammad.zahir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6926, "name": "South Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1208944, "name": "Archaeology of Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Pakistan?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1922889, "name": "Chitral", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chitral?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 2647431, "name": "Archaeology and culture of Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_and_culture_of_Pakistan?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 45581654, "title": "Seeing the \u2018foreigner\u2019 in the art of early Southeast Asia c.100 BCE \u2013 c.900 CE", "created_at": "2021-03-19T08:22:41.855-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45581654/Seeing_the_foreigner_in_the_art_of_early_Southeast_Asia_c_100_BCE_c_900_CE?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_45581654", "summary": "The millennium between c.100 BCE and c.900 CE saw the growth of long-distance economic and cultural exchange both within and beyond Southeast Asia, processes which contributed to the development of early states and precipitated cultural changes through encounters with Indian and Sinitic cultures. Increasing numbers of people were travelling long distances along established trade routes into, within, through and out of the region, and for many different reasons. Visual representations of people claimed to be \u2018foreigners\u2019 in the art of this period have been identified in several cultural contexts, but have mostly received only cursory mention, often with a simple assertion of their identity. However, they are significant as locally-produced representations because, appropriately interpreted, they may offer new insights into intercultural interactions that have in large part been reconstructed from non-Southeast Asian textual sources and via studies of stylistic relationships and archaeological exotica. This thesis seeks to develop a methodology for the informed interpretation of such images that incorporates an appreciation of the cognitive processes behind the perception and representation of difference, otherness and foreignness in ancient art, in part by drawing on interpretive discussions of this kind of visual material elsewhere in the ancient world. Additional considerations pertinent to Southeast Asian engagement with non-local iconographic traditions are included. The resulting methodology is discussed further in three case studies where figures have been claimed to represent \u2018foreigners\u2019 to highlight the subjectivities, subtleties and sources involved in interpretation. Two of these have geographical foci, in pre-Angkorian Cambodia and Dv\u0101ravat\u012b culture in Central Thailand, and one has a thematic focus, being an apparent association with early representations of horses in the region. In each case, significant new insights result from the attention paid to these figures and their interpretation, showing the methodology to be a productive approach to understanding long-distance connections in Southeast Asia, or indeed elsewhere in the ancient world.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3061289, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Wreyford", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "BenWreyford", "display_name": "Ben Wreyford", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/BenWreyford?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3061289/19573140/19468432/s65_ben.wreyford.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22181, "name": "Representation of Others", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation_of_Others?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 979519, "name": "Archaeology of Horse and Riders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_of_Horse_and_Riders?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1028132, "name": "Pre Angkor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pre_Angkor?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1209502, "name": "Dvaravati Period", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati_Period?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 1250015, "name": "Dv\u0101ravat\u012b", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dvaravati?f_ri=367722"}, {"id": 2668056, "name": "Sambor Prei Kuk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sambor_Prei_Kuk?f_ri=367722"}]}, {"id": 45581633, "title": "The representation of otherness and foreignness in the art of early Southeast Asia c.100 BCE \u2013 c.900 CE", "created_at": "2021-03-19T08:17:37.856-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45581633/The_representation_of_otherness_and_foreignness_in_the_art_of_early_Southeast_Asia_c_100_BCE_c_900_CE?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_45581633", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3061289, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Wreyford", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "BenWreyford", "display_name": "Ben Wreyford", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/BenWreyford?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3061289/19573140/19468432/s65_ben.wreyford.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22181, "name": "Representation of Others", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation_of_Others?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37943700, "title": "Crush Me", "created_at": "2018-12-09T11:28:23.631-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37943700/Crush_Me?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_37943700", "summary": "\"Crush Me\", Exhibition catalog essay for Entang Wiharso's solo exhibition, Crush Me,  Pearl Lam Fine Art, Shanghai, 20 May-28 June 2013. Pages 6-13. Please properly cite.\nCRUSH ME \u2013  In the English-language, the word \u2018crush\u2019 is both noun and verb, and carries different yet equally intense meanings. A crush is a powerful, short-lived passion -- a deep infatuation. To crush also means to suppress, to psychologically, socially and emotionally destroy someone, to physically annihilate something. Crush implies relations of power and scale.  Entang Wiharso maintains the dual meaning of \u2018a crush\u2019 and \u2018to crush\u2019 throughout the works in this exhibition. \nThe series of works in Crush Me also contend with issues of memory and geography, and the intertwined pathways of identity, place, becoming and belonging.

However, looking beyond the films' pedagogical role, Diaz also employs a range of representational practices associated with modern and contemporary visual art in the Philippines. Focusing on Diaz's formal strategies-particularly his striking use of perspective, composition and realism-my paper brings his films into conversation with visual art from the Philippines. I propose a reading of his films as part of a tradition of representation which mediates on natural and man-made environments since the Second World War. Highlighting the importance which he places on phenomenological experiences, my paper compares and contrasts Diaz's practice to mid-century Neo-Realist painters, as well as more recent forms of performance art, conceptualism and experimental video and photography, arguing that for a constant slippage between the experiential, political and aesthetic in his work.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52045130, "asset_id": 31735485, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2992294, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Bentcheva", "domain_name": "hausderkunst", "page_name": "EvaBentcheva", "display_name": "Eva Bentcheva", "profile_url": "https://hausderkunst.academia.edu/EvaBentcheva?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2992294/987598/32140715/s65_eva.bentcheva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1555, "name": "Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Studies?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 539122, "name": "Philippine art and culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_art_and_culture?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 630718, "name": "History of the Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_the_Philippines?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28270942, "title": "(co-author) Power and Piety: Islamic Talismans on the Battlefield (digital exh. cat.).

"Public talk at the Young Art Historians' Forum, LASALLE College of the Arts, MA Asian Art Histories programme, September 2015. \nAbstract:\nAfter being forbidden in French Cambodge, representational painting was introduced by a Japanese teacher following the Japanese occupation in 1945. Sentimental images depicting the Cambodian landscape quickly boomed in popularity, and representational drawing and painting became synonymous with artistic modernism in the years following independence in 1953. Its growth was aided by intensive involvement in cultural affairs by the United States, as part of their attempt to influence \u201cneutralist\u201d Cambodia in the \u201cCold War\u201d context of war in neighbouring Vietnam. This paper explores how the Cambodian \u201cmodern\u201d is articulated in the work of the most prominent visual artist of the period, Nhek Dim (1934-78). Drawing on research in the archives of the United States government, particular attention is paid to the intersections between Nhek Dim\u2019s paintings and the cultural activities of the United States, who organized numerous exhibitions in Cambodia in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and sponsored the artist\u2019s study in the US from 1964-67. This paper will argue that Nhek Dim\u2019s work embodies the possibility of nationalism amidst a policy of non-aligned neutralism: a balance that was endorsed by the US and became defining of the modern in this context.

I argue that the active collaboration of women artists who struggled against the condition of peran ganda (double role) in the formation of Nuansa Indonesia, a collective that sought to promote professionalism in the exhibitory world by women, was unquestionably conducted in the spirit of feminism. This series of women-centred exhibitions marked one of the first steps toward understanding their conditions, and toward re-modelling the male-dominated Indonesian art world.\n\nYvonne Low (2015)

Little regard, however, has been paid to non-Western aspects of the Baroque outside the colonial framework, despite the style\u2019s manifest impact on regions such as the Ottoman Empire, the Indian subcontinent, and East and Southeast Asia. This session seeks to explore the Baroque\u2019s global dimensions in a manner commensurate with the phenomenon itself, encompassing themes and geographies that fall outside the field\u2019s traditional purview. Challenging established notions of hegemonic and unidirectional European influence, the papers address various ways in which non-Western cultures actively participated in the Baroque, its dissemination, and its diversification. Topics include the use of imported Western artifacts to express locally resonant concepts; ornament as a cross-cultural carrier of taste and meaning; the reception, conceptualization, and adaptation of European artistic models in Asia; Baroque aesthetics as a means of display and self-representation; and the role of non-Western designers in shaping European aesthetic trends. The session thus opens up prevailing notions of Baroque art and architecture and expands the framework of scholarly inquiry to better reflect the material\u2019s global implications.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPERS TO BE PRESENTED:\r\n\r\nSylvia Houghteling (Yale University), \u201cThe Tree of Life and the World of Wonder: South Asian \u2018Aj\u0101\u2019ib Imagery as Baroque Grotesque\u201d\r\n\r\nRangsook Yoon (Cornell Fine Arts Museum, Rollins College), \u201cImages of Exotic Animals between East and West: The Case of an Eighteenth-Century Korean Folding Screen\u201d\r\n\r\nGreg M.

A central feature of the Angkorian economy was the precocious development of sophisticated craft industries. Of the multiple crafts produced in this empire, stoneware production stands out for two reasons: empire transport networks closely articulated with the location of stoneware production complexes best known in central Angkor and on the Khorat plateau northwest of Angkor; and distribution/consumption patterns of Angkorian stoneware map directly onto the empire&#39;s geopolitical extent. As part of a larger geochemical provenancing project concerned with Khmer stoneware production and exchange, we present and discuss results for Cheung Ek, a southern Cambodian provincial complex for production of both stoneware and earthenware. The similarities (shared local resources) and differences in the organization of local production are striking between stoneware and earthenware production. Comparison with previously published Khmer stoneware kiln complexes confirms that each has a unique and readily identifiable geochemical profile. By establishing a geochemical baseline this work highlights the potential of stonewares for developing a deeper understanding of Khmer craft production and distribution dynamics in future comparisons between stoneware production, Khmer settlement and ritual contexts. This elemental baseline will also enable future evaluation of the potential discriminating power of other, field deployable but less sensitive non-destructive analytic techniques such as pXRF and pLIBS, particularly in relation to extending this work to checking production origins of complete Khmer stoneware vessels held in museum collections.", "downloadable_attachments": [],

By this reckoning,  the notion of \"tradition\" can no longer be regarded simply as antithetical to modernity but must be seen, rather, as a constitutive part of what forges  c such modernity. In this vein, \"contemporary art\" must acknowledge the plural and manifold artistic practices of people the world over and recognize that the \"traditional\" may exist contiguously and even find presence in contemporary art and life.Thus, contemporary Southeast Asian art offers the potential for pushing the parameters of contemporary  art more generally (the means by which we define it, including its modes, media, styles and conditions of reception, among other formalist and affective considerations of aesthetics) so as to encompass those kinds of living \"folk\"or traditional\" art that are less readily translatable to pre-existing frames of \"internationalist\" avant-garde art practices with their Euro-American inheritances and biases.\" Excerpt from Michelle Antoinette, \"The Shifting Art-Historical Field for Southeast Asia: Tradition, Modernity and \"The Contemporary'\", Japan Foundation Asia Center Art Studies #03, 2017, pp.92-93 (originally published in Michelle Antoinette, Reworlding Art History: Contemporary Southeast Asian Art after 1990, Rodopi/Brill 2014).\n\nPart of an anthology of texts produced by the Japan Foundation Asia Centre and edited by Patrick D.

The second block, the life of the painter in Japan, is the one that will be discussed next. Accompanying \"Japan\" with the words \"freedom\" and \"criticism\", it is intended to refer to how Dinh Dang's art strips of its Vietnamese ties to become a means of free expression. The neosurrealist figuration will be chosen to represent its peculiar world. In addition, during this period from the decade of the 90s to today, the physicist converts many of his subjects into direct reflections of his life. \"Criticism\" is thus the conventional means of protest in the linens of Dinh Dang.\n\nThus, the work will be structured in two key axes to understand the new stage of Dinh Dang, included by dates. Through this article we will study the period that goes from 1994, that is, the arrival of the artist to the Nation of the Rising Sun, until the turn of the century.

Taylor recently argued that contemporary art (particularly archival and performance-based practice) holds the power to evoke collective histories and shared forms of knowledge. While Taylor\u2019s observation holds true in many cases, it raises the question of how contemporary art relates to events that lie beyond the collective imagination. What is to be made of histories that are forgotten or purposefully erased? What of events that are considered too marginal by a given majority? And, perhaps most importantly in the discussion on creative practices and migration, how may art tackle developments that take place abroad?\n\nThis article focuses on artistic practices that delve into the spaces of liminality and omission. It is particularly interested in works dealing with invisible or forgotten histories, and argues that the role of migrant artists is central in recovering these narratives and asserting their contemporary relevance. It concentrates on works which simultaneously excavate lost histories and re-enact them in the present. Here, the term \u201cexcavate\u201d plays an important role, for it emphasises that the histories which the artists seek to unearth are, for many, considered obsolete. Their incorporation into art thus serves as reanimation, giving them a new life in the present. Acknowledging the affective allure of such practices, this article also considers their ability to negotiate history in a contemporary context which, as Saloni Mathur notes, is \u201cboth inextricably interconnected and mercilessly blocked by the barriers and boundaries of historiography, writing, and the narratives of art history\u201d.\n\nIn reviewing the performance 'Kilapsaw: Everything Must Go' (2016) by UK-based Philippine artists Noel Ed De Leon, Kulay Labitigan and Lawrence Carlos, this article examines the work\u2019s citation of historical parallels and shared histories between Britain and the Philippines. Exploring the ways in which the artists deploy exposition, juxtaposition and re-enactment, it argues that Kilapsaw relies upon the placement of the artists abroad in order to perform a symbolic act of excavation. Here, a series of site-specific actions in central London evoke histories, such as the destruction of Manila during World War II at the hands of its American allies, and the British occupation of Manila between 1762\u201364. Staged in the run-up to the referendum on Britain\u2019s status in the European Union, these historical moments become resonant with contemporary debates around allegiance, opportunism and belonging.\n\nFurther bringing this work into conversation with recent research-led pro- jects by Erika Tan and Arin Rungjang, this article posits an incipient interest in artistic excavation and citation in Southeast Asian diasporic art. In this line of practice, the mapping of traces and partial histories, far from aiming to produce definitive historical knowledge, leaves room for imagining how the lessons of the past resonate within present-day social and political debates.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56582181, "asset_id": 36648945, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2992294, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Bentcheva", "domain_name": "hausderkunst", "page_name": "EvaBentcheva", "display_name": "Eva Bentcheva", "profile_url": "https://hausderkunst.academia.edu/EvaBentcheva?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2992294/987598/32140715/s65_eva.bentcheva.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5463, "name": "Performance Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 539122, "name": "Philippine art and culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_art_and_culture?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34193469, "title": "The Cinta Library", "created_at": "2017-08-10T09:47:09.809-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34193469/The_Cinta_Library?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_34193469", "summary": "The Cinta Library is a private collection of books (also images and other materials, including audio) specialising on India and Southeast Asia.

"Following the traumatic Malaysian race riots of 1969 that fractured the postcolony\u2019s imagination of a unified national community, landscape painting became a focal point of debate regarding the role of art in the construction of a pluralistic but properly Malaysian public sphere. Artists, cultural critics, and policy makers raised questions regarding the national character of realist and abstract modes of landscape representation, as well as the suitable pictorial and sentimental content of such works. This paper examines an avant-garde response to the landscape debate through Redza Piyadasa\u2019s The Great Malaysian Landscape, the winning entry to the 1972 national art competition. An early example of conceptual art in Malaysia, Piyadasa\u2019s piece literalizes the constitutive elements of landscape painting through stenciled text that labels the picture, frame, title, signature, and surface of the work as such. I argue that the deadpan aesthetic of this work signals the waning of landscape as an artistic genre that can be mobilized for unifying public sentiment through the aesthetic of the picturesque. Instead, Malaysian artists in the 1970s contested the function of landscape as a technology of representational mastery, and instead approached landscape as a contested terrain of cultural representation through the lens of sociology and information theory. Detached from the cultivation of public belonging, the landscape became a key conceptual term in the artistic response to urbanization and the instrumentalization of nature as a resource for national development.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 442287, "first_name": "Chanon Kenji", "last_name": "Praepipatmongkol", "domain_name": "mcgill", "page_name": "ChanonKenjiPraepipatmongkol", "display_name": "Chanon Kenji Praepipatmongkol", "profile_url": "https://mcgill.academia.edu/ChanonKenjiPraepipatmongkol?f_ri=367722", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/442287/142327/17516575/s65_chanon_kenji.praepipatmongkol.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367722, "name": "Southeast Asian Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art_History?f_ri=367722", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8428331, "title": "We Have Never Known Nature: PIPELINE issue 44", "created_at": "2014-09-21T18:33:24.912-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8428331/We_Have_Never_Known_Nature_PIPELINE_issue_44?f_ri=367722", "dom_id": "work_8428331", "summary": "Like over-familiar things, nature appears immediate and self-evident when summoned by artists to our attention.
