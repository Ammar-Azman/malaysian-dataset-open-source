Specifically, it sought to find out empirical evidence if business innovations adopted in a hotel industry could directly influence customer demands and satisfaction.\n\nThis study was a descriptive-quantitative design, making use of Total Enumeration System  and Convenient Sampling Design. Two separate surveys were used to gather data \u2014 a 5-point Likert Scale questionnaire for Business Innovations Survey. For Customer Satisfaction Survey, the researcher adopted and modified the SERVQUAL Model of measuring service quality by (Parasuaraman et al., 2005).\n\nThe study revealed that Business Innovations such as comfort level, brand innovation and novelty, products and services, process innovations, food and beverages, business facilities, technological innovations are significant and necessary for competitive advantage for Bella Casa Hotel.  It also perceived that the hotel management will also focus on putting up a recreation facility and activities, improve the online reservation systems, and implement green technology and property management. \n\n\n The Hotel Customer Satisfaction was perceived in a \u201cmoderate satisfaction\u201d. The Customers\u2019 perceptions of service quality through the Bella Casa hotel\u2019s existing business innovations and their satisfactions are profoundly influence by their service encountered with the hotel staff. Moreover; the study also reveals that Business Innovations has no direct influence to Customers\u2019 satisfaction at Bella Casa Hotel.\n\nThe researcher recommends some strategies to help improve a more creative innovations and Customer Oriented Environment. The need to design sound innovation strategies by deploying practical innovative activities to be more competitive in the market. In order to remain competitive in terms of customers' satisfaction, it must track the levels of customers' satisfaction through professional development, improvement of its recreation facilities, adopt more technological innovations and modernized the physical appearance of the hotel for rebranding. \n\nThe business sectors should create a new market for innovation collaboration among businesses and external partners\u2014 consulting firms, universities, research institutes, and entrepreneurial ventures\u2014that does not exist today.\n\n\n\nAdditional research is needed to fully understand how satisfaction arises among Customers, not only to local customers but to international customer as well.  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61514517, "asset_id": 41300409, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 110927986, "first_name": "R.

Before independence Zambia comprised of the Northern Rhodesia and the Barotseland both separate British Protectorates managed independently.\nFor purposes of becoming one and also getting independence from Britain, these two Protectorates entered into an agreement negotiated by the British Government under Her Majesty\u2019s permission to become a unitary state of the Republic of Zambia with conditions that guarded the agreement.\nThis paper looks at this agreement and its conditions, as well as the reason why the said agreement is claimed to have been breached by successive governments since 1970s. The Barotse Royal Establishment and its people has claimed that government has completely abandoned the agreement leading to the conflict. \nClaims of seceding from the country have been sounded by some groups belonging to the Barotse Roya Establishment or those propagating the rights of the Barotseland and its people, which the successive governments of Zambia have paid lip service or completed ignored. In some instances the Barotse people staged protests some of which ended up into fatal riots where lives were lost in the fights with law enforcement officers.\nEfforts have been made to try and resolve the impasse but to date nothing tangible has been achieved and the conflict continues taunting the country. Against this background this study was taken to establish the causes of this conflict and suggest recommendations which could be employed to resolve it before it could rage out of hand into a civil strife.\nA Desk review method complimented by a randomly selected sample of 100 questionnaire respondents in all the 10 provinces was used to analyse documents, reports, papers and any other data available in the public domain to ascertain the problem\u2019s root cause. \nFrom the findings achieved from this process, it was discovered that truly the Barotse agreement of 1964 was breached by the Zambian Government firstly when changes were made to the constitution in 1973 after a constitution review commission recommendation which allowed the ruling party then to become supreme over any other bodies in the country thus defaulting in its dealings with the Barotse Royal Establishment as was tabulated in the agreement.\nThis went on even after the said party was removed from government because the other parties that took over from it did not want to go back to the original conditions of the agreement in fear of making the area strong in their own views. Many commissions, those on constitution reviews and others particularly appointed to investigate happenings of riots in the area that caused deaths, have made recommendations to the successive governments to allow the full implementation of the agreement based on the original conditions in order to resolve the conflict but the governments have refused to take them.\nThe majority of the 100 people interviewed in all the 10 provinces acknowledge that there was a problem and that the government should either go back to the agreement conditions and start to implement them or called for round table to settle the problem instead of paying lip service. They believed that even if the advocate of the Barotse agreement implementation were considering secession from Zambia, a better solution could be brokered if serious efforts were put in. Other have suggested the implementation of a liberal system of governance which would give powers to the Barotse Royal Establishment like any other bodies in other provinces to run their own affairs but report to the central government. This is the general view of all over the issue and it is believed if tried the problem would become a thing of the past.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56506577, "asset_id": 36579824, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10997793, "first_name": "Kelvin", "last_name": "Kakanku", "domain_name": "uoc", "page_name": "KKakanku", "display_name": "Kelvin Kakanku", "profile_url": "https://uoc.academia.edu/KKakanku?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10997793/15274567/15938611/s65_kelvin.kakanku.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 34636435, "title": "\u0421\u0425\u0406\u0414\u041d\u041e\u0423\u041a\u0420\u0410\u0407\u041d\u0421\u042c\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u041a\u041e\u041d\u0424\u041b\u0406\u041a\u0422 \u0412 \u041a\u041e\u041d\u0422\u0415\u041a\u0421\u0422\u0406 \u0413\u041b\u041e\u0411\u0410\u041b\u042c\u041d\u0418\u0425 \u0422\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0421\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c\u0410\u0426\u0406\u0419 \u0417\u0411\u0406\u0420\u041a\u0410 \u041d\u0410\u0423\u041a\u041e\u0412\u0418\u0425 \u041f\u0420\u0410\u0426\u042c", "created_at": "2017-09-21T10:46:32.641-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34636435/%D0%A1%D0%A5%D0%86%D0%94%D0%9D%D0%9E%D0%A3%D0%9A%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%87%D0%9D%D0%A1%D0%AC%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%99_%D0%9A%D0%9E%D0%9D%D0%A4%D0%9B%D0%86%D0%9A%D0%A2_%D0%92_%D0%9A%D0%9E%D0%9D%D0%A2%D0%95%D0%9A%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%86_%D0%93%D0%9B%D0%9E%D0%91%D0%90%D0%9B%D0%AC%D0%9D%D0%98%D0%A5_%D0%A2%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%A1%D0%A4%D0%9E%D0%A0%D0%9C%D0%90%D0%A6%D0%86%D0%99_%D0%97%D0%91%D0%86%D0%A0%D0%9A%D0%90_%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%A3%D0%9A%D0%9E%D0%92%D0%98%D0%A5_%D0%9F%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%A6%D0%AC?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_34636435", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54497918, "asset_id": 34636435, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3649928, "first_name": "Nataliia", "last_name": "Kryvoruchko", "domain_name": "cuni", "page_name": "NataliiaKryvoruchko", "display_name": "Nataliia Kryvoruchko", "profile_url": "https://cuni.academia.edu/NataliiaKryvoruchko?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3649928/1285919/17812756/s65_nataliia.kryvoruchko.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4222, "name": "Hybrid Systems", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Systems?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14275, "name": "Ukrainian Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukrainian_Nationalism?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27728, "name": "Politics of Ukraine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Ukraine?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52236, "name": "Foreign Policy of Ukraine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Policy_of_Ukraine?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63322, "name": "Russian-Ukrainian Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian-Ukrainian_Relations?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 1552434, "name": "Ukraine conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ukraine_conflict?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 24514910, "title": "Economic Cooperation in the South Caucasus and the Wider Region: gained losses, lost benefits", "created_at": "2016-04-18T02:23:33.679-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24514910/Economic_Cooperation_in_the_South_Caucasus_and_the_Wider_Region_gained_losses_lost_benefits?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_24514910", "summary": "The past two and a half decades in the South Caucasus leave little hope to entertain for the eventual integration of the region. So far the fragmentation of the South Caucasus into different blocks is the only reality. The different integrational processes and transnational alliances that the South Caucasus countries have engaged in surely contribute to the creation of new spaces for cooperation, but also to the perpetuation of the conflicts in the region. In fact, often conflicts have been defining the design and implementation of these transnational alliances and integrational processes. With this reality, regional transnational integration as an avenue for conflict resolution seems to be part of a vicious circle since conflict resolution is often seen as a precondition for regional integration. This is not only due to the conflicts within and among the countries, but also to the complex and sometimes strained relations with the big neighbors \u2013 Turkey, Iran, and Russia.\n\nThis paper aims to explore economic options for inserting a wedge in this vicious circle. Convinced that regional economic cooperation could be an important step towards conflict transformation in the South Caucasus, this paper suggests that the prospects of such integration be considered. Be it in the form of exploring opportunities in the different integrational paths that the countries of the South Caucasus have taken or challenging the isolationist economic policies that have outlived their goals and utility, this paper offers all stakeholders to look at economic cooperation with rather than against each other as the option that could lead to the resolution of conflicts in the region.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45593646, "asset_id": 24514910, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 201962, "first_name": "Pinar", "last_name": "Sayan", "domain_name": "beykoz", "page_name": "PinarSayan", "display_name": "Pinar Sayan", "profile_url": "https://beykoz.academia.edu/PinarSayan?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/201962/771794/3917323/s65_pinar.sayan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4424, "name": "Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-conflict_Reconstruction_and_Development?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5065, "name": "Community Development & Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development_and_Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10966, "name": "Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkey?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 16211, "name": "Ethnic Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 16681, "name": "Economic integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_integration?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 17595, "name": "Conflict prevention and resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_prevention_and_resolution?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 20520, "name": "Peace & Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies-3?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 28981, "name": "Ethnic Conflict and Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict_and_Civil_War?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 33668, "name": "Georgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georgia?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 33669, "name": "Azerbaijan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Azerbaijan?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 33670, "name": "Armenia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Armenia?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 41863, "name": "Russia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russia?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 52234, "name": "Peace and Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 73105, "name": "Conflict Analysis and Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Analysis_and_Resolution?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 75162, "name": "South Caucasus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Caucasus?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 123202, "name": "Post-Conflict Reconciliation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Conflict_Reconciliation?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 169511, "name": "Ethnic Conflicts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflicts-1?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 636840, "name": "Conflict and Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_and_Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 931986, "name": "Post Conflict Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Issues?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 50750106, "title": "Art and conflict transformation.

avoid conflict. The church in particular is not devoid of conflict of all kinds. Church leaders and other stakeholders in the church have not only to resolve these conflicts, they have to also transform the conflicts and ensure that people live in peaceful coexistence as much as it is possible. The advent of the Internet in general and social media in particular has affected the way people are doing things tremendously. This includes conflict transformation in the church as well. This paper gives a brief introduction to conflict transformation in general and conflict transformation specifically in the church. It gives a brief biblical basis on conflict transformation. Furthermore, it delves extensively on the biblical basis for conflict transformation in churches through social media. It concludes that stakeholders in the church should blend theology together with technology, especially the social media, in transforming conflicts that are arising within the church.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66029965, "asset_id": 45552618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31246838, "first_name": "Adebayo", "last_name": "Afolaranmi", "domain_name": "leadcity", "page_name": "AdebayoAfolaranmi", "display_name": "Adebayo Afolaranmi", "profile_url": "https://leadcity.academia.edu/AdebayoAfolaranmi?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31246838/9192289/93049014/s65_adebayo.afolaranmi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 265632, "name": "Theology and Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology_and_Religious_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 873508, "name": "PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE IN A RELIGIOUS PLURALISTIC SOCIETY.", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PEACEFUL_CO-EXISTENCE_IN_A_RELIGIOUS_PLURALISTIC_SOCIETY?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 873513, "name": "PEACEFUL CO-EXISTENCE IN A MULTI-RELIGIOUS SCIETY", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PEACEFUL_CO-EXISTENCE_IN_A_MULTI-RELIGIOUS_SCIETY?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 29384410, "title": "Coordinating Organizations into Coherent Approaches to Human Security: the Italian Way and the implementation of the Civil Peace Corps concept (NOV 2015)", "created_at": "2016-10-24T01:10:07.852-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29384410/Coordinating_Organizations_into_Coherent_Approaches_to_Human_Security_the_Italian_Way_and_the_implementation_of_the_Civil_Peace_Corps_concept_NOV_2015_?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_29384410", "summary": "This dissertation is conceived to be a contribution to the understanding of the Italian \u201cCivil Peace Corps\u201d Concept, as a tool delivering non-violent conflict transformation actions of positive peace, contributing to Human Security interventions within National, European and International \u201cEarly Warning Systems\u201d, Conflict Prevention and Crisis Management Operations. It is, anyway, not concerned on how to run these interventions, taking into brief account the existing framework, into which an institutionalized implementation of the Italian CPC concept would find its place, as an instrument complementary to others.\nThis thesis is, therefore, aimed to address the following question: could the institutionalised development of the Italian CPC Concept be considered as a potentially useful tool, in the framework of comprehensive approaches to HS in EWS, CP and CMO? The tentative answer is organized in five chapters, giving overviews over: the international CA to CM; the Italian approach to a HS CM; the CPC concept; the path towards a CPC institutionalisation in Italy; the potential usefulness of the CPC in the current system with education, training and employment issues, considering also cultural concerns in the background, aiming to give an answer to the main question, in the most comprehensive way.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49826948, "asset_id": 29384410, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33395005, "first_name": "Davide", "last_name": "Galliolo", "domain_name": "unipd", "page_name": "DavideGalliolo", "display_name": "Davide Galliolo", "profile_url": "https://unipd.academia.edu/DavideGalliolo?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33395005/9876558/12066036/s65_davide.galliolo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4424, "name": "Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-conflict_Reconstruction_and_Development?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5521, "name": "Crisis Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crisis_Management?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8993, "name": "Nonviolence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nonviolence?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 10678, "name": "Human Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Security?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 13078, "name": "Peacekeeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacekeeping?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 14370, "name": "Conflict Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Management?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 24048, "name": "Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 67955, "name": "Human Rights, International Development, Diversity, Training, Capacity Building, Peacebuilding, Corporate Social Responsibility Youth Leadership, Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_International_Development_Diversity_Training_Capacity_Building_Peacebuilding_Corp?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 135260, "name": "Civil Defense", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Defense?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 142487, "name": "Civil Society and Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Society_and_Peacebuilding?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 188145, "name": "Peace Corps", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Corps?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 239765, "name": "Scienze per la Pace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scienze_per_la_Pace?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 334667, "name": "Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protection_of_Civilians_in_Armed_Conflict?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 360086, "name": "Comprehensive Approach", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comprehensive_Approach?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 524561, "name": "Italian security and defence policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italian_security_and_defence_policy?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 572443, "name": "Conflict and Conflict Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_and_Conflict_Management?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 922245, "name": "CIMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CIMIC?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 986660, "name": "Conflict Management and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Management_and_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 1883059, "name": "Nonviolenza", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nonviolenza?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 2039169, "name": "Difesa Civile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Difesa_Civile?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 2504139, "name": "Difesa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Difesa?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 2552365, "name": "Alexander Langer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alexander_Langer?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 6925201, "title": "Barriers toward peace in southern Thailand", "created_at": "2014-04-30T19:55:03.692-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6925201/Barriers_toward_peace_in_southern_Thailand?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_6925201", "summary": "The history of talks with former-separatists since 2004 and recent government attempts at building trust with the local population have yet to achieve any noticeable results in troubled southern Thailand.

Certain local and external factors also shape the conflict, such as the role of Malaysia as a safe-haven for insurgents and the role of the black-economy in the region.

Agreement of 1998, particularly examining the tensions between public policy, arts management, and the experiences of practitioners and participants. The key focus will be an analysis of the ways in which organizational contexts have enhanced or restricted the potential for critically reflective practice. As has been discussed in a previous article by M. Jennings and A. Baldwin, the prioritization within cultural development organizations of adhering to \u2018top-down\u2019 funding agendas and evaluation criteria has neglected consideration of the real challenges faced and the achievements attained by facilitators and participants within the context of specific projects. The complexity of the relationships between artists, cultural development organizations, funding bodies and the state have made it difficult for community artists to establish and transmit the values and significance of their own practice. The tensions between these stakeholders have undermined both the efficacy of community arts practice and the credibility of cultural development policy within contemporary Northern Ireland. The controversies, scepticism and even bomb attacks on the offices of the UK City of Culture company in Derry/Londonderry during the last two years indicate the risks of failure in these areas.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39027436, "asset_id": 16512374, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 269011, "first_name": "Matt", "last_name": "Jennings", "domain_name": "ulster", "page_name": "MattJennings", "display_name": "Matt Jennings", "profile_url": "https://ulster.academia.edu/MattJennings?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/269011/56080/51716/s65_matt.jennings.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1125, "name": "Cultural Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Policy?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5119, "name": "Community Cultural Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Cultural_Development?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6152, "name": "Applied Drama/Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Drama_Theatre?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17287, "name": "Arts Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_Management?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 541787, "name": "Applied Drama and Theatre, Community Drama, Theatre for Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Drama_and_Theatre_Community_Drama_Theatre_for_Development?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 1156425, "name": "Arts and Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_and_Health?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 39846768, "title": "\u00ab L\u2019activit\u00e9 diplomatique pendant les campagnes militaires de l\u2019empereur byzantin (Xe-XIIe si\u00e8cle) \u00bb, dans Guerre et Paix dans le Proche Orient m\u00e9di\u00e9val (Xe-XVe s.), \u00e9d.

Consequently, a resilient social fabric becomes crucial for people to feel included and empowered by their differences. The quality of relationships and the social environments, within which they are constantly being formed, are critical for successfully addressing divisive challenges and the destructive conflicts they might spawn. This chapter proposes a framework of three considerations for transforming conflict: 1. The mode of relationship- how the Self relates to the Other, 2. The perception of conflict, and 3. The social environment and the role of leadership in constructing dialogic environments. Revisiting assumptions pertaining to these considerations can support a shift from the unit of the individual (typically characterizes Western cultural and scientific traditions) to a relational unit. This shift is proposed as a premise for long-term transformation from adversarial interactions into dialogic relations. The latter is suggested as a constructive mode of relationship: a way of being with one another in which self and the other actively and equally co-create reality and relating to one another in their own terms. The chapter concludes with an example from an educational environment within which a relational transformation took place by integrating both micro efforts- consciousness raising to relational forms and dynamics, and macro work of restructuring the social context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65480360, "asset_id": 10514710, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2682119, "first_name": "Tzofnat", "last_name": "Peleg-Baker", "domain_name": "camden-sbc-rutgers", "page_name": "TzofnatPelegBaker", "display_name": "Tzofnat Peleg-Baker", "profile_url": "https://camden-sbc-rutgers.academia.edu/TzofnatPelegBaker?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2682119/25491227/41686289/s65_tzofnat.peleg-baker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 240, "name": "Organizational Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Psychology?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 956, "name": "Organizational Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Communication?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1324, "name": "Organizational Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Change?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2919, "name": "Organizational Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Culture?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 10431, "name": "Organizational Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Leadership?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 13614, "name": "Conflict Resolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 17802, "name": "Diversity & Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity_and_Inclusion?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 19707, "name": "Social Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inclusion?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 42465, "name": "Organizational Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Organizational_Development?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 143965, "name": "Social Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Conflict?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 199285, "name": "Strategic Change and Organizational Transformations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strategic_Change_and_Organizational_Transformations?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 627973, "name": "Conflict Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Engagement?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 960599, "name": "Conflict Resolution and Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Resolution_and_Transformation?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 3081420, "title": "\u201cPro-Peace Entrepreneur\u201d or \u201cConflict Profiteer\u201d?

Instead, this article proposes an alternative approach that may help to understand the personal and structural dimensions that make up a business response to peace and conflict. These two dimensions, which can be better understood in terms of a business actor's self-interests, motivations, and the economic incentive structures and mechanisms, are central in shaping businesses' attitudes and responses toward peace and conflict. The personal and structural dimensions may provide an analytical framework that distinguishes between business actors who might want to benefit from political instability and conflict and those who may want to support peace initiatives. In this article, these two categories of the private sector are referred to as \u201cconflict profiteers\u201d and \u201cpro\u02d7peace entrepreneurs\u201d respectively. While the business activities of a conflict profiteer may exacerbate conflict dynamics, by contrast a pro-peace entrepreneur can contribute to building peace in Nepal.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37959147, "asset_id": 3081420, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1104380, "first_name": "DB", "last_name": "Subedi", "domain_name": "une-au", "page_name": "DBSubedi", "display_name": "DB  Subedi", "profile_url": "https://une-au.academia.edu/DBSubedi?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1104380/384447/78791084/s65_db.subedi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1452, "name": "Corporate Social Responsibility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corporate_Social_Responsibility?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1778, "name": "Economics of Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economics_of_Conflict?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 13119, "name": "Post-Conflict and Recovery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Conflict_and_Recovery?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 16946, "name": "Nepal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nepal?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 24048, "name": "Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 55375, "name": "Private Sector Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Private_Sector_Development?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 100919, "name": "Politics of Economics and War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Economics_and_War?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 165281, "name": "Post-War Reconstruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-War_Reconstruction?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 401115, "name": "Business, Economy and Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_Economy_and_Peace?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 466484, "name": "Private Sector", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Private_Sector?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 512540, "name": "Post Conflict Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Development?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 609104, "name": "Peace and Conflicts Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflicts_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 891178, "name": "Private Sector in Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Private_Sector_in_Development?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 911440, "name": "Business and Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Business_and_Peace?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 931986, "name": "Post Conflict Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Issues?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 30480388, "title": "AVERTING CONFLICT IN EUROPE: International Crisis Management And The Role Of OSCE Field Operations", "created_at": "2016-12-16T05:45:23.194-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30480388/AVERTING_CONFLICT_IN_EUROPE_International_Crisis_Management_And_The_Role_Of_OSCE_Field_Operations?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_30480388", "summary": "Until the late 15th century, the term \u201ccrisis\u201d \u2013 from Greek krinein \u201cto decide\u201d \u2013 denoted the turning point of a grave illness, a change that leads either to patient\u2019s recovery or death. Today, an international crisis, if not averted, can result in the death of millions of people. \n\nSince the end of World War II, the UN has played a major role in preventing political disagreements, military accidents, ethnic and religious tensions from turning into large-scale armed conflicts. The OSCE has been one of the key organizations to share this responsibility with the UN, focusing primarily on the European continent. The OSCE\u2019s crisis management capabilities began to grow in the early 1990s. During this process, the dissolution of Yugoslavia and of the Soviet Union triggered an ad hoc creation of OSCE field operations, now a key instrument in the OSCE\u2019s crisis management toolkit. The first long-term OSCE operation \u2013 the Observation Mission of Long Duration in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina \u2013 commenced in 1992. Soon after, further field operations were established in the Western Balkans, Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and Central Asia. \n\nSince their creation, OSCE field operations have demonstrated mixed results in their crisis management work. The OSCE Centre in Bishkek was unable to avert the 2010 crisis in Kyrgyzstan. Not only did it turn violent, but also its death toll was higher than in the previous 1990 Kyrgyzstan\u2019s inter-ethnic clashes. Tajikistan, Moldova and FYROM, despite their earlier history of civil and separatist wars, have only experienced minor conflicts in recent years. And many crises were averted from turning violent, not without the contribution made by the OSCE field operations in these three countries. Finally, Ukraine, which had not gone through even a minor armed conflict during its late Soviet and post-independence history, since 2014 has been coping with a crisis that has already taken almost 10,000 lives, and which the OSCE was not able to prevent. \n\nThe central research question of this study is: Why have some OSCE field operations been more effective in crisis management than others? \n\nThis study aims at providing academic advice that could inform policy and aid in improving the OSCE\u2019s operation and strategy. It, therefore, analyzes the factors that lie firmly in the hands of the OSCE and of its participating States: the mandates of OSCE field operations and the resources at their disposal. \n\nThe study is based on document and secondary literature analysis. Where necessary, we requested information from respective OSCE field operations. \n\nThe paper is organized as follows. The next chapter provides a brief overview of the current policies and the state of the art in international crisis management in general and the role of OSCE field operations therein in particular. In the second chapter, we present our theoretical model of crisis management success. The third chapter lays out the case selection, research method and design. The fourth chapter is a case study that offers empirical evidence to assess our hypothesis. The final results and the main findings of the study are summarized in the conclusions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58070346, "asset_id": 30480388, "asset_type": "Work",

The paper begins by critiquing the rise of democracy promotion, and then employs a political economy framework to understand the more focused research on democratisation and elections. The paper highlights some of the major features of the Afghan case that provided a backdrop for the 2014 election: a deeply divided society, a highly militarised and invasive international presence, and a history of flawed elections. This discussion helps contextualise the seemingly technical questions about constitutional design, electoral systems and the organisation and monitoring of elections. It is argued that the pursuit of elections and democratisation efforts more broadly, in a context of growing insecurity and political fragmentation, have had unintended and perverse effects. The concluding section sets out the main themes of the individual contributions that follow.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50808102, "asset_id": 30355342, "asset_type": "Work",

to Imperial Japan by China's Qing dynasty in 1895, fifteen years prior to Japan's annexation of Korea. Like Korea, Taiwan's women and girls were subsequently conscripted into Japan's military \" comfort women \" (ianfu) system. The author notes significant differences between the treatment of the women in the two colonies and in the remembrance of the comfort woman systems. In Korea, dozens of comfort women statues and memorials commemorate the system's victims 1 while not one such statue exists in Taiwan. In December 2016, eighteen years after Korea opened its first of two comfort women museums, the Ama (Grandmother) Museum was opened in Taipei. While the museum in Taipei chronicles the Taiwanese comfort women's plight, its message represents more than an indictment of Japan or a pursuit of redress for the system's victims. The museum and its sponsors find ways to apply the lessons of this tragedy to the ongoing challenges of human trafficking and domestic violence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57541729, "asset_id": 37564658, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 94866454, "first_name": "Thomas", "last_name": "Ward", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ThomasWard28", "display_name": "Thomas Ward", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ThomasWard28?f_ri=232775", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 8017888, "title": "The 2013 Kuala Lumpur Talks: A step forward for southern Thailand", "created_at": "2014-08-18T21:55:15.184-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8017888/The_2013_Kuala_Lumpur_Talks_A_step_forward_for_southern_Thailand?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_8017888", "summary": "In 2013, talks were held in Kuala Lumpur between Thailand\u2019s National Security Council (NSC) and representatives of the Malay-Muslim separatist group Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN).

This article critically examines the turbulent ten month period from the February 28th declaration in Kuala Lumpur to the December 29th announcement by General Prayuth Chan-ocha that the military, and not the NSC, would represent Thailand at the next round of talks. This article also evaluates the positive aspects of the talks and the current barriers toward further progress for peace in the region.

For the development of this research, we considered ethnography for peace (ethnope- ace) as a methodology to analyze the weave of interactions within the academic community, as well as some fundamental theories of philosophy, pedagogy, peace education and conflicts. The concept of liberating peace is proposed as a Latin American contribution to peace studies because it offers a decolonizing perspective that en- ables local narratives.

The 2018 UN and World Bank report, Pathways for Peace, asserts that \u2018addressing inequalities and exclusion\u2019 and \u2018making institutions more inclusive\u2019 are key to preventing violent conflict. The challenges now are to strengthen that consensus and to better understand what inclusion in peace processes means in practice. These have been the questions explored in the Political Settlements Research Programme (PSRP), which this publication is part of (see inset below).\r\n\r\nSean Molloy and Borja Paladini, drawing on recent experiences with the Barometer Initiative in Colombia, show how more inclusive monitoring mechanisms can open up the implementation of a peace process to a range of new,  previously marginalised actors. They suggest that the sustainability of an agreement refers to the degree to which it is implemented, which means translating commitments into norms, institutions, policies and concrete actions \u2013 a long,  uncertain and complex process.

Whilst gravitating to violence might come naturally there is a realistic alternative nonviolent option to deal with conflict or even strong repression. The key source of power of nonviolent action is the indigenous people and the cooperation of different stakeholders. This paper takes a look at the conflict in Zimbabwe and proposes non-violent action that can be undertaken to bring about change. The preparatory stage is a crucial component of a nonviolent strategy that must not be overlooked in order to achieve successful democratic revolution. There is need to train and educate both the security personnel and the ordinary citizens in issues of governance, security sector reforms and the dangers of authoritarian rule. Zimbabwe finds itself at a crossroad where critical choices need to be made. People have to decide on what action they need to take so as to end the injustices they have become so accustomed to. A very plausible option is to embark on the civilian-based resistance route. However, non-violent action needs to be accompanied with strong strategic thinking and communication skills. It will also require a lot of community mobilisation and training. Ordinary citizens need to be skilled on how to act non-violently when faced up with a violent reaction to their demands.\n\nKey words: non-violent action, conflict resolution, Zimbabwe, civilian-based resistance, alternative non-violent action\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46009056, "asset_id": 25671657, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

There has been recognition that after the end of the Cold War with its externally financed proxy wars, a different type of internally financed wars had taken root. Analysts discerned civil wars that relied heavily on various means of war-related income: the skimming of valuable assets and resources the country in question possessed; the wheeling and dealing of black markets and informal market segments; legal and illegal trading networks across borders, involving diaspora communities as well as smugglers' networks. Economics could no longer be seen as a separate, apolitical sphere. Instead, it seemed to play a central role in sustaining violence and fighting. Economics thus gained prominence, both as a crucial aspect in thorough analyses of violent inter-group conflict and as a sector in society from which new actors \u2013 engaged in waging war or building peace \u2013 had to be factored in. We have decided to take up the issue of war economies in the context of the Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation \u2013 the dilemmas they pose and strategies that seem promising in addressing them \u2013 because a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics feeding into protracted ethnopolitical conflict is crucial for the conflict transformation community if they want to come up with innovative and successful initiatives to \" break the conflict trap \". In initiating this Berghof Handbook Dialogue, we were guided by a number of questions: How do economic motives and interests of various actors fuel the outbreak or continuation of violent conflict? How do such motives and interest influence the dynamics of contemporary violent conflict? Which, in fact, are the economic dynamics, actors and motivations at play? Which specific economic systems and structures emerge during protracted ethnopolitical conflict? And, moving from analysis to the practicalities of intervention and transformation: How can one design interventions that will not foster war economies which in turn fuel ongoing violence? What are appropriate policies, who are crucial actors to become involved?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45161714, "asset_id": 24837777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33221018, "first_name": "Martina", "last_name": "Fischer", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MartinaFischer", "display_name": "Martina Fischer", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MartinaFischer?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33221018/12537669/13950836/s65_martina.fischer.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4424, "name": "Post-conflict Reconstruction and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-conflict_Reconstruction_and_Development?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13078, "name": "Peacekeeping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacekeeping?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26151, "name": "Liberal Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Peacebuilding?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 28981, "name": "Ethnic Conflict and Civil War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Conflict_and_Civil_War?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 100919, "name": "Politics of Economics and War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Economics_and_War?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 125346, "name": "Peace and Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Security?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 198844, "name": "Security and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Security_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 474467, "name": "Postconflict Reconstruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postconflict_Reconstruction?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 512540, "name": "Post Conflict Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Conflict_Development?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 592997, "name": "Postconflict Peacebuilding Projects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postconflict_Peacebuilding_Projects?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 827660, "name": "Economy of war", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economy_of_war?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 76740185, "title": "\"Honorable Peace\" -A Utopian Idea", "created_at": "2022-04-17T13:24:32.194-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76740185/_Honorable_Peace_A_Utopian_Idea?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_76740185", "summary": "When the Ottoman Empire dissolved after WW I a unique opportunity arose for the Jewish people to at least partly rebuild their biblical state for the first time since the Romans had destroyed it. British Foreign Minister Balfour announced that opportunity in 1917; members of the Jewish people actualized the idea, partly against the resistance of the British. When, in 1947, the general public became aware that such a new state might indeed become a reality, since the UN General Assembly had suggested to dividing Palestine, the Arab neighbors attacked the not yet established Jewish state. But, coming from the still wide-open wound of the Holocaust, the determination of the Jews was overwhelming. Not only did they survive the attack, they were victorious and thus able to proclaim their state in 1948; one year later the Arab neighbors had to accept armistice. They could not prevent the Jewish state-but they insisted on their view that the territory of their new state had been taken illegally from Palestine. They accused the Jews of having robbed them of that land. And seeing themselves as the legal owners, they certainly were not willing to accept that. The actions of the Jews had stained the honor of the Palestinians, of the Muslims, and in order to restore that honor Israel must disappear. There was no other way to arrive at an honorable solution. Today, this view is still being voiced by Hamas. Thus, later on, when the Palestinians joined the Arab peace initiative, many had the impression of a capitulation to injustice, because, besides the fact that the entire Palestinian territory had meanwhile been occupied by the Israelis, there is no state of Palestine, and the Arab peace initiative seemed even to renounce the restoration of their honor in order to be able to negotiate acceptable living conditions for the Palestinians who were now all living under the diktat of the Israelis. Thus, no honorable peace is in sight. The missing element is essentially the elimination of the injustice. Yet, how could the injustice of an illegal occupation be undone? Today, only one line of action will be effective: coming to understand the situation the occupiers were in at that time and then donating the land, which they deemed to have been occupied illegally.

communication is an exceptionally diverse field, which encompasses many stimulating and creative subfields. Differences and similarities between them are grounded in the combination of theoretical frameworks that are adopted, and which become the backbone for both research and practice. Some of these areas are still emerging scholarships, with a need to integrate more consistently existing practical experiences with conceptual models developed through exploratory methods. The applied nature of peacebuilding and communication makes the grey literature in this field, comprising nongovernmental organizations\u2019 (NGO) reports and publications from other nonacademic actors, also noteworthy. Research in this area borrows from media studies, development studies, peace and conflict studies, sociology, psychology, and technology studies.

By the late 1960s the central concerns had broadened to issues of justice. Violence is no longer associated solely with war but with poverty. Structural violence is identified in political and social institutions and processes. Security refers not just to security\nfrom attack, but to \"livelihood security\" against sickness, early death and deprivation. The overlap with development studies is clear. There is however no direct link between disarmament and development. Scaling down military expenditure will not\nin itself advance development but will increase the potential for development. Peace and development are best conceived as processes rather than states. Degrees of peacelessness and development co-exist and interact and the two processes cannot be separated.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49011723, "asset_id": 28642165, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11456558, "first_name": "Diane", "last_name": "Hendrick", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DianeHendrick", "display_name": "Diane Hendrick", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DianeHendrick?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11456558/19749947/19597798/s65_diane.hendrick.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 977, "name": "Development Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Development_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2582, "name": "Interdisciplinarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interdisciplinarity?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8367, "name": "Complexity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Complexity?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 24837847, "title": "(with Norbert Ropers) Introduction, in Alex Austin, Martina Fischer and Norbert Ropers (eds.).

On the analytic level, therefore, we see it important to understand not only the bi-lateral relations between any two of the societies, but also the interrelationship among the three.

a comprehensive review of the conflict resolution and peace-building literature focused on the issues involved in assessing the impact of peace-making and peace-building through people-to-people contact. Findings reveal that we are still in the beginning stages of establishing frameworks for the resolution of wars and the building of peace and that there continues to be academic and political contestation over the definition of peace and peace-building. At the same time, this review identifies significant research progress in creating useful conceptual distinctions among the various modalities for peace, in establishing definitions that are both explanatory and remedial, and in recognizing the need for multi-faceted approaches to peace-making and peace-building. Likewise, the literature indicates a growing understanding of the various forms of people-to-people contact, their impact, their possibilities, and their limitations. Attempts are made to reconcile the tensions between structural and social-psychological approaches, and similarly, the contradictions between conflict resolution and social justice. Finally, directions for future research that address the impact, the effectiveness, and the possibilities for creating an infrastructure for a sustainable just peace.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86944109, "asset_id": 80623899, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 225518630, "first_name": "Michelle", "last_name": "Gawerc", "domain_name": "loyola", "page_name": "MGawerc", "display_name": "Michelle Gawerc", "profile_url": "https://loyola.academia.edu/MGawerc?f_ri=232775", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/225518630/82684718/71295109/s65_michelle.gawerc.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5175, "name": "Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dialogue?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17177, "name": "Conflict Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45578, "name": "Peacebuilding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peacebuilding?f_ri=232775", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 232775, "name": "Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict_Transformation_and_Peace_Studies?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 447363, "name": "Post conflict, Reconstruction, Peace building and Transitional Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_conflict_Reconstruction_Peace_building_and_Transitional_Justice?f_ri=232775"}, {"id": 790295, "name": "Protracted Social Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protracted_Social_Conflict?f_ri=232775"}]}, {"id": 43444178, "title": "QHuda Chapter Enhancing Skills Capacity Building Crescent Dove", "created_at": "2020-06-26T11:38:14.973-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43444178/QHuda_Chapter_Enhancing_Skills_Capacity_Building_Crescent_Dove?f_ri=232775", "dom_id": "work_43444178", "summary": "Imams and religious scholars are textually trained in theological sources.

Although the norm is that such sexual transactions are initiated by academics, evidence shows students also initiate such relationships. Consequently, efforts to eliminate this threat to academic integrity should not only focus on lecturers, but also be extended to students.
