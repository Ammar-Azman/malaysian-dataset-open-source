With a primary focus on Turkey, scholars have described this process as a policy of linguicide, or language genocide, which is \u201cthe extermination of languages, an analogous concept to (physical) genocide.\u201d2 In contrast, similar processes at work in southern Kurdistan (Kurdistan of northern Iraq) have often been described as \u201clinguistic suppression.\u201d3 This paper argues that linguistic suppression does not adequately describe the Iraqi Kurds\u2019 experiences. Rather, linguicide better captures the practices of cultural genocide that have targeted this group. This paper focuses on how the Kurds in modern-day Iraq were subjected to linguicide under the Language Education Policy (LEP) from 1932 to 1991. This policy was established during the monarchy (1921\u20131958), and advanced through the time of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime (1979\u20131991).4 While much scholarly work has associated the process of linguicide with the birth of a nation-state,5 this article further argues that linguicide in the Iraqi Kurdish case predates the formation of the Iraqi nation-state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63496583, "asset_id": 43227431, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1242802, "first_name": "Kaziwa", "last_name": "Salih (Ph.D)", "domain_name": "queensuniversity", "page_name": "KaziwaSalihPhD", "display_name": "Kaziwa Salih (Ph.D)", "profile_url": "https://queensuniversity.academia.edu/KaziwaSalihPhD?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1242802/452983/565410/s65_kaziwa.salih.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3972, "name": "Genocide Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genocide_Studies?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 34425, "name": "Monarchy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monarchy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 44343, "name": "Kurdish Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Language?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 74580, "name": "Iraq War", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iraq_War?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 92834, "name": "Arab nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arab_nationalism?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 238790, "name": "Saddam Hussein", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Saddam_Hussein?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 555084, "name": "Cultural Genocide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Genocide?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 792792, "name": "Iraqi Kurdistan Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iraqi_Kurdistan_Region?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1829565, "name": "Sati al-Husri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sati_al-Husri?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 2821678, "name": "Iraqi Baath Party", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iraqi_Baath_Party?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 31944206, "title": "Cornish language funding 2010-2016 as a political \u2018bribe\u2019", "created_at": "2017-03-20T08:35:00.377-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31944206/Cornish_language_funding_2010_2016_as_a_political_bribe_?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_31944206", "summary": "A transcript and video of a TV interview with Sir Eric Pickles MP on 20 March 2017, in which he agrees that the first large-scale central government funding for promoting the Cornish language, delivered from 2010 to 2016, was a political \u2018bribe\u2019 to secure fiscal savings in other areas of government from his Liberal Democrat coalition partners.

Using Chronbach\u2019s Alpha, Tonio and Ella\u2019s (2019) modified questionnaire garnered a 0.80 rating for reliability. The questionnaire was administered online, and the data were obtained from 70 secondary teachers of sixteen (16) public high schools in the Zamboanga del Sur province. The data were analyzed using the frequency and mean computation as well as thematic analysis. The results indicate that generally, the teachers disagree that the MTB-MLE policy is in good principle as they believe that it will not make the lessons interesting to students, and that it will not enable them to understand their lessons \neasily. In addition, some of the most recurring challenges associated with the policy include reading and instruction comprehension difficulties, degradation of English language literacy and proficiency, language and/or \ncommunication barrier between the teacher and the students, poor vocabulary and other grammar issues, teaching difficulty in Math, and difficulty in learning a second language (L2). Some recommendations obtained from the participants include the call for additional funding and support for MTB-MLE teachers, abolishing the policy and switching to the old curriculum, and revising some aspects of the policy to better suit the linguistic diversity of the country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85902816, "asset_id": 79050855, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 219311244, "first_name": "Friendly Mark H.", "last_name": "Andrino", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FriendlyMarkHAndrino", "display_name": "Friendly Mark H.

"work_14197806", "summary": "This paper delves into the \u201cprofound effect of globalization on education\u201d  specifically in the area of language learning and teaching vis-\u00e0-vis the use of Filipino and English in schools and eventually as part of lifelong skills.  Some decades back, the Philippines prided itself to have mastered the art of bilingualism with its people efficiently speaking both Filipino and English in classrooms and outside.  Prominent economist Solita Collas-Monsod (2003),  in fact, puts the Philippines as the third-largest English-speaking country in the world after the United States and the United Kingdom. However, recent findings caused the Philippine government to rethink of a better policy to contain the fast- deterioration of English-speaking, most importantly, among its people and to ensure the use of English as medium of instruction in schools to make its people \u201cglobally competitive\u201d while, at the same time, complying with the constitutional mandate on the use of Filipino.  \n\nTo fully grasp the country\u2019s current state of bilingualism, this paper looks into the effect of the advent of a \u201cglobalized education system\u201d, where learning is characterized by modern modes and strategies like e-learning, distance education, international joint-degree programs and partnerships, integrated study abroad modules, etc., which critiques consider as \u201cimpediment\u201d to productive learning.  Perhaps the most appropriate question that should be asked is \u201cHow does globalized education system impact on the bilingual communication skills and competencies of Filipinos?\u201d\n\nApparently, the Philippine government is confronted with the dilemma that the dwindling bilingual communication skills and competencies of Filipinos, as a comparative advantage over other Asian countries, will worsen even further and that Filipinos will eventually be left out in the globalized economy.  Center on this debate are issues whether to pursue English as the sole medium of instruction, or strengthen bilingual approach to education or review the policies involved in the proliferation of the \u201cglobalized education system\u201d.  A major policy issue, thus, remains crucial: can a \u201cglobalized education system\u201d indeed contribute to the development agenda of the Philippines and ensure the country in positioning its labor force in a globally competitive market?  The government believes that the Philippines\u2019 own historical experience itself evidenced a symbiotic relationship between enhancing the Filipinos\u2019 bilingual skills and becoming a globally competitive business environment.  Proponents for further strengthening Filipinos\u2019 English skills and competencies often argue on the bases of the Asian Street Journal (October 15, 2002 issue) where it noted of India\u2019s English skills and proficiency that has propelled the country\u2019s hi-tech industry and that which catapulted Singapore to be \u201cone of the world\u2019s most impressive economic success stories\u201d.   \n\nThis paper, however, strongly disagrees with so-called \u201ceducational Taylorism\u201d as suggested by William Tabb. The art of promoting bilingualism under the regime of a \u201cglobalized education system\u201d, unlike education per se, cannot be conducted in similar way that Henry Ford manufactured automobiles where \u201cskilled labor are broken down into a series of lower-skilled tasks, assigning some tasks to machines and imposing strict managerial control over the rest.\u201d  While at some point language learning and/or can be commodified and are sold through various modes and strategies, just like education as a whole, concrete policy standards have to be crafted if indeed such skills-enhancement is geared towards lifelong competencies for the Filipinos.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38232984, "asset_id": 14197806, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11337682, "first_name": "Alan", "last_name": "Villarante", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AlanVillarante", "display_name": "Alan Villarante", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AlanVillarante?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11337682/3318408/3904914/s65_alan.villarante.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1008, "name": "Second Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 21447, "name": "Bilingual Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 690370, "name": "Filipino Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Filipino_Language?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 19519259, "title": "Teacher Professional Education in Indonesia and ASEAN 2015: Lessons Learned From English Language Teacher Education Programs", "created_at": "2015-12-06T05:32:54.339-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19519259/Teacher_Professional_Education_in_Indonesia_and_ASEAN_2015_Lessons_Learned_From_English_Language_Teacher_Education_Programs?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_19519259", "summary": "The Indonesian government has a quality-oriented paradigm in teacher training, including training for English language teachers.

These initiatives were influenced by popular narratives about the challenges to Arabic learners in the usage of their mother-tongue, the diluted presence of the Arabic language in public space, and the relative lack of macro-level language policies in the UAE and the Gulf region more broadly. The government initiatives have sought to bring about a revival of Arabic language discourse in the public, educational and policy spheres. \n\nUsing a post-structuralist approach to the analysis of policy discourse, this study investigated the perceptions and problematizations of the recent Arabic language initiatives (ALI) of the UAE with a view to identifying the implications for the curriculum and pedagogy of the Arabic language. \n\nData were gathered by means of 29 semi-structured interviews, following the \u2018What\u2019s the problem represented to be\u2019 framework (WPR) proposed by Bacchi and Goodwin (2016b).  A discourse-historical analysis (DHA) approach was then used in order to interrogate the underpinning concepts of the Arabic language policy which impact on teaching and learning. \n\nThe findings suggest that the Arabic Language Initiatives of the UAE are political drivers that contributed to raising the profile of the Arabic language, yet they were not perceived to have filtered through the system sufficiently to affect learners\u2019 pedagogical experiences in the language. The data reflects a perceived policy practice gap reflected in the absence of an Arabic language education policy and an ambiguous regulatory landscape. The implications of this research bring to the fore new pathways for the development of Arabic language policy, pedagogical practices and curriculum planning in the UAE. In addition, the study suggests implications for the agenda of Arabic teacher preparation and the Arabic language content in public and virtual space. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Largely absent in reclassifcation scholarship is the consideration of how reclassifcation policies uniquely affect those learners with identifed disabilities. Applying an intersectionality lens that foregrounds political and structural critique, we conducted an interpretive policy analysis of reclassifcation policies in two states, New Mexico and California. In the analysis, we examined the coalescence of federal and state policies governing reclassifcation procedures along with assessment designs and\npractices as they impact the educational realities of emergent bilinguals with disabilities. The analysis illuminated how existing policies and practices marginalize emergent bilinguals with disabilities by making reclassifcation improbable for students with intersecting disability and second language acquisition needs. We argue that the unlikelihood of being reclassifed as Fluent-English Profcient has profound educational consequences for emergent bilinguals, who over time may become disproportionately represented in both special education as well as the long-term English learner population in schools.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56782205, "asset_id": 36830243, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4514098, "first_name": "Jamie", "last_name": "Schissel", "domain_name": "uncg", "page_name": "JamieSchissel", "display_name": "Jamie Schissel", "profile_url": "https://uncg.academia.edu/JamieSchissel?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4514098/1861217/2211020/s65_jamie.schissel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1750, "name": "Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18045, "name": "Language Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Assessment?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 48850, "name": "English Language Learners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_Learners?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 568909, "name": "Exceptional Childrens Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exceptional_Childrens_Education?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 38856552, "title": "Aspects of 'English language education' policies in Iran: 'Our own beliefs' or 'out of who you are'", "created_at": "2019-04-18T22:45:29.855-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38856552/Aspects_of_English_language_education_policies_in_Iran_Our_own_beliefs_or_out_of_who_you_are?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_38856552", "summary": "The worldwide English language teaching enterprise is mostly known by its professional and practical features such as teaching methodology and proficiency tests which tend to overshadow the cultural politics of language education and broader policy-level issues. To probe aspects of such less-addressed concerns and with a consideration of the crucial role of policies in education, including English language education, in this paper we explore officially stated English teaching policies in Iran as well as implicitly embraced de facto policy orientations in this area and their possible (mis)matches. Four major national documents bearing policy messages for English language education are examined as sources of overt national policies in this regard. Moreover, to observe parts of the related covert policies, we employ data obtained from interviews with teachers of private language teaching institutes as representative settings of real-life English teaching in Iran. Based on the illustration of the two types of policies and specifically considering the sociocultural implications of embracing or avoiding elements of these policies, we raise some concerns regarding the overall direction of English language education in Iran that could apply to the wider non-English-speaking world as well.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58951966, "asset_id": 38856552, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8753946, "first_name": "Seyyed-Abdolhamid", "last_name": "Mirhosseini", "domain_name": "fsasani", "page_name": "SeyyedAbdolhamidMirhosseini", "display_name": "Seyyed-Abdolhamid Mirhosseini", "profile_url": "https://fsasani.academia.edu/SeyyedAbdolhamidMirhosseini?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8753946/2938217/24398421/s65_seyyed-abdolhamid.mirhosseini.jpg"}, {"id": 110557087, "first_name": "Sepideh", "last_name": "Khodakarami", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SepidehKhodakarami", "display_name": "Sepideh Khodakarami", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SepidehKhodakarami?f_ri=119852", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99517, "name": "English as a Foreign Language (EFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_a_Foreign_Language_EFL_?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 126788, "name": "English Language Teaching (ELT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_Teaching_ELT_?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1118283, "name": "ELT In Iran", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ELT_In_Iran?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1750267, "name": "Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_to_Speakers_of_Other_Languages_TESOL_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 3205432, "name": "Sociopolitics of Language Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociopolitics_of_Language_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 3205443, "name": "EFL in Iran", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/EFL_in_Iran?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 3205472, "name": "English teaching policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_teaching_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 3205473, "name": "ELT policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ELT_policy?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 42983229, "title": "'In other schools you can plan it that way': A raciolinguistic perspective on dual language education", "created_at": "2020-05-08T13:43:45.331-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42983229/In_other_schools_you_can_plan_it_that_way_A_raciolinguistic_perspective_on_dual_language_education?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_42983229", "summary": "In recent years, there has been a massive expansion of dual language\neducation (DLE) programs across the United States.

transformation of education in the context of wider processes of economic, institutional, political, sociolinguistic and cultural changes. As Hong Kong changed from a former British colony to a Special Administrative Region (SAR, hereafter) of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the space of language education has seen the overlapping of old and new ideas regarding what languages should be learned or taught, by whom, when and to what degree.

This entry traces major works that have reported and described these processes, with attention to their implications for the existing language-in-education policies and practices in contemporary Hong Kong.

It aligns with the expansion beyond the multilingual turn (May 2013) to a transdisciplinary perspective that recognizes how languages are learned, used, lost, and revitalized in a multilingual world shaped and being shaped by ideologies and political power dynamics (Ortega 2013; Douglas Fir Group 2015). This calls for consideration of social, historical, and political factors, as well as sociopolitical and historical ecologies that shape concepts of heritage language and approaches to research and pedagogic approaches to heritage language education (van Deusen-Scholl 2003; Hornberger 2005; Tifonas and Aravossitas 2014, 2018). To highlight these dynamics, this chapter focuses on the case of Spanish as a heritage language in the United States - the most commonly taught heritage language, and the heritage language with greatest representation in the literature.

In this article, we seek to build on this tradition to envision a new approach to language activism for the twenty-first century. In particular, we advocate a materialist anti-racist approach to language activism that broadens what counts as language education policy to include a focus on the broader racial and economic policies that impact the lives of language-minoritized communities. In order to illustrate the need for a materialist anti-racist framing of language education policy we provide portraits of four schools in the School District of Philadelphia that offer dual language bilingual education programs. We demonstrate the ways that larger societal inequities hinder these programs from serving the socially transfor-mative function that advocates for these programs aspire toward. We end by calling for a new paradigm of language education policy that connects language activism with other movements that seek to address societal inequities caused by a myriad of factors including poverty, racism, and xenophobia.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53466091, "asset_id": 33412738, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8007173, "first_name": "Nelson", "last_name": "Flores", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "NelsonFlores", "display_name": "Nelson Flores", "profile_url": "https://upenn.academia.edu/NelsonFlores?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8007173/2797661/16905700/s65_nelson.flores.jpg"}, {"id": 3088711, "first_name": "Sofia", "last_name": "Chaparro", "domain_name": "ucdenver", "page_name": "SofiaChaparro", "display_name": "Sofia Chaparro", "profile_url": "https://ucdenver.academia.edu/SofiaChaparro?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3088711/1014791/1290052/s65_sofia.chaparro.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18091, "name": "Educational Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Linguistics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 29598802, "title": "Protestant missionaries language education in Amoy dialect in the 19th Century in Amoy China", "created_at": "2016-11-01T15:04:24.831-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29598802/Protestant_missionaries_language_education_in_Amoy_dialect_in_the_19th_Century_in_Amoy_China?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_29598802", "summary": "The purpose of this study is describe how Protestant missionaries\u2019 language education in Amoy dialect in Amoy was started in the 1850s, how it expanded to Tainan in the 1870s, and how it had strong effect on language education policy of the Taiwan Government-General in 1895.

The ethnographic material presented is based on the author\u2019s ten years living and working among bilingual urban Malays, and a year making regular visits to rural communities in Narathiwat. One of the few things that informed analysts of South Thailand agree on is that a range of factors contributed to the resumption of violence in 2004. In addition to the role of political legitimacy, there is consensus that progress towards peace is complicated by the involvement of uncivil constituencies from two highly ethnicised religious communities. Despite the importance of ethnoreligious issues this paper argues that ethnolinguistic dynamics\u23afspecifically language loyalty, loss, and angst\u23afhave much to contribute to the return of peaceful co-existence and reconciliation. Although religious freedom in Thailand is promised and present, few minority languages in Thailand are strong now than they were before policies promulgated in the 1930s. I introduce the range of positions on the role of language and multi-lingualism in the construction of difference and the achievement of peaceful co-existence. I describe the range mono-lingual and bilingual communities in South Thailand. I also recount the variety of ways that Southern Malays have responded to the decline of Malay and the importance of Thai for those wishing to engage in Thai modernity. There is a need to as informed by ethno-linguistic angst as ethno-religious rebellion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32924081, "asset_id": 5960398, "asset_type": "Work",

The challenge we face is the identification of the most convenient ways to organise the coexistence of different human language groups in order that we might promote their solidarity as members of the same culturally developed biological species in the globalization era.\r\n\r\nProcesses of economic and political integration currently in motion are seeing increasing numbers of people seeking to become polyglots. Thus, English is establishing itself as the usual world supra-language, although it coexists with other lingua francas that are widely used in certain parts of the globe. \r\n\r\nAll this communicative reorganization of the human species may very well pose new problems and aggravate existing tensions as regards language and identity. It would seem that these processes comprise at least four major conceptual dimensions which must be taken into account above all else, as they are both widespread and, left unaddressed, may lead to significant social instability. These dimensions concern linguistic recognition, communicability, sustainability and integration. \r\n\r\nWhile accepting the utility of having an inter-national language, the keystone of the system is clearly that it must ensure the linguistic sustainability of each group. The basic principle is likely to be functional subsidiarity, i.e., whatever can be done by the local language should not be done by another one which is more global. As in the quote from Paracelsus  --\u201cthe dose alone makes the poison\u201d-- contact between languages is not \u2018poisonous\u2019 per se, but when the correct dose is exceeded it can prove harmful to the language whose position is weaker.

Nevertheless, those concerned with religious factors dwarf the number of studies interrogating language issues. Without suggesting that language represents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue that anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand's southern impasse must be more informed about language policy, monolingual mind-sets, and linguistic justice, namely how linguistic repertoires and linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are theoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper's two substantive sections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and how the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states between South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok's policies towards southern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking Buddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South Thailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact with recent treatments of how language and religion are involved in constructions of ethno-nationalisms, and linguistic injustice that leads to inequality among linguist minorities. I conclude suggesting reasons for anyone seeking peaceful political resolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority possesses close connections to the Malay cosmopolis \u2013 needing address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand's (deeply entrenched) monolingual mind-set and discriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.",

Japan has recently promoted a number of initiatives that can be termed an opening to the world and the Asia-Pacific in particular. These have origins in Japan's globalization generally and multicultural policies more specifically. The chapters in this book are grouped in three sections - theories, language, and migration - and they explicate details of multiculturalism in the Asia-Pacific, largely focused on Japan, but including cases that extend beyond Japan as well. Alternative understandings based on analyzing conflicts and moving towards reconciliation underscore the urgency of viewing multiculturalism in Japan and the Asia-Pacific from perspectives that are firmly based in the region. Themes such as immigration, identity, foreign language education, politics and language, English language policies, dual citizenship, foreign labor policies and movements, and higher education are all addressed in the individual chapters. The book will be of interest to scholars of multiculturalism in a wide variety of fields.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55942848, "asset_id": 8364248, "asset_type": "Work",

The institutional change under study consisted of integrating standards through electronic portfolios. Teacher training provides an opportunity for students to enhance their status, as English is an international language. However, language and culture are interconnected, which situates English as a tool for influence, persuasion, and a subtle form of colonization to concepts proper to Western societies. Indeed, language is more than communication: It represents experience and social attitudes and links knowledge with demands for group worth. This article focuses on the dynamics of change. Participatory Action Science (PAS) was used as a design for the study. Participants documented their activity and were interviewed during the collaborative changes. The focus is on the clash between male and female positioning during the innovation process. The article is a reflection on how globalization shakes traditional obedience networks based on gender, how it impacts cultural change, and how it typifies seats of resistance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31626681, "asset_id": 4105601, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1109520, "first_name": "Francois", "last_name": "Tochon", "domain_name": "wisc", "page_name": "FrancoisVTochon", "display_name": "Francois V Tochon", "profile_url": "https://wisc.academia.edu/FrancoisVTochon?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1109520/460905/577446/s65_francois_victor.tochon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 101, "name": "Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 998, "name": "Language Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 5547, "name": "Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 11395, "name": "Economic Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Development?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 44868, "name": "City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/City?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 61225, "name": "ELT", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ELT?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 66080, "name": "Age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Age?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 72519, "name": "Education language policy and the languages roles in a multilingual context (East Timor)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_language_policy_and_the_languages_roles_in_a_multilingual_context_East_Timor_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 82489, "name": "State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 89536, "name": "Western Balkans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Balkans?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 122894, "name": "Teacher Education in Teaching English to Speakers of Second/Foreign Languages (TESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education_in_Teaching_English_to_Speakers_of_Second_Foreign_Languages_TESOL_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 134887, "name": "Census", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Census?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 146206, "name": "Education Policy for English Language Learners;

Without suggesting that language\r\nrepresents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue\r\nthat anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand\u2019s southern\r\nimpasse must be more informed about language policy, linguistic justice, and how\r\nlinguistic repertoires are linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

The article offers a critical reflection about the experience of the colonial non-autonomous U.S.-imposed school system, and contributes to teacher education and language education policymaking (LEP) by exploring the effect of displacements, schooling on identity, and the role teachers can play. The article is based on an analysis that broadened the notion of language and education policy to include standards, textbooks, and teaching practices. The research question is about indigenous identity in a context of not only colonial schooling but conflicting visions of history, and loss of oral tradition in lieu of standardized school-sanctioned knowledge. The article suggests that community and indigenous models and educational autonomy would be more sustainable, practical, and just than standardized notions of school.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58388757, "asset_id": 37452910, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34714863, "first_name": "Kristine", "last_name": "Harrison", "domain_name": "wisc", "page_name": "KristineHarrison", "display_name": "Kristine M .

reasons of criticism and negative reactions with which Quebec\u2019s language law is frequently met both inside and outside Canada. The article gives an overview of Quebec\u2019s language regulations, presenting them both in historical and contemporary contexts. The analysis is focused on three areas where the influence of Quebec\u2019s language law is most evident and, at the same time, most fervently debated, i.e. in business and commercial signage, in legislation and public administration, and in education. Quebec\u2019s linguistic regulations are presented in a wider context of the language laws adopted by other Canadian provinces and on the federal level. Such a comparative study of Canadian language regimes is aimed to examine: a) whether the criticism and ridicule that Quebec often receives for its language policy is deserved and justified, b) whether Quebec\u2019s language law is indeed so uncommonly restrictive by Canadian standards and practice. The article also evaluates the relevance and effectiveness of the Quebec language policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43516211, "asset_id": 23002885, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20753792, "first_name": "Tomasz", "last_name": "Soroka", "domain_name": "jagiellonian", "page_name": "TomekSoroka", "display_name": "Tomasz  Soroka", "profile_url": "https://jagiellonian.academia.edu/TomekSoroka?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20753792/8187881/9162211/s65_tomek.soroka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 381, "name": "Canadian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 534, "name": "Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 796, "name": "Comparative Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Politics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2412, "name": "Canadian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_History?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 4093, "name": "Qu\u00e9bec History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qu%C3%A9bec_History?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 12322, "name": "Canadian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Politics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 28808, "name": "Quebec", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quebec?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 178059, "name": "Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 263386, "name": "French Language -

Notwithstanding the political saliency of this debate over the last decades, no research has studied the preferences of the Catalans on the linguistic regime in the school system. This article is the first to consider Catalan opinions about this issue. Based on a survey of a representative sample of the Catalan population (N=2,200) launched in 2016, this article examines the preferences of the Catalan population regarding linguistic immersion and alternative linguistic policies. Results show that even when support for linguistic immersion and alternative policies are divided, preferences about the distribution of Catalan, Castilian and English teaching hours in the classroom are not polarised. The article also explores the alignment of preferences regarding linguistic policies and pro-independence sentiment in Catalonia, as well as the demand for English as a language of instruction.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 74805559, "first_name": "Andr\u00e9s", "last_name": "Santana", "domain_name": "uam", "page_name": "AndresAlejandroSantanaLeitner", "display_name": "Andr\u00e9s Santana", "profile_url": "https://uam.academia.edu/AndresAlejandroSantanaLeitner?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/74805559/18851347/24909522/s65_andres_alejandro.santana_leitner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 998, "name": "Language Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 18111, "name": "Political Language and Political Correctness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Language_and_Political_Correctness?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 29511, "name": "Language and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 59317, "name": "European language policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_language_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 153464, "name": "Language and Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Politics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 178059, "name": "Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 484227, "name": "Language in Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_in_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 492839, "name": "Education and language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_language?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 608979, "name": "Lingistics Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lingistics_Studies?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 2760792, "name": "Liverpool University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liverpool_University?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 34425700, "title": "INTERPOLICY DYNAMICS BETWEEN NONFORMAL  EDUCATION POLICY AND LANGUAGE POLICY OF INTERNATIONALISATION THROUGH  ILFS TEACHING IN INDONESIA", "created_at": "2017-08-31T06:46:08.286-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34425700/INTERPOLICY_DYNAMICS_BETWEEN_NONFORMAL_EDUCATION_POLICY_AND_LANGUAGE_POLICY_OF_INTERNATIONALISATION_THROUGH_ILFS_TEACHING_IN_INDONESIA?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_34425700", "summary": "Republic of Indonesia\u2019s Act Number 24 Year 2009 has mandated among other: (1) the obligation for overseas employees and workers to be proficient in Indonesian language, otherwise they need to be trained in Indonesian language classes; (2) the establishment of a language national agency which must be directly responsible to the minister; and (3) the increasing of Indonesian as the state language function to be an international language. Furthermore, the Government Regulation Number 57 Year 2014 emphasises the policy of Indonesian language internationalisation and it is stated that the policy is undertaken through Bahasa Indonesia bagi Penutur Asing (BIPA) or Indonesian Language for Foreign Speakers (ILFS) teaching program. Within the ILFS field itself, there are three major teaching providers which are: (1) universities, (2) agreement of cooperation schools, and (3) nonformal course and training institutions. This article is a policy analysis report which intends to expose the interpolicy dynamics existing in two education policies implementation; the internationalisation of Indonesian state language policy and the nonformal education policy. The research which is done qualitatively finds that there is an interpolicy synergy or a two-ways-support between the two policies in their implementation process. This is possible due to a good will for intersectoral cooperation and coordination among policy actors; two main governmental leading sectors of the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC), which are (1) the Directorate of Nonformal Courses and Trainings Nurturance (CTN) and (2) the Agency of Language Development and Nurturance (Language Agency), and some nongovernmental ILFS stakeholders, such as the ILFS professional association \u201cAPPBIPA\u201d, and the nonformal course and training providers (CTP) themselves.

In light of this, the article deals with Swedish-language summaries (SLSs) in English-language doctoral theses. It treats the SLS as an instrument of language regimentation, deliberately aimed at limiting the near-total dominance of English. Drawing on language policy documents , along with scholarly accounts and interview data, the article discusses the SLS as conceived by advocates in language policy and planning, university policy-makers, and active researchers. It is shown that the SLS is aimed at counteracting negative effects pertaining to knowledge outreach as well as register formation. I argue that there is a contradiction between these two aims: on the one hand, an SLS that is simple enough to bridge the gap between science and society is not likely to contribute to the expansion of advanced registers of Swedish; on the other hand, an SLS that takes seriously the task of expanding Swedish registers will be unintelligible for the wider audience. Yet, it may still serve as a reminder that languages other than English are worthy of consideration and use.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1836445, "first_name":

The teaching of these two languages offers a unique case of language education policy where categories of ideology, policy, curriculum, methods, and assessment intersect. For Arabs, Hebrew is perceived as a major tool for upward mobility, but findings show they are alienated by a curriculum embedded in the hegemonic culture and ideology, with which they can hardly identify. For Jews, Arabic is a language of low prestige, and their motivation is hindered by a curriculum which focuses mostly on formal language and security needs, and not on communicative, interactive skills. Concluding the paper, we propose an outline for the creation of alternative teaching environments that defy existing power structures and reinvent inclusive ecologies for the learning of both languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55954553, "asset_id": 25474985, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2417541, "first_name": "Iair", "last_name": "Or", "domain_name": "telaviv", "page_name": "IairOr", "display_name": "Iair Or", "profile_url": "https://telaviv.academia.edu/IairOr?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2417541/758920/943328/s65_iair.or.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9919, "name": "Teaching Arabic as a Foreign Language (TAFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_Arabic_as_a_Foreign_Language_TAFL_?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35930, "name": "Teaching Hebrew as a Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_Hebrew_as_a_Foreign_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 14836949, "title": "National and Global Issues in the Language Education Policy of Kazakhstan: Stagnating Attempts to Educate Multilingual Kazakhstanis", "created_at": "2015-08-10T18:41:39.501-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14836949/National_and_Global_Issues_in_the_Language_Education_Policy_of_Kazakhstan_Stagnating_Attempts_to_Educate_Multilingual_Kazakhstanis?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_14836949", "summary": "This presentation was made at  IX World Congress of International Council of Central and Eastern Europe Studies held in Makuhari, Japan, on 3-8th of August, 2015. \n With a collapse of Soviet Union in 1991, five Central Asian republics have gained independence and full freedom to build a new country in according with new aspirations and expectations. Consequently, education has been delegated crucial role to nurture new nation with a strong sense of belonging to this new country, and at the same time has been challenged by harsh rules of market economy and neoliberal values to educate and sustain competitive nation in the era of globalization. Thus, educational reforms have been implemented one after another, causing significant changes to contents and structure. Some of reforms are in progress and their outcomes are premature to be analyzed, but others have already brought to concrete results that are full of ambiguity. The biggest challenge is to preserve positive achievements of soviet education and to fit into requirements of global educational trends.\nThe purpose of this round table is to discuss variety of educational challenges in four Central Asian republics (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan). Young scholars from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Russia bring together problems of language education in Kazakhstan, citizenship education in Uzbekistan, school enrollment gap in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and problems of educational rights of labor migrants from Central Asian countries in Russia. We will draw commonalities and differences in the issues of nation-building and meeting challenges of globalization in these countries, and discuss the role of Russian educational influence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56569451, "asset_id": 14836949, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 173524, "first_name": "Kuanysh", "last_name": "Tastanbekova", "domain_name": "tsukuba", "page_name": "KuanyshTastanbekova", "display_name": "Kuanysh Tastanbekova", "profile_url": "https://tsukuba.academia.edu/KuanyshTastanbekova?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/173524/43401/20173197/s65_kuanysh.tastanbekova.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6032, "name": "Central Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_Asian_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29257, "name": "Globalization and education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_and_education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 84668, "name": "Educational Reforms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Reforms?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 85585, "name": "Kazakhstan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kazakhstan?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 9665908, "title": "Language management: a snapshot of governmentality within the private schools in Quetta, Pakistan", "created_at": "2014-12-07T17:40:11.559-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9665908/Language_management_a_snapshot_of_governmentality_within_the_private_schools_in_Quetta_Pakistan?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_9665908", "summary": "Pakistan is a multilingual and multiethnic country; however, this diversity stands unrecognized in the formal language-in-education policies. Estimates suggest that about 90 % of children who speak over 60 indigenous languages do not have access to education in their mother tongues. Linguists estimate that exclusive teaching of Urdu and English subjects the indigenous languages to physical endangerment as well as negative perceived vitality. This study investigated the language management techniques, practices and discourses of the school authorities about indigenous languages and linguistic diversity, and its effects on perceptions of the students. The study used the theoretical framework of governmentality as introduced by Foucault in The foucault effect: studies in governmentality with two lectures by and an interview with Michael Foucault, Harvester Wheatsheaf, London, (1991), which not only focuses on the direct acts of the governing of the state apparatuses, but also addresses the indirect acts of governance that shape individual behaviors. Deploying a mixed methodology that used students of high secondary level, teachers and school principals as sampling in 11 low-fee English-medium private schools in Quetta, Pakistan, the findings suggest that school authorities exercise stringent techniques such as notices, wall paintings, penalties and occasional punishment to suppress the use of languages other than Urdu or English. Mostly, the students also show compliance to the top-down policies. Most of participants perceive indigenous languages as worthless because of their lesser role in professional development and social mobility. The study concludes that the governance methods displace the indigenous languages both physically as well as perceptually. The prevailing orientations look upon languages as commodities, profoundly downgrading the cultural, literary, aesthetic and sociolinguistic dynamics of the indigenous languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36745781, "asset_id": 9665908, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1623393, "first_name": "SYED", "last_name": "ABDUL MANAN", "domain_name": "nu-kz", "page_name": "SYEDABDULMANAN", "display_name": "SYED ABDUL MANAN", "profile_url": "https://nu-kz.academia.edu/SYEDABDULMANAN?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1623393/566161/18260373/s65_syed.abdul_manan.jpg"}, {"id": 62375, "first_name": "Francisco", "last_name": "Dumanig", "domain_name": "uhh-hawaii", "page_name": "FranciscoDumanig", "display_name": "Francisco P .

These changes have impact on individual's personalities, thinking, and behavior; and the society takes a new look with distinguished characteristics. Ben Jonson, in Volpone, presents a group of diverse characters who seemed to be the representatives of the rising period of protocapitalist economic order. These characters are distinguished by what and how fraudulently they speak to others to boost money and wealth. They are in rivalry against each other, and mostly engaged in the acquirement of material goods over goodwill and moral obligation. Among others Volpone and Mosca are the leading representatives who constantly entice the different entrepreneurial potential to avariciously drive for money, and to finally shatter their hopes. The two mastermind plotters creatively shroud their true sort in entwining linguistic artifice merely to trick the wealth-maniac people by making themselves unsuspected and credible. The difference between right and wrong evaporates from society, and the principles and morality have been at stake.

Despite time and efforts spent and resources\nallocated, the success of EFL in Turkey is still questionable as the problem is versatile and associated with various factors.

However, the 1847 Report of the Commissioners of Enquiry into the State of Education in Wales was a convenient reason for the ensuing Anglicisation of education, which was best exemplified by the 'Welsh-Not(e)' penalties for pupils. The 1944 Butler Education Act facilitated the gradual re-introduction of Welsh into schools and nowadays every pupil in Wales has to attend Welsh classes. Nevertheless, the present situation of the language is substantially different from what it was in the 19th century. The primary aim of this paper is to examine how the position of the Welsh language in education has evolved over the last 200 years. The second aim is to juxtapose these findings with the changes in the number of Welsh speakers over the same period. The third issue approached in this text is whether there has been any correlation between the changing status of Welsh in education and the number of speakers thereof, or whether the current situation of Welsh results from other factors. To answer these questions, the author employs the concept of language policy, as defined by Bernard Spolsky, who contrasts overt language policies with covert ones and who acknowledges the importance of both governments and informal groups of citizens as language policy makers.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68221652, "asset_id": 50115324, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14254460, "first_name": "Pawe\u0142", "last_name": "Tuz", "domain_name": "szczecin", "page_name": "Pawe\u0142Tuz", "display_name": "Pawe\u0142 Tuz", "profile_url": "https://szczecin.academia.edu/Pawe%C5%82Tuz?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14254460/50977449/108719240/s65_pawe_.tuz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14574, "name": "Cymraeg - the Welsh language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cymraeg_-_the_Welsh_language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16164, "name": "Minority Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Languages?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 45163492, "title": "Book Review: The Routledge international handbook of language education policy in Asia (Routledge International Handbooks), Current Issues in Language Planning", "created_at": "2021-02-21T07:25:46.518-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45163492/Book_Review_The_Routledge_international_handbook_of_language_education_policy_in_Asia_Routledge_International_Handbooks_Current_Issues_in_Language_Planning?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_45163492", "summary": "This international handbook of language policy education provides a current analysis and assessment of the impact of language education policies in over 30 countries in Asia.

Since Heller (1996) developed the notion of \u2018legitimate language\u2019 to encompass issues of language choice, there has been a consensus that a legitimate language is a language that is appropriate in a given situation. However, a crucial issue remains to be addressed, namely that of knowing what benchmark do classroom participants use to know when a language is appropriate, that is, legitimate or not. To address this issue, this paper takes as an example the case of an induction classroom for newly-arrived immigrant children in France where multiple languages have been observed. A Conversation Analysis of a set of audio-recorded interactions reveals that whilst languages other than French are not legitimized by top-down language policies and ideologies held at the societal and institutional levels, they are nevertheless seen as legitimate according to the local \u201cpracticed language policy\u201d (Bonacina-Pugh 2012). This paper thus argues for a multi-layered understanding of legitimacy and shows how in the classroom under study, and possibly in other multilingual classrooms, practiced language policies play a key role in the legitimization of multilingual language practices.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54741320, "asset_id": 34881411, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 43850031, "first_name": "Florence", "last_name": "Bonacina-Pugh", "domain_name": "edinburgh", "page_name": "FlorenceBonacinaPugh", "display_name": "Florence Bonacina-Pugh", "profile_url": "https://edinburgh.academia.edu/FlorenceBonacinaPugh?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/43850031/17314144/70582944/s65_florence.bonacina-pugh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2847, "name": "Conversation Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conversation_Analysis?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7982, "name": "Legitimacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Legitimacy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 27336, "name": "France", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/France?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 127642, "name": "Superdiversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Superdiversity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 499361, "name": "Language-In-Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language-In-Education_Policy?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 78938024, "title": "Advocating an empirically-founded university admission policy", "created_at": "2022-05-10T11:17:59.074-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78938024/Advocating_an_empirically_founded_university_admission_policy?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_78938024", "summary": "Few studies have yet described concrete efforts by researchers in applied linguistics to systematically impact language policy.

The first part of the paper presents researchbased recommendations regarding language requirements for international students, the second focuses on mechanisms to communicate these recommendations to policy makers.

Estimates suggest that about 90 % of children who speak over 60 indigenous languages do not have access to education in their mother tongues. Linguists estimate that exclusive teaching of Urdu and English subjects the indigenous languages to physical endangerment as well as negative perceived vitality. This study investigated the language management techniques, practices and discourses of the school authorities about indigenous languages and linguistic diversity, and its effects on perceptions of the students. The study used the theoretical framework of governmentality as introduced by Foucault in The foucault effect: studies in governmentality with two lectures by and an interview with Michael Foucault, Harvester Wheatsheaf, London, (1991), which not only focuses on the direct acts of the governing of the state apparatuses, but also addresses the indirect acts of governance that shape individual behaviors. Deploying a mixed methodology that used students of high secondary level, teachers and school principals as sampling in 11 low-fee English-medium private schools in Quetta, Pakistan, the findings suggest that school authorities exercise stringent techniques such as notices, wall paintings, penalties and occasional punishment to suppress the use of languages other than Urdu or English. Mostly, the students also show compliance to the top-down policies. Most of participants perceive indigenous languages as worthless because of their lesser role in professional development and social mobility. The study concludes that the governance methods displace the indigenous languages both physically as well as perceptually. The prevailing orientations look upon languages as commodities, profoundly downgrading the cultural, literary, aesthetic and sociolinguistic dynamics of the indigenous languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 63156, "first_name": "Prof. Dr. Maya Khemlani", "last_name": "David", "domain_name": "malaya", "page_name": "ProfDrMayaKhemlaniDavid", "display_name": "Prof. Dr. Maya Khemlani David", "profile_url": "https://malaya.academia.edu/ProfDrMayaKhemlaniDavid?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/63156/17821/20194274/s65_prof._dr._maya_khemlani.david.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 10452, "name": "Linguistic diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_diversity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 46948, "name": "Bilingualism and Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_Multilingualism?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 123744, "name": "Language Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Studies?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 38227209, "title": "\u00bfEstandarizar lo diferente?

This auto-ethnographic exposition aims at offering a critical analysis of intercultural competence in the curricular documents of foreign languages, but also at providing a space for reflection and self-evaluation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58267479, "asset_id": 38227209, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6581974, "first_name": "Ana", "last_name": "Jovanovic", "domain_name": "bg", "page_name": "JovanovicAna", "display_name": "Ana Jovanovic", "profile_url": "https://bg.academia.edu/JovanovicAna?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6581974/4078558/5772472/s65_ana.jovanovic.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5991, "name": "Intercultural Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Education?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8910, "name": "Evaluation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Evaluation?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13639, "name": "Spanish as a Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spanish_as_a_Foreign_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33323, "name": "Intercultural Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Competence?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43492, "name": "Standardization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Standardization?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 80613, "name": "Interculturalidad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturalidad?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 201923, "name": "Foreign languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_languages?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1284807, "name": "Educational Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Ideology?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 2042640, "title": "(2012) Thai and Islamic Influences on Thailand\u2019s Southern Malays.

I begin by demonstrating how the local rise of Thai/Siamese influence coincided with growth of Islamic reformism. The subjugation of the Malay Kerajaan of Patani by Siamese forces between the 178Os and the 1820\u2019s led to an exodus of \u2018ulama to Mecca at a tumultuous time. The writings and returning students of Malay-Indonesian scholars based in Mecca began to challenge traditionalist orthopraxy in Pattani before Siam increased its attempts to assimilate its southern subjects following the 1909 Anglo-Siamese Treaty. The governments of General Prem Tinsulanonda negotiated an amnesty to Malay separatists, accommodated Malay demands, and co-opted Malay elites. Once more, these developments roughly coincided with Islamic resurgence. As a result, Malays in South Thailand are both more religiously observant, and engagement in Thai modernity. The second half of this paper describes the impact of these Thai and Islamic influences on merit-making rhetoric, rituals, and rationales. Malay language loss among urban Malays have led to increasing numbers referring to the generation, accumulation and transference of merit as tham bun (merit-making)\u23afan expansive Thai religious idiom. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, Islamic reformism has changed merit (Th. Bun, SM. Pahala) are generating. Traditionalists and reformists both insist that the performance of one\u2019s individual ritual obligations (fardu \u2018in) has the biggest effect on Muslim\u2019s comfort in the grave and eschatological vindication. Nevertheless, reformist reject the efficacy of merit transferred to the deceased (except when performed by anak saleh) have led to the circle of posthumous funeral feasts being replaced by merit-transference strategies considered consistent with the sunnah. Traditionalists argue for the efficacy of a range of merit-generating ritual complexes, and that merit-transference is a meritorious act. While Thai influences have impacted merit-making rhetoric, and Islamic influences merit-making rituals, both affect merit-making rationales. Islamic tradition emphatically affirms that one\u2019s the level of one\u2019s store of merit affects one\u2019s comfort in the grave and vindication at judgment. While Malays of South Thailand share the Indic background with other Southeast Asian Muslims, contact with Theravada Buddhism can be seen to have led to a greater emphasis on, and more sophisticated conception of, the economy of merit in South Thailand.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 29561199, "asset_id": 2042640, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Researchers in this study worked on a sociolinguistic profile of over 300 indigenous students at Universidad de Antioquia and, from a critical decolonial perspective, aimed to understand the multiple views and challenges these students face in relation to their identities, languages, academic literacies, and the most recent institutional language policy that requires them to learn English to earn their university degrees. Data collection methods included several institutional databases, a survey, interviews, and conversation circles. Results from this study suggest that more equitable pedagogical principles coupled with a more sensitive and effective appropriation and implementation of this type of reform in higher education institutions are both necessary.

This is due, in large part, to the perception by teachers, students and other key stakeholders that writing instruction is too time consuming and extraneous to student needs. These perceptions regarding English writing have been influenced greatly by the educational policies of the country, and the local constraints English teachers face in trying to implement these policies. In order to meet the challenges faced by and needs of second language (L2) writing teacher education it is necessary to understand the severe impact of these policies and constraints on the English teachers in Japan\u2019s high schools and universities. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the context of English writing instruction in Japan by reviewing prior research on English writing practices and teacher education. More specifically, the chapter focuses on three key factors that influence the teaching and learning of English writing in secondary schools and subsequently tertiary education: (a) the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Course of Study (CoS), (b) university entrance  examinations, and (c) local constraints of English writing practices (for example, class size and teacher workload) especially at secondary school level, from the viewpoint of teacher education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 91310071, "asset_id": 40697352, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 221211, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Harwood", "domain_name": "sophia", "page_name": "ChrisHarwood", "display_name": "Chris  Harwood", "profile_url": "https://sophia.academia.edu/ChrisHarwood?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/221211/49977/33859387/s65_chris.harwood.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11835, "name": "Language Teacher Training", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Teacher_Training?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61609, "name": "ESOL Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESOL_Teacher_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 90921, "name": "L2 writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/L2_writing?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 99517, "name": "English as a Foreign Language (EFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_a_Foreign_Language_EFL_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 121307, "name": "Washback Effects of Examinations, Teacher Education and Language Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Washback_Effects_of_Examinations_Teacher_Education_and_Language_Change?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 122894, "name": "Teacher Education in Teaching English to Speakers of Second/Foreign Languages (TESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education_in_Teaching_English_to_Speakers_of_Second_Foreign_Languages_TESOL_?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 130676, "name": "Washback", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Washback?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 150026, "name": "Teaching EFL and Teacher Training", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_EFL_and_Teacher_Training?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 178059, "name": "Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 190784, "name": "Test washback", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Test_washback?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 207478, "name": "MEXT Course of Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/MEXT_Course_of_Study?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 283184, "name": "Linguistics, Applied Linguistics, Second and Third Languges Acquision", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics_Applied_Linguistics_Second_and_Third_Languges_Acquision?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 316921, "name": "English EFL TEFL learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_EFL_TEFL_learning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 545093, "name": "ESL/EFL Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESL_EFL_Writing?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 584796, "name": "Japanese Language Education Policy, Japan MEXT Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Language_Education_Policy_Japan_MEXT_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 2562887, "name": "language testing\uff0cMEXT\uff0ccommunicative language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/language_testing_MEXT_communicative_language_teaching?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 26760089, "title": "Language-in-education across the Baltic: policies, practices and challenges", "created_at": "2016-07-05T15:55:23.604-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26760089/Language_in_education_across_the_Baltic_policies_practices_and_challenges?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_26760089", "summary": "Since their political reorientation that started in the late 1980s, the Baltic states have experienced profound social reforms to rebuild their democratizing societies.

The process of policy-making for a new concept of education, however, entailed numerous challenges, and it has resulted in a diverse tapestry of educational provision across the Baltic.

In the past, and even nowadays, this tendency to think in terms of dichotomies seems to have dominated the view of language contact, thus making it impossible for all groups concerned to live in more harmonious contentment. The vast majority of states seem to find it impossible or very difficult to structure themselves politically in a way that would permit both the continuity of the linguistic life of their constituent groups and the intercommunication necessary for common living between these groups. The great majority seem to choose one over the other: they either impose a single official language for all groups, without recognizing the diversity (and often explicitly against this), or the existing linguistic groups are recognised but the matter of intercommunication is not resolved satisfactorily. It is hard to believe that either option can have a future in the current era of mankind: against the background of positive growth of the democratic and egalitarian conscience of human groups and the dignity of each and every one of these,historical groups that have been thus far subordinated will not sit back and allow the introduction of solutions condemning them to a reduced linguistic existence when this could be full and normal. Moreover, a political and linguistic organisation that does not consider the forms of intercommunication between its components in the best possible way is not sustainable.Thus, there is no alternative but to explore imaginatively other forms of political and linguistic organisation that could make the two objectives above compatible: preserving the linguistic diversity and dignity of all historical linguistic groups, while ensuring fluent intercommunication and a feeling of solidarity among our species.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31990275, "asset_id": 239586,

processes of formulation of language policies have not been researched thoroughly. This paper aims to explore the relationship between ideas, power and agency in language policy-making and specifically with reference to the formulation of language-in-education policy for multilingualism in Ireland. Through an argumentative approach to language policy and using a discursive institutionalist framework, the paper examines data from policy documents and interviews with policy actors in the Department of Education and Skills. The paper reports on the ways in which agentive discourses are constrained and enabled by institutional structures. The analysis shows how power resulting from asymmetric internal forces and the hierarchical architecture of institutions prevailed over the capacity of some actors to promote their ideas through discourse. Moreover, it shows how static ideational elements are powerful structural constraints on agency. The paper argues for a conceptualisation of actors in policy-making as agentive individuals who engage in a dynamic struggle over ideas to realise complex and changing policy goals. It concludes by claiming that a focus on discursive forms of power in the policy analysis at the so-called macro level would be beneficial for language policy scholarship.

Here, we interview second generation members of migrant families for their recollections as heritage language learners and their experiences setting their own FLP towards their children. We use a transdisciplinary oral history/narrative methodology to discern oscillating attitudes concerning language maintenance and acquisition as a function of changing societal and education policy. Participants are from three families originating in waves of German-speaking migrants to Australia between the 1930s and 1970s. We find that FLP only occasionally maps onto the stages of shifting ideology, highlighting individual agency of families in setting their own FLP, although sometimes remnants of bygone ideologies enter the family through marriage. Furthermore, while participants negotiated inconsistent impacts of education policies on the availability of German classes at school, to support their FLP, they utilise forms of language education outside the school system, including travel to the German-speaking \u2018homelands\u2019. These case studies underline the individuality of participants\u2019 experiences of FLP, their autonomy, and success in shaping their own language policies. Overall, it is striking how much autonomy and agency individuals and families have, considering the external forces of language education policy and language ideology discourses.\r\n\r\nFULL ARTICLE: https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/UZJ3WN3MCADZF6YYYWUY/full?target=10.1080/14790718.2022.2037609", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3302510, "first_name": "Jaime W", "last_name": "Hunt", "domain_name": "newcastle-au", "page_name": "JaimeWHunt", "display_name": "Jaime W Hunt", "profile_url": "https://newcastle-au.academia.edu/JaimeWHunt?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3302510/1099525/18820399/s65_jaime_w.hunt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6148, "name": "German Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6701, "name": "Australian multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_multiculturalism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6767, "name": "German diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33372, "name": "Heritage language studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_language_studies?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1008368, "name": "Family Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 43797798, "title": "Kerfoot 2020.

The objective of these statutes was to allow for minority protection of the German- and Ladin-speaking communities while also permitting Austria to be the 'protector' of South Tyrol even though the province is situated in Italy. Another bi-product of these statutes was the creation of the 'separate but equal' education system, which allowed the German-, Italian- and Ladin-speaking communities to have individual schools in order to protect their culture and language identity. \nIn the past several decades, there has been an increase in 'mixed' marriages with members of differing language groups producing bilingual children. Additionally, civil service positions now require that all applicants have a mandatory comprehension of the L2, or in some cases L3, in order to apply for certain posts. As the education system tries to adjust to local concerns regarding the insufficient teaching of the L2 in monolingual education, the concept of South Tyrol as a 'peace model' is brought into question. \nIn this thesis, I examine how the South Tyrolean school system is reflective of society at large as its divided education mirrors the current fissures existent amongst the language communities. With parents looking for alternative measures to instruct their children in the L2, some residents would prefer a bilingual schooling option to encourage inter-group assimilation. \nFurthermore, I discuss, outside of education, external social factors in the region which impact L2 learning creating language learning 'blocks' and 'victim' versus 'conqueror' mentalities. The objective of this research is to try and understand how South Tyrol continues to be in transition as the province adjusts to more bilingualism despite the historical need to preserve the language minorities. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62337756, "asset_id": 42193430, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2923070, "first_name": "Dr Ann", "last_name": "Wand, DPhil (Oxon)", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "DrAnnWandDPhilOxon", "display_name": "Dr Ann Wand, DPhil (Oxon)", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/DrAnnWandDPhilOxon?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2923070/965957/33477079/s65_ann.wand.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 25993, "name": "Second Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Learning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 59470, "name": "Borders and Frontiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Frontiers?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 59475, "name": "Anthropology of European borders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_European_borders?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 969719, "name": "South Tyrol", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Tyrol?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1668235, "name": "Segregated Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregated_Schools?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 38236933, "title": "Exposing vacancies: Interactive agency in adult education language policy", "created_at": "2019-01-28T08:48:04.931-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38236933/Exposing_vacancies_Interactive_agency_in_adult_education_language_policy?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_38236933", "summary": "This paper analyzes the U.S. state of Minnesota's Adult Basic Education (ABE) policy, tensions between policy directives, and current discourses about language education.

The data consist of video-recorded observations of the teacher interacting with the children and interviews where she reflected on her bilingual practices. The results show that the bilingual practices relied on responsible code-switching with pre-planned principles for language use and allocation. An important principle in the teacher\u2019s language practices was the equal use of the two languages and the avoidance of direct translation between them. The teacher further used the two languages for different purposes. She used Finnish to give complex and important instructions and to initiate discussion.

In studies of bilingualism and bilingual acquisition the role of parents and parenting has always been mentioned as an important (although somewhat peripheral) factor. In this paper, our aim is to bring these two strands of research together, by putting parents at the center stage of our investigation and showing how having children can considerably qualify the effects of a particular language policy at the micro level. We will do so by presenting the case of a transnational couple with a \u2018mixed\u2019 language background who are confronted with the two-tier organization of the city they live in (Brussels, Belgium). As we will see, having children has turned a previously \u2018invisible\u2019 top\u2013down language policy into a salient reality for these parents, with a clear influence on their micro-political agency and their sense of belonging. By taking the example of this particular couple as a point of departure, we will discuss what education policy options could be implemented to cater for the particular situation of transnational parents in general.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50760645, "asset_id": 18819055, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30613162, "first_name": "Luk Van", "last_name": "Mensel", "domain_name": "unamur", "page_name": "LukVanMensel", "display_name": "Luk Van Mensel", "profile_url": "https://unamur.academia.edu/LukVanMensel?f_ri=119852", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40862, "name": "Belgium", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belgium?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 319606, "name": "Family Language Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1008368, "name": "Family Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 8872743, "title": "Leone, A.

This view is further illustrated when contrasting native and non-native English speaking teachers (NESTs and NNESTs) and their interpretations of policy reform. Studies have established that language-in-education policy (LEP) measures may pressure NNESTs to upgrade to more communicative approaches, and may position NESTs as potential change agents who can facilitate policy reform through their perceived linguistic \u201csuperiority\u201d. However, the manner in which the NEST-NNEST dichotomy is reflected in teacher perceptions of agency in LEP reform is under-explored. This chapter analyses open-ended questionnaire comments and in-depth interviews with NESTs and Japanese teachers of English (JTEs), exploring their perceptions of their agency in the implementation of an initiative launched in 2013 for teachers to conduct English classes in English in Japanese senior high schools. Findings show that the notion of NEST as change agent is challenged, and teachers, regardless of background, equally detect restrictions in their agency due to a combination of professional beliefs and experiences, self- perceptions, and contextual constraints.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 642426, "first_name": "Gregory Paul", "last_name": "Glasgow", "domain_name": "kandaeli", "page_name": "GregoryPaulGlasgow", "display_name": "Gregory Paul Glasgow", "profile_url": "https://kandaeli.academia.edu/GregoryPaulGlasgow?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/642426/221206/92669941/s65_gregory_paul.glasgow.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 42227, "name": "English as an International Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_an_International_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 207478, "name": "MEXT Course of Study", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/MEXT_Course_of_Study?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4717465, "title": "Moli sikkalkal - Tamil translation of 'International opinion on language issues....'", "created_at": "2013-10-08T17:23:52.228-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4717465/Moli_sikkalkal_Tamil_translation_of_International_opinion_on_language_issues_?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_4717465", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32041150, "asset_id": 4717465, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3928, "first_name": "Joga", "last_name": "Singh", "domain_name": "punjabiuniversity", "page_name": "JogaSingh", "display_name": "Joga  Singh", "profile_url": "https://punjabiuniversity.academia.edu/JogaSingh?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3928/1971809/2329687/s65_joga.singh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 138932, "name": "Sociolinguistics, Sociology of Languages, Language Policy and Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics_Sociology_of_Languages_Language_Policy_and_Planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 178059, "name": "Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 238616, "name": "Foreign Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Foreign_Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 391056, "name": "France Language Policy and Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/France_Language_Policy_and_Education?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 443302, "name": "Mother Tongue as a Resource for Other Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_as_a_Resource_for_Other_Language_Learning?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 499361, "name": "Language-In-Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language-In-Education_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 670699, "name": "The Use of Mother Tongue in English Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Use_of_Mother_Tongue_in_English_Teaching?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 3719647, "title": "O chuvaso en Chuvasia: exemplo de regresi\u00f3n das linguas medianas en Rusia", "created_at": "2013-06-15T17:54:56.610-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3719647/O_chuvaso_en_Chuvasia_exemplo_de_regresi%C3%B3n_das_linguas_medianas_en_Rusia?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_3719647", "summary": "Neste artigo descr\u00edbese a situaci\u00f3n actual do chuvaso, especialmente nas cidades de Chuvasia.

"This study problematises the folk theories of ELT practitioners, and critically views the limits of their monolingual idealism and guilty multilingualism in the context of Pakistan. Drawing on interviews of 18 English teachers and classroom observations in a provincial capital of Pakistan, the study analyses their \u2018two solitudes\u2019 assumptions, in which they essentialize English-only teaching without any recourse to L1/native/local languages. Results show that practitioners\u2019 current theoretical positioning is underpinned by the TESOL orthodoxy, which means that they treat English learning as a hermetic process, and emphasise on rigid separation of L1s from the target language. The study finds that narrow theoretical base and orthodox orientations towards TESOL/SLA holds teachers from liberal use of multiple languages. Inferiority syndrome about the value of native/ indigenous languages also causes their lack of confidence in bi/ multilingual TESOL.

Apart from a lone bilingual program that ended over twenty years ago (Meehan 2017), Kriol has rarely featured in formal education (Angelo 2021: 296, Dickson 2021). In 2018, a community survey in one of the largest Kriol-speaking communities, Ngukurr, found strong support for bilingual education and Kriol literacy instruction (Yugul Mangi Development Aboriginal Corporation 2019: 12). \n\nIn the face of the hegemony of English instruction in schools, Yugul Mangi Development Aboriginal Corporation decided to fund a Kriol resourcing and education program in 2019 called Meigim Kriol Strongbala (https://meigimkriolstrongbala.org.au/en_au/). Within a year, this non-government program had become enmeshed in the local school, delivering programs in all classes. The rapid acceptance highlighted the local need and desires for vernacular education and how the funding and policy vacuum can be quickly filled at the local level when opportunities arise. \n\nIn terms of program delivery, the past two years of work by Meigim Kriol Strongbala, in collaboration with Ngukurr School and other agencies, has seen numerous innovations and developments in resourcing and pedagogy for the Kriol language. This includes: commercial book publications, development of units in primary education in various subject areas and explorations in methods of Kriol literacy instruction. Examples of success (as well as failures) across these areas will be shared in this presentation, with evidence for success provided by: improved capacity in Kriol literacy; positive formal independent evaluation (Ninti One 2021); and increased engagement and acceptance of Kriol-medium education programs. While some teachers and schools in other Kriol speaking communities are also expanding their use of Kriol in classrooms, this presentation aims to further develop a grassroots movement towards the expanded use of Kriol in formal education. \n\nReferences \n\nAngelo, Denise. 2021.

In the article home languages, their qualities and use by pupils in grades 2 to 5 in Tallinn are analyzed. Two larger and more characteristic groups (Ukrainians and Belarusians) and two groups with Islamic backgrounds (Azerbaijanis and Tatars) were compared with the aim of analysing different language loss and preservation factors. Although Ukrainians and Belarusians form much larger ethnic groups within Estonia, they have not managed to preserve their lan-guage anywhere near as successfully as the Azerbaijanis and Tatars. Comparison of the data suggests that language preservation in Estonia and the ability to withstand Russification are most influenced by the degree of dif ference of the language from Russian and the religious difference from the Russian Orthodox faith (and Soviet era atheism). Home languages are characterised by their use mainly in the verbal form, with skills in the literary language generally low or even non-existent.

Largely absent in reclassifcation scholarship is the consideration of how reclassifcation policies uniquely affect those learners with identifed disabilities. Applying an intersectionality lens that foregrounds political and structural critique, we conducted an interpretive policy analysis of reclassifcation policies in two states, New Mexico and California. In the analysis, we examined the coalescence of federal and state policies governing reclassifcation procedures along with assessment designs and practices as they impact the educational realities of emergent bilinguals with disabilities. The analysis illuminated how existing policies and practices marginalize emergent bilinguals with disabilities by making reclassifcation improbable for students with intersecting disability and second language acquisition needs. We argue that the unlikelihood of being reclassifed as Fluent-English Profcient has profound educational consequences for emergent bilinguals, who over time may become disproportionately represented in both special education as well as the long-term English learner population in schools.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4514098, "first_name": "Jamie", "last_name": "Schissel", "domain_name": "uncg", "page_name": "JamieSchissel", "display_name": "Jamie Schissel", "profile_url": "https://uncg.academia.edu/JamieSchissel?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4514098/1861217/2211020/s65_jamie.schissel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1750, "name": "Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 18045, "name": "Language Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Assessment?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 48850, "name": "English Language Learners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_Learners?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 123744, "name": "Language Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Studies?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 568909, "name": "Exceptional Childrens Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exceptional_Childrens_Education?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 54922851, "title": "Special Edition on the English without Borders Program", "created_at": "2021-10-02T15:32:36.012-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54922851/Special_Edition_on_the_English_without_Borders_Program?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_54922851", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71046859, "asset_id": 54922851, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28693232, "first_name": "Cristina", "last_name": "Perna", "domain_name": "pucrs", "page_name": "CristinaPerna", "display_name": "Cristina Perna", "profile_url": "https://pucrs.academia.edu/CristinaPerna?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28693232/8133854/9103820/s65_cristina.perna.jpg_oh_8361706848181a5346531bbd6be2eda2_oe_55a7ca5e___gda___1436516255_caccbb9fd14d5e289dd95a7282b11225"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1006, "name": "English for Academic Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Academic_Purposes?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 273611, "name": "Ingl\u00e9s", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ingl%C3%A9s?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2206043, "name": "English without Borders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_without_Borders?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 54566460, "title": "Language management: a snapshot of governmentality within the private schools in Quetta, Pakistan", "created_at": "2021-10-01T04:49:14.758-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54566460/Language_management_a_snapshot_of_governmentality_within_the_private_schools_in_Quetta_Pakistan?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_54566460", "summary": "Pakistan is a multilingual and multiethnic country; however, this diversity stands unrecognized in the formal language-in-education policies.

Firstly, we investigate the extent to which the submissions to the consultation process form a sequence with the final document, Languages Connect; secondly, we examine the Irish government documents and compare the submissions reflecting the government approach to language with those problematising such discourse. The former analysis reveals how a market-led valuing of languages is embedded in the government discourse. The latter analysis further shows that linguistic diversity did not receive as much attention as language competence. Bearing in mind that participatory and deliberative procedures are meant to provide legitimacy for policy decisions, the paper concludes by discussing some of the positionings taken in Languages

Catalonia. The study of the legislation in relation to contexts of social and institutional use shows how this legal framework is not sufficient to change Catalan from being a minoritized language, since the phenomenon of minoritization is innate to the ecosystem in which languages develop. This ecosystem is conditioned by the presence of Castilian as a lingua franca on both sides of the border between Andorra and Catalonia. In the case of Andorra, its status as a cross-border microstate makes it a plurilingual space with Castilian as a socially cross-cutting language; moreover, the fact that until recently there was no network of state schools hindered Catalan language normalisation efforts. Catalonia, on the other hand, is an even more complex example on account of how the implementation of llengua pr\u00f2pia policy contradicts the constitutional control the Spanish state exercises on this.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4868088, "first_name": "Juan", "last_name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Salcedo", "domain_name": "umh", "page_name": "JuanJimenezSalcedo", "display_name": "Juan Jim\u00e9nez-Salcedo", "profile_url": "https://umh.academia.edu/JuanJimenezSalcedo?f_ri=119852", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4868088/2088509/12540108/s65_juan.jim_nez-salcedo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1173, "name": "Catalan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catalan_Studies?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1391, "name": "Catalan Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catalan_Language?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=119852", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 139429, "name": "Andorra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andorra?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 155966, "name": "Law and Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Law_and_Language?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 424608, "name": "Catalan sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catalan_sociolinguistics?f_ri=119852"}, {"id": 1230090, "name": "Andorran Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Andorran_Studies?f_ri=119852"}]}, {"id": 36282879, "title": "Il Giornalino: rivista per insegnanti e studenti di italiano diretta da Giuseppe Prezzolini", "created_at": "2018-03-29T01:22:21.569-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36282879/Il_Giornalino_rivista_per_insegnanti_e_studenti_di_italiano_diretta_da_Giuseppe_Prezzolini?f_ri=119852", "dom_id": "work_36282879", "summary": "Giuseppe Prezzolini crea e dirige a New York, tra il 1934 e il\n1943, una rivista, Il Giornalino, rivolta ad insegnanti e studenti di italiano\ncome lingua straniera.
