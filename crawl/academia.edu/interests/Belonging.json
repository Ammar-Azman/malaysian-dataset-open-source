We envision this notion to help us gain a more nuanced understanding of the entanglements of the political, social, and affective dimensions of belonging and their effects on health, illness, and healing. A focus on embodied belonging, we argue, reveals how displacement, exclusion, and marginalization cause existential and health-related ruptures in people's lives and bodies, and how affected people, in the struggle for re/emplacement and re/integration, may regain health and sustain their well-being. Covering a variety of regional contexts (Germany/Vietnam, Nor-way, the UK, Japan), the contributions to this special issue examine how embodied non/belonging is experienced, re/imagined, negotiated, practiced, disrupted, contested , and achieved (or not) by their protagonists, who are excluded and marginalized in diverse ways. Each article highlights the intricate trajectories of how dynamics of non/belonging inscribe themselves in human bodies.

While this is possible for some migrant groups, it overlooks those groups who cannot. This study examines how mutually reinforcing socio-spatial processes converge to produce the unequal distribution of belonging experienced by low-wage migrants at the margins of the margin. Drawing from the emotional narratives of forty-four temporary migrant workers from eleven different countries employed in low-wage work in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the study reveals the exclusionary processes that limit belonging. These processes are rooted in historical hierarchies established by the state and socioeconomic elite along the lines of nationality, race, and ethnicity. The hierarchies are reinforced using socio-spatial disciplinary mechanisms that create and maintain low-wage labor. Social exclusion and the devaluing of certain nationalities are further reinforced within the space of worker accommodation in relation to the stratification of low-wage migrant groups whose behavior replicates society's vertical hierarchies. Analysis focuses specifically on the scale of the room\u2014the cramped, confined space that low-wage migrants share\u2014, how it was experienced spatially, socially, and emotionally, and how it can be a pathway or barrier to accessing a sense of belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 161255, "first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Reber", "domain_name": "umich",

This special issue brings together scholars from history, sociology and anthropology to explore cross-border mobility and migration during the formation, development, and transformation of the modern (nation-)state explicating the conflictive and fluctuating character of borders. The historical perspective demonstrates that such bordering processes are not new. However, they have developed new dynamics in different historical phases, from the formation of the modern (nation-)state in the nineteenth century to the creation of the European Union during the second half of the twentieth. This introduction explains the dynamic relationships between borders and migratory movements in Europe from the nineteenth century to the present by approaching them from four different, overlapping angles, which the articles analyze in more detail: (1) the multiple actors involved, (2) scales and places of borders and their crossings, (3) the instruments and techniques employed, and (4) the significance of social categories. Focusing on the historical, local specificity of the complex relations between migration and boundaries will help denaturalize the concept of the border as well as further reflection on the shifting definitions of migration and belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57802520, "asset_id": 37803847, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9379002, "first_name": "Levke", "last_name": "Harders", "domain_name": "uibk", "page_name": "LevkeHarders", "display_name": "Levke Harders", "profile_url": "https://uibk.academia.edu/LevkeHarders?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9379002/2992908/52129226/s65_levke.harders.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1729, "name": "German History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2817, "name": "Border Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15455, "name": "Russian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Russian_History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15575, "name": "20th century (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/20th_century_History_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 16287, "name": "Migration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_History?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 19332, "name": "19th Century (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/19th_Century_History_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 27949, "name": "Borderlands Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borderlands_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 249304, "name": "Borders and Borderlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borders_and_Borderlands?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 384379, "name": "European Migration Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Migration_Policy?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 33881064, "title": "School Values: A Comparison of Academic Motivation, Mental Health Promotion, and School Belonging With Student Achievement", "created_at": "2017-07-14T03:02:56.472-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33881064/School_Values_A_Comparison_of_Academic_Motivation_Mental_Health_Promotion_and_School_Belonging_With_Student_Achievement?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_33881064", "summary": "School vision and mission statements are an explicit indication of a school's priorities.

The Traction Youth Ensemble is an outreach program offered by Queensland Theatre in the city of Logan - recently portrayed in the media as a hub for crime and race \u201criots\u201d. Traction was established to counteract some of these negative stereotypes, to promote social cohesion, and to fill a gap in high quality theatre opportunities for young people there. Barambah Mission Talk is a theatre performance being developed with women prisoners in Brisbane Women\u2019s Correctional Centre (BWCC). The work is based on Ruth Hegarty\u2019s memoir Is That You Ruthie? which describes her time growing up in Barambah Aboriginal Mission (now Cherbourg Community) in the 1930s and 40s. Many of the women in BWCC have strong connections to Barambah, as well as other Aboriginal missions around Australia, where their families were forcibly removed and institutionalised as part of the Stolen Generations. Both of these projects generate performances of belonging in often-fraught political and social contexts. Barambah Mission Talk contains performances of belonging and not belonging in carceral sites, where there exists simultaneously a strong sense of home, and the anguish of separation and displacement. The Traction Youth Ensemble offers 50 young theatre makers in Logan a unique place to belong, developing their voice and identity, and leading ultimately to positive forms of social and civic participation. In both projects, there is a sense of vitality and hope, generated by the performers\u2019 engagement with their own evolving sense of story and culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54557857, "asset_id": 34699948, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42888149, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Woodland", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "SarahWoodland", "display_name": "Sarah Woodland", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/SarahWoodland?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42888149/11511061/12838739/s65_sarah.woodland-griffith.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5118, "name": "Applied Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Theatre?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6152, "name": "Applied Drama/Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Drama_Theatre?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14495, "name": "Theatre in Prisons", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_in_Prisons?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 152476, "name": "Youth and Children's Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_and_Childrens_Theatre?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 32822793, "title": "2012, Three Views of a Secret: Land Rights and the Constitution of Local Citizenship in West Africa", "created_at": "2017-05-04T01:21:59.838-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32822793/2012_Three_Views_of_a_Secret_Land_Rights_and_the_Constitution_of_Local_Citizenship_in_West_Africa?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_32822793", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52971910, "asset_id": 32822793, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3975643, "first_name": "Jean-Pierre", "last_name": "Jacob", "domain_name": "graduateinstitute", "page_name": "JeanPierreJacob", "display_name": "Jean-Pierre Jacob", "profile_url": "https://graduateinstitute.academia.edu/JeanPierreJacob?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3975643/11676753/13019327/s65_jean-pierre.jacob.jpg"}, {"id": 30797639, "first_name": "Pierre-Yves", "last_name": "Le Meur", "domain_name": "ird", "page_name": "PierreYvesLeMeur", "display_name": "Pierre-Yves Le Meur", "profile_url": "https://ird.academia.edu/PierreYvesLeMeur?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30797639/9880896/11014977/s65_pierre-yves.le_meur.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5757, "name": "Land tenure", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_tenure?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14768, "name": "Land Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Land_Law?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 69221, "name": "Nationality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 161014, "name": "Social Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Integration?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 43697221, "title": "Teacher Care and Students' Sense of Connectedness in the Urban Mathematics Classroom", "created_at": "2020-07-23T09:26:05.071-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43697221/Teacher_Care_and_Students_Sense_of_Connectedness_in_the_Urban_Mathematics_Classroom?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_43697221", "summary": "This multimethod study draws on theories of teacher care, dispositions, and culturally relevant pedagogy to examine how 12 urban mathematics teachers\u2019 perceptions of their own care practices align with their Black and Latinx students\u2019 (n = 321) sense of connectedness in the  mathematics classroom.

As a result, a critique of this model was constructed called the social model of disability. Much of the language used to articulate the purpose behind the social model of disability can be summed up within the word inclusion. However, this essay asserts that inclusiveness is an incomplete aspiration. The social model, as it currently stands, does not aid in creating a society where those with impairments actually belong. Rather, the social model aids in lessening the visibility, or negative consequence of, difference. Therefore, the social model does not invite society to welcome those with physical and intellectual impairments. It simply aids society in ignoring the existence of impairment by removing explicit forms of exclusion. Rather than simple inclusion, then, this essay uses John Swinton\u2019s concept of friendship and Jean Vanier\u2019s understanding of belonging to better articulate the intended outcome of the social model\u2014a society where everyone can belong.

The data obtained in the field study carried out in Stockholm, G\u00f6teborg and Malm\u00f6 cities, the most densely inhabited cities by Turks, and the analysis of the data was made using SPSS 18 programme. When the data obtained are analysed, it is revealed that Turks in Sweden care for the identity formation representing their homeland and its continuation in socio-cultural terms, and they generally tend to be conservative in this sense. Nevertheless, it is also understood that the contact of Turks in Sweden with Turkish culture and Turkey is gradually decreasing (when it compared to the past). This also reveals the differences between the generations. When that 3rd generation young Turks born in Sweden came to Turkey, they generally do not feel like in their homeland, but in a foreign country or a country they visit as guests, and this also related to this kind of change.

integration is another result arising out of the data obtained in the field study.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44712578, "asset_id": 24375799, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

The review process required some significant editing changes be made to this original version. \n\nThe term \u2018sense of place\u2019 has become a ubiquitous piece of phraseology in contemporary Western culture; however its meanings are as diverse as its use is common. The primary aim of this paper is to clarify more precisely what the term \u2018sense of place\u2019 actually means, in response to the driving thesis that its present multifarious use renders the term so amorphous in meaning, that its power of meaning is lost. To corroborate this supposition, examples of the term\u2019s multiple uses are portrayed, including its conflation with the related terms \u2018spirit of place\u2019 and genius loci. The Roman term genius loci is identified as the root from which both the terms \u2018spirit of place\u2019 and \u2018sense of place\u2019 stem, and in order to untangle their conflated use, the interrelated history of all three terms are mapped from their respective points of inception to present day. Having established this etymological and historical foundation, the importance of being linguistically precise in our use of the term \u2018sense of place\u2019 is argued within light of the added theses that, a) fostering the subjective reality of sense of place is essential to individual and social welfare, and b) that using the term more exactly is a necessary prerequisite to its being taken seriously enough to be incorporated into Western systems of governance and social policy. Finally, distinct definitions for each of the different terms are suggested and briefly discussed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32092949, "asset_id": 4790880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3648349, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Spittles", "domain_name": "murdoch", "page_name": "BrianSpittles", "display_name": "Brian Spittles", "profile_url": "https://murdoch.academia.edu/BrianSpittles?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3648349/1285219/1598931/s65_brian.spittles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 186853, "name": "Cultural Planning, Destiny, Sense of Place, Spirit of Place, Genius Loci, Cultural Mapping, Placemaking, Local Distinctiveness, Place Identity, Cultural Tourism, Literary Tourism, Gestalt, Culture-Led Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Planning_Destiny_Sense_of_Place_Spirit_of_Place_Genius_Loci_Cultural_Mapping_Placemak?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41182440, "title": "Communication and Technology Congress -CTC", "created_at": "2019-12-04T09:01:48.263-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41182440/Communication_and_Technology_Congress_CTC?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_41182440", "summary": "As a situation on Social media that is frequently encountered in recent times, comments, which whether or not knowledge about matter of any share/posts on social media that contain criticism, humiliating, judging, lynch are drawn reaction by users.

In order to investigate this underrepresentation, we interviewed 201 college seniors, primarily women and people of color, who either majored in STEM or started but dropped a STEM major. Here we discuss one section of the longer interview that focused on students' sense of belonging, which has been found to be related to retention. In our analysis, we examine the intersections of race and gender with students' sense of belonging, a topic largely absent from the current literature. Results: We found that white men were most likely to report a sense of belonging whereas women of color were the least likely. Further, we found that representation within one's STEM sub-discipline, namely biology versus the physical sciences, impacts sense of belonging for women. Four key factors were found to contribute to sense of belonging for all students interviewed: interpersonal relationships, perceived competence, personal interest, and science identity. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that students who remain in STEM majors report a greater sense of belonging than those who leave STEM. Additionally, we found that students from underrepresented groups are less likely to feel they belong. These findings highlight structural and cultural features of universities, as well as STEM curricula and pedagogy, that continue to privilege white males.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57136277, "asset_id": 37184924, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88223424, "first_name": "Katherine", "last_name": "Rainey", "domain_name": "colorado", "page_name": "KatherineRainey", "display_name": "Katherine Rainey", "profile_url": "https://colorado.academia.edu/KatherineRainey?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88223424/26954067/25401705/s65_katherine.rainey.jpg"}, {"id": 88322207, "first_name": "Roslyn", "last_name": "Mickelson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RoslynMickelson", "display_name": "Roslyn Mickelson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RoslynMickelson?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50118, "name": "Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 86911, "name": "Retention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Retention?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 706380, "name": "Intersectional", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectional?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 35706292, "title": "Fostering School Belonging in Secondary Schools Using a Socio-Ecological Framework", "created_at": "2018-01-18T19:33:03.548-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35706292/Fostering_School_Belonging_in_Secondary_Schools_Using_a_Socio_Ecological_Framework?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_35706292", "summary": "\n\nThe benefits of belonging and feeling connected to school for adolescent mental health and wellbeing are well documented, but how belonging is fostered is less understood.

The conceptual framework is used to present a range of evidence-based school belonging strategies (some with examples) that schools can use to enhance student belonging. This article makes an original contribution to the field of psychological and educational research by presenting a socio-ecological framework to explore the themes that influence school belonging within a secondary school system. It broadens the frame of reference of school belonging beyond the individual student to consider features of the broader school system and environment.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57528311, "asset_id": 35706292, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1485621, "first_name": "Kelly-Ann", "last_name": "Allen", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "drkellyallen", "display_name": "Kelly-Ann Allen", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/drkellyallen?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1485621/529773/68494969/s65_kelly-ann.allen.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 78748253, "title": "Student belongingness in higher education: Lessons for Professors from Student belongingness in higher education: Lessons for Professors from the COVID-19 pandemic the COVID-19 pandemic", "created_at": "2022-05-08T05:47:01.657-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78748253/Student_belongingness_in_higher_education_Lessons_for_Professors_from_Student_belongingness_in_higher_education_Lessons_for_Professors_from_the_COVID_19_pandemic_the_COVID_19_pandemic?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_78748253", "summary": "'To learn about X, observe what happens to the system when X is removed.'

Indeed, the pandemic has been a significant point of anxiety for students, educators, and universities globally.

Boey and Michelle Cahill, Contemporary Asian Australian Poets. This essay engages with three of these poets: Debbie Lim, Shen and James Stuart, and reads their poems through a diasporic lens. Contrary to scholarship that investigates belonging using the more orthodox ideas of home and land, this reading engages with fluidity and mobility through the depictions of water to better represent the diasporic experience. Further, these poems employ desire and the desiring subject to engage with the way diasporic belonging is figured as contested and contingent. Each of these elements will be explored in the poems in order to investigate the link between diasporic belonging and depictions of water.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50341235, "asset_id": 29874101, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56717759, "first_name": "Rosalind", "last_name": "McFarlane", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "RosalindMcFarlane", "display_name": "Rosalind McFarlane", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/RosalindMcFarlane?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56717759/14912149/15677371/s65_rosalind.mcfarlane.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8084, "name": "Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12677, "name": "Desire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Desire?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 255793, "name": "Transnationalism, Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism_Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 735300, "name": "Fluidity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fluidity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1071133, "name": "Water Imagery In Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_Imagery_In_Literature?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1323303, "name": "Asian-Australian Poetry and Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian-Australian_Poetry_and_Poetics?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2570325, "name": "Asian Australian Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Poetry?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 3019045, "title": "\u0410\u0440\u0437\u044e\u0442\u043e\u0432 2013 \u0410\u043b\u0442\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440 \u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0438 [The Altai Ritual Rug and the Creation of Heterotopia;

It is about belonging. This award winning and critically acclaimed feature film exploring the period called anni di piombo, does not only have the role in bringing forth the controversial issues of this period and offering an (alternative) understanding, but it also provides the opportunity to mourn those who are affected by violence and terror of the period and to make it less likely to repeat itself. Looking at the film and belonging, what this paper aims at is twofold. Firstly, with the Reflections and Methods chapter, it suggests including concepts of belonging and price of belonging in the methodological discussion of narrative film analysis which lacks sufficient sociological and anthropological input (Tudor, 2000). Secondly, with the Analysis chapter, it tries to deepen our understanding of belonging by (a) discussing burdens of multiple and discordant belonging (Pfaff-Czarnecka, 2013) as well as its ambiguity through the tangible (though fictional) struggles of Accio in the film, and (b) bringing in the notions of voice, exit, exclusion (Hirschmann, 1970; Hoffmann, 2008), pain (Das, 1995), precarious life (Butler, 2009) and social navigation (Vigh, 2009).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59029603, "asset_id": 38928898, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12490123, "first_name": "Ekin", "last_name": "Yildiran-Schoepe", "domain_name": "cit-ec", "page_name": "EkinYildiran", "display_name": "Ekin Yildiran-Schoepe", "profile_url": "https://cit-ec.academia.edu/EkinYildiran?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12490123/3891497/19158337/s65_ekin.yildiran.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3301, "name": "Film Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Film_Analysis?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18880, "name": "Narrative Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Analysis?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3213400, "name": "price of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/price_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 36774955, "title": "Belonging and Unbelonging: Space, Identity, and Imagination", "created_at": "2018-06-04T04:20:56.210-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36774955/Belonging_and_Unbelonging_Space_Identity_and_Imagination?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_36774955", "summary": "Conference paper/introduction for the 3 sessions on \"Belonging and Unbelonging\", Intersections/Intersezioni Conference, Florence, 30 May -

Die Auswertung des erhobenen Datenmaterials erfolgte mit Hilfe einer Membership Categorization Analysis. Es wurde versucht gezielt jene Momente zu identifizieren, an denen Spannungsverh\u00e4ltnisse aus emanzipatorischem Potential und der Reproduktion von Machtasymmetrien entstehen, und die jeweiligen Strategien der Rechtfertigung kenntlich zu machen. \r\n\r\nLocation: Working Paper Series \"Gender, Diversity and Migration\" Nr. 15 (2018)\r\nPublisher: Faculty of Social Sciences, Goethe-University Frankfurt", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55871753, "asset_id": 35986822, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 55263589, "first_name": "Chris", "last_name": "Hey-Nguyen", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ChrisHeyNguyen", "display_name": "Chris Hey-Nguyen", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ChrisHeyNguyen?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/55263589/14566995/15432193/s65_christian.hey.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6667, "name": "LGBT Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Issues?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9903, "name": "LGBT Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Youth?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 12351, "name": "Ethnomethodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnomethodology?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 26743, "name": "Intersectionality and Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality_and_Social_Inequality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 38067, "name": "Membership Categorisation Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Membership_Categorisation_Analysis?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 38004628, "title": "The Concept of Belonging: Critical, Normative and Multicultural", "created_at": "2018-12-18T13:50:44.547-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38004628/The_Concept_of_Belonging_Critical_Normative_and_Multicultural?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_38004628", "summary": "Contemporary diversity politics is mobilized around debates on the effects of diversity on political community and cohesion.

The discourse on migration is dominated by a binary between living and leaving, where living at home is privileged over leaving; the latter often denigrated as abnormal and a rupture in the rhythm of social life. The chapter argues that while migration has been an ongoing historical process, the figure of the migrant is a modern conception. On the one hand, this figure is received as a \u201cmoral panic\u201d among the hosts; on the other, any effort to normalise mobility runs the risk of undermining its exploitative and traumatic aspects. The chapter argues that apart from the traditional disciplines, women\u2019s studies and scholarship on the partition, forced migration, marginalisation, experience, and pain and suffering have contributed immensely to enhancing our understanding of migration in its interdisciplinarity. The dominance of over-deterministic methodological frames of causal analysis has led to the neglect of migrants\u2019 subjectivity towards belongingness and home in migration literature. Home is often conceptualised in binary to work, which the recent experiences of COVID-19 have ruptured by bringing into focus in academic discourse the issue of work from home and migrants\u2019 lack of choice to live rather than longing to leave for home.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73742539, "asset_id": 60188365, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3257888, "first_name": "Sadan", "last_name": "Jha", "domain_name": "centreforsocialstudiessurat", "page_name": "SadanJha", "display_name": "Sadan Jha", "profile_url": "https://centreforsocialstudiessurat.academia.edu/SadanJha?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3257888/1077159/98530100/s65_sadan.jha.jpg"}, {"id": 933392, "first_name": "Pushpendra", "last_name": "Kumar", "domain_name": "tiss", "page_name": "PushpendraKumar", "display_name": "Pushpendra  Kumar", "profile_url": "https://tiss.academia.edu/PushpendraKumar?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/933392/63948783/52263026/s65_pushpendra.kumar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 133229, "name": "Labour migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labour_migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 134143, "name": "Politics of Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Memory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 768477, "name": "Politics of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 43630313, "title": "\"In the Same Soup:\" Marginality, Vulnerability and Belonging in Life Stories Of Disabled Ghanaian Women", "created_at": "2020-07-15T11:59:47.432-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43630313/_In_the_Same_Soup_Marginality_Vulnerability_and_Belonging_in_Life_Stories_Of_Disabled_Ghanaian_Women?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_43630313", "summary": "Previous scholarship shows that women with disabilities are excluded from national and transnational economic development strategies and depicted, if at all, as passive victims and subjects of charity. In Sub-Saharan Africa, disabled women tend to occupy marginal positions in the social and economic milieux of major cities. This feminist narrative ethnography draws upon fifteen months of collaborative, cross-cultural fieldwork in Accra, Ghana. It confronts prior misrepresentations by constructing detailed narrative portraits and \u201cpoetic transcriptions\u201d (Glesne, 1997) derived from life-story interviews with thirteen Ghanaian women with disabilities who reside in Ghana\u2019s capital and its suburbs. Through narrative reconstructions of women\u2019s stories, it explores how interlocking social and economic structures marginalize girls and women with disabilities. Disabled women\u2019s social personhood is undermined, for example, through denial of family roles and entitlements; provision of inferior education and work training in unsustainable trades; and expressions of pity or contempt by passers-by. The portraits highlight the dangers, hardships and diminished personhood to which disabled women are subjected through these marginalizing processes. They foreground disabled women\u2019s perspectives and their persistent agency in knitting themselves back into the fabric of their families, neighborhoods, and religious communities. They also explore the roles that disability self-help and advocacy groups play in women\u2019s lives by enabling them to form friendships and access material support. Through participating in such groups, women begin to question the inevitability of their exclusion, reconstruct themselves as worthy and respectable persons, and strengthen their claims on family and society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63930424, "asset_id": 43630313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5013566, "first_name": "Denise", "last_name": "Nepveux", "domain_name": "duke", "page_name": "DeniseNepveux", "display_name": "Denise Nepveux", "profile_url": "https://duke.academia.edu/DeniseNepveux?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5013566/2177580/2553240/s65_denise.nepveux.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1909, "name": "Family studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 6476, "name": "Anthropology of Disability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Disability?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 8475, "name": "Narrative Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Methods?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 9620, "name": "Ghana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ghana?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 14464, "name": "Marginalized Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marginalized_Identities?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 14776, "name": "Precarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Precarity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 16823, "name": "Vulnerability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vulnerability?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 24442, "name": "Feminist Research Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Research_Methods?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 43854, "name": "Life Stories", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Life_Stories?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 50051, "name": "Disability Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Rights?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 262585, "name": "Marginalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marginalization?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 506417, "name": "Personal Narratives", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Personal_Narratives?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 79335040, "title": "Strength-based parenting and academic motivation in adolescents returning to school after COVID-19 school closure: Exploring the effect of school belonging and strength use", "created_at": "2022-05-17T16:20:33.135-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79335040/Strength_based_parenting_and_academic_motivation_in_adolescents_returning_to_school_after_COVID_19_school_closure_Exploring_the_effect_of_school_belonging_and_strength_use?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_79335040", "summary": "The present study aimed to examine whether the level of strength-based parenting a student receives during remote learning affects their levels of academic motivation once returning to school.

Matters of identity divide societies on every inhabited continent. Religion, ethnicity, skin color, age, sexual orientation, and race, among other identity groups, are shaping politics everywhere. Societies are polarizing around these fundamental axes, as demagogic political leaders promise to keep outsiders away. Xenophobia is on the rise, and anti-immigrant sentiment swells in a period of mass migration. \n\nTo what extent do societies, fracturing along these dimensions of difference, strive or even successfully bridge these social cleavages with fair and inclusive policies? In this, our fifth annual Inclusiveness Index report, we strive to answer this question, not simply by reference to particular policies or initiatives, but by examining the data to track how marginalized populations actually fare relative to dominant groups. \n\nThe Othering & Belonging Institute's Inclusiveness Index is one of the first indices that measures equity without regard for national wealth or economic conditions. One of the challenges in measuring inclusivity is that it is difficult to disentangle policies aimed at inclusivity from the investments and resources available to marginalized communities. They are often the same and can be conflated. We surmount this challenge by focusing on policies, laws, and outcomes rather than government expenditures or investments. The Inclusiveness Index is uniquely focused on the degree of inclusion and marginality rather than a more general assessment of group-based well-being. \nIn addition to assessing how inclusive various societies are, the Inclusiveness Index serves as a diagnostic tool. It helps us identify places and societies that are improving, in terms of developing a more inclusive polity and set of institutions, and those places where societies are fracturing and becoming more divided along these lines. The data tells the main story, but we also seek to surface stories and trends that lie beneath the data. \n\nIn our conception, inclusiveness entails access to power and public and private resources, and it improves the way society views marginalized group members. Inclusivity is realized when historically or currently marginalized groups feel valued, when differences are respected, and when basic and fundamental needs and rights- relative to those societies' dominant groups-are met and recognized. Our index focuses on social groups rather than individuals, as marginality often occurs as a result of a group membership. \n\nWe operationalize this definition of \"inclusivity\" by focusing primarily on the performance of groups that span salient social cleavages, such as gender, race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation. We realize that such an approach cannot fully account for the unquantifiable or more qualitative aspects of belonging and inclusivity. For that reason, each version of the Inclusiveness Index report highlights stories and themes that go beyond the data. \n\nThus, each issue looks for patterns or stories that lay behind the data and touch on issues of inclusivity both across the globe and within the United States. Our 2016 report examined the global migrant crisis. Our 2017 report focused on the rise of ethnonationalism. Our 2018 report surveyed the reckoning brought about by the global #MeToo movement and the growing global water crises. For 2019 we took a closer look at the role of social media in spreading hate and falsehoods, and how global leaders are responding. And in this 2020 report, we focus on the responses nationally, and globally, to the COVID-19 crisis. \n\nAs always, a word of caution: our rankings are not the final word on inclusivity nor a definitive assessment of any national or state performance.

Gramastha mandals are village-run committees that buy chawl (tenement) rooms and rent them to single male migrants from their own villages. Save a few studies and cursory references, gramastha mandals have received limited academic attention, especially in today\u2019s climate of economic liberalization following the widespread closure of Mumbai\u2019s cotton mills. Through an examination of gramastha mandal living arrangements, working patterns and social activities, I answer three broad questions. Firstly, how have the gramastha mandals been impacted by the closure of the mills that once provided a major source of employment? Secondly how does living in a gramastha mandal room impact migrants\u2019 relationships with the city around them and, thirdly, how does this arrangement perpetuate societal divisions from the village? I suggest that most gramastha mandal residents remain more part of their villages than of Mumbai\u2019s social structures, and that this alienation has increased since the mills closed and opportunities for forging a working-class urban solidarity correspondingly declined. Moreover, through strict eligibility criteria, gramastha mandals replicate, rather than erode, village fault-lines between caste Hindu and Dalit Buddhist communities, a phenomenon that shows only limited signs of changing.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60556171, "asset_id": 40314238, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 100324863, "first_name": "Jonathan", "last_name": "Galton", "domain_name": "ucl", "page_name": "JonathanGalton", "display_name": "Jonathan Galton", "profile_url": "https://ucl.academia.edu/JonathanGalton?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/100324863/21867153/52476783/s65_jonathan.galton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 118633, "name": "Caste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caste?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 146119, "name": "Dalits", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dalits?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 146932, "name": "Mumbai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mumbai?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 196351, "name": "Village", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Village?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 214505, "name": "Circular Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Circular_Migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 225186, "name": "Maharashtra", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maharashtra?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 447182, "name": "Marathas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marathas?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3375364, "name": "Chawl", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chawl?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 60709879, "title": "Essay collection: Nostalgia and Belonging in Art and Architecture from the MENA Region (2021)", "created_at": "2021-11-01T07:52:16.065-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/60709879/Essay_collection_Nostalgia_and_Belonging_in_Art_and_Architecture_from_the_MENA_Region_2021_?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_60709879", "summary": "This collection brings together twelve short essays investigating how nostalgia and belonging come into play in the study of modern and contemporary art and architecture from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

The purpose of the present study sought to investigate the longitudinal mediating effect of school belongingness on the association of school victimization with emotional problems and psychological well-being among Turkish adolescents. Using the short-term longitudinal approach, data was collected from 282 students in a public secondary school in an urban city of Turkey at two different time points. Students responded to questions concerning school belongingness, emotional problems , psychological well-being, and school victimization. Mediation analyses were conducted across the two waves of data. Findings revealed that both victimization and a low sense of belonging were independently shown to be significantly negatively correlated with emotional problems and positively correlated with psychological well-being.

Produced through complex interactions between water and power, a waterscape is a \u2018politicised environment\u2019 that rejects \u2018apolitical\u2019 ecologies that obscure conflicts over meaning and practice. Political ecology of water has been enriched by sophisticated analyses of water-power dynamics, unruly materiality and emancipatory projects, while the concept of a waterscape has brought to the foreground the thick network of actors and interests that constitute it. This chapter advocates a further disciplinary transgression in the research field via a cultural turn. Given that control over water can be a means of cultural conquest, and not simply a way to assert political-economic power over a resource, it is argued that political ecologists will need to widen their unit of analysis to permit greater conceptual elaboration and empirical depth. This chapter discusses how key cultural factors, notably symbolism, consumption, belonging and landscape, intersect with politics to produce waterscapes, and draws on diverse Indian examples by way of illustration. In the process, the case for a more culturally-oriented political ecology of water is thereby made. \n\n(This draft chapter has been published by Edward Elgar Publishing in 'The International Handbook of Political Ecology' edited by Raymond L.

Because of issues of abuse and neglect, the Commonwealth Government identified this cohort on November 16, 2009 as a vulnerable group with \u2018special needs\u2019 in their senior years. A review of the literature exposed significant gaps in what is known about the Forgotten Australians. One of these gaps is a lack of discussion on a sense of belonging and its effects in later life.  The aim of this study was to explore how individuals who lived in institutional out-of-home child care in Australia before 1974 experienced, during adult years, a sense of belonging in relationships with significant others, and in relation to community and a sense of self.  \n\nUsing hermeneutical phenomenology, this research was designed to explore participants\u2019 narrated experiences by drawing on theoretical and methodological approaches that facilitate the expression of subjective experiences.  Research methods included semi-structured interviews conducted with 21 participants in all states and territories of Australia between January 2012 and April 2012. Key findings included experiences of stigma and shame as well as not feeling part of, or belonging to communities or societal groups. For many, a sense of not belonging has impacted on how they see themselves in relation to community and others in later life. Several participants spoke of having stable places to live; however they also spoke of feelings of discomfort and of being disconnected from the communities in which they resided. \n\nThe conclusion of this research was that most participants belonged to one of two distinct orientations. In the first group, members continued to have challenges with how they viewed themselves and connected to community. The second group contained those who have overcome the negative view of their sense of self; even though they continued to have challenges connecting to community. Finally, there was one outlier who never felt that his experiences in institutional care affected the way he viewed himself or how he connected to community. The findings highlight the need for further research so that services and education programs can be developed to assist Forgotten Australians integrating into social networks as they age. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61148653, "asset_id": 40862920, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25739592, "first_name": "Gregory P.", "last_name": "Smith", "domain_name": "scu-au", "page_name": "GregoryPSmith", "display_name": "Gregory P.

the lack or absence of something. However, it is less clear what, exactly, is experienced as missing. In this chapter, I take my lead from the phenomenologist and psychiatrist, J. H. van den Berg, who emphasizes a distinctive way of experiencing one's surroundings.

This study has focused on whether the Meskhetian Turks who have migrated to Turkey particularly since 1992 have preferred Turkey or the Meskhetian territories as the motherland with priority. The direction of the predominant preferences by the Meskhetian Turks regarding spatial belonging will be examined via the selected sample. It will be questioned how much the Governments in the position of being decision makers as the political power in Turkey in the 1992-2017 period affected the \"migration management\" policy on the Meskhetian Turks in terms of \"encouraging\" or \"discouraging\" arrival in Turkey. In addition, the subject of how much attention the Meskhetian Turks who have returned to Turkey at\nincreasing rates in the recent years draw in the public opinion and of how much social adaptation to the Turks in Turkey is achieved will be questioned through in-depth interviews. Moreover, their emotions about spatial belonging will be scrutinized. In the final analysis, the content of this proposed paper questions the presence of \"motherland\" belonging, which is claimed to exist in the Meskhetian Turks for both countries towards Turkey and the Meskhetian territories that comes to the fore in the literature, and emphasis will be put on the sense of belonging to the territories and identity of which country might have a stronger influence in the future scenario.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56939349, "asset_id": 36990411, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4992178, "first_name": "Damla", "last_name": "MURS\u00dcL", "domain_name": "nny", "page_name": "DamlaKabaku\u015fak", "display_name": "Damla  MURS\u00dcL", "profile_url": "https://nny.academia.edu/DamlaKabaku%C5%9Fak?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4992178/2164410/19808840/s65_damla.murs_l.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14580, "name": "Forced Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 134693, "name": "Refugees and Forced Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees_and_Forced_Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 428169, "name": "Migration Management", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Management?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 466447, "name": "Ahiska Turks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ahiska_Turks?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1342925, "name": "Ah\u0131ska T\u00fcrkleri", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ahiska_Turkleri?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 40466915, "title": "Belonging without Boundaries: Settlers, Sojourners and Travelers in the 21st Century", "created_at": "2019-09-28T14:13:48.157-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40466915/Belonging_without_Boundaries_Settlers_Sojourners_and_Travelers_in_the_21st_Century?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_40466915", "summary": "\u201cThe Church of God sojourning in Rome to the Church of God sojourning in Corinth.\u201d - Clement\u2019s Letter to the Corinthians\n\nIn Clement\u2019s letter, the Greek paroikousa (sojourning) means a provisional abode as opposed to katokein, the citizen with residence, from which we may derive two modes of living: parokein (to sojourn like a stranger) and katokein (to reside like a citizen). His message was that the Church was not a permanent structure but a sojourn and that Christians live in messianic time.\n\nThe 20th century saw so many displacements of peoples across borders, languages and cultures that the terms emigrants, immigrants and migrants are sprinkled across the literature of every field of human endeavour from law to literature, from politics to philosophy, and certainly from\npsychiatry to psychoanalysis. Things have only gotten more complex in the 21st century where the bipolar world of the Cold War and \u201cthe end of history\u201d has given way to a multicentric, polyglot cacaphony where culture has replaced class as the dominant signifier and language has become the major expressive vehicle of that shift. In the European Union alone, there are 23 official languages, the UN has 6 official languages, and battles over language as the emblem of culture are evident among peoples affirming their identity everywhere\u2014from Quebec to Catalonia, Rwanda to East\nTimor.\n\nWhither belonging in all this? The author argues that belonging has become a critical issue for sociocultural psychiatry and for global mental health. Belonging has a bi-valent, ambiguous, deeply unresolved/unresolvable quality, what philosophy calls an aporia, a puzzle. We can begin to describe this puzzle with the dichotomy settlers or sojourners: those who are \u201chere\u201d to settle and those who stay for work or other reasons, for shorter or longer periods, but do not make their home \u201cthere.\u201d There is, however, a third state of being, intermediate between sojourners who merely stay a while and settlers who plant roots, and that is those who still on the journey, in transit, \u201cbetwixt and between,\u201d as anthropologist Victor Turner described it, neither here nor there, travelers on the threshold. Whether it accompanies a language, a nation, a profession, or other organizing system of meaning, the construct of belonging can be more than an aporia for imagining identity and the very definition of subject and subjectivity.\n\n\u201cBelonging\u201d is a way of rethinking relational being, how we define mental health, how we understand the expression of its vicissitudes, and how we organize care and healing for sufferers. To do this, we need to recognize how belonging is experienced and negotiated, free of the constraints of our habitual patterns of practice and thought, to imagine belonging without borders for settlers, sojourners and travelers in the 21st century.\n\nBibliography:\n\n1.

In 2014 and 2019, Hong Kong caught the world\u2019s imagination via massive long-term protests for democracy and socioeconomic justice while under de facto rule by mainland China.  Following both waves of social movements, heightened sociopolitical repression was brought down upon students, other activists, and mainstream society.  Under such conditions, it is understandable that students and teachers struggled to develop a sense of agency, belonging, and community.  It is within these contexts that the Project for Critical Research, Pedagogy and Praxis (PCRP) emerged from 2015-2020.  Co-written by student and teacher members of PCRP, this chapter discusses PCRP\u2019s efforts at building an educational pipeline from the undergraduate to Ph.D. level, across university campuses and K-12 school communities.  \r\n\r\nUtilizing sociocultural learning and critical pedagogy, including Chang\u2019s notions of recognition, solidarity and collaboration, this pipeline\u2019s focus was on developing more engaging and rigorous teacher education praxes at research universities, linking pre-/in-service teachers, teacher educators, and researchers.  Particularly concerned with equity issues, the PCRP pipeline was based at a research-intensive campus that also largely serves working-class students, or those who are the first in their family to attend college.  Adapting social justice-oriented theories originally developed in the Global North, this chapter presents insights to teacher education and educational pipeline work in Asia, and how they can be sustained as spaces of greater agency, belonging, and community abroad.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71997798, "asset_id": 56780896, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37992, "first_name": "Benji", "last_name": "Chang", "domain_name": "tc", "page_name": "BenjiChang", "display_name": "Benji Chang", "profile_url": "https://tc.academia.edu/BenjiChang?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37992/12628/26014105/s65_benji.chang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1607, "name": "Participatory Action Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_Action_Research?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11237, "name": "Sociocultural Theory Of Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociocultural_Theory_Of_Learning?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18004, "name": "Equity and Social Justice in Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equity_and_Social_Justice_in_Higher_Education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 28115, "name": "South Asian Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Diasporas?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 57253, "name": "Internationalization of higher education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internationalization_of_higher_education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 96694, "name": "Ethnic minority groups", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_minority_groups?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 106182, "name": "Pre Service Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pre_Service_Teacher_Education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 163315, "name": "Hong Kong studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hong_Kong_studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 391715, "name": "Ethnicity and National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_National_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 618429, "name": "Chinese Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 981519, "name": "In service Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In_service_Teacher_Education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 982211, "name": "Mentorship of Beginning Teachers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mentorship_of_Beginning_Teachers?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1890988, "name": "P-20 Educational Pipeline", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/P-20_Educational_Pipeline?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3301263, "name": "rightful presence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/rightful_presence?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 37003525, "title": "Affect in Relation: Families, Places, Technologies", "created_at": "2018-07-08T07:14:53.417-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37003525/Affect_in_Relation_Families_Places_Technologies?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_37003525", "summary": "Affect in Relation brings together perspectives from social science and cultural studies to analyze the formative, subject constituting potentials of affect and emotion.

"summary": "The thesis traces Internet textual representations of the Maidan, a wide-scale protest movement that took place in 2013-2014 in Ukraine, and their function in identifying the opposing sides during the protests. These texts helped to formulate new narratives, articulate attitudes, and build relationships, create a sense of community within the protestors\u2019 side, which had its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices.\nFacebook served as an important platform for the initial appeal, for coordination between the participants, for reflections, and for identification of the opposing sides during the protests. It was a key space for sharing emotions, personal stories, humor and expressive forms of protest, making allusions to known literary works, historical events and world public figures.\nExploring the types of narratives and their contribution in identifying the opposing sides, the work is focused on digital stories that illuminate elements not covered by the professional media coverage and official reports. It traces the diverse forms, topics and expressive devices in the narratives, and identifies the categories of lore (eyewitness narratives, (re)telling of stories, jokes, poetry, songs, etc.). It provides juxtaposition of the patterns found in the text with the main events of each specific day. \nThe thesis provides several chapters that focus on: (1) a review of the historical context of the events; (2) an analysis of the data with reference to all categories and topics, and the main findings; (3) the role of humor and expressive devices in releasing the tension of the conflict and in helping to formulate the attitudes within the protestors\u2019 side; (4) evidence of the functions of personal stories as they build relationships, create a sense of community, and validate the participants\u2019 experiences and the significance of the events from the protestors\u2019 perspectives; (5) interpretation within this protest lore, and its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices as in the example of the Nebesna Sotnia (Heavenly Hundred) narrative formation and its correlation to the repertoire of motifs and terms of the selected historical periods: the Cossack, the Ukrainian National Republic and World War II.\nThe study underlines the relevance of time and several patterns related to historical events, as Facebook posts immediately responded to the events occurring on the square and streets occupied by protestors, simultaneously with professional media outlets, and sometimes prior to them. These findings have important implications that go beyond the Ukrainian context in that they contribute to the further exploration of social networks functioning in relation to factual events.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53646657, "asset_id": 33632356, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50733725, "first_name": "Nataliya", "last_name": "Bezborodova", "domain_name": "ualberta", "page_name": "NBezborodova", "display_name": "Nataliya Bezborodova", "profile_url": "https://ualberta.academia.edu/NBezborodova?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50733725/13402307/23074490/s65_nataliya.bezborodova.jpg"}, {"id": 18655131, "first_name": "Nataliya", "last_name": "Bezborodova", "domain_name": "ualberta", "page_name": "NataliyaBezborodova", "display_name": "Nataliya  Bezborodova", "profile_url": "https://ualberta.academia.edu/NataliyaBezborodova?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18655131/5181899/5933291/s65_nataliya.bezborodova.jpg_oh_619547f8298819119fd26f835b267041_oe_54b4e0ef___gda___1420488318_37675f98ae4c425728acc950b430bdf2"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5310, "name": "Language, Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8769, "name": "Intangible cultural heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intangible_cultural_heritage?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11474, "name": "Commemoration (Memory Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_Memory_Studies_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 16391, "name": "Space And Place (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_And_Place_Art_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 19764, "name": "Intangible Cultural Heritage (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Culture_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 24135, "name": "Experiences of Place and Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experiences_of_Place_and_Space?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 47191, "name": "Historical memory and Identity studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_memory_and_Identity_studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 68355, "name": "Imagining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagining?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 78121, "name": "Memory Studies/historical Memory and Identity/", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies_historical_Memory_and_Identity_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 82632, "name": "Memory and Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_and_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 94755, "name": "Community building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_building?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 123392, "name": "Social Theory, Urban and Cultural Studies, and the Interactions Between Urban Space, Politics, Memory, and Subjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Theory_Urban_and_Cultural_Studies_and_the_Interactions_Between_Urban_Space_Politics_Memor?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 151359, "name": "Anthropology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 157784, "name": "Space, place and culture;

These are often applied and reproduced in the social sciences as a result of methodological nationalism. Space-sensitive studies of migration and globalization and a return to the material have recently challenged social constructivist lines of argumentation and have provoked a con-ceptual shift from analytical categories with inherent spatiality, territoriality, and boundary marking to concepts based on movement and flow. In this paper the analysis of belonging and the related politics of belonging in migration studies incorporates space as an analytical category that cross-cuts established categorizations such as race, class, gender, and stage in the life cycle, and integrates a material semiotic perspective more systematically into the study of social rela-tions at the intersection of the social categories mentioned. A new concept of belonging is defined which reflects the complex relations that individuals have with other people, circulating objects, artefacts, and changing social, political, and cultural landscapes, thus mirroring both the material conditions and the underlying power relations. Such an un-derstanding of belonging proceeds from social naturalizations and fixations to the multiplicity and situatedness of indi-vidual attachments, which entangle social, imagined, and sensual-material relations that are constantly re-articulated and re-negotiated by actors in their day-to-day practices. In such a reading, belonging comes into being as a result of individual life stories, versatile contexts, and situated experiences and acts. In times of constant exchange through trav-el, mass media, and communication technologies, the conceptualization of belonging questions established sociocul-tural and political demarcations, indicates the compatibility of ascribed socio-cultural difference and stresses the per-meability of borderlines. A space-sensitive theorization of social relations and belonging opens up new perspectives on the question of how social collectives are naturalized and by whom, and under which conditions they open up to new forms of belonging; it thus brings forth new findings about collectivization, social mobilization, and change", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38131625, "asset_id": 13804986, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8233099, "first_name": "eva", "last_name": "youkhana", "domain_name": "uni-bonn", "page_name": "evayoukhana", "display_name": "eva youkhana", "profile_url": "https://uni-bonn.academia.edu/evayoukhana?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8233099/9365341/10437781/s65_eva.youkhana.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29487, "name": "Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40516, "name": "Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spain?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 136649, "name": "Madrid", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Madrid?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 280877, "name": "Creative Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_Activism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 768477, "name": "Politics of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1992300, "name": "Religious Place-making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Place-making?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 41058897, "title": "MINORITIES, MAJORITIES, AND THE MONARCH: NATIONALIZING EFFECTS OF THE LATE OTTOMAN ROYAL PUBLIC CEREMONIES, 1808 -

Using heritage as a perspective to these dynamics in Bulgaria, I examine the interactions between the national-populist actors that challenge the core of liberal democracy, and the LGBT+ movement which counters xenophobic and exclusionary politics. In particular, the study focuses on the tenth edition of Sofia Pride march held in 2017 that instrumentalized elements of traditional masked mumming and fused them with international queer symbolics for its visual identity and communicational campaign. National folklore was thus reclaimed to performatively contest ethnonationalist and heteronormative discourses and assert a more inclusive understanding of heritage and belonging. This strategic reinterpretation of masquerade revealed some persistent societal divides which materialized through the hostile reactions of far-right parties and other conservative circles. Following this opposition, the paper sheds light on the local entanglements with the global illiberal wave and anti-gender mobilizations, while additionally provides a more attuned contextualization of the Bulgarian terrain. It further emphasizes the empirical and epistemological implications of gendered heritage for both the establishment of and the resistance to boundaries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78902036, "asset_id": 68421946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1443059, "first_name": "Ivo", "last_name": "Strahilov", "domain_name": "uni-sofia", "page_name": "IStrahilov", "display_name": "Ivo Strahilov", "profile_url": "https://uni-sofia.academia.edu/IStrahilov?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1443059/2800258/31505547/s65_ivo.strahilov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6013, "name": "Performativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performativity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 7896, "name": "Bulgaria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bulgaria?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 19764, "name": "Intangible Cultural Heritage (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Culture_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 51593, "name": "Radical Right", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_Right?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 52020, "name": "Radical Right Populism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Radical_Right_Populism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 64718, "name": "Ethnonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnonationalism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 72394, "name": "LGBT Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 111356, "name": "Carnival", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carnival?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 287761, "name": "Masquerade", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masquerade?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 469051, "name": "Masquerades and Carnival", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Masquerades_and_Carnival?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 515217, "name": "Contested Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contested_Heritage?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 545153, "name": "Critical Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1229586, "name": "Intagible Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intagible_Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2929111, "name": "anti-gender movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/anti-gender_movements?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 36710790, "title": "Chapitre 8 -

Thousands were born to mothers and often fathers who were abducted by the LRA and forced to marry inside the rebel group. The children are part of a global population of people born of sexual violence in conflict. This dissertation contributes to the small but growing body of work on this population called \u2018children born of war.\u2019 Using a child-centered methodology, this study is grounded in the everyday experiences of 29 children born into the LRA, with data collected at various points over a period of eight months between 2011 and 2016 in northern Uganda. The following research questions guided my inquiry: 1) How do the children experience their everyday social lives? 2) How do they make sense of their experiences? 3) What strategies and resources do they use or access to help navigate their everyday lives? 4) What macro and micro processes lend insight into or explain these experiences? To answer these questions, I developed a conceptual framework consisting of the ideas of a) the politics of belonging, inclusive of place-based, and b) nation-building and hegemonic masculinity. The findings point to the role of place-making in shaping the children\u2019s social experiences. Careful examination of their everyday lives reveals the children\u2019s efforts to negotiate the boundaries of their exclusion in effort to navigate toward better positions in life. Through drawings, journals, storytelling, and play, I interpret how the children make sense of their experiences and construct a sense of legitimacy despite their marginalization. By situating their experiences within current and historical political forces, their everyday experiences become intelligible as central to a local and national politics of belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61086290, "asset_id": 40803160, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1493340, "first_name": "Beth W.", "last_name": "Stewart", "domain_name": "fdu", "page_name": "BethWStewart", "display_name": "Beth W.

It questions the ways that power relations operate to re/create spatial differences as reductive. Intra-actions re/counted demanded the materialisation of particular types of schoolgirls within marked spaces, demonstrating the making of difference as entangled Baradian (2007) cuts productive of exclusions. Enacting improvisations \u2018to fit\u2019 enabled some of the female participants to endure these spaces but others removed themselves from educative pathways. Some bodies were worn down, and others found ease of movement. The filmic methodology employed accounts for shifting \u2018multiple instances\u2019, revealing a multiple and conflicting reality (as mattered meaning). The virtual viewer becomes with the research in affective intra-action that is materially consequential. The re/active documentary methodology (Wolfe, 2016a) accommodates a multiple non-linguistic affective recognition of relationality, a sameness in difference.

For international students, moving from their 'home' countries to a new country entails significant changes in their everyday lives. Moving across continents and temporarily or permanently settling in a 'foreign' land are the stepping stones to an intensely mobile existence. They maintain transnational connections with their 'home' country, and move across and between different social spaces locally, primarily with the help of friendship networks. Framing the research around theoretical underpinnings of migration, transnationalism, and (im)mobilities in the context of 'home' for Indian students in London and Toronto, the research involved 72 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 36 students, together with self-directed photography of their everyday life and solicited week-long diaries. The research has two main aims. The first is to explore the emotional, material, sensorial, and embodied nature of 'home' and their spatialities in three different spaces: the city, university, and dwelling. Second, the research aims to unearth the multi-layered nature of their socio-spatial identities through their everyday spatialities. The main findings re-instated the importance of place as experiences of the students in the spaces of the city, university, and dwelling varied (and were also similar) in London and Toronto.

After descendants of Chinese immigrants, widely regarded as Thailand\u2019s largest and most successfully assimilated ethnic minority, Malays residing south of Satun and Songkhla are over three times more numerous that the Northern Khmer of southern Isaan, its next most populous ethnic minority. Practically all Thai citizens self-identifying as Melayu are Muslims, and Islam is Thailand\u2019s largest religious minority. Nevertheless, not all Muslims self-identify as Malays, and Islam has long been acknowledged as being anything but a monolith. In addition to being an ethnically diverse ecumene, its sectarian divisions mirror those present throughout Southeast Asia. Some surmise Thailand\u2019s Muslims being divided between \u201cMalay-Muslims\u201d, and \u201cThai-Muslims\u201d who are either traditionalist or reformist in orientation. This paper proposes perspectives on Thailand\u2019s Muslim mosaic based multi-sited fieldwork among Sufi orders (Ar. turuq, tariqa [sg.]) with visible and viable followings from among the Central Thai-speaking, Southern Thai-speaking, and Malay-speaking Muslim communities. This paper seeks to articulate alternatives to the double-barreled binaries that have provided the theoretical ballast in previous explorations of Muslim ethnic and religious diversity. Whilst relevant details of these hereunto unstudied Sufi orders are provided, this paper\u2019s considers the significance of their presence in three cultural milieu between Ayutthaya and Narathiwat over the details of the spiritual lineages (Ar. silsilah) or litanies (Ar. wird) of individual orders. Rather than where these orders have come from, I concentrate on both their adoption by Central Thai, Southern Thailand, and Malay-speaking Muslims, and the manner in which they have been adapted in ways that reflect these regional identities.

Arguing that \u2018mid-level theory\u2019 of the sort presented in the framework provides a strong basis for structuring academic debate and dialogue with practitioners and policymakers, we identify four key issues that although of some current interest warrant further attention. First, we consider recent evidence from Europe and elsewhere on how prevailing notions of nationhood and citizenship determine understandings of integration, and argue that this powerfully shapes the social space available to refugees with regard to \u2018belonging\u2019. Second, we note the wide adoption of concepts of social capital in framing components of social connection in the context of integration, but suggest greater attention is paid to the manner in which bonds, bridges and links establish forms of reciprocity and trust in social relations. Third, we examine the notion that integration is a \u2018two way\u2019 process, and suggest how this might be expanded to embrace the multiplicity and fluidity of social meaning and identity.

The individual interacts with the space as a 'subject' in the first order and creates the process of transforming it into 'place'. The bond / emotion that the individual establishes with the space provides the richness and interaction of his daily and social life. Space-subject relationship is also closely related to the individual's sense of belonging. Being a part of a place can be considered as an important parameter of space choice for the user. In this context, the protection and sustainability of the places are successful in direct proportion with the sense of belonging to the user. Considering the traditional urban areas reevaluated by conservation studies today, the continuity of the use of individuals living and working in these areas is of great importance in the context of the sustainability of these areas. The users' feelings of these areas ensure that the physical interventions are positive in the context of conservation and sustainability. Conservation of regions where traditional texture is present in growing cities; While maintaining the existence of urban spaces, on the other hand, it maintains the continuity of the social and spatial life with which the individual is associated with the bond. In this context, accepting the sense of individual and social belonging as one of the basic planning parameters in the urban conservation process; is an important issue for both social and spatial sustainability. The aim of the study is to examine the traces of the concept of belonging through the conservation and sustainability of traditional settlements in urban areas and open them for discussion. In this context, the urban protection, sustainability and belonging phenomena are examined, and \u0130zmir-S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k castle area, which is selected as an example area and where these phenomena stand out, is discussed. S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Castle settlement, which allows the results of the sense of belonging with its permanent users and touristic aspects to be evaluated from different perspectives, is a very rich example in the context of the relationship between belonging-urban conservation and sustainability. As a working method, the related literature has been examined and on-site observations are detailed. From this point of view, the study is thought to be useful in emphasizing the relationship between urban conservation and sustainability not only with concrete-physical concepts but also with abstractness, which is an abstract concept.\r\nKeywords: Urban Conservation, Sustainability, Belonging, S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Inter Castle Settlement.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80399041, "asset_id": 68052107, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 156436435, "first_name": "Nihal Arda", "last_name": "Aky\u0131ld\u0131z", "domain_name": "balikesir", "page_name": "NihalArdaAky\u0131ld\u0131z", "display_name": "Nihal Arda Aky\u0131ld\u0131z", "profile_url": "https://balikesir.academia.edu/NihalArdaAky%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/156436435/43737220/39437548/s65_nihal_arda.aky_ld_z.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19702, "name": "Urban Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Conservation?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 183004, "name": "S\u00fcrd\u00fcr\u00fclebilirlik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/S%C3%BCrd%C3%BCr%C3%BClebilirlik?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 286990, "name": "Kentsel s\u00fcrd\u00fcr\u00fclebilirlik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kentsel_surdurulebilirlik?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 396608, "name": "Kentsel Koruma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kentsel_Koruma?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2613143, "name": "Aidiyet Duygusu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aidiyet_Duygusu?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2864942, "name": "Mek\u00e2nsal Aidiyet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mek%C3%A2nsal_Aidiyet?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3640964, "name": "S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Inter Castle Settlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/S%C4%B1%C4%9Fac%C4%B1k_Inter_Castle_Settlement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 4066044, "name": "S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Yerle\u015fim Alan\u0131", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/S%C4%B1%C4%9Fac%C4%B1k_Yerle%C5%9Fim_Alan%C4%B1?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 43849588, "title": "Kinship, Law and Politics: An Anatomy of Belonging", "created_at": "2020-08-13T06:40:59.173-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43849588/Kinship_Law_and_Politics_An_Anatomy_of_Belonging?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_43849588", "summary": "Why are we so concerned with belonging?

One line of research has looked at churches founded by migrants as home away from home, helping migrants to settle in a new place and at the same time connecting them back to where they came from. Another strand has rather highlighted incorporation into a global Christendom and engagement in global spiritual warfare. Whereas the first line of research is often phrased in terms of diaspora and religion, the second one views Pentecostalism as producing globality on its own terms. With this article, we attempt to contribute to this discussion by asking how deterritorialized belonging is produced in daily Pentecostal practices. What is made present when a home is made absent? What kind of attentive practices create the presence of the Holy Spirit? In thinking with the notion of hodological care, we argue that Pentecostal churches founded by Gha-naian migrants in Southern Africa and Europe create belonging not to a \" home \" but to connections. They thereby produce forms of de-dia-sporization, which could be seen as belonging through disconnecting.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54041966, "asset_id": 34111130, "asset_type": "Work",

Accordingly, several Malaysian writers such as K.S. Maniam have addressed the issues in their literary productions. This paper intends to examine the dilemmas, agonies and desolations of Indian community in Malaysia which have been reflected in K.S. Maniam\u2019s autobiographical novel The Return (1981). In the story, Maniam voices out the experiences of Indian minority in the troubled times of Malaysia and their struggle for assimilation and adaptation to the new land as well as their identity crisis. Central characters of the story, Ravi, Periathai and Naina as three different generations of Indian migrant in the landscape of Malaysia attempt to embrace the new land as their home and build their coherent or homogeneous Malaysian identity.

The extreme metal scene, birthed from the heavy metal genre of music which in turn evolved from rock and roll music of the 1960s and 1970s, has been censored for its lack of cultural morality and plagued by negative stereotypes (Liew and Foo 2006). Even with a gradual liberalisation process of the state in an effort to position the state as a renaissance city (Kong 2000, Tan 2007), extreme metal bands and fans have still been associated with moral decay and only afforded limited spaces to perform their fandoms. Through the use of virtual ethnography, participant observation and semi-structured interviews of members of the extreme metal scene, I look at how these musicians and fans derive ideas of belonging, meaning and identity for this fiercely insular and alternative scene that prides itself on its celebration of the transgressive.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65883920, "asset_id": 45347358, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30590722, "first_name": "Joel", "last_name": "Skadiang", "domain_name": "nus", "page_name": "JoelSkadiang", "display_name": "Joel Skadiang", "profile_url": "https://nus.academia.edu/JoelSkadiang?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30590722/25288957/63215660/s65_joel.skadiang.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3351, "name": "Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subcultures?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16893, "name": "Youth Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Subcultures?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 132468, "name": "Transgression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgression?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 183577, "name": "Extreme Metal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extreme_Metal?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 202921, "name": "Music scenes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_scenes?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 32960465, "title": "White Namibians in tourism and the politics of belonging through Bushmen", "created_at": "2017-05-11T08:26:26.887-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32960465/White_Namibians_in_tourism_and_the_politics_of_belonging_through_Bushmen?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_32960465", "summary": "Namibian Bushmen, such as the Hai//om and the Ju/\u2019hoansi, are increasingly involved in the growing, white-dominated tourism industry.

Elsewhere, whites from southern Africa have avoided contact with blacks by identifying more with nature than with people. This has been an important element in their \u201cpolitics of belonging\u201d to the land. From this perspective, Bushmen occupy a special position because they are considered \u201cpart of nature\u201d while they are also members of contemporary society. Although this view is paradoxical at first sight, I argue that essentialising Bushmen as people of nature and modernising (developing) them \u201cinto society\u201d are compatible ideas that can strengthen white Namibians\u2019 belonging to nature and society.

affective reserves of Zikr, the Sufi exercise of godly remembrance. It explores how performances of religious longing broaden the moral experience of a post-migrant Berlin by offering contemporary believers critically thin zones of hypersocial contact with Islamic holy figures. Zikr emerges as a key interface of felt and material worlds: through acts of remembrance, subliminal figures and migrant inheritances are made contemporaneous while sup- pressed civic-political matters find a spectral, more-than-visual presence in Berlin. Sufi haunting thus achieves, amid enduring conditions of migration, a provisional posi- tioning of the not-here and the not-now as an also-here. Such remembrance affords migrants a greater awareness of being distinctly historical as well as the critical means to look past conditions of the present.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80802608, "asset_id": 71477634, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13201720, "first_name": "omar", "last_name": "kasmani", "domain_name": "fu-berlin", "page_name": "omarkasmani", "display_name": "omar kasmani", "profile_url": "https://fu-berlin.academia.edu/omarkasmani?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13201720/9079052/42567774/s65_omar.kasmani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11152, "name": "Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sufism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 17330, "name": "Affect Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Theory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 23855, "name": "Affect Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 44070, "name": "Berlin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Berlin?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53039, "name": "Haunting and Spectrality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Haunting_and_Spectrality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 107947, "name": "Anthropology of Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Islam?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 11928278, "title": "SOCIAL CITIZENSHIP AND DISABILITY: IDENTITY, BELONGING, AND THE STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION OF EDUCATION", "created_at": "2015-04-13T10:09:52.196-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11928278/SOCIAL_CITIZENSHIP_AND_DISABILITY_IDENTITY_BELONGING_AND_THE_STRUCTURAL_ORGANIZATION_OF_EDUCATION?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_11928278", "summary": "The framing of disability is an ongoing, negotiated discourse in which participants build upon, challenge, and reject the political, social, economic, and cultural influences that lead to constructions of impairment. Experiences of racialization, poverty, immigration, gender, and sexuality juxtaposed against defined institutionalized norms and dominant narratives speak to how disability is not only conceived but also experienced. Drawing upon transnational and citizenship theory, this thesis proposes employing a new framework of analysis, centralizing the experience of social citizenship and belonging as an indicator of broader structural equity. Situated in the field of education, theoretical considerations also explore how growing market fundamentalism shapes public schools and contributes to the systematic exclusion of poor and racialized students through mechanisms of disablement such as reduced academic programs and special education placement.\r\n\r\nThis body of work includes three separate, but related, studies exploring historical and current incidences of institutional exclusion. In particular, the nuanced relationship of exclusion to race, class, gender, generational status, and sexuality, complicated with the identification of impairment, is explored. One of the most profound findings of this research is that, although there is much discussion in Disability Studies of the construction of impairment labels, this is the first quantitative analysis to substantiate these claims. Results also indicate that the classroom represents the most stratified space in which student groups defined by race, exceptionality, class, and generational status experience the greatest sense of exclusion. Evidence shows that employing a lens of citizenship and belonging is an authoritative tool in identifying the existence of inequities distributed among myriad identity groups. Furthermore, evidence lends credence to the notion that identification of disability is intimately linked to race, gender, and class contexts.\r\n\u2003\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47997169, "asset_id": 11928278, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5473000, "first_name": "Gillian", "last_name": "Parekh", "domain_name": "yorku", "page_name": "GillianParekh", "display_name": "Gillian Parekh", "profile_url": "https://yorku.academia.edu/GillianParekh?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5473000/2402652/2796376/s65_gillian.parekh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1062, "name": "Special Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Special_Education?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1298, "name": "Alternative Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Education?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2595, "name": "Critical Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Disability_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2808, "name": "Poverty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poverty?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2818, "name": "Education and Youth Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_Youth_Exclusion?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3210, "name": "Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregation?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3512, "name": "Educational Inequalities (class;

Focusing on contemporary and everyday expressions of nationhood, the study marked a profound shift away from previous attempts to map the transformation to an era of nations and the association of nationalism with political violence, civil conflict and extremist movements.\n \nBillig\u2019s arguments have been picked up by scholars working in an impressive range of disciplines as part of the recent turn to the \u2018everyday\u2019, and the term \u2018banal\u2019 has come to form a short hand for the study of the ways in which particular representations, forms of social organisation and cultural practice become normalised and taken-for-granted.\n\nWhile, however, there have been numerous journal papers and monographs that have made reference to Billig\u2019s work, there has yet to be an in-depth, critical and comprehensive evaluation of the study or how it has impacted on both studies of nationalism and the social sciences as a whole. In the latter case, it\u2019s worth noting that the Banal Nationalism thesis has not been made redundant by the burgeoning literature on globalisation but instead has been extended by scholars looking to theorise new forms of sociability, most notably Urry and Beck\u2019s influential work on \u2018banal globalism\u2019 and \u2018banal cosmopolitanism\u2019, respectively.\n\nThis edited collection, drawing together scholars from a range of disciplines, will assess the contribution of Billig\u2019s work but, above all, draw on recent developments in theories of practice, material culture, media and communications and affect to highlight new developments in the field. These discussions will place it at the cutting edge of current research into social and cultural identities.

They were restructured by Spanish rule, as they had been by the Inca conquest before. Spanish rule also reshaped indigenous migration and the social categorization of the migrants, which was closely intertwined with the regime of land tenure. This article takes a look at the integration of new and old migrants and their descendants into the local social structure, and examines how they negotiated their belonging in petitions to change or defend their fuero. The petitioners successfully argued on the basis of their ancestry, whether legitimate or not, and activated personal networks on their behalf. In that, they paralleled mestizo and mulatto petitioners who, like migrants, benefited from fiscal prerogatives, which were however challenged in the course of the 18th century, leading to a partial re-categorization. The redistribution of land was an important motive in these late colonial re-categorizations, but also earlier in the colonial period the absence of bonds to the land was an essential characteristic of being categorized as a \u201cmigrant\u201d.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55915613, "asset_id": 31692770, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1850079, "first_name": "Sarah", "last_name": "Albiez-Wieck", "domain_name": "uni-m", "page_name": "SarahAlbiezWieck", "display_name": "Sarah Albiez-Wieck", "profile_url": "https://uni-m.academia.edu/SarahAlbiezWieck?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1850079/628670/874705/s65_sarah.albiez-wieck.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15262, "name": "Latin American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45246, "name": "Colonial Latin American History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonial_Latin_American_History?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 1565408, "title": "Nationalism, Narcissicism and Victimhood", "created_at": "2012-05-16T15:46:37.395-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1565408/Nationalism_Narcissicism_and_Victimhood?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_1565408", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 13867248, "asset_id": 1565408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1131134, "first_name": "Ghassan", "last_name": "Hage", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "GhassanHage", "display_name": "Ghassan Hage", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/GhassanHage?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1131134/548665/936471/s65_ghassan.hage.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6693, "name": "Palestine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Palestine?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188525, "name": "Anti-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-Colonialism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 4265454, "title": "PETER SLOTERDIJK: ENSAYOS DE INTOXICACI\u00d3N VOLUNTARIA Y CONSTITUCI\u00d3N PSICO-INMUNITARIA DE LA NATURALEZA HUMANA", "created_at": "2013-08-18T05:49:04.137-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4265454/PETER_SLOTERDIJK_ENSAYOS_DE_INTOXICACI%C3%93N_VOLUNTARIA_Y_CONSTITUCI%C3%93N_PSICO_INMUNITARIA_DE_LA_NATURALEZA_HUMANA?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_4265454", "summary": "\"RESUMEN \u2013 ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nSe indaga en torno a la intoxicaci\u00f3n voluntaria, dentro de un programa general encaminado a la experimentaci\u00f3n con el propio cuerpo, m\u00e9todo que encuentra sus fundamentos en la idea de la medicina rom\u00e1ntica donde, seg\u00fan Sloterdijk, los efectos de las dosis en el hombre sano y el enfermo se reflejaban de manera especular. Es aqu\u00ed donde se origina una ambiciosa semi\u00f3tica de la medicaci\u00f3n farmacol\u00f3gica, no s\u00f3lo del endomorfinismo de la especulaci\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n de mecanismos endocrinos o quimio\u00e9ticos.\r\nSloterdijk se refiere a un proceso de intoxicaci\u00f3n voluntaria en referencia al creador de la homeopat\u00eda, Samuel Hahnemann, como inventor de una micropol\u00edtica de la subjetividad. De la misma manera que el home\u00f3pata, seg\u00fan Hahnemann, debe intoxicarse a s\u00ed mismo antes de poder dar consejo alguno, el te\u00f3rico pol\u00edtico debe estar dispuesto a arriesgar su identidad en la pr\u00e1ctica.\r\nSloterdijk al referirse a este tipo de \u201cexperimentos con uno mismo\u201d, no piensa en un experimento de vivisecci\u00f3n en las propias carnes, ni tampoco en la psicosis rom\u00e1ntica del psicoan\u00e1lisis, sino que m\u00e1s bien hace referencia, a un fen\u00f3meno perteneciente a la historia de la medicina moderna, el movimiento homeop\u00e1tico, que se remonta a hace m\u00e1s de doscientos a\u00f1os y cuya eficacia se verifica en tratamientos terap\u00e9uticos -con propuestas m\u00e9dicas adecuadas- capaces de tratar la neurosis moderna. Se examina y discute la convicci\u00f3n heterodoxa de que el m\u00e9dico estar\u00eda obligado a intoxicarse a s\u00ed mismo con todo lo que \u00e9l m\u00e1s tarde iba a prescribir a los enfermos. De esta reflexi\u00f3n procede el concepto de experimento con uno mismo: quien quiera ser m\u00e9dico necesita previamente ser cobaya, esto es ser su propio conejillos de Indias.\r\nEl autor valioso y \u00fatil es el que se contamina \u00e9l mismo con las materias con las que trabaja, sustancias de alto contenido t\u00f3xico, este planteamiento no ha cambiado.

However, varying perspectives on how belonging should be conceptualised, assessed, and cultivated has hampered much-needed progress on this timely and important topic. To address these critical issues, we conducted a narrative review that summarizes existing perspectives on belonging, describes a new integrative framework for understanding and studying belonging, and identifies several key avenues for future research and practice.\n\nMethod: We searched relevant databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, PsycInfo, and ClinicalTrials.gov, for articles describing belonging, instruments for assessing belonging, and interventions for increasing belonging.\n\nResults: By identifying the core components of belonging, we introduce a new integrative framework for understanding, assessing, and cultivating belonging that focuses on four interrelated components: competencies, opportunities, motivations, and perceptions.\n\nConclusion: This integrative framework enhances our understanding of the basic nature and features of belonging, provides a foundation for future interdisciplinary research on belonging and belongingness, and highlights how a robust sense of belonging may be cultivated to improve human health and resilience for individuals and communities worldwide.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67326033, "asset_id": 48921605, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1485621, "first_name": "Kelly-Ann", "last_name": "Allen", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "drkellyallen", "display_name": "Kelly-Ann Allen", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/drkellyallen?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1485621/529773/68494969/s65_kelly-ann.allen.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 70652582, "title": "Thinking through the lens of translocational positionality: An intersectionality frame for understanding identity and belonging", "created_at": "2022-02-06T00:26:42.226-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70652582/Thinking_through_the_lens_of_translocational_positionality_An_intersectionality_frame_for_understanding_identity_and_belonging?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_70652582", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80314485, "asset_id": 70652582, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 80807243, "first_name": "floya", "last_name": "anthias", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "anthias", "display_name": "floya anthias", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/anthias?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/80807243/101872593/91033651/s65_floya.anthias.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 29743, "name": "Translocations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translocations?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76666, "name": "Transnational", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3008187, "name": "Translocational Positionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translocational_Positionality?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 49055010, "title": "Hope and Uncertainty in Contemporary African Migration", "created_at": "2021-05-27T08:17:18.707-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49055010/Hope_and_Uncertainty_in_Contemporary_African_Migration?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_49055010", "summary": "This volume examines the relationship between hope, mobility, and immobility in African migration. Through case studies set within and beyond the continent, it demonstrates that hope offers a unique prism for analyzing the social imaginaries and aspirations which underpin migration in situations of uncertainty, deepening inequality, and delimited access to global circuits of legal mobility.\n\nThe volume takes departure in a mobility paradox that characterizes contemporary migration. Whereas people all over the world are exposed to widening sets of meaning of the good life elsewhere, an increasing number of people in the Global South have little or no access to authorized modes of international migration. This book examines how African migrants respond to this situation. Focusing on hope, it explores migrants\u2019 temporal and spatial horizons of expectation and possibility and how these horizons link to mobility practices. Such analysis is pertinent as precarious life conditions and increasingly restrictive regimes of mobility characterize the lives of many Africans, while migration continues to constitute important livelihood strategies and to be seen as pathways of improvement. Whereas involuntary immobility is one consequence, another is the emergence and consolidation of new destinations emerging in the Global South. The volume examines this development through empirically grounded and theoretically rich case studies in migrants\u2019 countries of origin, zones of transit, and in new and established destinations in Europe, North America, the Middle East, Latin America and China. It thereby offers an original perspective on linkages between migration, hope, and immobility, ranging from migration aspirations to return.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67444639, "asset_id": 49055010, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1697435, "first_name": "Nauja", "last_name": "Kleist", "domain_name": "diis", "page_name": "NKleist", "display_name": "Nauja Kleist", "profile_url": "https://diis.academia.edu/NKleist?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1697435/586412/15600395/s65_nauja.kleist.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1233, "name": "Social Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Networks?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5671, "name": "West Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Africa?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 9230, "name": "Hope", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hope?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 9620, "name": "Ghana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ghana?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 48174, "name": "Temporality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 50690, "name": "Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 56958, "name": "Transit Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transit_Migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 61603, "name": "Uncertainty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uncertainty?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 102533, "name": "Deportation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deportation?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 134579, "name": "African Migrations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Migrations?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 201233, "name": "Immobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immobility?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 248847, "name": "Mobility Regimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Regimes?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 492772, "name": "Border control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_control?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1811004, "name": "Migration Decisions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Decisions?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 44660795, "title": "Gez\u00e4hmte Schizophrenie.

Nihility is explored as a form of ontological homelessness, an experience which affects humanity in response to modernity.

Andrew Kincaid connects Joyce to contemporary Irish noir by stating that novels in this genre harken back to Joyce\u2019s Dubliners because they too deal with one of Joyce\u2019s central theme: \u2018the tension between a parochial Irish urbanism and the desire for a metropolitan culture that has its roots elsewhere.\u20191 Though this tension is still very much present in Dublin today, it is no longer present in terms of this desire. Rather, the tension comes from the actual mixing of the local (native Irish culture) and the global (multicultural immigrant culture) in the city itself through the inward migration produced by the brief economic boom of the Celtic Tiger. This new \u2018glocal\u2019 reality that adapts the local to these global influences is documented in the works of Roddy Doyle, particularly his contributions to immigrant magazine Metro \u00c8ireann chronicling glocal encounters and resulting hybridisations, which he also published as the short story collection The Deportees in 2007. It is a testament to Joyce\u2019s grip on the Irish psyche and literary scene that in spite of the new visions of Dublin offered by Doyle and others, the disconnect between what was \u2018old\u2019 Dublin and what is \u2018new\u2019 Dublin persists.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66086080, "asset_id": 45602067, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

The resulting breadth of research is impressive and includes such topics as gender and migration, migration and development, refugees and transnationalism. However, this work still suffers from the limitations imposed by existing migration theories that privilege the host context over the sending context focusing on linear processes and bounded conceptual frameworks. Through field work with Ugandan migrants and their descendants in Britain, this paper challenges existing theoretical limitations by proposing an inter-disciplinary approach that draws on transnationalism, diaspora and cultural geographical perspectives on landscape. Through this lens the concept of diasporic landscape emerges as an innovative contribution to migration theory as it highlights the embeddedness of migrants\u2019 lives, within processes of production and reproduction of a discursive terrain that straddles Uganda and Britain. It captures the multi-faceted physical and symbolic impacts of migrants\u2019 lived realities and privileges the continued impact of the sending context, cultural and temporal dimensions. The contours that emerge through migrants\u2019 everyday practices of \u2018belonging\u2019 highlight asymmetric power relations. These shift in complex patterns disrupting such bounded notions as migration, immobility, the migrant, non-migrant, refugee, citizen or undocumented person.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

I show how gentrification leads to spatial clustering by creating exclusionary practices and eroding social cohesion, and illuminate divisions that are inscribed into the physical\r\nspace of the neighbourhood.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53890436, "asset_id": 8732491, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7373, "first_name": "Ebru", "last_name": "Soytemel", "domain_name": "aston", "page_name": "Ebru_Soytemel", "display_name": "Ebru  Soytemel", "profile_url": "https://aston.academia.edu/Ebru_Soytemel?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7373/2789/2778/s65_ebru.soytemel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3055, "name": "Mixed Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mixed_Methods?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7455, "name": "Gentrification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrification?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10966, "name": "Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turkey?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13340, "name": "Pierre Bourdieu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pierre_Bourdieu?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19675, "name": "Modern Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Turkey?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 26879, "name": "Social Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Class?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 121480, "name": "McA", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/McA?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 144221, "name": "Istanbul", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Istanbul?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 546181, "name": "Multiple Correspondence Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiple_Correspondence_Analysis?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 705957, "name": "Gentrificaci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gentrificaci%C3%B3n?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 983167, "name": "Urban Sociology: Gentrifiurban Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology_Gentrifiurban_Development?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 82287217, "title": "Modern Monarchic Visibility in Eurasian Empires.", "created_at": "2022-06-28T01:52:35.069-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82287217/Modern_Monarchic_Visibility_in_Eurasian_Empires?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_82287217", "summary": "The purpose of this chapter is to introduce a new conceptual framework to facilitate the analysis of central power embodied by the ruler/dynasty and the changing patterns of its public staging in the nineteenth century.

Things have only gotten more complex in the 21st century where the bipolar world of the Cold War and \u201cthe end of history\u201d has given way to a multicentric, polyglot cacaphony where culture has replaced class as the dominant signifier and language has become the major expressive vehicle of that shift. In the European Union alone, there are 23 official languages, the UN has 6 official languages, and battles over language as the emblem of culture are evident among peoples affirming their identity everywhere - from Quebec to Catalonia, Rwanda to East Timor.\u201d\n\nWhither belonging in all this? The symposium presents belonging as a critical issue for sociocultural psychiatry and for global mental health. The notion of belonging sutures together the social questions of identity and affiliation to psychoanalytic questions of memory and representation to build a crucial construct for social psychiatry and psychotherapy in the 21st century.\n\nIleana Botezat-Antonescu\u2019s presentation, \u201cBelonging to the group of psychotherapy professionals: Between interdiction and proliferation in different political contexts in Romania,\u201d demonstrates that \u201cBelonging to a\nprofessional group just as psychotherapists do from other part of the world (Western Europe or the Americas), was a cherished dream for many Romanian psychiatrists or clinical psychologists before December 1989. We try to follow the developmental process of psychotherapy from the belonging concept perspective toward the cultural and political\ncontext in a communist\u2013totalitarian and a democratic society and examine its evolution.\u201d\n\nDrozdstoj Stoyanov\u2019s contribution is an empirical study of \u201cBelonging dimensions in psychological climate and personality as predictors of vulnerability to burn-out.\u201d His discussion highlights that, \u201cThe evidence from our pilot study as well as complementary case studies reveal the relevance of belonging as embedded in personality and psychological climate to the emergence of burn out. The following inter-connected study dimensions may elicit belonging: cooperativeness and self-transcendence in personality; cohesion and fairness in the psychological climate\nat work place and depersonalization as measurement of burn out.\u201d\n\nBibliography:\n\n1.

Moving away from the nation, considered as a site of discrimination and exclusion, geographers and social scientist more broadly have focused on alternative socio-spatial formations. Over the last two decades or so, the local place, particularly the city or the neighbourhood within the city, has attracted considerable attention. Imbued with transnational and cosmopolitan traits, these local places have been narrated as progressive and empowering in contrast to a nation perceived as to embodying opposite dimensions. The present study critically interrogates this local/national divide. Drawing on narratives of Italians with foreign background talking and writing about their individual experiences of living and growing up in Italy, the article offers empirical evidence which challenges the local/national divide in two ways. First, participants blurred the distinction between these two scales, as identification and attachment to local places were narrated by also mobilizing national markers. Second, the sense of local rootedness of the participants was not cast against the nation, but it was strategically deployed to claim a place in the nation. These findings invite scholars to explore the different ways in which the nation intervenes in shaping life in diversity, beyond the dominant narrative of the local/national divide.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55283832, "asset_id": 35422957, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434146, "first_name": "Marco", "last_name": "Antonsich", "domain_name": "lboro", "page_name": "MarcoAntonsich", "display_name": "Marco Antonsich", "profile_url": "https://lboro.academia.edu/MarcoAntonsich?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434146/784287/974778/s65_marco.antonsich.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11001, "name": "Second generation identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_generation_identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 45213, "name": "Italy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italy?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 90837, "name": "Second Generation Immigrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Generation_Immigrants?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 28898749, "title": "Reflections on the use of spatial and relational metaphors in youth studies", "created_at": "2016-10-03T20:59:14.221-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28898749/Reflections_on_the_use_of_spatial_and_relational_metaphors_in_youth_studies?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_28898749", "summary": "This article makes a contribution to ongoing debate with youth studies about the frameworks and concepts that inform research and practice.  It offers an analysis of the spatial metaphor of transition and the emerging relational metaphor of belonging. Noting that metaphor is an essential tool of theory, and that all theories illuminate particular elements of life and obscure others, it argues that there are elements of the transitions metaphor that have become entrenched as orthodoxies. These include the focus on youth-as-transition, the entrenchment of particular markers of progress and the tendency to see youth as a category (NEET for example). While the goal is not to replace one orthodoxy with another, new insights into the production of inequalities and the creation of enabling processes can be forged through consideration of what is opened up when a metaphor of belonging informs theorising and analysis.  Belonging brings the idea of youth as a social process back into the centre of analysis, enabling researchers to recognise the significance of relationships to people, place and to the times. Drawing on analyses of young people\u2019s lives from an Australian longitudinal study, it illustrates the ways in which transitions and belonging approaches open up different insights.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49333055, "asset_id": 28898749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 374207, "first_name": "Hernan", "last_name": "Cuervo", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "HernanCuervo", "display_name": "Hernan Cuervo", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/HernanCuervo?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/374207/14359177/15286310/s65_hernan.cuervo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69256, "name": "Generations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generations?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 178554, "name": "Youth Transitions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Transitions?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 365521, "name": "Rural Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Youth?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 79788082, "title": "(Lived) Spaces of Belonging, Culture, and Gender: Spatial Practices of Home for Syrian Women in Istanbul", "created_at": "2022-05-23T21:52:07.926-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79788082/_Lived_Spaces_of_Belonging_Culture_and_Gender_Spatial_Practices_of_Home_for_Syrian_Women_in_Istanbul?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_79788082", "summary": "Combining architectural and cultural anthropological approaches, this study explores the domestic lived spaces of Syrian women in Istanbul to understand how they create belonging in a new social and architectural setting and perform gender roles.

This successful movement became known worldwide through the Black Protests and the massive Polish Women's Strike that took place in October 2016. While this new movement is impressive in its scope and can be described as one of the most successful opposition movements to the ethno-nationalist right wing and fundamentalist Catholicism, it also deploys a patriotic rhetoric and makes use of national symbols and categories of belonging. Feminism and nationalism in Poland are usually described as in opposition, although that relationship is much more complex and changing. Over decades, a general shift towards right-wing nationalism in Poland has occurred, which, in various ways, has also affected feminist actors and (counter)discourses. It seems that patriotism is used to combat nationalism, which has proved to be a successful strategy. Taking the example of feminist mobilizations and movements in Poland, this paper discusses the (im)possible link between patriotism, nationalism and feminism in order to ask what it means for feminist politics and female solidarity when belonging is framed in different ways. A surprising response to extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in Poland appeared in the mass mobilization against a legislative initiative introducing a total ban on abortion in 2016, which culminated in a massive Women's Strike in October the same year. While the popular resistance was definitely a huge success and had a significant impact on the revitalization of political practices from below, it also made a discursive shift visible. When looking at the public discourse of contemporary initiatives and campaigns, it is striking that it is mainly \"Polish women\" who are addressed by the movement and not for example \"citizens\" or \"inhabitants\" of the country. It seems that patriotism is being used to combat nationalism and this has proven a successful strategy. This shift marks a clear difference from the language and discursive strategies of feminist movements in the 1990s and 2000s, which referred mainly to a transnational imaginary, along with the human rights discourse of the UN, the \"West\" and the European Union. Over decades, a general shift towards right-wing nationalism has been occurring in Poland, which, in various ways, has also affected feminist actors and counter-discourses. Those in turn have increasingly started to focus on problems of national belonging and national imaginaries, whereas today's feminist mobilizations have taken this even a step further. The public discourse accompanying these mobilizations could already be described as an expression of popular feminist patriotism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60943742, "asset_id": 40659961, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3385207, "first_name": "Jennifer", "last_name": "Ramme", "domain_name": "europa-uni-de", "page_name": "JenniferRamme", "display_name": "Jennifer Ramme", "profile_url": "https://europa-uni-de.academia.edu/JenniferRamme?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3385207/45619703/42946886/s65_jennifer.ramme.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 134143, "name": "Politics of Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Memory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 199924, "name": "Extreme and Far Right", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Extreme_and_Far_Right?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 768477, "name": "Politics of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 40608167, "title": "No Laughing Matter: Bani Abidi at Berlin's Gropius Bau", "created_at": "2019-10-13T08:31:04.703-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40608167/No_Laughing_Matter_Bani_Abidi_at_Berlins_Gropius_Bau?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_40608167", "summary": "Place is a concern in Abidi\u2019s time-based practice, yet her work is not about a place.

M. (2019). Using auto-photography to explore young people's belonging and exclusion in urban spaces in Accra, Ghana. Open House International, 44(1), 62-70. \r\n_______________________\r\nThis paper examines young people\u2019s \u2018lived\u2019 experience of urban spaces in Accra, the capital of Ghana, by focusing on the use of auto-photography as an appropriate method for this investigation. Accra has a very young population and low rates of employment among the young people, demographics that are often associated with societal instability and increased risk of civil conflict. Research into African youth and the urban spaces they occupy is scarce and involves real challenges, but it is necessary and urgent due to various issues of exclusion and identity. This paper reports part of a larger phenomenological study on the spatial exclusion of youth in Accra\u2019s urban spaces. The theoretical framework builds on Lefebvrian dialectics of space and focuses on how notions of belonging and exclusion are reflected in the mode of \u2018lived space\u2019. The fieldwork was completed on a small sample of young people in two distinct neighborhoods of Accra. In essence, the focus of the paper is on the urban spaces occupied by young people and on the utility of the participatory research tool adopted, auto-photography. In this context, the tool is less intrusive than direct observation and therefore well equipped to allow an \u2018insider\u2019 view into personal experiences and perceptions of place that are otherwise difficult to access and study. The paper concludes with a call for urban professionals and decision makers to produce inclusive urban environments that cater for all while for differences and belonging to co-exist.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58820916, "asset_id": 38734695, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10393996, "first_name": "Kristijn", "last_name": "van Riel", "domain_name": "radboud", "page_name": "KristijnvanRiel", "display_name": "Kristijn van Riel", "profile_url": "https://radboud.academia.edu/KristijnvanRiel?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10393996/3165011/8832598/s65_kristijn.van_riel.jpg"}, {"id": 27312, "first_name": "Ashraf M.", "last_name": "Salama", "domain_name": "strath", "page_name": "AshrafMSalama", "display_name": "Ashraf M.

People fleeing conflict are trying to find a safe space in which they can make a home,  those migrating are trying to make themselves at home in strange environments, those seeking out gay bars and nightclubs are seeking places to socialise in which they feel at home. Those transitioning across genders or maintaining gendered fluidity are seeking bodily appearances which signal possibilities of social interaction in which they, too, can feel at home.  In each of these examples home is imagined as a positive good, something central to people\u2019s wellbeing.  But the imaginary of home can also be problematic. This chapter explores both the necessity and the dangers of the imaginary of home, and people\u2019s assumptions that they are entitled to all aspects of it.  The dangers rest on a backwards-looking nostalgia for mythical communities. This informed support for both Brexit in the UK, Trump in the US and many right wing parties in Europe and beyond. It engenders hostility to difference.

Analysing the ends to which genealogy is put, it finds that genealogy is a key kinship practice, mapping connectedness, offering a resource for identity-work, and allowing belonging in time. Engaging with anthropological work on kinship, relatedness and remembrance and with recent sociological work on identity and affinity, this article explores how family history as a creative and imaginative memory and kinship practice is simultaneously used to map affinities and connectedness, enact relatedness, and produce self-identity. It argues that examining the role of genealogy and the genealogical imaginary reveals that conventional as well as non-conventional kinship produces partial and insecure identities.

I stress the role of identification rather than identity, relationality, processuality and performativity in understanding the relations between nationhood and homosexuality. Homosexual subjects attaining the rituals of national bereavement break the chains of interlinked subject positions and social expectations. In doing so, nationhood is rendered a \u201chybrid\u201d space of identification for the homosexual subject. Consequently, mourning becomes an act of \u201cqueering\u201d the nation, a wilful subversion of culturally and traditionally sanctioned performative recollections of nationhood (Polishness).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37938320, "asset_id": 9824189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7982, "first_name": "Roberto", "last_name": "Kulpa", "domain_name": "napier", "page_name": "RobertoKulpa", "display_name": "Roberto Kulpa", "profile_url": "https://napier.academia.edu/RobertoKulpa?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7982/2872/105912061/s65_roberto.kulpa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8104, "name": "Mourning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mourning?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10802, "name": "Subversion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subversion?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76967, "name": "Homonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homonationalism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 159218, "name": "Death, Grief, and Mourning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_Grief_and_Mourning?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 234644, "name": "Mourning and melancholia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mourning_and_melancholia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 640768, "name": "Melancholic Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melancholic_Nationalism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 640769, "name": "Melancholic Sexual Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melancholic_Sexual_Politics?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 832210, "name": "LGBT In Central and Eastern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_In_Central_and_Eastern_Europe?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1723408, "name": "Queer Melancholia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Melancholia?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 1762260, "title": "Latino immigrants and the renegotiation of place and belonging in small town America", "created_at": "2012-07-03T09:57:55.241-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1762260/Latino_immigrants_and_the_renegotiation_of_place_and_belonging_in_small_town_America?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_1762260", "summary": "This article compares the politics of place and belonging within two non-metropolitan\ncommunities\u2014Woodburn, Oregon, and Leadville, Colorado\u2014that have witnessed a\nsignificant increase in Latino immigration during the last fifteen to twenty years.

ISSN # 0160-2601.\n______________________________________________________________\nA multitude of diverse attributes is required for effective urban performance at various scales ranging from the immediate context of public buildings to central urban spaces, and from urban corridors to residential neighbourhoods. Following their earlier works (GRIERSON, 2014; MUNRO and GRIERSON, 2016; SALAMA, 2011; SALAMA and WIEDMANN, 2013; and SALAMA et al., 2016) the guest editors frame these qualities under a cycle of three main symbiotic pillars: the imagined, the measured, and the experienced, which contribute to the development of insights that elucidate various parameters for exploring urban performance. These three pillars stem from the Lefebvrian arguments and his theory on the production of space, which postulates a triadic relationship of three different but related types of spaces: the conceived (Imagined), the perceived (measured) and the lived (experienced).\n\nPrimarily, Lefebvre de\ufb01ned \u2018conceived space\u2019 as the space which is theorised by scientists and planners, known as \u2018representations of space\u2019, representations that are intangible and are entrenched in the principles, imperatives, beliefs and visions of experts, decision makers, and those who are in a position to impose their personal notion of \u2018order\u2019 onto concrete reality. The second is \u2018perceived space\u2019, the space of \u2018spatial practice\u2019 de\ufb01ned as the space where movement and interaction takes place, where networks develop and materialise. Consequently, it includes both daily routines at an individual level and urban realities such as the networks that link places designated for work, leisure and \u2018private\u2019 life (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 38). The third is \u2018lived space\u2019, which is explained as the unconscious, non-verbal direct relation between people and space. This is the space that is occupied through associated images and symbols (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 39). The current body of knowledge on Lefebvre\u2019s work suggests that the \u2018conceived space\u2019 is abstract and tactical and where authority functions, the \u2018perceived space\u2019 is a pragmatic, physical space encompassing flows of investment, workforce, and information and that this where the conceived and lived spaces are construed. Salama and Wiedmann (2013) suggest that the \u2018lived space\u2019 is the most subjective space, involving the actual experience of individuals that is performed in the \u2018perceived space\u2019 and as a result of the \u2018conceived space\u2019.\n\nIn our call for papers, the premise was that contributions to this issue of Open House International (OHI) would address the way in which decision-making processes, led by policy makers and discipline experts, contribute to successful urban environments; how the social and spatial practices of key actors (investors, developers, and users) manifest diverse urban activities; and how users attach to places and identify with their surroundings as a basis for social and spatial justice. Contributions were expected to address one of the three pillars while offering implications on the other two.  In response we have received more than 40 abstracts, and subsequently identified 19 for further development into full papers towards submission for review. The outcome of a rigorous review process concluded with the identification of 11 papers published in this issue.  Addressing various contexts in Europe and the Middle East, the papers represent diverse efforts undertaken by committed scholars in universities and academic institutions in Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Qatar, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n___________________________________________________\nPlease see more in the attached editorial document", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58808242, "asset_id": 38723235, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27312, "first_name": "Ashraf M.", "last_name": "Salama", "domain_name": "strath", "page_name": "AshrafMSalama", "display_name": "Ashraf M.

Based on face-to-face, in-depth, semi-structured interviews (N=45), this question is probed through the eyes of first and second generation immigrants in southwest Germany. Perceptions of social and affective integration, group identifications and possibilities of de-differentiating native-immigrant distinctions are studied in detail. While a few respondents mention instances of personal discrimination and most are at ease with their life in Germany, even fewer see themselves as German without further qualification. Even though there are hints of a partial disintegration of the fault lines between immigrants' self and what they perceive as \" German \" , their answers provide little indication of an emergence of a new inclusive narrative of Germaneness.

migration phenomenon as a current issue both Turkey and the World. No doubt that, every act of migration has a \u2018challenge\u2019 in itself. The most important of these challenges is the acquiring of livable place that evolves due to the need for shelter that is one of the most essential needs of humankind. On that point, the task of the people, who specialized in the disciplines of design and architecture, is to draw this contemporary issue through the spatial aspects of migration. Today, the spatial distribution of migration in Turkey is divided into two groups as accommodation centers and cities in general. In the case of emergency, well-intentioned accommodation centers were built as temporal response to this problem to find an immediate solution. It is aimed that meeting the basic human needs in the proper way, but these spaces couldn\u2019t give the feeling of being at home. Instead of staying in the accommodation centers, due to the various difficulties and dissatisfactions experienced in these areas, the process of acquiring a place by migrating to various cities results with establishing a \u2018home\u2019. In the process of searching for livable place and re-establishing of the home, individuals past experiences and the role of the new place in memories becomes essential. Therefore, this article focuses on this issue within the scope of the theoretical framework based on \u2018acquiring a livable space\u2019, \u2018developing sense of belonging\u2019 and \u2018establishing a cultural attachment\u2019. This framework will be used for understanding the re-establishment of \u2018home making\u2019 process of Syrians living in Sultanbeyli, I\u0307stanbul, Turkey within the content of the field study conducted in 2016.\nKeywords: Migration, livable place, sense of belonging, cultural attachment, home.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69206706, "asset_id": 51512617, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57003938, "first_name": "Talia", "last_name": "\u00d6zcan Aktan", "domain_name": "nku-tr", "page_name": "talia\u00f6zcanaktan", "display_name": "Talia \u00d6zcan Aktan", "profile_url": "https://nku-tr.academia.edu/talia%C3%B6zcanaktan?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57003938/63702941/52013054/s65_talia._zcan_aktan.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13246, "name": "Interior Design (Architecture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Design_Architecture_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 190143, "name": "Home-Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home-Making?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1009494, "name": "Livable Environment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Livable_Environment?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 42913882, "title": "Investigation of the Relationship Between the Concept of Belonging and Sustainable Urban Conservation Process: The Case of Izmir - Sigacik Inter Castle Settlement", "created_at": "2020-05-01T11:25:59.595-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42913882/Investigation_of_the_Relationship_Between_the_Concept_of_Belonging_and_Sustainable_Urban_Conservation_Process_The_Case_of_Izmir_Sigacik_Inter_Castle_Settlement?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_42913882", "summary": "People's lives and daily behavior patterns; comes to life in the social and physical environment to which they belong. The individual interacts with the space as a 'subject' in the first order and creates the process of transforming it into 'place'. The bond / emotion that the individual establishes with the space provides the richness and interaction of his daily and social life. Space-subject relationship is also closely related to the individual's sense of belonging. Being a part of a place can be considered as an important parameter of space choice for the user. In this context, the protection and sustainability of the places are successful in direct proportion with the sense of belonging to the user. Considering the traditional urban areas reevaluated by conservation studies today, the continuity of the use of individuals living and working in these areas is of great importance in the context of the sustainability of these areas. The users' feelings of these areas ensure that the physical interventions are positive in the context of conservation and sustainability. Conservation of regions where traditional texture is present in growing cities; While maintaining the existence of urban spaces, on the other hand, it maintains the continuity of the social and spatial life with which the individual is associated with the bond. In this context, accepting the sense of individual and social belonging as one of the basic planning parameters in the urban conservation process; is an important issue for both social and spatial sustainability. The aim of the study is to examine the traces of the concept of belonging through the conservation and sustainability of traditional settlements in urban areas and open them for discussion. In this context, the urban protection, sustainability and belonging phenomena are examined, and \u0130zmir-S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k castle area, which is selected as an example area and where these phenomena stand out, is discussed. S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Castle settlement, which allows the results of the sense of belonging with its permanent users and touristic aspects to be evaluated from different perspectives, is a very rich example in the context of the relationship between belonging-urban conservation and sustainability. As a working method, the related literature has been examined and on-site observations are detailed. From this point of view, the study is thought to be useful in emphasizing the relationship between urban conservation and sustainability not only with concrete-physical concepts but also with abstractness, which is an abstract concept.\nKeywords:  Urban Conservation, Sustainability, Belonging, S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Inter Castle Settlement\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63163991, "asset_id": 42913882, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 156436435, "first_name": "Nihal Arda", "last_name": "Aky\u0131ld\u0131z", "domain_name": "balikesir", "page_name": "NihalArdaAky\u0131ld\u0131z", "display_name": "Nihal Arda Aky\u0131ld\u0131z", "profile_url": "https://balikesir.academia.edu/NihalArdaAky%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/156436435/43737220/39437548/s65_nihal_arda.aky_ld_z.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 19702, "name": "Urban Conservation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Conservation?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 183004, "name": "S\u00fcrd\u00fcr\u00fclebilirlik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/S%C3%BCrd%C3%BCr%C3%BClebilirlik?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 286990, "name": "Kentsel s\u00fcrd\u00fcr\u00fclebilirlik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kentsel_surdurulebilirlik?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 396608, "name": "Kentsel Koruma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kentsel_Koruma?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1208617, "name": "Sustainability", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sustainability?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2613143, "name": "Aidiyet Duygusu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aidiyet_Duygusu?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2864942, "name": "Mek\u00e2nsal Aidiyet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mek%C3%A2nsal_Aidiyet?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3640964, "name": "S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Inter Castle Settlement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/S%C4%B1%C4%9Fac%C4%B1k_Inter_Castle_Settlement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 4066044, "name": "S\u0131\u011fac\u0131k Yerle\u015fim Alan\u0131", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/S%C4%B1%C4%9Fac%C4%B1k_Yerle%C5%9Fim_Alan%C4%B1?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 697224, "title": "Latino Migrants in the Jewish State: Undocumented Lifes in Israel (full book)", "created_at": "2011-06-26T19:01:37.197-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/697224/Latino_Migrants_in_the_Jewish_State_Undocumented_Lifes_in_Israel_full_book_?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_697224", "summary": "In the 1990s, thousands of non-Jewish Latinos arrived in Israel as undocumented immigrants.

While waria form a visible social category, they suffer from various prevailing stigmas, of which a significant share is tied to some cultural assumptions embedded in the mainstream understanding of Islamic morality. While most waria do not feel comfortable practising their religion in public, many describe their subjectivity along the distinction between their bodies and their inner sense of gender as God\u2019s will. Consequently, permanent bodily modifications are associated with the notion of sin. These conceptions have enabled a specific form of Indonesian transgender embodiment. This article addresses the bodily negotiations of waria against the background of their religious sensitivities and aspirations for belonging. The spiritually grounded sentiments in relation to their bodies and the sense of gender on one hand, and the signs of increased focus on embodied expression of religiosity among waria on the other, signal the desire for reimagining belonging to Indonesian (Muslim) society. Religious sensitivity, while being the major cause of anxieties on both personal and societal levels, has provided waria with important frameworks which enhance their own relative acceptance of their embodied subjectivity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81929265, "asset_id": 73389682, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8965071, "first_name": "terje", "last_name": "toomistu", "domain_name": "ut-ee", "page_name": "TerjeCece", "display_name": "terje toomistu", "profile_url": "https://ut-ee.academia.edu/TerjeCece?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8965071/2928209/30882206/s65_terje.toomistu.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 4920, "name": "Anthropology of Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Gender?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 11155, "name": "Women and Gender Issues in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Issues_in_Islam?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 12093, "name": "Theories of Gender and Transgender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Gender_and_Transgender?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 12693, "name": "Body Image", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Body_Image?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 84377, "name": "Body Modification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Body_Modification?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 90384, "name": "Feminist Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Anthropology?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1301756, "name": "Waria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Waria?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 72063033, "title": "Who \u201cBelongs\u201d?

The concept of identity has for some decades become\ncentral ever since the rise of identity politics, a form of politics that\npeople are poised to mobilize themselves towards when they identify\nwith a religion or a nationality or a caste or race \u2013 as a Muslim, as it\nmight be, or a Quebecois, or a Dalit, or African-American\u2026\n\nAnother line of discussion has to do with interpreting belonging in\nterms of feelings of solidarity or fraternity with others in the wider\ngroup.\n\nA third has to do with the condition when belonging goes missing or\nis thwarted and dif\u00d6cult; often such a condition is discussed under\nthe label \u2018alienation\u2019 and belonging, therefore, is equated with the\nunalienated life.\n\nThe first of these \u2013 belonging as identity \u2013 is a more or less\ndescriptive issue, whereas the second and third \u2013 belonging as\nentailing supportive emotions of compassion and solidarity, and\nbelonging as the unalienated life \u2013 tend to be seen in normative\nterms, as ideals or values that we should aspire to.\n\nThere is a vast amount of literature on each of these ways of thinking\nabout belonging but there will be no effort to summarize it here.\nInstead, the chapter will begin with an analytical elaboration of the\ntheoretical issues at stake in these three aspects of belonging and\nthen proceed with an extensive empirical report on how these\nquestions of belonging have surfaced in different parts of the world.\nThough there is no effort to be globally comprehensive in this\nempirical reach, it will nevertheless brie\u00d7y cover areas as far \u00d7ung as\nEurope, North America, Latin America, the Middle East, and South\nAsia.

I argue that, within the partial involution of social bonds that market economy creates, two aspects of local cultural intimacy get progressively divorced:\u00a0familiality (the basis of collective identification) is denied, whereas familiarity (recognition of shared avoidance of state rules) is intensified.\u00a0The key to this process is a massive shift to idioms of nuclear family, that underline not the sameness but equivalence of self-interests as the ultimate explanation of social life. Here, people are recognized as responsible for their families and engaged in interest-driven activities of all kinds to fulfil that responsibility. Establishing a homology between politicians and \u2018ordinary people\u2019, familiarisation of interest creates a space of coexistence and mutuality between the citizens and the bureaucrats, and a critical resource for making politics close and \u2018sincere\u2019 again. But, at the same time, it marks all claims of common identity to seem as false and exploitative. Everyone works for themselves and their own families, my interlocutors claimed, and this is what makes our interests comparable. But precisely because of that, they can never share the same interests. Harking back to Thatcher\u2019s infamous saying that there is \u2018no thing such as society: only individual men, women, and families\u2019 - I suggest that familiarity is a relational modality in which resemblance\u00a0is recognized, whereas identity is denied, instituting new forms of bonds that go beyond the collectivist ethos of nation states.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57150237, "asset_id": 35226664, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 278797, "first_name": "Ivan", "last_name": "Rajkovi\u0107", "domain_name": "univie", "page_name": "IvanRajkovi\u0107", "display_name": "Ivan Rajkovi\u0107", "profile_url": "https://univie.academia.edu/IvanRajkovi%C4%87?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/278797/57341/97768370/s65_ivan.rajkovi_.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3472, "name": "Political Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5903, "name": "Postsocialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postsocialism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15875, "name": "Anthropology of Kinship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Kinship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 44835, "name": "Serbian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Serbian_Politics?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 55540, "name": "Post-yugoslav politics, Post-socialism and EU integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-yugoslav_politics_Post-socialism_and_EU_integration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 73699, "name": "Corruption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corruption?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 78630, "name": "Serbia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Serbia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 84290, "name": "Familiarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Familiarity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 95215, "name": "Cultural Intimacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Intimacy?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 364874, "name": "Kragujevac", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kragujevac?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 564401, "name": "Morals and Markets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Morals_and_Markets?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 576621, "name": "Self Interest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Interest?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1379515, "name": "Anthropology of Kinship and the Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Kinship_and_the_Family?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 34411984, "title": "That's Not Funny: Pages on How the Demon Clown of Gotham City Learned (Not) to Love and What that has to do with Anything, Like Maybe the American Zeitgeist", "created_at": "2017-08-30T09:40:59.578-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34411984/Thats_Not_Funny_Pages_on_How_the_Demon_Clown_of_Gotham_City_Learned_Not_to_Love_and_What_that_has_to_do_with_Anything_Like_Maybe_the_American_Zeitgeist?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_34411984", "summary": "In September of 2011, DC Comics revamped the fictional universe that the characters of their comic books inhabit by launching 52 new book titles in an effort to \u201creboot\u201d their franchises.

The second part focuses on the hierarchies of belonging that operate within a given national setting. Of particular interest is the largely taken-for-granted status of the dominant majority and the degree to which it underpins claims to belonging and entitlement that are used to secure key material and psychological benefits.

Human capital were to become as mobile as financial, human individuals as free to roam the globe as the goods and services they produced and consumed. The perks of the global village would inexorably reduce the significance of place-bound communities. As globalization began to reap financial turmoil, political disaffection, economic injustice and social dislocation, triumph turned uncertainty and the demarcation lines of identity and belonging, new and old, inherited and invented, terrestrial and virtual, open and closed, soon criss-crossed the European landscape. Add to this the immediate dislocating effects of rapid and large-scale migration, and it is not hard to see why the spectre of homelessness might again come to haunt European societies. And this time around, people will not necessarily have to leave home to sense the ground shaking under their feet.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61780661, "asset_id": 41624270, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3282462, "first_name": "G\u00f6ran", "last_name": "Rosenberg", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "G\u00f6ranRosenberg", "display_name": "G\u00f6ran Rosenberg", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/G%C3%B6ranRosenberg?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3282462/1089206/5575001/s65_g_ran.rosenberg.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4421, "name": "Homelessness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homelessness?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27442, "name": "Hannah Arendt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hannah_Arendt?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43798, "name": "Statelessness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Statelessness?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56163, "name": "Otherness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Otherness?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 480721, "name": "Jean Am\u00e9ry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jean_Am%C3%A9ry?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 38139082, "title": "Stephanov.

As of today, homosexuality is still illegal. Activists are continuing the fight for legal recognition, yet it is an uphill battle due to widespread societal homophobia. Queerness remains a taboo for many people, and an unspeakable subject for many families. Despite the social stigma, 17 years prior to the 2013 ruling Deepa Mehta produced a film called Fire (1996) about a love story between two queer Indian women (Radha and Sita) and their process of relinquishing their family for their relationship. Upon its release in India, the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party boycotted the film, saying homosexuality\nhad no place in the country, and was a Western invention. Despite the political backlash, the film interrogates queer Indian women\u2019s ability to challenge compul- sory heterosexuality in Indian society, and by extension, explore queer people\u2019s place within the postcolonial Indian national imaginary. This paper argues that the film\u2019s depiction of Radha and Sita\u2019s relationship works to delegitimize the traditional heteronormative ways the Indian postcolonial nation came to repre- sent Indian women in society and thereby come to understand itself. In doing so, Mehta\u2019s work illuminates how Indian queer people\u2019s naming processes transcend linguistic borders.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57655426, "asset_id": 37667034, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96080253, "first_name": "Rishi", "last_name": "Gun\u00e9", "domain_name": "princeton", "page_name": "RishiGun\u00e9", "display_name": "Rishi Gun\u00e9", "profile_url": "https://princeton.academia.edu/RishiGun%C3%A9?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/96080253/21562005/20918026/s65_rishi.gun_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 699, "name": "Queer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 16323, "name": "Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolitics?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 109527, "name": "The nation-state and modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_nation-state_and_modernity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 273414, "name": "Media representation of women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_representation_of_women?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 755982, "name": "Transnational Film/media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Film_media?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 11664902, "title": "Belonging in Education: Lessons from the Belonging Project", "created_at": "2015-03-26T01:09:08.124-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11664902/Belonging_in_Education_Lessons_from_the_Belonging_Project?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_11664902", "summary": "This paper presents some preliminary findings from The Belonging Project \u2013 a longitudinal learning and teaching research project seeking to develop and define a new approach to student engagement.

The hierarchy places value on immigrants in Finland based on their ethnicity, socio-economic status, and various other interlinking factors, dividing them into differently valued categories. Against this framework, the relevance of such a hierarchy to the everyday lives of highly-skilled migrants in Finland is explored, using data from ethnographic fieldwork and interviews. The data are used to describe these migrants\u2019 experiences of being categorized and perceived as particular types of immigrants, and the relevance of these experiences to their social life and their self-defined group identities. The data show, firstly, that highly-skilled migrants in Finland are aware of the migrant hierarchy, and that it has an impact on their lives. Secondly, although they object to its homogenizing and hierarchizing aspects, the categorizations of the hierarchy are still internalized to a certain extent, affecting identity constructions. Exploring these issues reveals boundaries that imply underlying problems in regards to the social integration and feelings of belonging by highly-skilled migrants in Finland.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44291012, "asset_id": 5938079, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 682782, "first_name": "Kaisu", "last_name": "Koskela", "domain_name": "radboud", "page_name": "KaisuKoskela", "display_name": "Kaisu Koskela", "profile_url": "https://radboud.academia.edu/KaisuKoskela?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/682782/236764/27816639/s65_kaisu.koskela.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5909, "name": "Social Categorization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Categorization?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 75964, "name": "Boundaries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Boundaries?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 153341, "name": "Lived Experiences of Skilled Migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lived_Experiences_of_Skilled_Migrants?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 343273, "name": "Ethnicity and Social Hierarchies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Social_Hierarchies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 977774, "name": "Highly Skilled Migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Highly_Skilled_Migrants?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 387871, "title": "Power and Powerlessness of Intellectuals in Turkey: The Debate on \u2018Turkishness\u2019 and the Murder of Hrant Dink", "created_at": "2010-12-11T00:04:16.853-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/387871/Power_and_Powerlessness_of_Intellectuals_in_Turkey_The_Debate_on_Turkishness_and_the_Murder_of_Hrant_Dink?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_387871", "summary": "Hrant Dink, Armenian, author and chief editor of the magazine Agos was murdered on 19 January 2007 in Istanbul.

The concept of \u2018belonging\u2019 is introduced as a combination of commonality, mutuality, and attachments. A vital opposition is made between the collective constellations of belonging and the individual navigations through multiple collective assemblages during the life course. It is argued that these navigations entail tackling manifold forms of boundary dynamics as collective belonging creates regimes that guard collectivities against the outsiders and also against the members\u2019 attempts to abandon \u2018their\u2019 collectivities. The analysis draws upon ethnicity research, immigration research and globalisation research, i.e. in fields where issues of belonging are as vital as they are challenged, and therefore, they are often politicized. Rather than taking a specific collective belonging for granted, e.g. ethnic, religious or national, this contribution addresses the situated nature of individual positionings, the possibility of combining different dimensions of belonging, and the necessity to belong together in contemporary societies.

The present article offers a brief genealogy of the native/alien divide and argues that central to this binary is a national thinking which divides the world into distinct (national) units, enclosed by (natural) borders, with a unique (native) population attached to these spatial units. The article illustrates this argument by looking at two interrelated processes: the nationalisation of nature, by which the national thinking intervenes as an organising principle in determining ecological inclusion/exclusion, and the naturalisation of the nation, through which the nation is given an ontological status. Taken together these two processes confirm the continuing salience of the nation as a bordering principle actively constituting both the social and natural world, also in times of anthropogenic changes and increasing people's mobility.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64909893, "asset_id": 44479307, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 434146, "first_name": "Marco", "last_name": "Antonsich", "domain_name": "lboro", "page_name": "MarcoAntonsich", "display_name": "Marco Antonsich", "profile_url": "https://lboro.academia.edu/MarcoAntonsich?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/434146/784287/974778/s65_marco.antonsich.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9846, "name": "Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 101548, "name": "Invasive Alien Species", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Invasive_Alien_Species?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 149474, "name": "Anthropocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropocene?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 41927291, "title": "L\u00e4hdesm\u00e4ki, Tuuli (2019): \"Politics of belonging in Brussels\u2019 European Quarter.\" International Journal of Heritage Studies.

The Dutch government calls these regions that are dealing with a declining population and availability of work shrinkage regions. Due to this, houses in these regions are fairly cheap making them interesting for especially highly educated people from urban areas that are in search for a more peaceful life outside  the tumult of the city. This thesis is about Paesens-Moddergat, a small village that is located in a shrinkage region. Paesens-Moddergat is originally a fishing village located right next to the Wadden Sea. Due to the changing local interests, as the region is relying more and more on tourism, and the influx of so called \u2018newcomers\u2019 to the town, it is dealing with friction between original inhabitants and newcomers. This thesis proposes that this friction is one of different human-environment relations and feelings of belonging the inhabitants have. Furthermore, thesis demonstrates that the village of Pae-sens-Moddergat has always been divided in several ways. In order to demonstrate this, this thesis is divided in three chapters. The first chapter is a contextual chapter showing how the history of the vil-lage is linked to the contemporary situation and social dynamics of the place. In the second chapter different feelings of belonging are covered. Here is demonstrated how these various feelings of be-longing the inhabitants have can lead to friction. The third chapter explorers the various attitudes towards outside organisations that the inhabitants have and how this is linked to the relation the in-habitants have with their environment.

Research on belonging in educational settings has been unsystematic and diluted by disparities in definition and terminology.

Child of God is Cormac McCarthy\u2019s celebrated book which has attracted a critical attention since its publication in 1973. The novel is about Lester Ballard\u2019s growing madness which frustrates any attempt at defining subjectivity within the boundaries of language and body. Relying on the Lacanian theory of the Real and the Derridean notion of cryptonomy, this paper explores the psychotic phenomenon in Child of God, a phenomenon that deconstructs the concept of belonging.  In this novel, McCarthy\u2019s main character is remarkable in the sense that he undermines the logocentric assumptions in the authority of the concept of belonging. Ballard embodies the failure to become a subject, leading to psychosis. Thus, this paper tackles two major aspects of the psychotic phenomenon. A first part deals with Ballard\u2019s psychotic discourse which is outside language, outside the Symbolic, belonging to the order of hallucinations and delusions. Ballard is someone who is inhabited, traumatized and invaded by language. His speech does not belong to him because it is the speech of all those voices incorporated within him. It is precisely this idea which lays the ground to the second part of this paper. Ballard\u2019s body corresponds to the Derridean crypt, a body which is totally foreign to him and, thus, it is understood in terms of the Lacanian Real. At the root of this paper is the objective of undermining the idea of the subject\u2019s linguistic and corporeal belonging long-held by the Western metaphysics by arguing that Ballard\u2019s subjectivity is ultimately spectral and consequently, it exceeds the dialectics of body and language.\n\nKeywords : Belonging - subjectivity - body - language - psychosis - the Real - the Symbolic - deconstruction \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40699834, "asset_id": 19563579, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12230261, "first_name": "IJHCS", "last_name": "IJHCS", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IJHCSIJHCS", "display_name": "IJHCS IJHCS", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IJHCSIJHCS?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12230261/3510458/4124356/s65_ijhcs.ijhcs.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4868, "name": "Deconstruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deconstruction?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54659, "name": "Subjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subjectivity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 16827808, "title": "Mapping the Concept(s) of Belonging.

Change is an unsettling, but inevitable, part of everyday life; continuity speaks of repetition over time, unity and the comfort of belonging. This paper examines how themes of nostalgia and authenticity are evoked in telling family histories in order to negotiate change and create a continuous story of belonging. Three family histories demonstrate how material objects, places and claims of family resemblances are used to create both authentic identities and authentic selves belonging to the wider community. Where there is a break in the family story and the \u2018world of restorable reach\u2019 is no longer available nostalgia creeps in to replace personal stories with communal ones. Through using both nostalgia, to inform a sense of loss and sometimes a shared past, and authenticity, to create a sense of continuity within an overall arc of change, this paper shows how family histories can work to maintain identities over time, retaining a sense of ontological security and belonging in place.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47037239, "asset_id": 12091172, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1660873, "first_name": "Julia", "last_name": "Bennett", "domain_name": "chester", "page_name": "JuliaBennett", "display_name": "Julia  Bennett", "profile_url": "https://chester.academia.edu/JuliaBennett?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1909, "name": "Family studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2852, "name": "Narrative", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5277, "name": "Sociology of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Identity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 8475, "name": "Narrative Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Methods?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 14831, "name": "Narrative and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_and_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 32159, "name": "Family history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_history?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 42042, "name": "Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 72039, "name": "The Social and Institutional Construction of Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Social_and_Institutional_Construction_of_Nostalgia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 182681, "name": "Nostalgia and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia_and_Memory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 387143, "name": "Nostalgia and home", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nostalgia_and_home?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 635128, "name": "Social Memory and Nostalgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Memory_and_Nostalgia?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 78361502, "title": "Strength-based parenting and stress-related growth in adolescents: Exploring the role of positive reappraisal, school belonging, and emotional processing during the pandemic", "created_at": "2022-05-03T13:35:13.532-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78361502/Strength_based_parenting_and_stress_related_growth_in_adolescents_Exploring_the_role_of_positive_reappraisal_school_belonging_and_emotional_processing_during_the_pandemic?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_78361502", "summary": "Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the way families live, interact, and connect with others, resulting in higher levels of stress for many teenagers who struggle with the ongoing uncertainty and disrupted school and family life. The current study examined the psychosocial factors that influence the capacity of adolescents to grow through the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The sample included 404 secondary school students ranging in age from 11 to 18 (M = 14.75, SD = 1.59; 50.2% female, 46.8% male, and 3% non-/other gendered or declined to answer) from an independent high school in Australia. Data were collected from a battery of questionnaires that assessed strength-based parenting (SBP) and the effect of three psychosocial factors (positive reappraisal, emotional processing, and school belonging) on stress-related growth. Results: Structural equation modeling showed that (SBP) was significantly associated with stress-related growth (SRG). Positive reappraisal and emotional processing were also positively and significantly associated with SRG and mediated the effect of SBP on SRG. Moreover, school belonging was positively linked to positive coping, emotional processing, and SRG, as well as mediating the association of SBP with positive reappraisal, emotional processing, and SRG in adolescents during the pandemic. Conclusions: The results show that teenagers can experience SRG during the COVID-19 pandemic, and adolescents adapting by engaging in constructive coping responses such as positive reappraisal and emotional processing is positively related to SRG.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85436381, "asset_id": 78361502, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1485621, "first_name": "Kelly-Ann", "last_name": "Allen", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "drkellyallen", "display_name": "Kelly-Ann Allen", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/drkellyallen?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1485621/529773/68494969/s65_kelly-ann.allen.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 113686, "name": "School Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 155683, "name": "Emotional processing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotional_processing?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 212591, "name": "Stress-Related Growth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Stress-Related_Growth?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556337, "name": "Strength-based Parenting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Strength-based_Parenting?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 54781795, "title": "The Aesthetics and Emotions of Religious Belonging: Examples from the Buddhist World", "created_at": "2021-10-02T02:41:01.118-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/54781795/The_Aesthetics_and_Emotions_of_Religious_Belonging_Examples_from_the_Buddhist_World?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_54781795", "summary": "The articles in this special issue illuminate the importance of aesthetics, affect, and emotion in the formation of religious communities through examples from the Buddhist world.

It discusses how Buddhist communities can take shape around feelings of togetherness, distance, and absence, how bonds are forged and broken through spectacular and quotidian aesthetic forms, and how aesthetic and emotional practices intersect with doctrinal interpretations, gender, ethnicity, and social distinction to shape the moral politics of religious belonging.

In the aftermath of the disaster, commentators almost universally described the blaze as \"unprecedented.\" This essay examines that claim in the light of contex-tualizing environmental histories and finds that although such firestorms are rare, they are far from unprecedented; they are in fact a necessary part of the cycle of regeneration in certain types of eucalypt forest. The idea that a never-before-witnessed event is unprecedented calls into question the shallow temporal frames through which deep time environmental phenomena are understood in Australian settler culture and offers an insight into often unno-ticed ways in which contemporary society struggles with the colonial legacy. This struggle sits next to the ambition of land management authorities to adopt traditional Indigenous mosaic-patterned cool-burning techniques as part of a fire mitigation strategy, without directly addressing the colonial history inscribed on the land they are commissioned to manage.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60256968, "asset_id": 40056424, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2128615, "first_name": "Christine", "last_name": "Hansen", "domain_name": "gu-se", "page_name": "ChristineHansen", "display_name": "Christine Hansen", "profile_url": "https://gu-se.academia.edu/ChristineHansen?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2128615/12865155/14262567/s65_christine.hansen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 153, "name": "Landscape Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Ecology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14072, "name": "Australian Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23193, "name": "Environmental Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Humanities?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 57534, "name": "Eucalypts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eucalypts?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 150471, "name": "Deep time", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep_time?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 437697, "name": "Bushfires", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bushfires?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2760884, "name": "Black Saturday", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Saturday?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 37951327, "title": "Pathways to Belonging: Contemporary research in    school belonging.

It does so in dialogue with two broad, interrelated bodies of literature, citizenship and transnationalism, which have examined issues of belonging, exclusion, mobility and access to rights among transnational migrants, while highlighting the renewed capacity of the state to regulate both people\u2019s movements and migrants\u2019 actual access to public entitlements. My dissertation challenges three sets of claims shaping research and policy agendas on migrant transnationalism and citizenship, and questions the hegemonic analytical and methodological approaches underlying them.\nMy research has been carried out at two distinctive analytical and empirical levels. On the one hand, I examine the \u201ctechnologies of citizenship\u201d (Ong 2003, Fujiwara 2008) deployed by the government to transform Argentina into a diverse, inclusive and Latin American nation over the past decade, paying particular attention to Kirchnerismo\u2019s creation of a \u201cnew legality\u201d for the Paraguayans, Bolivians and Peruvians in the country. On the other\nhand, I analyze the \u201chorizontal dimensions of citizenship processes\u201d (Neveu 2005, Pickus and Skerry 2007, Gagn\u00e9 and Neveu 2009) among these migrants in urban, peripheral and rural\nareas of the partido of La Plata. Namely, I study the extent to which migrants\u2019 socio-economic circumstances have changed in tandem with their new legal status (as nationals of the\nMERCOSUR in Argentina with rights equal to those of its citizens) and the \u201cinclusive citizenship\u201d policies deployed by the government.\nMy dissertation pays particular attention to the grounding and embodiment of rights by examining how migrants\u2019 new legal status translates into everyday life depending on a) where\nthey live and work, and b) their perceived social status by other migrants and non-migrants. On the one hand, I look at urban, peripheral and rural areas of La Plata as zones of graduated\nsovereignty (Ong 1999) where particular governmentality regimes have emerged in tandem with the settlement of often ethnically marked groupings, whose entitlements and obligations\ndiffer from those in other zones. On the other hand, I examine how social status is produced through everyday social interaction by transposing socially constructed distinctions, such as race, class, gender and national origin, into formal systems of exclusion (Gregory 2007). My ethnographic analysis of what I shall call lim\u00edtrofes\u2019 experiences of legality demonstrates that\ntheir formal equality vis-\u00e0-vis Argentinians, far from being merely given as a new legal status evenly guaranteed to all, is both unequally experienced by diverse migrants and differently\nenforced in geographic areas governed by distinctive governmentality regimes (Foucault 1978).\nKeywords : anthropology, socio-cultural anthropology, ethnography, transnationality, migration, regional integration, citizenship, state, MERCOSUR, Argentina.\n\nDe mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ma th\u00e8se examine les m\u00e9canismes des processus sociaux, \u00e9conomiques et politiques ayant contribu\u00e9, souvent de mani\u00e8re contradictoire, \u00e0 la (re)d\u00e9finition des crit\u00e8res d\u2019adh\u00e9sion au sein de la nation et de l\u2019Etat. Elle le fait par le\ndialogue au sein de deux grands corps de litt\u00e9rature intimement li\u00e9s, la citoyennet\u00e9 et le transnationalisme, qui se sont pench\u00e9s sur les questions d\u2019appartenance, d\u2019exclusion, de mobilit\u00e9 et d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux droits chez les migrants transnationaux tout en soulignant la capacit\u00e9 accrue de l\u2019Etat \u00e0 r\u00e9guler \u00e0 la fois les d\u00e9placements de personnes et l\u2019acc\u00e8s des migrants aux\ndroits. Cette th\u00e8se remet en question trois principes qui influencent la recherche et les programmes d\u2019action publique ayant trait au transnationalisme et \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 des\nmigrants, et remet en cause les approches analytiques h\u00e9g\u00e9moniques et m\u00e9thodologiques qui les sous-tendent.\nL\u2019\u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e \u00e0 deux niveaux distincts d\u2019analyse empirique et analytique. D\u2019une part, nous examinons les \u00ab technologies de la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00bb (Ong 2003, Fujiwara 2008) qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es par le gouvernement pour transformer l\u2019Argentine en une nation latinoam\u00e9ricaine diverse et inclusive pendant la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, en nous int\u00e9ressant particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation, par le Kirchnerisme, d\u2019une \u00ab nouvelle l\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb pour les Paraguayens, les Boliviens et les P\u00e9ruviens r\u00e9sidant dans le pays. D\u2019autre part, nous analysons la \u00ab dimension horizontale des processus de citoyennet\u00e9 \u00bb (Neveu 2005, Pickus and Skerry 2007, Gagn\u00e9 and Neveu 2009) chez ces migrants dans des aires urbaines, p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques et rurales du partido de La Plata. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, nous examinons dans quelle mesure les conditions socio\u00e9conomiques des migrants ont chang\u00e9 suite \u00e0 leur nouveau statut l\u00e9gal (en tant que ressortissants du MERCOSUR en Argentine, dont les droits sont \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux des\ncitoyens) et aux politiques de \u00ab citoyennet\u00e9 inclusive \u00bb d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es par le gouvernement.\nCette th\u00e8se se penche particuli\u00e8rement sur les fondations et l\u2019incarnation (\u00ab embodiment \u00bb) des droits en examinant comment le nouveau statut l\u00e9gal des migrants se manifeste au quotidien en fonction de a) o\u00f9 ils vivent et travaillent, et b) leur statut social\nper\u00e7u par les autres migrants et non-migrants. D\u2019une part, nous examinons les aires urbaines, p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques et rurales de La Plata en tant que \u00ab zones de souverainet\u00e9 gradu\u00e9e \u00bb (Ong 1999), o\u00f9 des r\u00e9gimes de gouvernementalit\u00e9 locaux sp\u00e9cifiques se sont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s en lien avec l\u2019installation de groupes ethniques souvent distincts, et dont les droits et devoirs diff\u00e8rent de\nceux d\u2019autres zones. D\u2019autre part, nous \u00e9tudions la fa\u00e7on dont le statut social est produit \u00e0 travers les interactions sociales quotidiennes en transposant des distinctions construites\nsocialement telles que race, classe, genre et origine nationale, en syst\u00e8mes d\u2019exclusion formels (Gregory 2007). Notre analyse ethnographique de ce que nous appelons les \u00ab exp\u00e9riences de\nl\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb des migrants d\u00e9montre que leur \u00e9galit\u00e9 formelle vis-\u00e0-vis des Argentins, loin d\u2019\u00eatre simplement donn\u00e9e comme un nouveau statut l\u00e9gal uniform\u00e9ment garanti pour tous, est \u00e0 la\nfois in\u00e9galement v\u00e9cue par les divers migrants, et diff\u00e9remment respect\u00e9e dans les zones g\u00e9ographiques dirig\u00e9es par divers r\u00e9gimes de gouvernementalit\u00e9 (Foucault 1978).\nMots-cl\u00e9s : anthropologie, anthropologie

The concept of identity has changed considerably over the past century, the subject finding itself at the intersection of nation, gender, the rise of multiculturalism and colonial history. While we are born with no selfawareness and our first point of reference is the world outside us, navigating existence involves a constant self-analysis and the realisation that any attempt at defining ourselves will result in newer interrogations. Aiming to provide some guidance to this relentless quest by introducing few of the key concepts used in identity research, the present paper addresses the fluidity of the self by focusing on the identity-alterity nexus and by prioritising the 'becoming' over the 'being'. Identity is, thus, always shifting and never a given; it is a transitional process oscillating between self-identification and identification made by the others, a puzzle whose interlocked pieces can be moved around and change in meaning.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79059229, "asset_id": 68132777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 163237107, "first_name": "Gabriela", "last_name": "Mocan", "domain_name": "ubbcluj", "page_name": "GMocan", "display_name": "Gabriela Mocan", "profile_url": "https://ubbcluj.academia.edu/GMocan?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/163237107/71468756/59913768/s65_gabriela.mocan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77969, "name": "Identity and Alterity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Alterity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 61638967, "title": "Citizenship: from three to seven principles of belonging", "created_at": "2021-11-13T06:31:27.674-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61638967/Citizenship_from_three_to_seven_principles_of_belonging?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_61638967", "summary": "Conventionally, three 'laws' are said to govern the recognition of citizenship.

Visto que, o presente estudo tem como foco principal fazer uma leitura dessa protagonista na perspectiva da identidade cultural na p\u00f3s-modernidade, \u2013 sob a luz dos Estudos Culturais e dos Estudos P\u00f3s-coloniais \u2013 apontando como a personagem feminina mostra uma conformidade cultural ao final das tr\u00eas narrativas. Ademais, o estudo justifica-se pela necessidade de investigar o modo como o choque cultural colabora para a desconstru\u00e7\u00e3o/constru\u00e7\u00e3o, configura\u00e7\u00e3o/reconfigura\u00e7\u00e3o da personalidade desse ser fict\u00edcio; al\u00e9m disso, n\u00f3s investigamos a crise e a fragmenta\u00e7\u00e3o de sua identidade enfrentadas por ela no decorrer do seu processo de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o e ajustamento ao contexto s\u00f3cio, hist\u00f3rico e cultural que lhe \u00e9 imposto. Metodologicamente, partiu-se de uma pesquisa bibliogr\u00e1fica, de cunho qualitativo, explorat\u00f3rio e investigativo, utilizando-se do m\u00e9todo dedutivo, atrav\u00e9s de uma an\u00e1lise estrutural da narrativa. Como fundamenta\u00e7\u00e3o te\u00f3rica, contamos com as concep\u00e7\u00f5es de Bonnici (2009); Cevasco (2009); Cust\u00f3dio (2013); G\u00e1mez-Fern\u00e1ndez (2016); Hall (2006); Ling (2014); e, Rahman (2017). Em conclus\u00e3o, vemos que, al\u00e9m de Hema apresentar uma identidade h\u00edbrida, ela tamb\u00e9m mant\u00e9m um equil\u00edbrio entre a cultura norte-americana e a cultura dos seus pais. Em suma, a protagonista transparece conseguir ajustar-se \u00e0 ambas as culturas, apresentando uma conformidade cultural, como uma forma de concilia\u00e7\u00e3o entre os costumes do Oriente e os do Ocidente.

"This chapter builds on anthropological studies that examine the role of religious practice in the construction of belonging within the context of migration. We expand on such studies by focusing on how religiously and spatially mediated modes of being in and relating to the world become embodied in the life worlds of the members of two diasporic religious groups in Berlin \u2013 a German-Turkish Sufi circle and a West-African neo-Pentecostal church. Emphasis is placed on affective religious routines and related emotional experiences which relate the followers of these groups to their wider socio-material urban environment.

Abstract In this article, as a researcher speaking Zazaki and having a Zaza identity, I will associate my own experience and perception with general identity and belonging literature and identity researches by addressing them with a self-criticism and intersubjectively. While analyzing the historical, political and sociological situation of Zaza identity within the scope of nationalism studies, I will try to determine the options related to Zaza nationalism and becoming a nation state for the mass defining themselves with this identity. The Zaza population, particularly the segment with Alevi belief, continues their presence considerably at diaspora. With the awareness of existing dominant nationalist factors, the idea that the Zaza identity which has developed particularly in the European diaspora belongs to a separate ethnic identity is recognized partially. The Ancient Dersim region, which appears as a transition point between the area dominated by the Turks and Turkish language and the area dominated by the Kurds and \"Kurdish languages\", is located in the center of identity conflict. I will also analyze the current and historical situation of the people of this region, who separate from each other in terms of Sunnism and Alevism, in a pluralist and self-democracy extent. Aim of this study is to underline the requirement for bringing the differences into light despite the monist mentalities and strategies to enforce dominant structures to maintain and regenerate their power and to impose these to the communities which they want to build on a dominance. I will examine the subject's topic with resources documenting the actual political process, as well as with critical discourse and self-criticism method, and with the theoretical basis of identity and belonging, nationalism and nationalism/nation building.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56764326, "asset_id": 36813685, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors":

Bringing a different perspective to modern French novel by exemplifying of these newly formed hybrid genres, Jean Echenoz gives the narrative dynamism by changing the novel conventions. Echenoz, who is seen as significantly loyal to the traditional novel features, re-interprets the basic concepts of the narrative and creates a more cinematographic narrative structure. In the novels One year (Un an) and I'm gone (Je m'en vais), static, settled and detailed descriptions of space in the classic French novel are replaced by a narrative in which the space is dynamic, continuously changing and evoking rootlessness. The constant travel of the novel characters creates spatial mobility; on the other hand, it weakens heroes' sense of belonging.

This qualitative study explored the experiences of six newly arrived migrant women who attended community ESOL classes (English for Speakers of Other Languages), focusing on the women\u2019s social interactions in English, the places in which social interactions took place and their sense of belonging. Belonging is defined as feeling at ease with oneself and one\u2019s surroundings (Miller, 2003). Data was gathered over one and a half years, using narrative interviews and oral diaries, and analysed using thematic and classic content analysis methods. The study concluded that women\u2019s social interactions took place in four main spheres: local community, public services, work and home. Data demonstrated that social interactions in English affected women\u2019s feelings of belonging from four aspects: material, relational, cultural and temporal. Findings indicated that social interactions supported women to build trust in people who were different to them and to learn cultural knowledge, practices and acceptable behaviours not formally taught in their ESOL sessions, which supported participants to gain access and to feel at ease in unfamiliar spheres.\nThis study will help teachers to recognise the contribution of social interactions to their students\u2019 language development and integration; policy-makers to plan for future ESOL and integration programme development and funding; and assist organisations in designing more effective community ESOL programmes. Recommendations include for practitioners to plan for activities to support social interactions outside the classroom, to consider the importance of digital skills in enabling ESOL learners to participate in online social interactions, and a more joined-up approach with public service organisations to support staff in those roles to understand how to best support migrant clients who are learning English.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65292527, "asset_id": 44796321, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30647353, "first_name": "Nafisah", "last_name": "Graham-Brown", "domain_name": "ioe", "page_name": "NafisahGrahamBrown", "display_name": "Nafisah Graham-Brown", "profile_url": "https://ioe.academia.edu/NafisahGrahamBrown?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30647353/17873299/38469906/s65_nafisah.graham-brown.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11442, "name": "Community Cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Cohesion?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60827, "name": "Social cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_cohesion?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 161014, "name": "Social Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Integration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 169010, "name": "ESOL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESOL?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 356037, "name": "Skills for Life (ESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Skills_for_Life_ESOL_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 399195, "name": "ESOL Learners, ESL Learners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESOL_Learners_ESL_Learners?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 625630, "name": "Language Socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Socialization-1?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 635156, "name": "Migrant Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Women?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 652283, "name": "Identity/ies and Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_ies_and_Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2467300, "name": "Second language socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_language_socialization?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2540442, "name": "Migration, identity and belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_identity_and_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3844076, "name": "Esol and Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Esol_and_Integration?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 40783226, "title": "Mobility and Belonging: A Study of Italian Youth Diaspora in Australia", "created_at": "2019-10-29T21:55:51.034-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40783226/Mobility_and_Belonging_A_Study_of_Italian_Youth_Diaspora_in_Australia?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_40783226", "summary": "This research report presents and discusses the\npreliminary findings of a mixed-methods research\nproject examining Italian youth mobility to and\nformations of belonging in Australia.

In the story, Maniam voices out the experiences of Indian minority in the troubled times of Malaysia and their struggle for assimilation and adaptation to the new land as well as their identity crisis. Central characters of the story, Ravi, Periathai and Naina as three different generations of Indian migrant in the landscape of Malaysia attempt to embrace the new land as their home and build their coherent or homogeneous Malaysian identity. This paper also explores Maniam's protagonist's (Ravi) identity conflicts and his endeavor to escape from his unsettled identity as an Indian Malaysian. Ravi seeks his identity in mastering English, the colonial language, yet this is the very point of his alienation as he finds out that all his preconceptions about language was false and illusionary.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53341375, "asset_id": 33272947, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2824884, "first_name": "Robabeh", "last_name": "Zabihzadeh", "domain_name": "ukm", "page_name": "ROBABeh", "display_name": "Robabeh  Zabihzadeh", "profile_url": "https://ukm.academia.edu/ROBABeh?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2824884/923886/1156602/s65_ro_ba.beh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 41079, "name": "Alienation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alienation?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 888572, "name": "Identity Crisis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Crisis?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2715220, "name": "Unhomeliness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unhomeliness?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31792817, "title": "Zero Budget Natural Farming and Bovine Entanglements in South India", "created_at": "2017-03-09T12:59:19.776-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31792817/Zero_Budget_Natural_Farming_and_Bovine_Entanglements_in_South_India?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_31792817", "summary": "Daniel M\u00fcnster takes us to the troubled history of improving dairy production in India, from the crossbreeding and high-cost industrialized care of delicate hybrids to the equally complex implications of a native-cow revival.

Participants in the study were 275 adolescents and emerging adults aged between 17 and 24 (mean = 18.82, SD = 1.50), and included 177 females, 99 males, and 2 transgender participants, with 2 participants not disclosing their gender. Convenience sampling from a national group of young people accessing welfare service organisations within Australia was used. Qualitative data was obtained from thirteen open ended questions to an online survey. The study found that this group of adolescents and emerging adults with a history of childhood adversity understood social support and belonging as having someone who listened, as coming from people who surrounded them, and as impacted by their childhood experiences.

Territoriality was not an important element of sovereignty but it depended primarily on control of or influence over people. The historical lack of borders among port cities in the Gulf region, a multiplicity of identities and the relative autonomy that the Gulf cities enjoyed led to the formation of a hybrid society, which I would define as the khal\u012bj\u012b community or community of the \u2018Gulfies\u2019 (al-mujtama\u02bda al-khal\u012bj\u012b). It resulted from social and economic interactions between people of the Persian Gulf with people living in South Asia, China, Southeast Asia and East Africa that has occurred over the centuries. Despite people on the coastal areas in the Persian Gulf had intense relations, they did not share a common identity. This community was not an integration of different cultures and groups but an aggregation of different ethnic groups held together for economic and commercial reasons. \nIn 1971, the formation of the United Arab Emirates federation disrupted the unity of the khal\u012bj\u012b community, which was characterized by unity within diversity. One consequence of this disruption was the establishment of boundaries between Emiratis and non-Emiratis. Based upon my ethnographic research, this paper explores the importance of belonging among Pakistanis in Dubai, the role played by the Pakistan Association Dubai (PAD) in strengthening the Pakistani identity, even among the young generation. The lack of any policy aimed at integrating migrants, and the impossibility of settling down permanently in Dubai has pushed the Pakistani community to \u2018cultivate\u2019 and enhance their Pakistani identity.\n\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48621921, "asset_id": 28291174, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46235654, "first_name": "Gennaro", "last_name": "Errichiello", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "GennaroErrichiello", "display_name": "Gennaro Errichiello", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/GennaroErrichiello?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2714, "name": "Gulf Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gulf_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2817, "name": "Border Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Border_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46474, "name": "Territoriality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Territoriality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 51050, "name": "Dubai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dubai?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 74602, "name": "Port cities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Port_cities?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 218974, "name": "Positionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Positionality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 713158, "name": "Migrant Associations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Associations?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 25041310, "title": "Crossing Boundaries: Acts of Citizenship among Migrant Youth in Melbourne", "created_at": "2016-05-04T22:29:10.937-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25041310/Crossing_Boundaries_Acts_of_Citizenship_among_Migrant_Youth_in_Melbourne?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_25041310", "summary": "This paper focuses on how migrant youth in Melbourne with experience of direct or indirect migration negotiate cross-cultural engagements and tensions between family, community and the greater society in which they are supposed to participate as political subjects.

Distance education (DE) is one such method of delivering education. The method of investigation was regarded as fundamentally interpretative and designed\nfrom the hermeneutic phenomenology, as it focused particularly on the world as it is lived and experienced by Batswana students, in order to establish why and how\nthese Batswana students experience their studies. Their way of thinking and feeling about their studies in the Advanced Certificate of Education (ACE) is influenced by the face-to-face facilitated contact opportunities embedded within the distance division of the North-West University (NWU). These experiences affect the success of distance students at a traditional contact university. A qualitative research design was used. The research design used 17 semi-structured, open-ended individual interviews and three focus-group interviews. Interviews were administered to 32 teacher-students in\nthe ACE programmes. Qualitative findings were interpreted to identify the reasons for why and how the Batswana students think and feel about facilitated contact opportunities during the distance study term. The reasons include feelings of mutual\nacceptance, the need for affective security, closeness, commitment and sincerity during scheduled contact sessions. Through this qualitative study it was established that despite various types of assistance provided for them in terms of teaching and learning, they insist on contact in their distance-type ACE programme. They prefer that all encounters should create an atmosphere of openness and sincerity\nin which students can confidently realise their right to existence within this particular community. The encounters should also provide these students with academic safety\nand security. Within the contact sessions, distance can be considered an initial communal agreement where the cohesion of belonging among participants may be created time and again, and maintained throughout the distance study process.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38861945, "asset_id": 16068562, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 110565, "first_name": "Ferdinand", "last_name": "Potgieter", "domain_name": "nwu", "page_name": "FerdinandPotgieter", "display_name": "Ferdinand J Potgieter", "profile_url": "https://nwu.academia.edu/FerdinandPotgieter?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/110565/10226902/77631916/s65_ferdinand.potgieter.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4715, "name": "Social Interaction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Interaction?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 931698, "name": "Open Distance Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Open_Distance_Learning?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 14476883, "title": "Property Relations by other Means: Conflict over Dryland Resources in Benin and Mali", "created_at": "2015-07-28T20:56:46.035-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14476883/Property_Relations_by_other_Means_Conflict_over_Dryland_Resources_in_Benin_and_Mali?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_14476883", "summary": "Conflicts over natural resources and property concern the distribution of entitlements to resources and social identities.

impact on a range of factors associated with wellbeing. These areas include life satisfaction, general wellbeing, clinical depression, cognitive performance, academic outcomes, and physical health. Belonging is an important aspect of psychological functioning. Schools offer unique opportunities for mediating belonging for school-aged children. Research on belonging in educational settings has been unsystematic and diluted by disparities in definition and terminology. This paper provides an overview of belonging, the importance of belonging in schools, and proposes an argument as to why further research is needed.

Unlike several recent studies on youths in Africa, it focuses on educated youths from Manyu, exploring their strategies to secure greater political inclusion and better chances for upward social mobility. With a critical attention to their discourses and practices, the article examines the disjuncture between the promise of Cameroon\u2019s patrimonial state as an inclusive structure of political action and the sense of exclusion, anxiety, and uncertainty felt by many actors. It argues that this tension generates relations of mutuality and interdependence between elite and nonelite actors. Yet, the article finds that while the logics of political intimacy between Manyu students and their political elites in Cameroon are mediated by kinship, ethnicity, and patronage, these do not always guarantee inclusion and success in social mobility for the youthful actors. For these youths, they felt their exclusion to be more a result of the obstructive character of middle-aged elites who were reticent to acknowledge the values of kinship, ethnicity, and patronage as valid basis for granting opportunities to their younger kinsmen.

The results demonstrate that searching for belonging and connection are spiritual practices, illustrate that spiritual meaning can be revealed over time as adverse experiences are contemplated, and suggest opportunities for practicing spiritual leadership.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84262074, "asset_id": 76609327, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1781830, "first_name": "Jessica", "last_name": "Dreistadt, Ph.D.", "domain_name": "eastern", "page_name": "JessicaDreistadt", "display_name": "Jessica R .

of nearly three decades of conflict in northern Uganda, children born into the rebel group the Lord&#39;s Resistance Army (LRA) experience social, economic, and political exclusion. Thousands were born to mothers and often fathers who were abducted by the LRA and forced to marry inside the rebel group. The children are part of a global population of people born of sexual violence in conflict. This dissertation contributes to the small but growing body of work on this population called &#39;children born of war.&#39; Using a child-centered methodology, this study is grounded in the everyday experiences of 29 children born into the LRA, with data collected at various points over a period of eight months between 2011 and 2016 in northern Uganda. The following research questions guided my inquiry: 1) How do the children experience their everyday social lives? 2) How do they make sense of their experiences? 3) What strategies and resources do they use or access to help navigate their everyday lives? 4) What macro and micro processes lend insight into or explain these experiences? To answer these questions, I developed a conceptual framework consisting of the ideas of a) the politics of belonging, inclusive of place-based, and b) nation-building and hegemonic masculinity. The findings point to the role of place-making in shaping the children&#39;s social experiences. Careful examination of their everyday lives reveals the children&#39;s efforts to negotiate the boundaries of their exclusion in effort to navigate toward better positions in life.

Both regions witnessed the creation and then consolidation of memory regimes related to remembering military dictatorships and state socialism, respectively. This article interrogates how transnational migration experiences between the two regions challenge nationally framed memory regimes, with a focus on Chile, Romania, and Croatia. By tracing individual migrants and exiles between Romania and Chile, as well as the Croatian Chilean diaspora, this article discusses the entanglements between Chile and Southeastern Europe in the remembrance of the Pinochet and Ceausescu dictatorships, as well as the Tito\u00b4s Yugoslavia. First, it shows how migrants who experienced dictatorships in both regions operate their own vernacular comparisons between the two experiences. These reframe the tropes existing in dominant memory narratives in each country and create hierarchies of suffering and oppression (i.e. in the case of the Romania\u2013Chile comparison, with a more negative valuation of the Ceau\u015fescu dictatorship). Second, by discussing intergenerational memory for those who did not experience dictatorship, as well as diasporic memory formations (e.g. Croat Chileans), it shows that, in these instances, comparisons are more under the influence of dominant national memory frames, but also of memory entrepreneurs who mobilize specific threads. Moreover, the article discusses how these various migrant experiences constitute and reframe senses of belonging, interrogating both the formulations of home and transnationality.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77672738, "asset_id": 66508611, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16255189, "first_name": "Gruia", "last_name": "Badescu", "domain_name": "konstanz", "page_name": "GruiaBadescu", "display_name": "Gruia Badescu", "profile_url": "https://konstanz.academia.edu/GruiaBadescu?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16255189/4405750/27693675/s65_gruia.badescu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 10767, "name": "Exile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13530, "name": "Chile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chile?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18214, "name": "Social Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Memory?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18639, "name": "Dictatorships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dictatorships?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 48952, "name": "Romania", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romania?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 57511, "name": "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Comparison?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 77925, "name": "Military Dictatorship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_Dictatorship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 134143, "name": "Politics of Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Memory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 162580, "name": "Chilean Social and Cultural History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chilean_Social_and_Cultural_History?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 227356, "name": "Generational Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generational_Memory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 614690, "name": "Dictatorship and Transition in the Southern Cone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dictatorship_and_Transition_in_the_Southern_Cone?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 56753120, "title": "Tax Raj: Koyas, Migration, and Adivasi Frontiers in the Central Provinces", "created_at": "2021-10-09T01:53:41.343-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/56753120/Tax_Raj_Koyas_Migration_and_Adivasi_Frontiers_in_the_Central_Provinces?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_56753120", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71982685, "asset_id": 56753120, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 245684, "first_name": "Rakesh", "last_name": "Krishnan", "domain_name": "uohyd", "page_name": "rakeshkrishnan", "display_name": "Rakesh M Krishnan", "profile_url": "https://uohyd.academia.edu/rakeshkrishnan?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/245684/150746/107319113/s65_rakesh.krishnan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28387, "name": "Adivasi Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adivasi_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 219564, "name": "Central Provinces (India)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_Provinces_India_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 430768, "name": "Tribals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tribals?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 50793724, "title": "Feeling at home across time and place: A study of Ecuadorians in three European cities", "created_at": "2021-08-08T13:29:14.908-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/50793724/Feeling_at_home_across_time_and_place_A_study_of_Ecuadorians_in_three_European_cities?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_50793724", "summary": "International migration creates significant dilemmas for people to feel at home or not and a meaningful field to investigate this emotional experience.

We link these aspects to length of residence and the location's 'connectedness' to Ecuador. Immigrants' sense of feeling at home increases over time, regardless of location or scale. However, feeling at home is positively associated with the location's connectedness to Ecuador. The importance of social relations (especially inviting friends) and infrastructural characteristics for feeling at home in a place also increases over time, contrary to the influence of nostalgic homeland reminders.

This article explores lesbian, queer and gay women's narratives of their everyday lives in Cape Town. Their counter narratives reveal how they 'make' Cape Town home in relation to racialized and classed heteronormativies. These grey the racialised binary of territorial safety and danger, and produce modes of lesbian constructions of home, notably the modes of embedded lesbianism, homonormativity and borderlands.

For rural youth, the opportunities education can afford usually necessitates leaving home to study in a regional or metropolitan campus, with added cost and loss for families and communities. Thus, aiming a post-compulsory education for rural students typically involves \u2018higher stakes\u2019 than for their urban counterparts. This chapter examines the impact of the view of education as \u2018learning to leave\u2019 (Corbett 2007) against the backdrop of building the social fabric and sustainability of rural places. We explore this tension between the concepts of aspirations and belonging in young peoples\u2019 lives and then consider the implications for changing (rural) teachers\u2019 work. We argue that the tension between belonging and being aspirational, as it is articulated in educational discourse, is central on both individual decision-making and institutional responsiveness. We seek to problematise the relationship between belonging and aspirations by focusing on the impact that rural teachers\u2019 work can have in (re)solving or (re)producing this tension. We draw on case studies in Victoria and Tasmania to examine how different communities represent structures of opportunity, and consider some related challenges and opportunities for rural education.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82950416, "asset_id": 38976322, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 374207, "first_name": "Hernan", "last_name": "Cuervo", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "HernanCuervo", "display_name": "Hernan Cuervo", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/HernanCuervo?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/374207/14359177/15286310/s65_hernan.cuervo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 115756, "name": "Aspirations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aspirations?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 365521, "name": "Rural Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Youth?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2540670, "name": "Rural Teachers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Teachers?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37622558, "title": "Formations of belonging in Australia: The role of nostalgia in experiences of time and place", "created_at": "2018-10-21T12:42:32.304-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37622558/Formations_of_belonging_in_Australia_The_role_of_nostalgia_in_experiences_of_time_and_place?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_37622558", "summary": "Although residential mobility has been studied at length, residential immobility has been addressed comparatively rarely.

It is taken as a priori, given and therefore static, whereas society is changing, dynamic (Urry, 2000: 133).  Local places are seen as irrelevant, because now we live in an homogenous global world where \u2018local\u2019 infers a sentimental attachment to history (Appadurai, 1995: 214; Massey, 1994: 5).  Here I shall argue that that places are not a priori, but are created interactively. Beginning from Heidegger\u2019s (1971) Building, Dwelling, Thinking I will explore how places \u2018gather\u2019 leading to an examination of the entanglement of local places and local life stories. Having established place as a thoroughly social entity the contrasting ideas of the \u2018global\u2019 and the \u2018local\u2019 will be scrutinised showing how the particularity of place is connected to its people and their practices. Using case studies from my research in Wigan as illustration I will show how building gathers both landscape and peoplescape; building brings together neighbourhoods; building leads from place to place. Places are not merely an effect of human agency but are created performatively as material intra-activity (Barad, 2003), not merely a backdrop to the performance of human or social life.

promising young writers. A major theme in many of Bromfield\u2019s works is the 20th-century loss of a lived sensitivity to the natural world percipitated in part by American industrialism and materialism. At the same time, Bromfield sought to resurrect a style of environmental encounter whereby plants, animals, and places could be seen as they were in themselves and thereby be genuinely cared for and protected.\r\n\r\nOne label he used for this sympathetic way of knowing nature is \u201cteched\u201d\u2014a colloquial word referring to a capacity for experiencing an intuitive intimacy with things, creatures, and landscapes such that the boundaries of self and other dissolve. Bromfield believed that such direct openness to the world was essential to understanding nature and for using it in a responsible, sustainable way, especially in regard to particular places, including his home region of northern central Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, I draw on two of Bromfield\u2019s short stories\u2014\u201cUp Ferguson Way\u201d and \u201cThe Pond\u201d (both written in 1944)\u2014to examine the experiential dimensions of \u201cteched\u201d and to indicate how this mode of encounter relates to attachment to place.\r\n\r\nKey words: Louis Bromfield, Malabar Farm, environmental experience, place, attachment to place, love of nature, phenomenology of place\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 732047, "asset_id": 216763, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 93547, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Seamon", "domain_name": "ksu", "page_name": "DavidSeamon", "display_name": "David Seamon", "profile_url": "https://ksu.academia.edu/DavidSeamon?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/93547/25922/29662134/s65_david.seamon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4430, "name": "Altered States of Consciousness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Altered_States_of_Consciousness?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4470, "name": "Literary Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Geography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7695, "name": "Environmental Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Ethics?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26247, "name": "Ecophenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecophenomenology?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 33313, "name": "Literature and Environment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature_and_Environment?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 178742, "name": "Place Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 296320, "name": "Phenomenology of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Place?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 324103, "name": "Insideness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insideness?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 326408, "name": "Literature and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature_and_Place?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 326409, "name": "Louis Bromfield", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Louis_Bromfield?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 326414, "name": "Environmental Humility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Humility?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 75613957, "title": "Zero Budget Natural Farming and Bovine Entanglements in South India", "created_at": "2022-04-06T03:29:09.949-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75613957/Zero_Budget_Natural_Farming_and_Bovine_Entanglements_in_South_India?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_75613957", "summary": "Daniel M\u00fcnster takes us to the troubled history of improving dairy production in India, from the crossbreeding and high-cost industrialized care of delicate hybrids to the equally complex implications of a native-cow revival.

The concept of the (re)construction of identity seems to be adequate here, because during the interviews the interlocutors were never asked about their identity or belonging, and yet in their statements they position themselves narratively.

In Samburu county, northern Kenya, \"plastic boys\" are unemployed men whom others despise for being unattached, \"useless paupers,\" who, not unlike plastic itself, have allegedly no capacity to grow roots and thrive. Analyzing this subject position against a wider background of objects and afflictions deemed \"foreign\"-including plastic bags, plastic rice, plastic hair, plastic smiles, and homosexuality as a \"plastic pollutant\"-I show how different troublesome objectifications of plastic resonate with one another and their wider context. I argue that panics over plastics and the politics of belonging shape one another, producing new, less-obvious forms of inclusion and exclusion.

Throughout the history of the Turkish Republic, Imam-Hatip High Schools have been one of the most controversial schools on the agenda of Turkey with its emergence, structure, curriculum, students and graduates. As known, advanture of Imam-Hatip Schools have begun by Law of Tevhid-I Tedrisat, in 1929-1930 school year, due to lack of demand for attendance to Imam- Hatip Schools, theese schools have been closed. Imam-Hatip Schools that they have stopped much duration, had opened again because of neccesity in 1950. Until 1997, demand of theese schools increased, but law numbered 4306 which increased the compulsory basic education to eight years, decreased the demand for theese schools, at a significant rate. Middle classes of Imam-Hatip High Schools was closed because this law. So, this law have been a new turning point for Imam-Hatip High schools. Imam-Hatip High School which firstly started with the idea of raising \u201c Lucent Religious Functionary\u201d but later on that kind of schools have undergone a change towards the desire of \u201cchildren study and learn their religion.\u201d It was soon adopted by the society as an educational model that combines general education and religious education. During February 28 period, the middle parts of these schools have been closed in 1998 and the graduates have been banned from going to different faculties other than Theology Faculties. The cirriculum of Imam-Hatip High Schools changed in 1999. In this period, the number of schools and students considerably decreased. With the amendment of the law adopted on 30 March 2012, 12 years of compulsory and gradual education were introduced instead of 8 years of continuous compulsory education. First level 4 year elementary school, second level 4 year secondary school and third level it is organized as a 4-year high school. In this framework, the middle parts of Imam-Hatip schools, which were closed with the continuous 8 year compulsory education in 1997, were reopened thanks to this law. The various field surveys are needed in order to understand the profile, perceptions, expectations, sense belonging, satisfaction and dissatisfaction sense of students, teachers, the administrators, and parents in these schools. For this reason we have aplied inquiries to the students who study in Imam-Hatip schools. Through thise inquiries we aimed to find out problemes and suggest some solutions. Finally, in the light of data obtained teachers some recommendations have been suggested for researchers. A general evaluation of this presentation which is called \u201cImam Hatip (religious vocational) High Schools According to Teachers: Profiles, Perceptions, Satisfaction and Belonging\u201d is carried out by the Center for Education of Values. In this presentation were discussed only the data obtained from the opinions of the teachers. \nKey Words: Imam-Hatip High School, religious education, perception, belonging, expectation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60475089, "asset_id": 40242984, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1528241, "first_name": "Kasim", "last_name": "Tatlilio\u011flu", "domain_name": "bingol", "page_name": "KasimTatlilio\u011flu", "display_name": "Kasim Tatlilio\u011flu", "profile_url": "https://bingol.academia.edu/KasimTatlilio%C4%9Flu?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1528241/541043/22289196/s65_kasim.tatlilio_lu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 867, "name": "Perception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Perception?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2397, "name": "Religious Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Education?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 62984, "name": "Imam Hatip Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imam_Hatip_Schools?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 153511, "name": "Expectations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Expectations?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 39615571, "title": "Social Beings, Future Belongings", "created_at": "2019-06-17T16:47:25.257-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39615571/Social_Beings_Future_Belongings?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_39615571", "summary": "Social Beings, Future Belongings is a collection of sociological essays that address an increasingly relevant matter: what does belonging look like in the twenty-first century? The book critically explores the concept of belonging and how it can respond to contemporary problems in not only the traditional domains of citizenship and migration, but also in detention practices, queer and feminist politics, Australian literature and fashion, technology, housing and rituals.\n\nDrawing on examples from Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, each topic is examined as a different kind of problem for the future \u2013 as a toil, an intensity or a promise. Ultimately, the collection argues that creating new ways to belong in contemporary times means reimagining the traditional terms on which belonging can happen, as well as the social itself. Read on their own, each chapter presents a compelling case study and develops a set of critical tools for encountering the empirical, epistemological and ontological challenges we face today. Read together, they present a diverse imagination that is capable of answering the question of belonging in, to and with the future.\n\nSocial Beings, Future Belongings shows how belonging is not a static and universal state, but a contingent, emergent and ongoing future-oriented set of practices.

Repression of same-sex sexuality reached a peak in February 2008 after a Senegalese tabloid, Ic\u00f4ne, published 20 photos of an allegedly gay marriage, and 5 men were subsequently put into custody. Based on fieldwork research and several interviews conducted in the cities of Dakar, Thies and Mbour, this paper explores the rise of new types of political demands and discourses related to homosexuality in Senegal. First, this paper analyses the condemnation of homosexuality by some Senegalese religious groups, such as the religious association Djamra/Jamra. This condemnation of same-sex intimacy is motivated by an attempt to regenerate religious and cultural values. Second, it focuses on the political claims and participatory politics of gay and lesbian Senegalese citizens in this hostile environment. This paper outlines how current discourses on homosexuality are embedded in Senegal in a set of fractured representations of togetherness and belonging.

Policies regarding the right to residency can play an important role in reducing mental health symptoms. We propose that facilitating a sense of belonging should be seen as one important preventive mental healthcare intervention.

In this paper, I propose to look at migration no longer as a process but as a project. Migration process is a 'neutral' term that does not unpack the migration experience, practices and everyday life of migrants in the Arab Gulf countries. But more than that, it underestimates the role of agency in migration. I thus introduce the notion of 'migration project' to affirm that the migration experience is characterized by a conscious decision to migrate. It does not mean that there is a project established a priori but it emphasizes the agency of individuals, groups and households to mobilize resources in order to migrate and face difficulties of such experience. Belonging is conceived as emotional ties and feeling 'at home', and it also refers to social category, space and locales. I argue that belonging is also flexible, which means that people belong, at the same time, to different spaces, places and locales. 'Flexible belonging' is based on the relation between self and society, which means emphasizing the role and understanding the self as an active and participatory agent in society Based on my field research within the Pakistani community in Dubai and especially professionals, this paper revisits the notion of migration process and belonging in light of the particular characteristics of migration in the Gulf region. In terms of positionality within the Emirati context, Pakistani professionals adopt strategies and mobilize resources that allow them to develop relationships and interact with the local context. These relationships are framed within the concept of 'flexible belonging', thus suggesting that social relationships are shaped by fluctuations between 'preserving' Pakistani identity and feeling part of the Emirati context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52415928, "asset_id": 32181555, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46235654, "first_name": "Gennaro", "last_name": "Errichiello", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "GennaroErrichiello", "display_name": "Gennaro Errichiello", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/GennaroErrichiello?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 51050, "name": "Dubai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dubai?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1014775, "name": "Migrant Labors In GCC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Labors_In_GCC?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30669081, "title": "Nationalism and Belonging: Introduction", "created_at": "2016-12-29T13:27:42.767-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30669081/Nationalism_and_Belonging_Introduction?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_30669081", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52012458, "asset_id": 30669081, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 417316, "first_name": "Eleanor", "last_name": "Knott", "domain_name": "lse", "page_name": "EleanorKnott", "display_name": "Eleanor Knott", "profile_url": "https://lse.academia.edu/EleanorKnott?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/417316/148811/17556067/s65_eleanor.knott.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28147, "name": "Nations and nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nations_and_nationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 29768511, "title": "Language Learning and Identity", "created_at": "2016-11-09T16:23:05.796-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29768511/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_29768511", "summary": "Linguistic identity is crucial in determining whether or a language learner attains communicative competence in an L2.

The apparent incommensurability of these standpoints, and the taxing attempts at their reconciliation, invite us to reconceptualize the notion of moral tradition.\n\nhttps://www.haujournal.org/index.php/hau/article/view/hau5.2.017", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 169930, "first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Lorenz", "domain_name": "amu", "page_name": "JanLorenz", "display_name": "Jan Lorenz", "profile_url": "https://amu.academia.edu/JanLorenz?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/169930/88000/38631011/s65_jan.lorenz.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 983, "name": "Jewish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26445, "name": "Judaism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Judaism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43385, "name": "Anthropology of ethics and morality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_ethics_and_morality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 380323, "name": "Anthropology of Judaism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Judaism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 16191092, "title": "Difficult Belongings", "created_at": "2015-09-25T23:49:45.196-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/16191092/Difficult_Belongings?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_16191092", "summary": "The emergence of queer theory and politics in the 1990s was widely touted as heralding a new era of sexual inclusivity.

In relation to young children, belonging may be linked to their developing sense of identity, as well as the way they perceive and respond to others. Belonging is emerging as an important aspect of contemporary early childhood education and care (ECEC) curriculum such as Te Wha\u00af riki from New Zealand and Belonging, Being and Becoming: The Early Years Learning Framework for Australia (EYLF). There is the potential for belonging\r\nto become a romanticised, simplistic and taken for granted notion within ECEC. Following Sumsion and Wong\u2019s (2011) call\r\nfor belonging to be taken up in critical and reflective ways in ECEC, and Peers and Fleer\u2019s (2013) concerns regarding the inadequacy of everyday understandings of belonging to the full realisation\r\nof the intent of the EYLF, this paper is an attempt to begin problematizing the notion of belonging in early childhood, particularly in relation to infants in family day care (FDC). Conceptualisations of belonging across disciplines are discussed, with particular attention to the notions of a sense of belonging and the politics of belonging. Particular aspects of FDC that may be important to consider in relation to belonging are drawn out, namely its purported home- and family-like nature. Finally, in relation\r\nto infants, we argue that any discussion of infants\u2019 belonging in ECEC must include the peer group and the active role that infants may play in the politics of belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49119129, "asset_id": 8023053, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 670860, "first_name": "Tina", "last_name": "Stratigos", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "TinaStratigos", "display_name": "Tina  Stratigos", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/TinaStratigos?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/670860/4153585/4838997/s65_tina.stratigos.gif"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3753, "name": "Early Childhood Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Childhood_Education?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29470, "name": "Infancy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Infancy?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 684784, "name": "Family Child Care, Family Day Care, Childminding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Child_Care_Family_Day_Care_Childminding?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 768477, "name": "Politics of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 7873372, "title": "Mobility, Christianity and Belonging: Reflections of an Overseas Chinese Expatriate Wife in Shanghai. 2013.

Coping with these conflicts requires several conceptual distinctions; the key ones discussed here are the distinction between romantic intensity and romantic profundity and the distinction between extrinsically and intrinsically valuable activities. While admitting the presence of the opposing poles, I argue that in profound love, these poles can coexist. Such coexistence has significant consequences for the nature of romantic relationships, for instance, admitting the presence of romantic ambivalence and indifference and acknowledging the value of brief, casual sexual encounters.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86759886, "asset_id": 80347634, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11858249, "first_name": "Aaron", "last_name": "Ben-Ze'ev", "domain_name": "haifa", "page_name": "AaronBenZeev", "display_name": "Aaron Ben-Ze'ev", "profile_url": "https://haifa.academia.edu/AaronBenZeev?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11858249/3417728/4019287/s65_aaron.ben-ze_ev.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 254, "name": "Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotion?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9456, "name": "Emotions (Social Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions_Social_Psychology_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12935, "name": "Philosophy Of Freedom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Freedom?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16740, "name": "Polyamory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Polyamory?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18900, "name": "Philosophy of Love", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Love?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 20453, "name": "Culture Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_Change?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 21281, "name": "Moral emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moral_emotions?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 26949, "name": "Phenomenology of Temporality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Temporality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 42162, "name": "Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 48174, "name": "Temporality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 49779, "name": "Theories of Love", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Love?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 50767, "name": "Ambivalence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ambivalence?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 92257, "name": "Freedom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Freedom?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 145781, "name": "Romantic love", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romantic_love?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 199756, "name": "Romantic Jealousy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romantic_Jealousy?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 586389, "name": "Casual Sex", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Casual_Sex?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 705905, "name": "Love and Relationships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Love_and_Relationships?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 79584744, "title": "Presidential speeches and the online politics of belonging: Affective-discursive positions toward refugees in Finland and Estonia", "created_at": "2022-05-21T06:32:59.342-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79584744/Presidential_speeches_and_the_online_politics_of_belonging_Affective_discursive_positions_toward_refugees_in_Finland_and_Estonia?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_79584744", "summary": "The so-called \u2018refugee crisis\u2019 has added urgency to the social dynamics of inclusion and exclusion in European societies.

With enough money, you could get a taste of the city without ever setting foot on its streets. \u2013Nalo Hopkinson, Brown Girl in the Ring1", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86015656, "asset_id": 79231418, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4919665, "first_name": "Beth", "last_name": "Currans", "domain_name": "emich", "page_name": "BethCurrans", "display_name": "Beth Currans", "profile_url": "https://emich.academia.edu/BethCurrans?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4919665/2121421/2491774/s65_beth.currans.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 272, "name": "Social Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Geography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2337, "name": "Performance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5737, "name": "Autoethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autoethnography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 8400, "name": "Cultural Encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Encounters?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 9517, "name": "Protest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Protest?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 58525, "name": "Ruins", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ruins?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 147191, "name": "Bicycles", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bicycles?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 196390, "name": "Post Industrial City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post_Industrial_City?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 279642, "name": "Detroit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Detroit?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 432914, "name": "Tours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tours?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 635134, "name": "Slutwalk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Slutwalk?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1534295, "name": "Ruin Porn", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ruin_Porn?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 76279090, "title": "Communities of Absence: Emotions, Time, and Buddhism in the Creation of Belonging", "created_at": "2022-04-12T21:09:59.197-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/76279090/Communities_of_Absence_Emotions_Time_and_Buddhism_in_the_Creation_of_Belonging?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_76279090", "summary": "This article argues that belonging can be characterized by absence.

Based on fourteen months of ethnographic research in and around for-profit international schools in Cairo, it focuses on how this privileged youth group constructed, experienced and enacted belonging at the intersection between class and nation. I argue that internationally educated Egyptians were caught in a cultural bind between competing constructions of class and national belonging. On the one hand, globally-oriented socialization practices and international education reproduced a historically-specific and colonially-inspired configuration of social distinction that linked elite belonging to a cosmopolitan-inflected distance from local culture. On the other hand, these markers of elite belonging excluded internationally educated youth from a materially embodied conception of Egyptianness that tied national belonging to essentialist constructions of local culture and identity. I suggest that the tension between class and national belonging expressed a single dialectical process that was rooted in colonial binary conceptualizations of culture and difference, which split \u2018elite\u2019 and \u2018local\u2019 into mutually exclusive cultural and symbolic repertoires. My analysis challenges dominant theoretical approaches that conflate the reproduction of class and nation by exposing the educational, gendered and linguistic gaps between class and national culture in contemporary Egypt. I present a bottom-up approach to understanding national attachment that highlights the embodied and moral labor that goes into the production of local selfhood in a transnational postcolonial setting. This approach also shows the differential gendered dynamics of class and national reproduction. The burden of maintaining cosmopolitan-inflected class boundaries falls squarely on the girls while boys are expected to embody the nationally-inflected skills and dispositions necessary for personal and professional trajectories that transcend class boundaries. In telling this story, I expose the sociohistorical dynamic by which colonial/postcolonial categories are reconfigured through globally-oriented class practices and highlight the unexpected ways that neoliberal globalism can become the incubator for intensely and irreducibly local gender and cultural norms.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6291780, "first_name": "Noha", "last_name": "Roushdy", "domain_name": "bu", "page_name": "NRoushdy", "display_name": "Noha Roushdy", "profile_url": "https://bu.academia.edu/NRoushdy?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6291780/2578256/12842769/s65_noha.roushdy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4976, "name": "International Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Education?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 12537, "name": "Egypt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Egypt?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 24775, "name": "Anthropology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 30086, "name": "Critical sociology and politics of education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_sociology_and_politics_of_education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 42694, "name": "Elite education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elite_education?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 44765, "name": "International Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Schools?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 79374, "name": "School Choice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Choice?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 88022, "name": "Sociology of elites", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_elites?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 442978, "name": "Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Schooling?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 525574, "name": "Elites Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elites_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1685425, "name": "YOUTH, EDUCATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/YOUTH_EDUCATION_AND_SENSE_OF_BELONGING?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2448472, "name": "National Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2981505, "name": "Global Middle Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Middle_Class?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 72486462, "title": "Beyond Victims and Cultural Mediators.

on the rationale and purpose of transnational housing initiatives and so-called remittance houses have been published over the past two decades. Still missing, though, is a framework to illustrate the conceptual value of researching these buildings and their ways of mediating the relationships between movers and stayers. With a view to this, the article illustrates what remittance houses 'do' to narrow down the gaps that emerge-in space, time, status, and knowledge-between migrants and their communities of origin. As our fieldwork with Ecuadorian migrants in Europe and their left-behind counterparts shows, remittance houses are more than investments, or resources for migrants' emotional attachment and dreams of return. They are also central to the negotiation of class, status and belonging, and to the very interplay between housing and home along the course of migration. As 'agents' in themselves, these houses shape the transnational connections between distant and disparate places, and the circulation of home-related ideas and practices across them. Over time, they embody a variety of meanings and expectations that, unlike the buildings, are far from fixed or immobile.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68660257, "asset_id": 50793745, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4308065, "first_name": "Paolo", "last_name": "Boccagni", "domain_name": "unitn", "page_name": "PaoloBoccagni", "display_name": "Paolo Boccagni", "profile_url": "https://unitn.academia.edu/PaoloBoccagni?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4308065/2806980/18323385/s65_paolo.boccagni.jpg"}, {"id": 137112616, "first_name": "Luis Eduardo", "last_name": "Perez Murcia", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "LuisEduardoPerezMurcia", "display_name": "Luis Eduardo Perez Murcia", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/LuisEduardoPerezMurcia?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/137112616/50546579/38576715/s65_luis_eduardo.perez_murcia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9521, "name": "Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Housing?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17439, "name": "Ecuador", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecuador?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 54939, "name": "Remittances", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Remittances?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1028140, "name": "Homemaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homemaking?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 49283998, "title": "My lost Lithuanian home: An autobiographical essay on belonging and not belonging", "created_at": "2021-06-18T09:52:10.607-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49283998/My_lost_Lithuanian_home_An_autobiographical_essay_on_belonging_and_not_belonging?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_49283998", "summary": "This Working Paper can be accessed in full here: https://erchoming.files.wordpress.com/2021/06/ homing-wp_robin-cohen_pb.pdf \nThe paper is posted on a site called HOMinG which has many resources on the themes of belonging, migration and identity.

ISSN # 0160-2601. \n______________________________________________________________\nA multitude of diverse attributes is required for effective urban performance at various scales ranging from the immediate context of public buildings to central urban spaces, and from urban corridors to residential neighbourhoods. Following their earlier works (GRIERSON, 2014; MUNRO and GRIERSON, 2016; SALAMA, 2011; SALAMA and WIEDMANN, 2013; and SALAMA et al., 2016) the guest editors frame these qualities under a cycle of three main symbiotic pillars: the imagined, the measured, and the experienced, which contribute to the development of insights that elucidate various parameters for exploring urban performance. These three pillars stem from the Lefebvrian arguments and his theory on the production of space, which postulates a triadic relationship of three different but related types of spaces: the conceived (Imagined), the perceived (measured) and the lived (experienced). \n\nPrimarily, Lefebvre de\ufb01ned \u2018conceived space\u2019 as the space which is theorised by scientists and planners, known as \u2018representations of space\u2019, representations that are intangible and are entrenched in the principles, imperatives, beliefs and visions of experts, decision makers, and those who are in a position to impose their personal notion of \u2018order\u2019 onto concrete reality. The second is \u2018perceived space\u2019, the space of \u2018spatial practice\u2019 de\ufb01ned as the space where movement and interaction takes place, where networks develop and materialise. Consequently, it includes both daily routines at an individual level and urban realities such as the networks that link places designated for work, leisure and \u2018private\u2019 life (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 38). The third is \u2018lived space\u2019, which is explained as the unconscious, non-verbal direct relation between people and space. This is the space that is occupied through associated images and symbols (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 39). The current body of knowledge on Lefebvre\u2019s work suggests that the \u2018conceived space\u2019 is abstract and tactical and where authority functions, the \u2018perceived space\u2019 is a pragmatic, physical space encompassing flows of investment, workforce, and information and that this where the conceived and lived spaces are construed. Salama and Wiedmann (2013) suggest that the \u2018lived space\u2019 is the most subjective space, involving the actual experience of individuals that is performed in the \u2018perceived space\u2019 and as a result of the \u2018conceived space\u2019. \n\nIn our call for papers, the premise was that contributions to this issue of Open House International (OHI) would address the way in which decision-making processes, led by policy makers and discipline experts, contribute to successful urban environments; how the social and spatial practices of key actors (investors, developers, and users) manifest diverse urban activities; and how users attach to places and identify with their surroundings as a basis for social and spatial justice. Contributions were expected to address one of the three pillars while offering implications on the other two.  In response we have received more than 40 abstracts, and subsequently identified 19 for further development into full papers towards submission for review.

The first relies on narratives of \u2018true love\u2019 that foreground sentiment and long term relationships. The second, contrasting approach employs narratives of deceptive, \u2018cunning love\u2019 motivated by economic interest that reinforce the tourist-Cuban divide. Drawing on fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in Cuba between 2005 and 2016, the chapter highlights the moral foundations of these two approaches, uncovering their contextual emergence, meaningful coexistence, and implications. The analysis reveals the competing subjectivities and spheres of belonging that Cubans and tourists navigate, shedding light on the stakes, challenges and opportunities of \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018cunning\u2019 love in these relationships across difference and inequality.

Irizar, studying the bishop of Hippo\u2019s vast collection of texts, brilliantly reveals the finely interwoven tapestry of Augustine's reflections on the idea of 'the image of God' developed over the course of his life. This tapestry illustrates the truth of humanity, the Church, and ourselves, and shows us a path we could follow to be consoled. Irizar's excellent insight and steady reading of the texts thoroughly illuminates each thread of this tapestry, bringing it before our eyes. Blessed are all those who see the light by reading this book.\u201d \u2014 Makiko Sato, Tokyo Gakugei University, Japan\n\n\u201cWhat is the meaning of belonging and relationship within the Christian community in a time of pandemic? This book offers insights to help guide us in this present crisis, insights gathered from the works and thought of Augustine, where he proposes a mystical belonging through love in Christ\u2019s Body.\u201d \u2014 Enrique A. Eguiarte, Augustinaum, Italy\n\n\u201cThis book wrestles with the fundamental questions of the human relation to God and the world. In so doing, Irizar brings forward Augustine's thought on the church in a thoughtful, creative, and timely manner to address spiritual, ethical, and social concerns central to us today.\u201d \u2014 Matthew Drever, The University of Tulsa, USA\n\n\u201cThis meticulously researched and well-informed book gives a clear account of Augustine's theology of belonging. Dr. Irizar's work is an enormously important addition to the field of Augustinian ecclesiology.\u201d \u2014 Kolawole Chabi, Augustinianum, Italy\n\n\"This is a fascinating and important contribution to the understanding of the communion of the Church in a time of crisis.

After decades of violence in their homeland, hundreds of thousands have fled into refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border. Over 73,000 Karen have been resettled in the United States. Karen youth in urban areas of the United States have been participating in traditional Karen dance, practicing and performing regularly. This study explored the reasons Karen youth choose to engage in this activity. Interviews were conducted and were analyzed using grounded theory qualitative research methods that were constructivist in nature. One over-arching theme, \"If You Don't Know Your Culture, You Don't Know Who You Are\", and four sub-themes emerged from the data. Results demonstrate that group members are highly invested in maintaining their social engagement with their Karen community and find strength in Karen identity maintenance. This study demonstrates that those forced to migrate to a foreign country may face challenges to their sense of identity and belonging when immersed in a society that is unfamiliar to them. Local agencies can play an important role in the adaptation process by facilitating participation in meaningful activities that provide in-group social connections and opportunities to participate in familiar culturally relevant activities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64739284, "asset_id": 44346587, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 172377759, "first_name": "Societies", "last_name": "MDPI", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SocietiesMDPI", "display_name": "Societies MDPI", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SocietiesMDPI?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/172377759/47909471/36546384/s65_societies.mdpi.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 294, "name": "Ethnic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1556, "name": "Dance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 29167, "name": "Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dance?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 33745, "name": "Traditional dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_dance?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 96552, "name": "Refugee", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1619523, "name": "Cultural Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Traditions?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 44111786, "title": "Looking Back, Moving Forward: Reflection on Race and Racism", "created_at": "2020-09-17T21:26:30.855-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44111786/Looking_Back_Moving_Forward_Reflection_on_Race_and_Racism?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_44111786", "summary": "This paper addresses the history of racism, its manifestation and its impact.

Conside-ramos que el citado texto condensa los aspectos fundamentales del problema, muchos de ellos ya presen-tes en Fenomenolog\u00eda de la percepci\u00f3n, aunque ahora renovados por el abandono del punto de vista de la conciencia. Ante planteos filos\u00f3ficos que piensan el sentido de la alteridad como aquello que, por su dife-rencia radical, no puede tener una inscripci\u00f3n mundana, Merleau-Ponty propone pensar el mundo como provisto de una profundidad infinitamente participable. Es en este sentido que el problema de alteridad ser\u00e1 tributario de una ontolog\u00eda en la que se combinan dos l\u00f3gicas \u00edntimamente entrelazadas: la pertenencia sensible a un terreno general y el proceso de diferenciaci\u00f3n por medio de la palabra (parole).

The running of herds over mountain pastures was organized by state entities (kolkhozes and sovkhozes) and the great majority of animals were effectively state-owned. The state system maintained roads and vehicles for livestock transport, the provision of veterinary services, and the marketing of wool and meat, as well as the provision for the other needs of Kyrgyz pastoralists' livelihoods. Today, the pastoral landscape is scattered with the ruins of large livestock shelters, the doors and roofs of which have been pilfered for the needs of a much more small-scale, privately organized economy. As ownership of livestock and machinery passed to private hands in the mid-1990s, there was initially a catastrophic collapse of livestock herding as a basis of livelihood for most herders. As communities sought to reconstruct their future in the absence of the reliable state, their sense of belonging shifted from state entities to traditional concepts of relatedness remembered from their primordial past. Yet while the initial privatization was organized on the premise that collectivities based on extended kinship would replace the state organization, this proved unworkable in many ways. Such collectivities then fragmented and livelihoods became organized around families in the narrower sense. Thus, in a twenty year period, Kyrgyz herders have shifted from relying on the state organization of their lives, to an unstable primordial kinship, and now to a new set of orienting principles which hinge on complex assessments of what can assure the future. In this paper, based on fieldwork in Nar\u00efn Province, we will examine how these transformations have taken place in pastoral livelihoods, as well as the challenges that have emerged in this environment of rapidly changing belonging in relation to livelihoods, kinship and the state. A sense of belonging is commonly thought of as being forged from common historical experiences and enduring kinds of closeness in the present. What this description misses is the way in which claims to-and feelings of-belonging are also oriented towards a future. The lack of future, as Pierre Bourdieu has noted, is perhaps the most painful of wants. (Bourdieu 2000: 221) If the desirable future seems blurred, if there is no sense of purpose in life, no imaginable path towards an achievable future, then action itself loses its meaning. We argue that people's sense of belongings and desirable futures are mutually constitutive. This relationship has largely been neglected in the social sciences in favor of studying belonging in relation to the past. The ethnographies in this collection; however, demonstrate that people actively operate on their sense of fragility and fixity, opportunity and insecurity to make livable futures and co-existences. In this special issue, F\u00e9aux de la Croix describes, for example, how a Kyrgyz dam worker chose to educate his children entirely in Russian in the late Soviet era. We focus on ideas of belonging in conjunction with imaginations of-and attempts to build-desirable futures in Kyrgyzstan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, which offered not only pragmatic guarantees of future welfare, but also a vision of utopia to work towards, Kyrgyzstani citizens were forced to recast their pasts and futures. What are the practical and conceptual tools through which a livable future is articulated and worked upon? Since the upsurge in inter-ethnic violence in 2010, what changes in such orientations can be traced? And how can we explore, ethnographically, the ways in which imaginations of the Anthropology of East Europe Review 32(2) Fall 2014 1", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61484779, "asset_id": 41264321, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 945382, "first_name": "Aksana", "last_name": "Ismailbekova", "domain_name": "zmo", "page_name": "AksanaIsmailbekova", "display_name": "Aksana Ismailbekova", "profile_url": "https://zmo.academia.edu/AksanaIsmailbekova?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/945382/607221/754301/s65_aksana.ismailbekova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2727, "name": "Welfare State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Welfare_State?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17581, "name": "Futures Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Futures_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47503, "name": "Kinship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kinship?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49648, "name": "Livelihood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Livelihood?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 62196, "name": "Kyrgyzstan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kyrgyzstan?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 4930869, "title": "Home and Back Again: Texts and Contexts in Turkish Immigrant Theater in France", "created_at": "2013-10-29T19:33:03.152-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4930869/Home_and_Back_Again_Texts_and_Contexts_in_Turkish_Immigrant_Theater_in_France?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_4930869", "summary": "This article argues that the public space of theater in an immigrant language can contribute to making immigrants and their offspring feel at home in the host country. In France, however, there is little public support for theater in immigrant languages, since it is perceived as segregating immigrants from French cultural spaces and encouraging communautarisme, or the fragmentation of society along ethnic or religious lines, thus violating the spirit of equality inscribed in the constitution. Through interviews with the Turkish-French theater group Kebab Show and analysis of their plays, this paper argues that what anti-communautaristes see as theater intended to segregate immigrant communities may instead contribute to making them at home in France. For older members of the community, native-language theater provides a bridge between the country of origin and France. For their children and grandchildren born in France, this native-language theater publicly acknowledges a part of themselves that is usually relegated to private home spaces. Filled with word play and humorous situations that require knowledge of both Turkish and French cultures, such theater suggests the important role that native and bilingual theater can play in the process of helping all the generations of an immigrant community feel at home.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37533768, "asset_id": 4930869, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 84432, "first_name": "Annedith (Aninne)", "last_name": "Schneider", "domain_name": "khas", "page_name": "AnnedithAninneSchneider", "display_name": "Annedith (Aninne) Schneider", "profile_url": "https://khas.academia.edu/AnnedithAninneSchneider?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/84432/23513/35863600/s65_annedith_aninne_.schneider.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1629, "name": "French Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29102, "name": "Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 789528, "name": "Turks in europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turks_in_europe?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1670472, "name": "Turks in France", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Turks_in_France?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 39150363, "title": "Sweet Home Chicago?

The pseudonym reflects the complex entanglement of the place\u2019s pre-colonial heritage with the post-colonial reality in which Afrikaans is the most spoken language in the area. The Afrikaans word dorp (\u2018town\u2019) embodies the colonial history of which Afrikaans itself is a product. It is found that residents have created emic place identities depending on things like how recently they or their families arrived in the town and how many generations their ancestral connection reaches back. Through a discourse analysis of interview narratives, it is found that these new identities can be traced back to historical struggles to belong, resistance to newcomers, and discourses of authenticity. The argument is made that in-migration contributed to how residents position themselves and others as authentic or marginal, and in the process created various embodied place identities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57524934, "asset_id": 37549538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140289, "first_name": "Yolandi", "last_name": "Ribbens-Klein", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "YolandiRibbensKlein", "display_name": "Yolandi Ribbens-Klein", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/YolandiRibbensKlein?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140289/86214/20738472/s65_yolandi.ribbens-klein.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25270, "name": "Afrikaans (Language and Literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrikaans_Language_and_Literature_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 35849430, "title": "Reflections on place, mobility and belonging in Gujarat", "created_at": "2018-02-06T00:50:26.400-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35849430/Reflections_on_place_mobility_and_belonging_in_Gujarat?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_35849430", "summary": "This article translates four essays from the memoirs of Gujarati writer Sharifa Vijaliwala that are replete with sociological insights.

I argue that chutney soca reveals a politics of un-belonging in Trinidad and its Canadian diaspora, in contrast to a Carnival rhetoric that celebrates national belonging, as Indo-Caribbean communities continue to find their \u201cplace in this world,\u201d one that is never fully black nor fully 'Indian' but always in-between.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 913999, "first_name": "Darrell", "last_name": "Baksh", "domain_name": "sta-uwi", "page_name": "DarrellBaksh", "display_name": "Darrell G Baksh", "profile_url": "https://sta-uwi.academia.edu/DarrellBaksh?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/913999/339488/36177070/s65_darrell.baksh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1056, "name": "Popular Music Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 43251, "name": "Indo-Caribbean Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Caribbean_Diaspora?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 65725, "name": "Indo-Caribbean Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indo-Caribbean_Culture?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 72757, "name": "Race and Ethnic Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnic_Politics?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 76591, "name": "Bhojpuri Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bhojpuri_Diaspora?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 115552, "name": "Trinidad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trinidad?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 137967, "name": "Trinidad and Tobago", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trinidad_and_Tobago?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 287647, "name": "Trinidad Carnival", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trinidad_Carnival?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 298143, "name": "Indians in Trinidad and Tobago", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indians_in_Trinidad_and_Tobago?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 592045, "name": "Hybridity and Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 781173, "name": "Chutney Soca", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chutney_Soca?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2290454, "name": "Chutney Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chutney_Music?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 29874103, "title": "A Bay of Whispers: Seascape in Simone Lazaroo's The Australian Fianc\u00e9", "created_at": "2016-11-15T20:46:00.595-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29874103/A_Bay_of_Whispers_Seascape_in_Simone_Lazaroos_The_Australian_Fianc%C3%A9?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_29874103", "summary": "The ocean as a border in Australia has been gaining increased attention, not only with the arrival of asylum seekers by boat and the relentless government policies to prevent this, but also the connections with Asia that Australia's part of Oceania suggests. Recent scholarship by critics such as Elizabeth DeLoughrey, Suvendrini Perera, and Elizabeth McMahon explore the way representations of oceans can evoke, on the one hand, this doubled sense of insularity and threat, but on the other possibility and connection. However, while some of this analysis may be new and specifically addressing recent events, depictions of the sea that utilize such a doubled sense of intimacy and conflict have a significant history in Australian literature. One such example is Simone Lazaroo's The Australian Fianc\u00e9, a book that deals overtly with the White Australia Policy and the aftermath of WWII. Existing scholarship has tended to focus on the significant discussions around racism, exclusion, and gender in the novel, but as of yet there has been no sustained discussion of the representation of the sea and its relevance to such debates. Rather than being a simple backdrop, the depiction of the sea in Lazaroo's novel manifests the doubled threat and connection discussed by DeLoughrey, Perera, and McMahon.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50341238, "asset_id": 29874103, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56717759, "first_name": "Rosalind", "last_name": "McFarlane", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "RosalindMcFarlane", "display_name": "Rosalind McFarlane", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/RosalindMcFarlane?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56717759/14912149/15677371/s65_rosalind.mcfarlane.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3773, "name": "Literary Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Criticism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8032, "name": "Cross-Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-Cultural_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19064, "name": "Women Writers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_Writers?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25530, "name": "Intimacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intimacy?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 88871, "name": "Feminist Literary Criticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Literary_Criticism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 255793, "name": "Transnationalism, Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism_Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 271756, "name": "Western Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Australia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2570326, "name": "Ocean Imagery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ocean_Imagery?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2570327, "name": "Sea Imagery", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sea_Imagery?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2570328, "name": "Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 29063558, "title": "Fluidity and flexibility of ''belonging'': Uses of the concept in contemporary research", "created_at": "2016-10-10T23:10:42.124-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29063558/Fluidity_and_flexibility_of_belonging_Uses_of_the_concept_in_contemporary_research?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_29063558", "summary": "Studies framing ''belonging'' as a key focus and a central concept of research have increased significantly in the 2000s.

It takes a migrant-centred approach to its discussion to reflect the relationship between assumptions of integration and institutional, socio-cultural and socio-economic dimensions. This highlights colonial transnational practices that continue to inform migrants' everyday lives. The article shows how migrants' understanding of education as a vital component of social mobility and status is attributed to the legacy of British colonial administration. This means that, for Ugandans, the process of adaptation in the UK comes with a different set of connotations, as this heritage remains of key significance to migrants' expectations. Important dimensions to the interfaces between transnationalism and integration are shown to be labour-market participation and immigration status.

Though the formation of one&amp;#39;s identity and constructions of belonging (familial/national/cultural/political) are the central concems of the novel, they are recast in magical realist terms to question the primacy of certain hegemonic paradigms. The inherent duality of magical realism also motivates a reexamination of the position of women in transnational contexts, effectively overcoming the sort of lack of cultural and historical understanding and awareness that characterises representations of female experience across the world. Specifically, Garcia warns of the dangers of rigid ideologies and boundaries that are divorced: from conditions in the real world but to which the modem world is in thrall. To counter this, the author presents a family chronicle that facilitates and validates alternative (female) spaces, histories, stories and perspectives, without attempting to write a definitive version.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46697252, "first_name": "Anja", "last_name": "Mrak", "domain_name": "uni-lj", "page_name": "AnjaMrak", "display_name": "Anja Mrak", "profile_url": "https://uni-lj.academia.edu/AnjaMrak?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/46697252/115184420/104468795/s65_anja.mrak.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12558, "name": "Magical Realism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Magical_Realism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23305, "name": "Transnational Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Feminism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 75647, "name": "Interactions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interactions?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 2952280, "name": "Cristina Garcia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cristina_Garcia?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 63948983, "title": "Boundaries of displacement : Belonging and Return among Forcibly Displaced Young Georgians from Abkhazia", "created_at": "2021-12-13T00:31:40.875-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63948983/Boundaries_of_displacement_Belonging_and_Return_among_Forcibly_Displaced_Young_Georgians_from_Abkhazia?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_63948983", "summary": "This dissertation explores the implications of borders and boundaries for how forcibly displaced young Georgians from Abkhazia understand issues of belonging and return.

Specifically, we explored the impact of race-based rejection sensitivity on well-being, and whether cultural identity clarity could help curtail any negative effects. Hypothesis 1 was that race-based rejection sensitivity would be negatively associated with well-being. Hypothesis 2 was that cultural identity clarity would moderate the association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being such that Latino/a immigrants lower in cultural identity clarity would experience poorer well-being than those higher in cultural identity clarity. Method: A community sample of Latino/a immigrants (N \u03ed 136; M age \u03ed 38.21; 51.47% female) completed a survey including measures of race-based rejection sensitivity, cultural identity clarity, bicultural stress, selfesteem, and life satisfaction. Results: Correlation and regression analyses revealed that race-based rejection sensitivity was negatively associated with well-being. Additionally, high cultural identity clarity attenuated the negative association between race-based rejection sensitivity and well-being. Conclusion: Results of the present study suggest maintaining clarity over their heritage cultures postimmigration can be beneficial to Latino/a immigrants in Canada, in particular when they are sensitive to cues of racial discrimination.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75502001, "asset_id": 62878267, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

study explored social capital theory by investigating the relationship between enterprise social media use (ESM) as measured by an adapted instrument and employee belongingness as measured by the balanced measure of psychological needs (BMPN) scale of employees in USA, moderated by generational age groups. A survey of 155 employees from US corporations was conducted. The results support the theoretical model of social capital as well as three hypothesized relationships. While there was no significant relation between Social-related ESM use and employee belongingness, there was a statistically significant relationship between Work-related ESM use, age generation groups, and employee belongingness. Overall, Generation-X employees showed a higher belongingness score compared to Millennials, and even higher compared to Generation-Z employees. The results indicate that using an internal social media technology for work-related purposes can help employees feel that they belong and are a part of the social makeup of the organization. Work related social media use can also foster greater organizational social capital such as team building resulting in the achievement of organizational objectives and goals. These findings offer implications for research on social capital's value as an asset for the organization as well as enterprise social media's ongoing and ever-increasing value.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68119889, "asset_id": 49955970, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 194295010, "first_name": "Dr. Franklin", "last_name": "Lartey", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DrFranklinLartey", "display_name": "Dr. Franklin Lartey", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DrFranklinLartey?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/194295010/56814315/45025041/s65_dr._franklin.lartey.png"}, {"id": 145213157, "first_name": "Phillip", "last_name": "Randall", "domain_name": "capella", "page_name": "PhillipRandall", "display_name": "Phillip M .

It implements and develops conditional belonging in the setting of everyday life by examining female fans of science fiction. Based on 30 in-depth interviews with female fans of Doctor Who and Star Wars, this study defines conditional belonging as a liminal state in which new members are constructed as a threatening \"other\" and required to demonstrate conformity to the community. Having to align with values established by veteran members disrupts the ability of those who conditionally belong to perceive their identities as authentic. Conditional belonging is explored in offline and online settings, exposing the tactics used online by female fans to ensure their belonging. Through demonstrating the ways in which conditional belonging is cultivated and enforced, this article contributes to a nuanced understanding of belonging, not as a binary condition, but a multi-layered, complex one.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64895910, "asset_id": 44468189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29858138, "first_name": "Neta", "last_name": "Yodovich", "domain_name": "haifa", "page_name": "NetaYodovich", "display_name": "Neta Yodovich", "profile_url": "https://haifa.academia.edu/NetaYodovich?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15595, "name": "Fandom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fandom?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24593, "name": "Doctor Who", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Doctor_Who?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1299937, "name": "Female Fans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Female_Fans?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41705992, "title": "Where is Home for Hybrid Bodies in-between Worlds?", "created_at": "2020-01-22T16:32:17.420-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41705992/Where_is_Home_for_Hybrid_Bodies_in_between_Worlds?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_41705992", "summary": "Where is home?

At the same time, both thinkers emphasized the situated, historical and finite character of reason. In so doing they demonstrated their non-conformity with the modern model of science and knowledge, which is dependent on a representationalist metaphysics that has led to a subjectobject dichotomy regarding both knowledge and our access to the world. This vision gives rise to problems that are, in reality, artificial, as is the case with he realism-idealism debate. This article shows that the Gadamerian idea of belonging makes the dissolution of this problem possible.\r\n\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56591981, "asset_id": 36264496, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50476245, "first_name": "Carmen", "last_name": "Segura", "domain_name": "ucm", "page_name": "CarmenSegura", "display_name": "Carmen  Segura", "profile_url": "https://ucm.academia.edu/CarmenSegura?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9302, "name": "Understanding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Understanding?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 144857, "name": "Event", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Event?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1292432, "name": "Anti-realism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti-realism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2956406, "name": "Subject-Object Dichotomy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subject-Object_Dichotomy?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 33447677, "title": "Vital Signs 2015: Belonging - Exploring Connection to Community", "created_at": "2017-06-13T18:58:25.020-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33447677/Vital_Signs_2015_Belonging_Exploring_Connection_to_Community?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_33447677", "summary": "Community Foundations of Canada's 2015 national Vital Signs report, Belonging: Exploring Connection to Community, looks back over the past 50 years at our sense of belonging and where we as communities and a country are going next leading up to Canada\u2019s sesquicentennial in 2017 and beyond. \n\nIn this presentation, Ainsley Hawthorn, Executive Director of the Community Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, gives an overview of the findings of the national report at NL's 2015 Vital Signs launch event.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 903668, "first_name": "Ainsley", "last_name": "Hawthorn", "domain_name": "yale", "page_name": "AinsleyHawthorn", "display_name": "Ainsley  Hawthorn", "profile_url": "https://yale.academia.edu/AinsleyHawthorn?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/903668/1759245/104108274/s65_ainsley.hawthorn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 381, "name": "Canadian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canadian_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47452, "name": "Public Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Engagement?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54114, "name": "Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canada?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 479098, "name": "University-Community Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/University-Community_Engagement?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 510641, "name": "Community-University Partnerships", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community-University_Partnerships?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 631854, "name": "Community Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Knowledge?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 31779462, "title": "A Longitudinal Analysis of Belonging: Temporal, Performative and Relational Practices by Young People in Rural Australia", "created_at": "2017-03-08T18:03:22.531-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31779462/A_Longitudinal_Analysis_of_Belonging_Temporal_Performative_and_Relational_Practices_by_Young_People_in_Rural_Australia?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_31779462", "summary": "This article looks at how young people construct belonging over time in rural places in Australia.

In the school space, a multiplicity of social, economic and political relationships are sustained, which enhance the vitality of the community. As such, the relationship between small schools and communities is often presented as a powerful one; however, too often as a harmonious, natural and simple construction. This paper article argues that when education, youth and communities are defined through apparently simple, universal, natural and neutral conceptualizations, these are commonly based on prescribed norms that reflect the dominant values of an hegemonic majority. These homogeneous and universal conceptualizations of education, youth and community serve to legitimize processes of inequality and marginalization, and to undermine the goals these aim to contribute to. This article draws from disciplines such sociology of youth, education, rural studies and political theory to problematize the relationship between small schools and communities in rural spaces by analyzing the intersection of education and youth policies, as constructed by neoliberal policies, and the idea of community as presented by communitarians. It argues for the need to rethink the relationship between small schools and communities towards a more plural and socially just one that overcomes processes of exclusion and marginalization.\n\nLes petites \u00e9coles sont souvent au centre des communaut\u00e9s rurales.

Cet article soutient que lorsque l\u2019\u00e9ducation, les jeunes et les communaut\u00e9s sont d\u00e9finis par des conceptualisations apparemment simples, universelles, naturelles et neutres, celles-ci sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fond\u00e9es sur des normes qui refl\u00e8tent les valeurs dominantes d\u2019une majorit\u00e9 h\u00e9g\u00e9monique. Ces conceptualisations homog\u00e8nes et universelles de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, les jeunes et les communaut\u00e9s viennent l\u00e9gitimer les processus d\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 et de marginalisation, et compromettent les objectifs auxquels ils voudraient contribuer.

Research-based evidence has shown that many of them are not interested in politics like the youth of yesteryears. This trend has been described as \" youth de-politisation \" or youth political disengagement. Young people are said to now find comfort in pleasure and \" protest politics \" which often do not lead them to political positions in government or in governance institutions. Some researchers have thus described them as a \" protest generation \" in contrast to the \" political generation \" of their parents and grandparents. This could have crucial political implications in the future, more so because a large proportion of the world \" s population today consists of young people as the UN has documented. This paper thus seeks to examine these political implications (which have received little attention from researchers) from two theoretical perspectives: political science and youth studies. Questions as to whether this alleged growing youth de-politisation is jeopardizing or will jeopardize future democracy and governance, especially from the point of view of competent political leadership, or if it is merely a replacement of traditional and/or institutional forms of politics by young people with new patterns of expression and participation that some researchers term \" juventization \" , is examined. The cause(s) of this de-politisation is also looked into, and suggestions about youth participation in the future are made.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42536179, "asset_id": 21766104, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 32768897, "first_name": "Frank", "last_name": "Ndukwe", "domain_name": "jyu", "page_name": "FrankNdukwe", "display_name": "Frank Ndukwe", "profile_url": "https://jyu.academia.edu/FrankNdukwe?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/32768897/11100598/12387820/s65_frank.ndukwe.jpg_oh_4ad220142609e78526fd8f1668483221_oe_571da9b0"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14045, "name": "African Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Politics?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 39356, "name": "Translocality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translocality?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 336817, "name": "African immigrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_immigrants?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 817697, "name": "Youth and Political participantion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_and_Political_participantion?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 14504292, "title": "\u2018This is my home\u2019: Pakistani and Polish migrants\u2019 return considerations as articulations about \u2018home\u2019", "created_at": "2015-07-30T01:25:12.562-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14504292/_This_is_my_home_Pakistani_and_Polish_migrants_return_considerations_as_articulations_about_home_?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_14504292", "summary": "Considerations about return are a persistent dimension of identity work in migrant populations. The question of where and what constitutes \u2018home\u2019 for migrants is central to understanding processes of integration, sustained transnational ties, and return considerations, because reflections about \u2018home\u2019 are reflective of belonging. Based on analysis of migrants\u2019 and descendants reflections about the possibility of return migration, this paper asks: how is \u2018home\u2019 located in the transnational social field, and in which ways do the mutually overlapping spatial, temporal, emotional and rational dimensions of home matter? The paper draws on semi-structured interviews and focus groups with a total of 75 migrants and descendants from Pakistan and Poland living in Norway. Data from the two migrant groups with distinct migration histories are combined. Perhaps surprisingly, more similarities than differences are found between the two groups, with regard to their reflections about belonging. Considerations about return are found to be revealing of changing perspectives on home. For many there is an inherent ambivalence, reflected in home being located here, or there, or both, or neither. However, both migrants\u2019 and descendants exert agency in their own ways of locating \u2018home\u2019 and managing the spatial, temporal, emotional and rational dimensions involved.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38332870, "asset_id": 14504292, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8713070, "first_name": "Marta Bivand", "last_name": "Erdal", "domain_name": "prio", "page_name": "MartaBivandErdal", "display_name": "Marta Bivand Erdal", "profile_url": "https://prio.academia.edu/MartaBivandErdal?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8713070/2888671/3374371/s65_marta_bivand.erdal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7361, "name": "Pakistan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pakistan?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 14476857, "title": "Three Views of a Secret.

In this particular group, a narrative of the past\u2014that of their service in the Red Army during WWII\u2014is the central symbolic resource mobilized in forging an identity of honor and esteem within the host society and in constructing their narrative of inclusion. By observing the present circumstances of the elderly immigrants' lives and exploring their pasts in light of sociopolitical factors and social memory frames of the former and host societies, the article demonstrates how a soldiering identity serves the veterans in restoring the rupture between past and present.

Australian identity. Oral history theatre was used to facilitate a process whereby the young people were able to reconnect with their personal family histories, encounter Aboriginal young people and stories, and together interview Aboriginal Elders. Through this process, they could develop new understandings of their own social identities, and meanings of and possibilities for belonging. \u2018Centring diverse lives, decentring whiteness\u2019 and \u2018a different starting point: Aboriginal ways of knowing\u2019, were the two key outcomes that we report on. Bringing people from diverse cultural and social backgrounds together to share stories of history, culture and identity, offers a unique vantage point from which to rupture dominant narratives about belonging/non-belonging and show up whiteness, and together forge a new Australian identity reflective of everyday multiculturalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 134981, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Sonn", "domain_name": "vu", "page_name": "ChristopherSonn", "display_name": "Christopher Sonn", "profile_url": "https://vu.academia.edu/ChristopherSonn?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/134981/59753/35273356/s65_christopher.sonn.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 12189, "name": "Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identities?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 16069, "name": "Critical Race Theory and Whiteness theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory_and_Whiteness_theory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 30439, "name": "Critical Whiteness Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Whiteness_Studies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 49664, "name": "Oral History and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_History_and_Memory?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 87634, "name": "Participatory Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_Theatre?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 125925, "name": "Whiteness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Whiteness?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 161968, "name": "Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Displacement?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 79189201, "title": "Coming from Somewhere Else: Group engagement between students and academics", "created_at": "2022-05-15T21:18:09.578-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/79189201/Coming_from_Somewhere_Else_Group_engagement_between_students_and_academics?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_79189201", "summary": "The present political and economic climate for universities can promote competitive learning and anxieties about individual students&#39; academic achievements.

Our analysis of qualitative interviews with regional residents on different temporary visas and local employers and service providers shows that many temporary residents in regional locations develop a feeling of place-based belonging grounded in social relations and shared cultural affiliations as well as the efforts of local stakeholders who are keen to retain mig...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76103687, "asset_id": 63801731, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44500560, "first_name": "Martina", "last_name": "Boese", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MBoese", "display_name": "Martina Boese", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MBoese?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44500560/30783703/28488441/s65_martina.boese.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7453, "name": "Rural Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Development?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 74603, "name": "Migration policies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_policies?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 124587, "name": "Temporary migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporary_migration?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 63302019, "title": "Romov\u00e9 jako m\u00edstn\u00ed obyvatel\u00e9?

Belonging, Gypsyness, and the Politics of Space in an eastern Slovak village abstract: Based on long-term ethnographic research in one eastern Slovak village, this paper explores the complex issue of the role of place in the (self-) identification of Roma. Applying both a diachronic and a synchronic perspective, the author focuses on the mechanisms of the territorialisation of the Roma that led to the preservation of the historical continuity of the Romani settlement and to its territorial stigmatisation. He shows how local identification and position in the residential structure of the village studied here translated into a more enduring differentiation among Roma themselves. The author argues that crucial to understanding this process is the racialised category of 'Gypsyness', through which the Roma were singled out as 'less local'. 'Gypsyness' was also strongly associated with the space of the settlement and at the same time served as a generally accepted reason for its very existence. By setting up their own strategy of social mobility and striving to achieve fullfledged local belonging, the Roma, to a large extent, subscribed to the dominant logic of 'Gypsyness' and thus reproduced it, but they also transformed some of its characteristics, integrating it into their own understanding of their sociability in an environment of historically rooted non-Romani dominance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75776845, "asset_id": 63302019, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14025313, "first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Ort", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JanOrt", "display_name": "Jan Ort", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JanOrt?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14025313/4862245/5593958/s65_jan.ort.jpg_oh_95565f6d9a7c65ba5f6e2196bbf533a8_oe_54b5df27___gda___1421561195_00716196e15722e9a18a31d51c49de4f"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11866, "name": "Romani Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romani_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45426, "name": "Central and Eastern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_and_Eastern_Europe?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 58932752, "title": "\u2018I\u2019m not a barcode or case file number\u2019: understandings of perceived social support and belonging within disadvantaged adolescents and young adults", "created_at": "2021-10-18T18:23:41.295-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/58932752/_I_m_not_a_barcode_or_case_file_number_understandings_of_perceived_social_support_and_belonging_within_disadvantaged_adolescents_and_young_adults?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_58932752", "summary": "Perceived social support and a sense of belonging are thought to be protective factors against negative outcomes in adulthood that are commonly associated with childhood adversity.

This research aimed to examine adolescents\u2019 and young adults\u2019 understandings of perceived social support and sense of belonging, as well as their own understandings of their childhood experiences and current outcomes. Participants in the study were 275 adolescents and emerging adults aged between 17 and 24 (mean = 18.82, SD = 1.50), and included 177 females, 99 males, and 2 transgender participants, with 2 participants not disclosing their gender. Convenience sampling from a national group of young people accessing welfare service organisations within Australia was used. Qualitative data was obtained from thirteen open ended questions to an online survey. The study found that this group of adolescents and emerging adults with a history of childhood adversity understood social support and belonging as having someone who listened, as coming from people who surrounded them, and as impacted by their childhood experiences. We argue that support for this group of youth needs to revolve around building positive relationships in order to maximise resilience and wellbeing outcomes.", "downloadable_attachments": [],

Of the total study population, sixty students with low level of mental health were screened using Goldberg\u2019s General Health Questionnaire and randomly included in an intervention and a control group. They filled out Belongingness Scale-Clinical Placement Experience (BES-CPE) as the pre-test. The intervention consisted of eight group counseling sessions (two 2-hour sessions per week) with emphasis on communication skills that were held in their faculty. The final sample included fifty-two students filling out the post-test instruments. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22. Results There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of total score (P < 0.0001) as well as the self-esteem and self-efficacy subscales (P < 0.05).

In line with the globalising trans rights movement \u2013 which is underpinned by (neo)liberalist ideologies around citizenship and identity \u2013 trans people, when faced with precarity, tend to gravitate more toward either gendered assimilation or radical anti-institutionalism (Spade, 2015). This divisiveness is forged by institutional mis/recognition, namely restrictive access to gender-confirming medical technologies, conditional claims to legal gender status, and sociocultural norms around gender identity and bodily sex. Whether conscious or not, political positioning serves to sculpt a space for belonging \u2013 to achieve self-realisation and secure one\u2019s \u2018home\u2019 through community-building (Probyn, 1996). In this chapter, we compare the collected interview narratives of trans people from two national contexts, Norway and Japan. We use narrative analysis (Phoenix, 2013) to analyse the individuals\u2019 modes of political positioning amidst the changing political climate of their respective countries. We explore their modes of meaning-making in addressing feelings of loss or insecurity (Phoenix, 2013), using affect theory with a focus on the ordinary \u2018everydayness\u2019 of life (Berlant, 2011; Aultman, 2018). In doing so, we aim to shed light on how trans people\u2019s experiences and imaginaries of \u2018the good life\u2019 are shaped by sociocultural, historical and political interpretations of what it means to be a national citizen, gendered person and human being in Japan and in Norway. By comparing the two contexts for how trans people view institutional conditions for security and reshape their experiences in restitutive ways, we show how the globalising trans movement\u2019s ideologies are translating into practice in Norway and Japan, and how trans people adapt them in fashioning their own tactics for belonging amidst misrecognition.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 164619242, "first_name": "Kei", "last_name": "Ishimaru", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KeiIshimaru", "display_name": "Kei Ishimaru", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KeiIshimaru?f_ri=53547", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 54762659, "first_name": "france rose", "last_name": "hartline", "domain_name": "ntnu-no", "page_name": "francerosehartline", "display_name": "france rose hartline", "profile_url": "https://ntnu-no.academia.edu/francerosehartline?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/54762659/15604546/36575484/s65_france_rose.hartline.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 387, "name": "Japanese Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Japanese_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7490, "name": "Gender Equality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Equality?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18880, "name": "Narrative Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Analysis?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 51645, "name": "Norway", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Norway?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 103432, "name": "Gender Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Diversity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 3688525, "name": "Gender Legal Recognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Legal_Recognition?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 43096918, "title": "Whose meanings belong?: Marginality and the role of microexclusions in middle school inquiry science", "created_at": "2020-05-18T09:45:32.989-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43096918/Whose_meanings_belong_Marginality_and_the_role_of_microexclusions_in_middle_school_inquiry_science?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_43096918", "summary": "Recent research emphasizing disciplinary identities in the classroom indicates the importance of social interaction and inclusion in the classroom, yet only limited work focuses on how peer-initiated exclusion impacts learners.

The qualitative analyses here involved videorecorded observations for 5 small groups of students participating in a semester-long series of inquiry life science units. A total of 19 observations were analyzed across the 5 groups. Five themes were identified across the groups: individualization or splitting of the group, adversarial interactions within the group, uneven access to regulatory roles within the group, lagging group members, and using diffuse status characteristics to redirect group activity. Results indicate that microexclusions redirect learners' behavior toward managing participation dynamics inside the group at the cost of inclusion and group functioning.

The analysis is based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Spain and Cuba. By focusing on disjunctures between the aspirations and positionings of returnees, and the way in which they are perceived and treated by their fellow nationals in Cuba, I show how identifications and belongings are played out, negotiated, and reframed in these return visits. The experience and assessment of relations with family, friends, and the country more generally leads migrants to rethink the parameters of their \u201cbeing Cuban\u201d and their place in Cuba.

In terms of numbers, rap is clearly not a marginal phenomenon in France. In terms of politics, however, French rap is still often regarded as a music that eschews commercial success in favor of communicating political messages that challenge the status quo. Songs often focus, in particular, on life in urban housing projects on the outskirts of French cities. Unlike U.S. rap, however, they do not usually describe the problems of urban youth in terms of race or ethnicity. In contrast to U.S. rap which is largely associated with African American experience, French rap is anything but ethnically homogenous, perhaps most famously represented by the expression \u201cBlack, Blanc, Beur.\u201d\r\nThis paper will examine the work of rap musicians in France who are the children of Turkish immigrants, the so-called \u201csecond generation.\u201d They were born in France or arrived there at a young age, and all of their education has been in French schools. Yet when they turn to music, they often rap in Turkish or mix of Turkish and French and the identity that they proclaim visually in their clips is more tightly tied to Turkish rather than French identity. Does their critique of their position within French society indicate a desire for belonging, as is the case with many other rap groups, or is their choice of Turkish instead a sign of a rejection of French identity? How do their linguistic choices and the messages of their lyrics place them within the canon of French rap, or on the other hand, indicate their marginalization?

By uniquely applying the lens of family display to migrant family accounts, this article offers a timely new way to understand the strategies migrant families employ when negotiating recognition and validation in an increasingly globalised world. Existing applications of family display focus on what might be referred to as unconventional families: same-sex couples, dual-heritage families, single-parent households, and families living in commercial homes. Furthermore, previous migration studies consider the strategies employed by migrant individuals, sometimes within a family, but do not do so through the lens of family display. The concept has not, then, been applied to migrant families and their everyday lives, and with a specific focus on understanding the influence of audience in family display. This article, therefore, contributes to migration and transnational family studies by providing a new way of understanding migrant family lives, and also advancing the concept of family display in three clear ways: by showing that migrant families do display family to audiences beyond the family\u2013including the State\u2013so as to present as a \u2018legitimate\u2019 family; by expanding understanding of how family display is enacted; and by arguing that broader narratives influence those related to \u2018family\u2019 and impact on how and why migrant families engage in family displays.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1239879, "first_name": "Julie", "last_name": "Walsh", "domain_name": "sheffield", "page_name": "JulieWalsh", "display_name": "Julie Walsh", "profile_url": "https://sheffield.academia.edu/JulieWalsh?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1239879/11484443/12809225/s65_julie.walsh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1909, "name": "Family studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60827, "name": "Social cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_cohesion?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 40648260, "title": "Kodin merkitysten rakentuminen Koti!

Migrants are eager to master the host community\u2019s language and be part of the community. At the same time, they are suspicious of their own eagerness to do so. Rather than asking, \u2018How can the acquisition of the local language facilitate better integration of migrants?\u2019, the question that animates this article is: what kind of image of home is communicated by the narrative which assumes language to be a critical tool for integration? How might we start thinking about home differently if we are to address migrants\u2019 desire to be part of the community and, at the same time, their refusal to be part of it?

This paper reports on the results of qualitative, in-depth interviews conducted using the grounded theory, exploring experiences of Polish migrants in the UK. \nThree types of transnational care practices were identified i.e. care practices 1) rooted in the country of origin: when migrants assume that the care for family members should be provided in the country of origin; 2) anchoring to the country of destination: in which migrants are focused on bringing care providers to the country of destination; 3) chosen to be the most suitable, so the decision about the care is based on the utilitarian migrants\u2019 approach to provide and/or receive care. In all cases, the care practices can be considered as bidirectional, meaning that transnational migrants can either receive or provide care.  Moreover, transnational care practices exhibited by the migrants are correlated with the migrants\u2019 motivations and fixed timeframe of migration. Firstly, the migrants, \u2018rooted in the country of origin\u2019, targeted a temporary stay in the UK with a presumed plan of return to Poland. Secondly, the migrants \u2018anchoring care to the country of destination\u2019 focused on a permanent stay in the UK due to the lack of opportunities in the country of origin. Finally, the migrants, who \u2018chose the most suitable care practice\u2019, showed fluid decision making process about future migration. The abovementioned types of transitional care practices depend also on less significant factors related to the migrants\u2019 financial and family situation. \nIn summary, the presented results show that experiences of transnational care practices for Polish migrants in the UK are multidimensional and may be linked with the sense of belonging. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30761252, "first_name": "Kinga", "last_name": "Papiez", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "KingaPapiez", "display_name": "Kinga Papiez", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/KingaPapiez?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30761252/9452318/27959006/s65_kinga.papiez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9789, "name": "Family Caregivers/Carers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family_Caregivers_Carers?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 111167, "name": "Transnational Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Families?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37247081, "title": "Betwixt and Between.

Utilising the theoretical concepts of participation units, territories of the self (Goffman 1972[1971]) and belonging (May 2011, 2013), this paper explores the challenges that spatio-temporal conventions pose for women solo diners in particular. Through the lens of solo dining, we explore being alone and belonging in shared public spaces, and the gendered nature of aloneness and respectability. The paper contributes to existing theory by examining the influence that time has on a woman solo diner's 'single' participation unit, her ability to lay claim to public space and her relationship with the surrounding social environment. The paper concludes by exploring what the new trend of solo dining can offer and the consequences this has for how sociologists conceptualise sociality in public spaces.", "downloadable_attachments":

These migrants contested the intended precise social and spatial ordering of the colonial system. The entanglement of legal categories and human movement will be analyzed in two cases that might be expected to be very similar, but were surprisingly different: colonial Mexico (New Spain); and Peru, where migrants are more visible in the historical record.

However, it is one that requires further theorisation beyond everyday or romanticised understandings. The politics of belonging provides a potentially productive focus for thinking about belonging in early childhood education and care because of its attention to how belonging in all its complexity works. A key aspect of the politics of belonging is processes of categorisation, or how social\r\ncategories influence who does and does not belong, who decides and on what basis. In this article, the author complicates the notion of categorisation by bringing it into an encounter with the concepts of lines and segmentarity from Deleuze. The author then uses these concepts to look\r\nat video data of an infant aged eight to nine months in family day care, in an effort to illustrate how processes of categorisation, lines and segmentarity were at work.

Through these 'venting sessions', it is possible that teachers' perceptions of interactions with Japanese can slowly be shifted towards the negative, causing many teachers who engage within the narrative to form largely foreigner-only friendships and limit their participation in Japanese society.\r\nThrough this research, the disaggregation of the concept of belonging allowed me to discovered the myriad of ways teachers have been able to construct feelings of belonging - creating ties through their interests, hobbies, religion, family, friends, Japanese language abilities, and acceptance.

Our main hypothesis is that these managers are developing \u2018partial exit\u2019 strategies, investing resources outside the city, and developing transnational networks also to defend their interests at the local level. In socially mixed neighbourhoods, where managers live with less privileged social groups, we expect these managers to put into practice \u2018partial exit\u2019 strategies to a larger extent than their colleagues in homogeneous neighbourhoods. Results show that managers, although playing at the transnational level, keep a strong attachment to their area of residence, and no great differences emerge between managers living in homogeneous and mixed neighborhoods. Results also suggest that managers living in mixed neighborhoods are putting into practice to a larger extent \u201cpartial exit strategies\u201d at the urban level, through its selective use.

These fictional television shows, are analysed as cultural spaces in which conventions and discourses practice politics of belonging. The theoretical framework builds on the Nira Yuval-Davis\u2019s theory of belonging and on Judith Butler\u2019s theory on performativity. The politics of belonging promoted by the television series are examined from three different perspectives: belonging to 1) class, 2) gender and 3) welfare society. The work identifies four different narratives highlighted by the examined series. The first one discusses the collapse of welfare society. The second specifies how social classes react to the modernization process. The third explores marriage as a site of struggle between genders. Finally, the fourth narrative, visible especially in the television critiques, highlights how \u201ccommon people\u201d have been both categorized and instructed through the decades. By exploring the selected television series as cultural sites in which performative practices are reiterated, the work at hand discusses the changing cultural role of television series during the decades. At the same time, the fictional television material opens an entirely new perspective to the theories of belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27187341, "first_name": "Jenni", "last_name": "Hokka", "domain_name": "uta-fi", "page_name": "JenniHokka", "display_name": "Jenni Hokka", "profile_url": "https://uta-fi.academia.edu/JenniHokka?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/27187341/7699394/43760032/s65_jenni.hokka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2972, "name": "Media History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34074, "name": "Television", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Television?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 274431, "name": "TV Series", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/TV_Series?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 80882665, "title": "Interstitial spaces of belonging: Refugee and migrant inclusion, and digitally networked communication", "created_at": "2022-06-06T21:40:40.187-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/80882665/Interstitial_spaces_of_belonging_Refugee_and_migrant_inclusion_and_digitally_networked_communication?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_80882665", "summary": "\u00a9 2021 Estelle Louisa BoyleThis project considers how digitally networked communication technologies are opening up interstitial spaces of belonging for people of refugee and migrant backgrounds after resettlement.

I contextualise the findings arising from this data by first considering the history of migrant inclusion in Australia, and the historical practice of migrant communication through letters. I argue that while digital platforms and global connections play an important role in supporting their social inclusion and sense of belonging, interaction in the physical, local world remains crucial nonetheless.

interrelationship between patterns of im/mobility on the one hand and the reconstitution of social collective identities and the related emergence or settlement of conflicts on the other. The main arguments are (1) that the im/mobility of a social or cultural group has major impact on how identity narratives, a sense of belonging and relationships to \u2018others\u2019 are shaped, and vice versa, and (2) that these dynamics are closely interlinked with mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion between groups and power structures that involve a broad variety of actors. Mainly looking at patterns of internal mobility such as \u2018traditional\u2019 or strategic mobilities and mobilities enforced by crisis, conflict or governmental programmes and regimes, the contribution provides the conceptual background for a special issue that aims to go beyond currently predominant issues of transnational migration. Established or emerging dynamics of (non-)integration and belonging, caused by im/mobility, are analysed on a cultural and political level, which involves questions of representation, indigeneity/autochthony, political rights and access to land and other resources. Conflict situations in contexts of mobility involve changes in the social understanding and renegotiation, reconstruction or reproduction of group identities and narratives with reference to certain socio-political and historical patterns. The legitimation of rights and access to various forms of citizenship and mobility need to be understood against the backdrop of emerging or established mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion between groups, which trigger or settle conflicts and make social identities to be constantly renegotiated.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1884946, "first_name": "Birgit",

Aspects like the election of representatives, allocation of pews or administration of funds moved communal concerns well into the political sphere. We know much about processes of social and confessional differentiation, but what exactly were the power relations in parish communities? How did localities negotiate their dealings with manorial lords, city councils and state authorities? To which extent were parishes instrumentalized for secular purposes like local government or even resistance? \n \nThe 19th Warwick Symposium on Parish Research will take the form of a webinar on Saturday 8 May 2021, 10 am - 6 pm. Under the general theme of 'Parish, Power & Politics', proceedings are co-organized by Beat K\u00fcmin (Warwick) and Marjolein Schepers (IAS Fernandes Fellow/VUB), with the help of Warwick research students Daniel Gettings and Maria Tauber.  \n \nKEYNOTE ADDRESS\n'Parishes, pandemics and paths to take: post-Covid historical options' \nKeith Snell, Emeritus Professor of Rural and Cultural History (University of Leicester) \n \nTo complement the programme, we are now inviting proposals for two themed sessions and an open section: \n \nPANEL 1: Local Politics of Poor Relief\nPoor relief has developed as a parish-based institution, centred on the local community. But who was involved in decision-making processes on the local level? How was relief organised, e.g. income and distribution practices? How did parish politics relate to other levels of governance on an urban, regional or state level? And how were power relations represented in more formal or more informal forms of relief? This panel invites proposals on the local politics of poor relief in different areas and time periods. \n \nPANEL 2: Politics of Belonging\nHow was belonging to the parish constructed? Local communities had different levels of belonging, varying between natives, residents and elites. But which factors contributed to belonging? How did it relate to local xenophobia or notions of alienness and othering? And how was belonging negotiated or attributed? This panel invites proposals on the politics of belonging and how and why these changed over time. Proposals can address themes such as, but in no means limited to, migration and mobility, religious diversity, cultural and ethnic minorities, gender and intersectionality. \n \nPANEL 3: Open Section\nIn addition to the two panels above, we also invite other proposals related to the theme of 'Parish, Power and Politics' for an open section. \n \nTo submit a proposal for a 15 minute paper, please send your title, half-page abstract, brief biographical note and an indication of whether you wish to be considered for one of the panels or the open section to: b.kumin@warwick.ac.uk and Marjolein.Schepers@vub.be by Monday 15 March 2021. \n \nFor further information and updates please visit our homepage at: \nhttps://warwick.ac.uk/my-parish/parishsymposia/2021politics/\n \nWe look forward to hearing from you!

As a case, we look at the Yachen Gar monastery in the West of Sichuan. The Yachen Gar monastery became the largest Buddhist university in China in the past decades, but recently, reports of the destruction of large parts of the Buddhist encampment have emerged. This article is based on my observations during my field trip in late 2018, just before this destruction took place. I will use my conceptual framework of rhizomatic religion, which I developed in an earlier article, to show how Yachen Gar, rather than the locus of a \"world religion\", is rather an expression of rhizomatic religion, which is native to the Tibetan highlands in Kham Tibet. This rhizomatic religion could emerge because Yachen is situated both on the edges of Tibet proper, and on the edges of Han Chinese culture, therefore occupying an interstitial space. As has been observed before, Yachen emerges as a process which is the result of the revival of Nyingmapa Tibetan Buddhist culture, as a negotiation between the Tibetan communities and the Chinese state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65106357, "asset_id": 44635772, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3205945, "first_name": "Daan", "last_name": "Oostveen", "domain_name": "uu", "page_name": "DaanOostveen", "display_name": "Daan F .

More specifically, I examine how Hassan Maikal, a young Finnish man with a Somali background and an active vlogger and rapper, uses language, discourse(s), (moving) image and sound to construct social, discursive and affective (non)belonging. Ethnicity, religion and gender, along with age, language and place of residence are also taken into account in viewing (non)belonging from a multidimensional viewpoint. Theoretically and methodologically this study draws on sociolinguistic discourse studies and the study of multimodality. The data consist of an interview between Hassan Maikal and myself as well as a YouTube video of the artist\u2019s. The aim of this article is to examine a) how (non)belonging is constructed and negotiated in a globalizing and polarizing Finnish society, and b) what kind of role faith and religion have in this process. My study also sheds light on how social media can function as a significant site and channel for new, critical voices and how it, in its own way, can contribute to the processes of belonging and non-belonging.

As the rising merchant class strove to forge an identity, the institutions they constructed, whether in the form of a town government or a guild, can, and have, been seen as oligarchical, self-reciprocating, and defined by selection from among members of their own class. The historiography of religious guilds more generally perpetuates this assessment, as the prevailing view of their membership is one of exclusivity: from the greatest, such as the guild of St. Mary in Boston, to the smallest, which maintained a single light in their parish church. The payment of membership fines and the benefits incurred from membership naturally created socially insular groups, often homogenous in make-up. But was this a truism for all late medieval English guilds?\n\nThe Palmers\u2019 Guild of Ludlow, Shropshire, preserves an almost unique set of membership documents, dating from the fourteenth century until their dissolution in the sixteenth century. This allows us the opportunity to gain an unparalleled insight into how the guild constructed its sense of identity and belonging. Despite displaying similar traits to other \u2018exclusive\u2019 fraternities \u2013 such as substantial admission fees, a large elite mercantile contingent, and \u2018token\u2019 noble membership \u2013 the records of the Palmers nevertheless indicate an unusually socially diverse membership. These circumstances offer the chance to expand the historiographical remit and nuance traditional views. \n\nMy paper contends that the Palmers\u2019 Guild in fact intersected every level of society, offering a new dimension both to guild historiography and to notions of belonging and hierarchy in the later middle ages. While not necessarily representative of all guilds in this respect, the example of the Palmers stands to enrich and augment our understanding of these themes. The mentalities, structures and methods utilised by the guild will be used to understand how and why the Palmers achieved this unique range of membership. Moreover, there existed a noteworthy juxtaposition within the guild\u2019s constructed sense of belonging which deserves qualification. Although the Palmers were unusually inclusive in their membership, the structure of the guild\u2019s governance was itself intensely hierarchical, with spaces and material culture acting to promote and reinforce this. These themes of inclusivity and hierarchy, and the tensions between them, will be explored and evaluated within the parameters of how belonging was manifested within a single guild, shedding light on the mores of society more generally \u2013 through contrast, if not typicality. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 36777203, "first_name": "Rachael", "last_name": "Harkes", "domain_name": "durham", "page_name": "RachaelHarkes", "display_name": "Rachael Harkes", "profile_url": "https://durham.academia.edu/RachaelHarkes?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/36777203/10513980/11732342/s65_rachael.harkes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1446, "name": "Medieval History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_History?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14170, "name": "Medieval England", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Medieval_England?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 236711, "name": "Fraternity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fraternity?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 245019, "name": "Shropshire history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shropshire_history?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 38511236, "title": "Transnational positioniert und transkulturell verflochten: Zur Frage der Konstitution und Konstruktion von Zugeh\u00f6rigkeiten in Migrationsprozessen.", "created_at": "2019-03-07T21:45:15.489-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38511236/Transnational_positioniert_und_transkulturell_verflochten_Zur_Frage_der_Konstitution_und_Konstruktion_von_Zugeh%C3%B6rigkeiten_in_Migrationsprozessen?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_38511236", "summary": "Dealing scientifically with the question of belonging is a classic field of sociological migration research. However, in the era of globalization, increasing migration and transnationalization of social structures, this question appears in a new light. Whereas the classic assimilation- and integration-oriented research approaches focus on integration into and identification with the immigration society, the approaches of transnationalism and transculturalism allow for a wider perspective on the question of the constitution and construction of multiple ways of belonging across national borders. The following contribution deals with the constitution and construction of multiple ways of belonging in the context of migration. The critical appraisal of the concept of belonging is followed by a presentation of transnational and transcultural perspectives, which broaden the conceptualization of multiple ways of belonging beyond unambiguous national-ethnic-cultural attributions. In order to indicate the procedural character, the contextual-structural and temporal conditionality of such multiple ways of belonging as well as their embeddedness in the subjectification processes and agency, the constitution and construction of the transnational social spaces of action and belonging are discussed from the biographical perspective. Finally, the empirically grounded concept of transnational positioning is illustrated with the help of some examples as a complex biographical construction of belonging, which involves the biographical process of negotiation between structural identity constraints and subjective power of agency beyond unambiguous attributions and identifications.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 104055701, "first_name": "Minna-Kristiina", "last_name": "Ruokonen-Engler, Dr.", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MinnaKristiinaRuokonenEngler", "display_name": "Minna-Kristiina Ruokonen-Engler, Dr.", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MinnaKristiinaRuokonenEngler?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/104055701/23266836/22358169/s65_minna-kristiina.ruokonen-engler.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 402313, "name": "Biographical Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biographical_Research?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37491513, "title": "Partial Immunities: Rethinking Communities and Belonging through Viral Memories of Influenza", "created_at": "2018-09-27T22:07:23.052-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37491513/Partial_Immunities_Rethinking_Communities_and_Belonging_through_Viral_Memories_of_Influenza?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_37491513", "summary": "The article explores the concept of partial immunities \u2013 our past infections providing partial protection against new related epidemics \u2013 in order to develop feminist tools for rethinking communities and belonging as situated and inherently multiple.

As a result, these studies suggest that British converts to Islam are conceived as \u2018bridge builders\u2019 or as existing in \u2018liminal\u2019 space. Yet these frameworks leave converts out-of-place and positioned as double strange. Drawing on narrative interviews with British converts to Islam this paper argues that such conceptions do very little to understand their experiences as Muslims and as British, instead confining them to the existing terms of the debates, and as such leaves them in something of a conceptual wilderness. Taking Simmel\u2019s Stranger as a starting point, I argue that converts, who both explicitly and implicitly draw a line between \u2018religion\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 with regard to Islam and Muslims, offer a challenge and different perspective on what these terms can mean in Britain today and thereby contribute to these discussions. This divide is contentious, complex, and problematic.  Nevertheless, by taking the culture-religion divide as a prism through which to explore ideas and aspects of identity and belonging, moves can be made towards viewing converts in-place. The divide suggests the need to put the religious at the centre and it is in this way that varying horizons of ways of being can be brought into conversation. In this paper I trace the various lines of this religion-culture divide to explore how British converts to Islam do and do not relate to Islam, Muslim communities and wider society. This involves consideration of the dynamic interplay between the personal and the social, as well as, importantly, the Divine.

First, it provides a brief overview of historical developments and respective cultural policies leading up to such mass-scale objectification of royalty in each empire. In the process, it introduces a novel theoretical framework, based on the concept of modern ruler visibility, conveyed via the annual secular public ruler celebrations (royal birthday, accession day, etc.). Second, drawing on a large body of archival and printed evidence from the two empires, the paper analyzes the drivers and dynamics of desirability of 'ruler objects' and the linkages between the respective non-market and market channels of distribution. In this vein, it identifies two shifts in dissemination and socialization over time: a) from elite members to commoners, and b) from the public to the private sphere. For example, the appeal of status symbols, such as medals and orders, which form the bulk of early 'ruler objects', meant for elite socialization only, grew exponentially over time as did their royal bestowal thereby extending the realm of symbolic cooptation of the populace. At the same time, the increasingly ceremonious decoration of new public buildings with 'royal objects' at their inauguration elicited a more intense competition between private companies for the right to do the same (via advertisement boards, store front logos, endorsements, etc.). Both trends originated in the above-mentioned festivities and served as vehicles for subject loyalty and monarchic patriotism. In addition, the paper sheds light on empire-specific trends, such as the Ottoman shift away from ruler visibility in the 1880s and 1890s, under Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II, which led to a split in royal objectification: a) away from portraits, towards \" Long Live the Sultan \" banners for Muslims and b) unchanged for domestic non-Muslims. Thus, faith also became a determinant of consumer culture. Finally, this paper demonstrates the limits of royal objectification by reviewing actual cases of monarchic hyper-sensitivity and censorship on the consumption of royal images (in pubs, brothels, etc.) despite their owners' best intentions in order to avoid disrepute or trivialization. In short, the paper addresses some key intersections between changing notions of monarchic sovereignty and legitimacy, on the one hand, and nascent consumer trends and popular belonging, on the other.\n\n\u201cHistory of Consumer Culture: Objects, Desire and Sociability\u201d Conference\n\n23-25 March 2017, Gakushuin University, Tokyo, JAPAN\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54333883,

"This paper analyses the interrelationship between patterns of im/mobility on the one hand and the reconstitution of social collective identities and the related emergence or settlement of conflicts on the other. The main arguments are (1) that the im/mobility of a social or cultural group has major impact on how identity narratives, a sense of belonging and relationships to \u2018others\u2019 are shaped, and vice versa, and (2) that these dynamics are closely interlinked with mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion between groups and power structures that involve a broad variety of actors. Mainly looking at patterns of internal mobility such as \u2018traditional\u2019 or strategic mobilities and mobilities enforced by crisis, conflict or governmental programmes and regimes, the contribution provides the conceptual background for a  special issue that aims to go beyond currently predominant issues of transnational migration. Established or emerging dynamics of (non-)integration and belonging, caused by im/mobility, are analysed on a cultural and political level, which involves questions of representation, indigeneity/autochthony, political rights  and access to land and other resources. Conflict situations in contexts of mobility involve changes in the social understanding and renegotiation, reconstruction or reproduction of group identities and narratives with reference to certain socio-political and historical patterns. The legitimation of rights and access to various forms of citizenship and mobility need to be understood against the backdrop of emerging or established mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion between groups, which trigger or settle conflicts and make social identities to be constantly renegotiated.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1884946, "first_name": "Birgit", "last_name": "Braeuchler", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "BirgitBraeuchler", "display_name": "Birgit  Braeuchler", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/BirgitBraeuchler?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1884946/15682988/16240356/s65_birgit.braeuchler.jpg"}, {"id": 2600823, "first_name": "Ana\u00efs", "last_name": "M\u00e9nard", "domain_name": "eth-mpg", "page_name": "Ana\u00efsM\u00e9nard", "display_name": "Ana\u00efs M\u00e9nard", "profile_url": "https://eth-mpg.academia.edu/Ana%C3%AFsM%C3%A9nard?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2600823/819979/3050471/s65_ana_s.m_nard.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3849, "name": "Conflict", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Conflict?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5839, "name": "Kosovo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kosovo?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 9150, "name": "Indigeneity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigeneity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 13047, "name": "Sierra Leone", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sierra_Leone?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 21633, "name": "Liberia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberia?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 42489, "name": "East Timor", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Timor?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 43130, "name": "Collective Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collective_Identity?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 50690, "name": "Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53166, "name": "Power", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Power?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 135047, "name": "Social Exclusion and Inclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Exclusion_and_Inclusion?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 293502, "name": "Timor Leste", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Timor_Leste?f_ri=53547"}]}, {"id": 31451701, "title": "Ghosts and guests: A pastoral theology of belonging for ministry with persons with mental illness", "created_at": "2017-02-15T10:54:43.980-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31451701/Ghosts_and_guests_A_pastoral_theology_of_belonging_for_ministry_with_persons_with_mental_illness?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_31451701", "summary": "The purpose of this article is to develop a pastoral theology of belonging, which opposes the systemic marginalization of persons with mental illness.

The present contribution will give some insights on music as a vector of religious belonging: a female choir of a mosque in Lake Geneva Metropolitan Region has interpreted Beethoven's Ode to Joy with a new text about the glory of the messenger; a regional event on the edge of political and religious expression has united music from Syria, Kosovo and Tunisia in order to put on stage the cosmopolitan characteristics of Swiss Muslims.

The politics of belonging promoted by the television series are examined from three different perspectives: belonging to 1) class, 2) gender and 3) welfare society. The work identifies four different narratives highlighted by the examined series. The first one discusses the collapse of welfare society. The second specifies how social classes react to the modernization process. The third explores marriage as a site of struggle between genders. Finally, the fourth narrative, visible especially in the television critiques, highlights how \u201ccommon people\u201d have been both categorized and instructed through the decades. By exploring the selected television series as cultural sites in which performative practices are reiterated, the work at hand discusses the changing cultural role of television series during the decades.

The material culture of home embodies both their experiences and migrant trajectory, and the process of integration into the host society, representing the continuum process of adjustment that they face in cultural, social and material terms. The results show that the ways in which migrants inhabit their homes are related to their processes of settling down,since through the material culture, the belonging to their two worlds, the one they came from and the one they settled into, is daily negotiated, generating the ambivalence of  being here and there simultaneously. Their homes become transnational, where emerges a cultural syncretism between two worlds that coexist: Peru is symbolized by photography and food, both of which allow the reproduction of their belonging and cultural identity, and Chile is represented by technological artifacts, which embody their sacrificing labour and courage, and allow them to feel part of the host society.",

It explores the ways people come to achieve a sense of belonging with reference to recent theoretical treatments of place, territory, and mobility. We ground our discussion in analysis of an ethnographic case of Ecuadorian families who have migrated to Trentino in northern Italy. Most families miss the social relationships and places they left behind, but have decided to stay permanently in Italy, giving up the \u201cmyth of return\u201d (Anwar 1979). Trentino offers more opportunities in term of employment, education, and access to services than Ecuador. Yet the decision to stay in Trentino is based on more than a simple assessment of economic advantage. Participants spoke of a slowly unfolding sense of belonging to Trentino, with strong affective dimensions born of a specific attachment to the very materiality of place in Trentino. This attachment may be regarded as an assemblage of social, material and\r\naffective resonances, experiences and resources, revealing something of the place and feeling of belonging. Hence, the Ecuadorian sense of belonging does not rely on an abstract conception of cultural affiliation, nor is it a purely psychological response. Rather, belonging accrues in particular practices and material attachments. We unpack\r\nthese practices by documenting the work participants put into inhabiting an unfamiliar place as \u201ctheir\u201d place, while at the same time questioning the ontological status of space.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38430163, "asset_id": 8581655, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1176790, "first_name": "Roberta", "last_name": "Raffaet\u00e0", "domain_name": "unive", "page_name": "RobertaRaffaet\u00e0", "display_name": "Roberta Raffaet\u00e0", "profile_url": "https://unive.academia.edu/RobertaRaffaet%C3%A0?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1176790/418566/37594230/s65_roberta.raffaet_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 599334, "name": "Architecture and Public Spaces", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Public_Spaces?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7873958, "title": "Bodily Offerings of Belongings: Chinese-Australians in Perth. 2007.

It underlines the dynamic reflexivity and resilience demonstrated by the community in seeking to define their belonging within a state-imposed framework.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48230203, "asset_id": 7873958, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14705790, "first_name": "Sin Wen", "last_name": "Lau", "domain_name": "otago", "page_name": "SinWenLau", "display_name": "Sin Wen  Lau", "profile_url": "https://otago.academia.edu/SinWenLau?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14705790/4002592/14925046/s65_sin_wen.lau.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12179, "name": "Chinese Diaspora (Migration and Ethnicity)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Diaspora_Migration_and_Ethnicity_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 6629520, "title": "Bonhomme (2014) Exilio y retorno: dos procesos de inclusi\u00f3n desde el hogar/ Exile and return: two processes of inclusion from home", "created_at": "2014-04-02T04:24:01.426-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6629520/Bonhomme_2014_Exilio_y_retorno_dos_procesos_de_inclusi%C3%B3n_desde_el_hogar_Exile_and_return_two_processes_of_inclusion_from_home?f_ri=53547", "dom_id": "work_6629520", "summary": "Una vez recuperada la democracia, solo uno de cada cuatro chilenos que viv\u00edan en el exilio decidieron regresar a Chile, mientras que tres de cada cuatro optaron por quedarse en otro pa\u00eds que progresivamente se fue convirtiendo en su nuevo hogar.

prior to, and immediately following, the election of Barack Obama for a second term in 2011/12, there were widespread reports of far-right activists stating their intention to leave the United States as exiles, secede from it or create their own nation. In addition to such secessionism and separatism, there has also been a rise in far-right and more \u2018mainstream\u2019 right-wing disaster preparedness and survivalism. This far-right secessionism, separatism and survivalism, as well as anti-government enmity, have their origins in the post-civil rights 1970s, as responses to the alleged loss of white supremacy brought about by Civil Rights and perceived need to prepare, adapt to or escape the crisis that this was seen to represent to white Americans. This paper will trace the history of white secessionism, separatism and survivalism on the far right in response to perceived crises in the post-civil rights era, including the Civil Rights Act, Cold War, Millennium, 9/11, election(s) of Obama and current economic crisis. In addition to this, the paper will examine the ways in which such far-right ideologies, discourses and practices concerning threats to whiteness relate to more \u2018mainstream\u2019 right-wing ones in which race plays a less overt, but important role.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2485420, "first_name": "Aaron", "last_name": "Winter", "domain_name": "lancaster",

is a multi-sited ethnographic study of the practices through which a sense of identity and belonging is produced and experienced in the crate digging scene, a hip hop related translocal record collecting collectivity.\nAffective attachments are rarely theorised within popular music studies, and are largely neglected or taken for granted in empirical work. Whereas the emergence and prevalence of a sense of companionship and collective identity is less surprising in tightly-woven collectivities that frequently gather in public venues in a particular locality, it demands more of an explanation in spatially dispersed musical worlds, like the transnational crate digging scene, in which regular, locally based face-to-face interaction takes place in small friendly circles that consist of a handful of enthusiasts at most.\nThe thesis reworks earlier, more elusive definitions of the notion of scene \u2013 a shared cultural space in which a range of coexisting and interacting musical practices work towards producing a sense of community \u2013 in a way that is more specific both with regarding what kinds of practices \u2013 aesthetic, distinctive, and spatial \u2013 shall be taken into consideration in accounting for the sources of attachments in musical collectivities. Furthermore, through its empirical chapters it outlines and connects particular areas of inquiry \u2013 the collective cultivation of a certain form of musical appreciation, the performance of distinctive practices, the acquisition and passing on of scenic sensibilities and customs, the places of scenic practice, as well as a shared understanding of spatiality \u2013 in which the productive \u201cwork\u201d of these practices could be be more closely observed and understood. \nThrough a micro-sociological study of the collective practices organised around the consumption of second hand records, the thesis also engages with the sociocultural significance of the transforming technological regime of music consumption.\n\n[request a copy of the thesis here or in an e-mail]", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 326865, "first_name": "Gabor", "last_name": "Valyi", "domain_name": "golds", "page_name": "GaborValyi", "display_name": "Gabor Valyi", "profile_url": "https://golds.academia.edu/GaborValyi?f_ri=53547", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/326865/91741/55924537/s65_gabor.valyi.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 957, "name": "Cultural Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Sociology?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34139, "name": "Hip-Hop Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hip-Hop_Studies?f_ri=53547", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 80620, "name": "Record collecting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Record_collecting?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 105691, "name": "Audio Sampling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Audio_Sampling?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 105692, "name": "Breakbeat", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Breakbeat?f_ri=53547"}, {"id": 105697, "name": "Crate Digging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Crate_Digging?f_ri=53547"}]}]
