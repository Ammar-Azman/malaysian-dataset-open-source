The commercials analysed comprise ten advertisements that convey messages predominantly via visual or linguistic resources and were selected based on their availability at time of research. Kress and van Leeuwen\u2019s framework to multimodal analysis was employed in examining these commercials.\n\nSemiotic resources in the commercials were examined to reveal meanings conveyed, from which teacher roles, student types and education outcome expectations were identified. These were discussed together with observed representations of ethnicity, gender and power, surfacing the changing teacher requirements and education objectives of Singapore education. The analysis revealed the education system\u2019s progressive objectives, from imparting content and knowledge to character development and instilling of aspirational notions, equipping students with right values, solid knowledge and future-ready skills, remodelling teachers into skillful educators and ultimately inspiring mentors. The paper concludes with a calling to extend the analysis scope under social semiotics and to further examine changing student profiles, which shall surely illuminate future paths of Singapore education.\n\nKeywords: advertising, education objectives, multimodal communication, Singapore education system, sociolinguistics, teacher requirements, teaching", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39600423, "asset_id": 17591809, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5173610, "first_name": "Cynthia", "last_name": "Ong", "domain_name": "bham", "page_name": "CynthiaOng", "display_name": "Cynthia  Ong", "profile_url": "https://bham.academia.edu/CynthiaOng?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5173610/10434663/11643506/s65_cynthia.ong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3637, "name": "Advertising", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advertising?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7490, "name": "Gender Equality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Equality?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 20422, "name": "Multimodal Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimodal_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 21201, "name": "Multimodality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimodality?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 54405, "name": "Multimodal Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimodal_Communication?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 121345, "name": "Multimodality, Social Semiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimodality_Social_Semiotics?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 282446, "name": "Advertising, Multimodal Discourse Analysis, Semiotics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Advertising_Multimodal_Discourse_Analysis_Semiotics?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 296449, "name": "Singapore Education System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Education_System?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 760852, "name": "Discourse Analysis on Advertisements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse_Analysis_on_Advertisements?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 1019505, "name": "Analyzing Multimodal Texts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Analyzing_Multimodal_Texts?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 1750016, "name": "Singapore Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Education?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 2200631, "name": "Education in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428"}]}, {"id": 4890333, "title": "Issues of Citizenship, National Identity and Political Socialization in Singapore: Implications to the Singapore Education System", "created_at": "2013-10-25T13:27:55.882-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4890333/Issues_of_Citizenship_National_Identity_and_Political_Socialization_in_Singapore_Implications_to_the_Singapore_Education_System?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_4890333", "summary": "This inquiry attempts to address the question: How has the Singapore city-state used its education system in integrating three important cornerstones of nation-building?

This has contributed to the entrenchment of \u2018assessment\u2019 becoming an institutional authority of standards, teaching (performativity) and classroom learning. It is against, and amidst such contexts, that this article traces how the notion and discourse of formative assessment and Assessment for Learning (AfL) are widely introduced and used formally across all Singaporean schools, particularly after a recent introduction of new \u2018Holistic and Balanced Assessment\u2019 policies. We argue that the very institutional authority of successful high-stake examination results, which served as critical standards of performativity of teaching and learning in the classroom, is being challenged. The changing assessment context of Singaporean schools, therefore serves as an interesting case study site for studying how formative assessment and AfL can be adapted and understood when \u2018learning\u2019 is already seen to be successful.\r\n\r\nLink: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09585176.2014.970207#.VKdU6rkcRjo\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36135726, "asset_id": 9986112, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8326331, "first_name": "Wei Shin", "last_name": "Leong", "domain_name": "nie-sg", "page_name": "WeiShinLeong", "display_name": "Wei Shin Leong", "profile_url": "https://nie-sg.academia.edu/WeiShinLeong?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8326331/3022904/3551023/s65_wei_shin.leong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1077, "name": "Educational Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Leadership?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1750, "name": "Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4414, "name": "Formative Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Formative_Assessment?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77540, "name": "Classroom Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Assessment?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 242109, "name": "Classroom Based Assessment, Formative Assessment, Summative Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Based_Assessment_Formative_Assessment_Summative_Assessment?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 243981, "name": "Asian Education culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Education_culture?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 489484, "name": "Assessment reform", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment_reform?f_ri=158428"}]}, {"id": 2547257, "title": "Perform or else: the performative enhancement of teacher professionalism", "created_at": "2013-02-10T10:18:46.478-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2547257/Perform_or_else_the_performative_enhancement_of_teacher_professionalism?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_2547257", "summary": "The Singapore Ministry of Education's Enhanced Performance Management System (EPMS) was instituted in 2005 as a system of professional accountability to enhance the standards and stakes of teacher professionalism in schools.

The analysis centres on the discursive mechanisms of a standardized appraisal instrument known as the Work Review Form. Applying speech act theory via the insights of J.L. Austin and J. Butler, I argue that teachers' professional qualities are not only described and prescribed but also produced by the appraisal protocols of the EPMS \u2013 a process contingent on the discursive performativity of the Work Review Form. Implicated in this notion of performativity are the rhetorical manoeuvres by which teachers perform \u201con paper\u201d under the pressure to perform.

The paper is comprised of four sections. The first section outlines the structure of the paper which is followed in the second section by a general overview of Singapore\u2019s current education and examination system. The third section, which focuses on Chinese language education and assessment in Singapore, traces briefly the historical trajectory leading to the implementation of Singapore\u2019s bilingual policy. This section also examines the limitations of the current bilingual policy which, it is argued, entails an over-simplified reconceptualization of the state\u2019s internally heterogeneous Chinese population as a community with one \u201cmother tongue\u201d paired with a single culture and set of values. The concept of \u201cmother tongue\u201d in the Singaporean context is problematic as it undermines the legitimacy of the bilingual policy. Further, Singapore\u2019s bilingual policy has been accepted by the general public without critical engagement with the key issue of bilingualism itself. This paper also discusses how the underlying premise of Singapore\u2019s bilingual policy, namely that English and Chinese assume sharply different roles in society, has broken down rapidly in recent years. These limitations, as the fourth section maintains, have implications for how the Chinese language is perceived, taught and examined in Singapore. \n\nKeywords: bilingual policy, Chinese language education and assessment policy, language testing and assessment in Singapore, mother tongue, Singapore\u2019s education and examination system", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62118542, "asset_id": 41994694, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 19269257, "first_name": "Yun-Yee", "last_name": "Cheong", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "YunYeeCheong", "display_name": "Yun-Yee Cheong", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/YunYeeCheong?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/19269257/7131769/32923847/s65_yun-yee.cheong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18045, "name": "Language Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Assessment?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 216185, "name": "Educational Testing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Testing?f_ri=158428"}]}, {"id": 11578064, "title": "State formation and nation building through education: The origins and introduction of the \"National Education\" program in Singapore", "created_at": "2015-03-21T22:03:29.356-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11578064/State_formation_and_nation_building_through_education_The_origins_and_introduction_of_the_National_Education_program_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_11578064", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37065641, "asset_id": 11578064, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 75397, "first_name": "Yeow-Tong", "last_name": "Chia", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "YeowTongChia", "display_name": "Yeow-Tong  Chia", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/YeowTongChia?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/75397/20808/691877/s65_yeow-tong.chia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5293, "name": "State Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Formation?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82379, "name": "Citizenship Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_Education?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 44196415, "title": "Sample Essay 3 -

Through this we argue that augmenting linguistic analysis with philosophical perspectives develops and supports CDA scholarship more broadly by accommodating the shifting complexity of social problems of ideologically driven inequality that are inbuilt through, in our case, social policy texts. In discussing philosophical-methodological issues, the paper argues for the need to continually adapt CDA to the particular data so as to remain sensitive to and avoid hegemonic tendencies in analysis. Through adopting the principles of a working methodology, we discuss a micro-meso-macro CDA framework that draws on the analytical concepts of movement, metaphorical superfluidity, thematic condensation, and surrealism to conceive of a research approach capable of examining and comprehending evolving discourses of political economies. The most immediate benefit of this framework is its capacity to illustrate how forms of valuations perpetuated by and through policy discourse are the motivational locus of meaning making insofar as they strongly inform the moral underpinning the ideology of economic growth.\n ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55445759, "asset_id": 35579690, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Drawing on a theoretical framing from Foucault and the augmentation of Nietzsche\u2019s views on valuation, we sketch a framework for examining ways in which evaluative semantic categories can be linked to sociological theories in order to bring out their relevance for the purpose of critical discourse analysis. This multi-level research framework draws upon a relationship between language analysis, the philosophical study of valuation, and political economy as a composite formulation of values through which neo-liberalism is discursively entwined and progressed through a system of principles of e/valuation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48072218, "asset_id": 27792267, "asset_type": "Work",

sense-making processes of key stakeholders of Singapore\u2019s education: a historically dominant city-state, highly- qualified teachers, and high-performing students. The article interrogates the Teaching Schools Learning Nation policy initiative deployed toward achieving a knowledge-based economy.

Based upon a collection of policy texts from 2002 to 2012, our analysis illustrates that the metaphor of diversity in policy texts provides ways for systemic discrimination within the education system and that this inequality is given legitimacy as necessary through various moral discourses. The paper employs a critical discourse analysis that draws upon the relationship between language analysis, the philosophical study of valuation, and political economy as a composite formulation of values to highlight the ways in which an argument for inequality permeates policy from within a frame of meritocracy, and to analyse how changes associated with new modes of value determination serve to legitimize inequality.\r\n\r\n1. The article questions and challenges the official meritocratic principle of \u2018equal opportunities\u2019 (Wong, 2000) in Singapore's education system. Drawing on Foucault's and Nietzsche's philosophical perspectives, there is an explicit illustration through an in-depth analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in policy report/speech.\r\n\r\n2. Discourse builds in/tangible structures in society and greatly determines the possibilities of the now. As such, I am also arguing that it would be more difficult to 'help' any 'community' if the structural discrimination which has been deeply embedded, is not made explicit through national policies, and by this I mean an explicit illustration through an in-depth policy analysis of how inequality is inbuilt in Singapore's education policies. It may be through this that discriminatory structures could be substantially challenged.\r\n\r\nAn initial analysis of the original 1979 policy on primary school streaming which I conducted illustrates how dichotomous (arbitrary) categorization of pupils, i.e. 'slow' and 'fast' learners legitimates and sustains increasing institutional/structural access (over the years terms like 'talents' have been employed in policy discourse), of who gets privileged knowledge access. Through this, I also ask then to what ends do forms of 'categorization' or conventional designation entail? By this, given that categorization legitimizes structural access, my question is, what is 'Malay/Muslim community' and how is this categorization necessary?\r\n\r\n3. Even though the analysis in the article was based on Singapore's education system, it provides possible ways of understanding how inequality is continuously being inbuilt through policies on the basis of the ideology that economic growth is the (only) way forward. A way to critique this ideology is to expose its underlying assumptions. I believe the findings have much resonance with the widening inequality across many developed nations, as Singapore's policies have parallels with that of the U.K., U.S., and international organizations such as the World Bank.\r\n\r\n4. Economically considered, the transliteration of meritocratic discourse into the metaphor of diversity pinpoints how the appeal of development for all necessarily also demands the advance of inequity for the sake of the whole, i.e. advancing the 'growth with inequity' principle.\r\n\r\n5. The analysis highlights that value judgments are continually at work in the policy discourse and that despite the strong discourse of meritocracy that the Singapore education system promotes, it is argued that it is in the interests of the Singapore people that 'talents' should get privileged access to knowledge as it is through this that more 'opportunities' for the rest of the population are created. The findings demonstrate that although the underlying assumptions of this 'logic' that has been constructed in policies are unsubstantiated, the logic is continuously legitimated through forms of e/valuations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article has been featured in websites such as:

the different ethnic groups during the Japanese Occupation. This analysis is used to assess the explanatory power of the prevailing theories which distinguish between civic and ethnic forms of nationalism. The chapter analyzes all eight government-authored primary- and lower-secondary-level history and social studies textbooks from 1985 onwards. The findings indicate hat there has been an overall shift from an ethnocultural to a multicultural portrayal of the nation. While the 1985 history textbook focuses mainly on the experience of the Chinese community during the Occupation, and the following two sets of textbooks in 1994 and 1999 on the experiences of the Chinese and the Malay communities, the latest set of textbooks in 2007 include the stories of all four composite ethnic groups. While these findings show neither a clear convergence with nor a rejection of one or another theory, Brown\u2019s (2000) distinction between civic, ethnocultural and multicultural conceptions of the nation provides a more nuanced and useful tool for the analysis of the trend found in the textbooks.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35966057, "asset_id": 9791112, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 181005, "first_name": "Paul", "last_name": "Morris", "domain_name": "ioe-ac", "page_name": "PaulMorris", "display_name": "Paul Morris", "profile_url": "https://ioe-ac.academia.edu/PaulMorris?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/181005/3155649/3714972/s65_paul.morris.jpg"}, {"id": 284772, "first_name": "Khatera", "last_name": "Khamsi", "domain_name": "ioe", "page_name": "KhateraKhamsi", "display_name": "Khatera Khamsi", "profile_url": "https://ioe.academia.edu/KhateraKhamsi?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/284772/9302832/17604044/s65_khatera.khamsi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 6227440, "title": "Critical Perspectives on Singapore Education Reform: Exploratory Case Study of Information Communication Technology (ICT) Policy and School Leadership Responses", "created_at": "2014-02-27T07:39:50.281-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6227440/Critical_Perspectives_on_Singapore_Education_Reform_Exploratory_Case_Study_of_Information_Communication_Technology_ICT_Policy_and_School_Leadership_Responses?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_6227440", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33093971, "asset_id": 6227440, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3137889, "first_name": "Vicente", "last_name": "Reyes", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "VicenteReyes", "display_name": "Vicente  Reyes", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/VicenteReyes?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3137889/2447349/2858145/s65_vicente.reyes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7585, "name": "ICT in Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ICT_in_Education?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 6227458, "title": "Understanding classroom in dilemmatic spaces", "created_at": "2014-02-27T07:43:58.101-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6227458/Understanding_classroom_in_dilemmatic_spaces?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_6227458", "summary": "With the articulation of new \u2018Holistic and Balanced Assessment\u2019 initiatives in Singaporean schools, a new standard of conceptualising and enacting classroom assessment is expected of Singaporean teachers. This paper draws on findings from a study of the diversity of classroom assessment \u2018concourse\u2019, representing the variations in conceptions among the case studies of Singaporean primary- and secondary-school Music teachers, higher-education Music teachers and policy-makers. As such, the emphasis is on unravelling the multiplicity of significant relationships of conceptions within the specific context of Music teachers' classroom decision-making environments. The different conceptions from the Q-factor analysis, in particular, have revealed underlying bases of common and different views of classroom assessment. This suggests that classroom assessment, like many aspects of classroom teaching and learning, is not a stable entity. Rather, it is highly variable, contested and irreducibly situated in a specific context. The imagination, conviction and commitment of Music teachers, can inspire the wider education fraternities to consider how assessment can be compatible and complementary to the creativities of learning and teaching in the classroom.\r\n\r\nLink: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14613808.2013.878325#.VKdW3rkcRjo", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36136052, "asset_id": 6227458, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8326331, "first_name": "Wei Shin", "last_name": "Leong", "domain_name": "nie-sg", "page_name": "WeiShinLeong", "display_name": "Wei Shin Leong", "profile_url": "https://nie-sg.academia.edu/WeiShinLeong?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8326331/3022904/3551023/s65_wei_shin.leong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 683, "name": "Music Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_Education?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1750, "name": "Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4414, "name": "Formative Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Formative_Assessment?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77540, "name": "Classroom Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Assessment?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 100298, "name": "Teachers Conceptions of Assessment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teachers_Conceptions_of_Assessment?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 234333, "name": "Music in the Classroom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Music_in_the_Classroom?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 680191, "name": "Assessment in Music Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment_in_Music_Education?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 1305884, "name": "Singapore Classroom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Classroom?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 1739809, "name": "Assessment Progression", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessment_Progression?f_ri=158428"}]}, {"id": 27514670, "title": "International Mobility and Educational Desire: Chinese Foreign Talent Students in Singapore", "created_at": "2016-08-03T16:31:16.917-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27514670/International_Mobility_and_Educational_Desire_Chinese_Foreign_Talent_Students_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_27514670", "summary": "This book examines the Singapore government\u2019s controversial practice of recruiting students from China and granting them full scholarships on the condition of a service \u201cbond\u201d.

Singapore\u2019s holistic education initiative is being developed in these contexts, as well against the background of an education system that is increasingly witnessing its panoptical, disciplinary institutions take on the features of Gilles Deleuze\u2019s \u201ccontrol society\u201d. Holistic education is part of an evolving diagram of power that finds expression in mechanisms of modulatory control that monitor and measure the affective energies of students. The focus of this paper will be on holistic education assessments as a political technology of affective measurement that modulates the emotional, social and playful performativity of students. Two key Deleuzian insights inform my analysis. The first is the distinction that Deleuze, following Baruch Spinoza, makes between \u201caffects\u201d and \u201cemotions\u201d. Emotions denote subjective feelings about something or someone whereas affects for Deleuze are pre-personal, nonconscious and nonsignifiying bodily powers or potentials. Holistic education assessments attempt to register and represent the affections of the student body as subjective emotions and psychological categories (\u201csocial and emotional learning competencies\u201d). However, for Deleuze affect experienced as a nonconscious and transsubjective \u201cintensity\u201d can never be grasped or measured as a subjective emotion or psychological condition. Rather, the way we should understand the modulatory power of holistic educational assessments is not as a technology that gives measure to something that is intrinsically immeasurable, but as an instrumental force of limitation. Deleuze in his reading of Friedrich Nietzsche describes \u201creactive forces\u201d as those that \u201cseparate an active force from what it can do\u201d, and this is how holistic education is interpreted: as a reactive force that functions to limit and contain active forces of playful affirmation by profiling and modelling student subjectivities and measuring their affective labour.

"summary": "This paper, based on 12 months of fieldwork in Singapore and Malaysia, analyses policies of education as contested fields in these two countries. Malaysia is a multicultural society with 65% of Malay Malaysians and other Bumiputeras, 26% Chinese Malaysians and 7% Indian Malaysians. Ethnic categorizations build the basis for the Malaysian society, in which the Malay Malaysians benefit more from governmental policies than Chinese and Indian Malaysians do. Despite cultural diversity, Islam as the religion of the Malay Malaysians is the dominating one. The ethnically and religiously based social segregation has its rootedness in British colonial policies. Ethnic exclusion and inclusion were introduced through the education system also along gender- and class-specific lines. The emphasis on ethnic inclusion and exclusion in Malaysia so far hindered an expression of women\u00b4s and gender issues referring to women of all ethnic groups simultaneously. Singapore as a Southeast Asian Metropolis is a destination for migration for reasons of labour and education. Due to low birthrates, the city state promotes so called foreign talents from Primary School on, i.e. young people classified as intelligent, who shall be beneficial for the economy later on. The education and migration policies are related to ethnicity, class and gender. The majority of educational migrants in Singapore are Chinese Malaysian middle-class women. Not only are governmental policies factors for educational migration, the parents of young Chinese Malaysian women actively choose Singapore as a destination for further education of their children. By means of migration to Singapore, the young women develop their own ways to achieve social agency. The neoliberal education system and meritocratic society offer opportunities and access for migrants from \u201cmodern\u201d, Christian, middle-class backgrounds.

How do international students understand their relationship with the host society and host nationals? Based on in-depth interview data, this article investigates the ways in which international students from China at a Singaporean university understand the idea of 'integration' (or rongru in Chinese). It is found that these Chinese students tend to define 'integration' in terms of friendly and everyday social interactions, but their understanding has a more or less assimilationist underlying assumption. This explains their generally modest self-evaluations of their success at 'integration'. This article argues that this social and somewhat assimilationist understanding of integration might be explained in terms of the Chinese students' cultural-linguistic ideologies about rongru, and the characteristics of their social space, position and circumstances in Singapore as academically capable 'foreign talent' students on Singaporean government scholarships.", "downloadable_attachments":

Specifically, I argue that social actors negotiate educational migration within their gendered family constellations.

In the next sections, I discuss my ethnographic methods and examine a brief history of the state of research in gender and educational migration.

In 2001 and 2002 he was attached to the Global Positioning Systems Centre at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. He has written almost hundred research papers on navigation and satellite navigation and he used his knowledge in Singapore with great success.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay in Singapore Dr Krzysztof K. Vorbrich gave more than 20 lectures on the topic of satellite navigation at NTU and other scientific organisations in Singapore. His work as a scholar versed in satellite navigation was outstanding; he showed great proficiency in general navigation and performed his task as a lecturer and research worker with great success.\r\n\r\nI have introduced Dr Vorbrich to become a guest member of the Changi Sailing Club in Singapore. I have had the pleasure to sail with him dozens of times in the waters near Singapore and Malaysia. I have found his skills in practical navigation and boat handling to be commendable, and equal to his theoretical training in those matters.\r\n\r\nI understand that Dr Krzysztof K. Vorbrich is travelling to UK in order to get more practice in skippering yachts, teaching and training. He is also planning to collect research materials in British libraries, universities and museums for his second PhD, which he is writing in the School of English Language at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any help you can give him in his endeavour.

Through this we argue that augmenting linguistic analysis with philosophical perspectives develops and supports CDA scholarship more broadly by accommodating the shifting complexity of social problems of ideologically driven inequality that are inbuilt through, in our case, social policy texts. In discussing philosophical-methodological issues, the paper argues for the need to continually adapt CDA to the particular data so as to remain sensitive to and avoid hegemonic tendencies in analysis. Through adopting the principles of a working methodology, we discuss a micro-meso-macro CDA framework that draws on the analytical concepts of movement, metaphorical superfluidity, thematic condensation, and surrealism to conceive of a research approach capable of examining and comprehending evolving discourses of political economies. The most immediate benefit of this framework is its capacity to illustrate how forms of valuations perpetuated by and through policy discourse are the motivational locus of meaning making insofar as they strongly inform the moral underpinning the ideology of economic growth.\n\nKEYWORDS: Critical Discourse Analysis, philosophy, data-led methodology, valuation, evaluation, political economy, neo-liberalism, social policy, metaphor, surrealism", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 227900, "first_name": "Richard", "last_name": "Fitzgerald", "domain_name": "umac", "page_name": "RichardFitzgerald", "display_name": "Richard Fitzgerald", "profile_url": "https://umac.academia.edu/RichardFitzgerald?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/227900/50721/46220713/s65_richard.fitzgerald.png"}, {"id": 1182718, "first_name": "Nadira", "last_name": "Talib", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "NadiraTalib", "display_name": "Nadira Talib", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/NadiraTalib?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1182718/2368696/41345125/s65_nadira.talib.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 94, "name": "Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 938, "name": "Critical Discourse Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Studies?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3136, "name": "Qualitative methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_methodology?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5045, "name": "Critical Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Social_Theory?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 10633, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 15163, "name": "Qualitative Research (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research_Education_?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 18640, "name": "Ideology and Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideology_and_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 22540, "name": "Qualitative Research Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research_Methods?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 30086, "name": "Critical sociology and politics of education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_sociology_and_politics_of_education?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 101708, "name": "Political Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Discourse?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 182179, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis_CDA_?f_ri=158428"}]}, {"id": 15637363, "title": "the Development of a Framework for the Effective translation of Educational Research into Sustained Practice in Singapore", "created_at": "2015-09-12T21:15:25.155-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15637363/the_Development_of_a_Framework_for_the_Effective_translation_of_Educational_Research_into_Sustained_Practice_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_15637363", "summary": "In extension and scaling, deliberate efforts should be made towards seeding for a research-practice com-munity as a structure to engage the participants with the various context-instantiations.

To illustrate the adoption and consequences of neo-liberal education policy in China, this chapter focuses on recent curriculum reform in Shanghai. It is argued that there is a shift, through the implementation of neo-liberal education policy, from a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d educational model to one that focuses on individual interests and needs in China. However, the neo-liberal education policy in China faces two main challenges. First, although the educational changes attempt to promote more student- centred curriculum, pedagogy and assessment, key educational stakeholders in China still value traditional forms of teaching and learning that lead to academic success in high-stakes examinations. The second challenge is the de-professionalisation of school personnel where centralised control by the state through the school appraisal system and standardised exams threatens to undermine the professionalism and autonomy of the educators.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36583021, "asset_id": 10668474, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3137889, "first_name": "Vicente", "last_name": "Reyes", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "VicenteReyes", "display_name": "Vicente  Reyes", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/VicenteReyes?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3137889/2447349/2858145/s65_vicente.reyes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 207491, "name": "Curriculum Reforms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curriculum_Reforms?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 986115, "name": "Neo liberal Education Policies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neo_liberal_Education_Policies?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9640086, "title": "Fostering Creativity in the Land of Conformity", "created_at": "2014-12-05T13:49:43.610-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9640086/Fostering_Creativity_in_the_Land_of_Conformity?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_9640086", "summary": "The experience of being the Founding Dean of a new art school in Singapore, presented at DesignEd Asia 2010, Hong Kong.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35841315, "asset_id": 9640086, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3363462, "first_name": "Isaac", "last_name": "Kerlow", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "IsaacKerlow", "display_name": "Isaac Kerlow", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/IsaacKerlow?f_ri=158428", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3363462/6233202/7060366/s65_isaac.kerlow.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1751, "name": "Creativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creativity?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8787, "name": "Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 158428, "name": "Education Policies in Singapore", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policies_in_Singapore?f_ri=158428", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 173497, "name": "Nanyang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nanyang?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 572774, "name": "Teaching creativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_creativity?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 1704220, "name": "Singapore Creativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Creativity?f_ri=158428"}, {"id": 1704221, "name": "Nanyang Technological University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nanyang_Technological_University?f_ri=158428"}]}, {"id": 75701084, "title": "Education, Culture and the Singapore Developmental State: 'World-Soul' Lost and Regained?", "created_at": "2022-04-07T01:53:47.838-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75701084/Education_Culture_and_the_Singapore_Developmental_State_World_Soul_Lost_and_Regained?f_ri=158428", "dom_id": "work_75701084", "summary": "This book explores the role of education in the formation of the Singapore developmental state, through a study of education for citizenship in Singapore from 1955 to present day.

"dom_id": "work_25486438", "summary": "This book examines gendered allocations of meaning and social practices concerning educational migration paths from Malaysia to Singapore. The study is embedded in the disciplinary debates on migration and gender. The complexity of the issues of education, migration and gender as they operate along and across other axes of inequality and differentiation such as ethnicity and religion get analyzed by focusing the perspective of the social actors. The central questions that have guided the research are: Why do Chinese Malaysian women migrate to Singapore for further education? How do the social actors negotiate the education path in a gendered manner? Which strategies do the female educational migrants pursue through appropriation and allocation of certain gendered ideals and norms in transnational space?\r\nThe most important finding of the study points out that against the background of an ethnically segregated and patrilineal Malaysian society, educational migration to Singapore is the key for a transformation of femininity for Chinese Malaysian women as it implies extended scopes of action and relative independence. \r\nIn multicultural Malaysia, the Malay Malaysian population profits most from national politics. \r\nDespite cultural diversity in Malaysia, the government legitimates a cultural Malay supremacy. This is also linked to religion, as Islam has been established as the compulsory religion for the Malay Malaysians. These developments of in- and exclusion are based on colonial categorizations of \u2018race\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 and the concept of multiculturalism. The ethnic segregation was introduced during British colonial times mainly through the establishment of a formal education system. \r\nDue to the social emphasis on ethnic boundaries, broad, supra-ethnic political action regarding women\u2019s and gender issues has so far been difficult to organize. The Chinese Malaysian women have been denied equal access to education and equal participation in national gender politics for the last four decades. But not only do multicultural politics hamper women-related issues, but also patrilineal Confucian elements of the Chinese population group itself contribute to the poor implementation of gender-related claims.\r\nSingapore with its multiethnic meritocratic society is the destination for the educational migration of Chinese Malaysian women who seek more equal opportunities. Its \u201amodern\u2018 neoliberal education system opens up more possibilities for the migrants. The young Chinese Malaysian women do not only migrate to the \u2018modern\u2019, but also to the Chinese-dominated Singapore. Therewith, the migration process is also a means of ethnic distinction. Through appropriations of \u2018modern\u2019, Chinese-focused discourses on femininity, the social actors distance themselves from the Muslim Malay norms concerning family constellations, sexuality and romantic love as well as the body. \r\nBy means of change in perspective, the book not only analyzes the stories and topics of young Chinese Malaysian women, but also of female Malay Malaysian students with their perspectives on the similar issues. Through this complex picture, the transnational space between Singapore and Malaysia gets analyzed as a place of social order.
