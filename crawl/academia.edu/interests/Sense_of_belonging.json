In addition, results were compared between Latino students and their White counterparts. Findings reveal that grades, time spent studying, and interactions with diverse peers affect sense of belonging, accounting for approximately 11% of Latino students' belonging. Differences were found between Latino and White students. Important implications are discussed.\n\nResumen: El presente estudio estim\u00f3 la influencia de experiencias sociales y acad\u00e9micas en el sentido de pertenencia de estudiantes latinas/os; se controlaron las diferencias \u00e9tni-cas, usando t\u00e9cnicas de an\u00e1lisis jer\u00e1rquico con un dise\u00f1o de nido. Adem\u00e1s los resultados se compararon entre estudiantes latinas/os con su contraparte de estudiantes blancos. Los hallazgos revelan que las calificaciones, el tiempo usado en estudiar, y las relaciones con compa\u00f1eros diversos afectan el sentido de pertenencia; lo cual represent\u00f3 aproxima-damente 11% del sentido de pertenencia de los estudiantes latinas/os. Se encontraron diferencias entre estudiantes blancos y latinas/os. Se discuten implicaciones importantes.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48178232, "asset_id": 27892158, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4803905,

The present study sought to examine whether these themes relate to student academic achievement, as indicated by National Assessment Program \u2014 Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) scores. A stratified sample of 287 secondary schools in Victoria, Australia was analysed using two language analytic approaches: qualitative emergent coding and supervised lexical analysis. The highest academic scores occurred when mental health promotion was included, though results depended to some extent on the analytic approach and the level of aggregation. Results do suggest that explicitly prioritising both academic performance and mental health is beneficial.

Of key import was the indirect impact of students' perceptions of their school climate on both of these important academic outcomes, through their connection to both their school community and general school environment. Findings highlight the deleterious impact of school-based risk factors, including victimization and curricular silences, on educational outcomes for SSA youth.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50088839, "asset_id": 8756160, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 266078, "first_name": "Jacqueline", "last_name": "Ullman", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "JacquelineUllman", "display_name": "Jacqueline Ullman", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/JacquelineUllman?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/266078/65424/13253709/s65_jacqueline.ullman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3319, "name": "LGBT Issues (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Issues_Education_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9903, "name": "LGBT Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Youth?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11256, "name": "School Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Bullying?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22157, "name": "Academic Self Concept", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Self_Concept?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 81600, "name": "School Climate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Climate?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 7770065, "title": "''My School and Me''\u2014Exploring the Intersections of Insideness and Interior Environments", "created_at": "2014-07-24T06:57:08.912-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7770065/My_School_and_Me_Exploring_the_Intersections_of_Insideness_and_Interior_Environments?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_7770065", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34282880, "asset_id": 7770065, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57471050, "first_name": "Tasoulla", "last_name": "Hadjiyanni", "domain_name": "spanalumni", "page_name": "TasoullaHadjiyanni", "display_name": "Tasoulla Hadjiyanni", "profile_url": "https://spanalumni.academia.edu/TasoullaHadjiyanni?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57471050/19029671/18978736/s65_tasoulla.hadjiyanni.jpg"}, {"id": 14286565, "first_name": "Aileen", "last_name": "Strickland", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "aileenstrickland", "display_name": "Aileen  Strickland", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/aileenstrickland?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14286565/9352118/10423539/s65_aileen.strickland.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1063, "name": "Environmental Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5553, "name": "Interior Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Design?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 24375799, "title": "The Turks in Sweden in the Triangle of Acculturation, Integration and Homeland", "created_at": "2016-04-13T14:12:25.850-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24375799/The_Turks_in_Sweden_in_the_Triangle_of_Acculturation_Integration_and_Homeland?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_24375799", "summary": "In this field study, social, cultural, political identity and sense of belonging to Turks in Sweden, to which degree they are integrated into the country they live in, their perception about their homeland, and whether there is a difference between the generations about this subject were assessed in line with the data obtained in the research. The data obtained in the field study carried out in Stockholm, G\u00f6teborg and Malm\u00f6 cities, the most densely inhabited cities by Turks, and the analysis of the data was made using SPSS 18 programme. When the data obtained are analysed, it is revealed that Turks in Sweden care for the identity formation representing their homeland and its continuation in socio-cultural terms, and they generally tend to be conservative in this sense. Nevertheless, it is also understood that the contact of Turks in Sweden with Turkish culture and Turkey is gradually decreasing (when it compared to the past). This also reveals the differences between the generations. When that 3rd generation young Turks born in Sweden came to Turkey, they generally do not feel like in their homeland, but in a foreign country or a country they visit as guests, and this also related to this kind of change. While negativities occur at the point of active participation of the Turks in Sweden in the political system in this country, that they are generally in a positive level at the point of corporate integration is another result arising out of the data obtained in the field study.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44712578, "asset_id": 24375799, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

"summary": "This study explored the psychometric properties of a survey designed to measure the construct of belongingness based on a pilot administration of a new instrument. This exploration used Rasch measurement theory to determine the degree to which the instrument could be used to examine this construct within the context of language learning and instruction, and to inform revisions to the instrument prior to its use in future research. Pilot data for the new survey were collected from 249 undergraduate students enrolled at four universities in the Southeastern United States and displayed overall good fit to the Rasch model. Overall, the results suggested that the students reported complex perceptions of their own belonging, indicating neither isolation nor a close community in learning French. Students reported a general lack of pride or shame with complex disclosure patterns. Implications for theory, research, and practice suggest a need for further exploration of the various aspects of sense of belongingness, for the active cultivation of community, as well as for advocacy work.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54912804, "asset_id": 35052471, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26520101, "first_name": "Kris", "last_name": "Knisely", "domain_name": "universityofarizona", "page_name": "KrisKnisely", "display_name": "Kris  Knisely", "profile_url": "https://universityofarizona.academia.edu/KrisKnisely?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26520101/14302584/15247141/s65_kris.knisely.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1008, "name": "Second Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50569, "name": "Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 121115, "name": "Rasch measurement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rasch_measurement?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37891686, "title": "Lessons for Liberation: Reflections on the Study of hooks and Freire by Women of Color The Chicago School of Professional Psychology", "created_at": "2018-12-01T11:03:52.654-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37891686/Lessons_for_Liberation_Reflections_on_the_Study_of_hooks_and_Freire_by_Women_of_Color_The_Chicago_School_of_Professional_Psychology?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37891686", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57900017, "asset_id": 37891686, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 98357305, "first_name": "Monica", "last_name": "Boyd-Layne", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MonicaBoydLayne", "display_name": "Monica Boyd-Layne", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MonicaBoydLayne?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/98357305/21453380/20837787/s65_monica.boyd-layne.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9756, "name": "Racial Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17383, "name": "Clinical Supervision", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clinical_Supervision?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11961802, "title": "Connecting agents: Engagement and motivation in online collaboration", "created_at": "2015-04-15T11:50:49.483-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11961802/Connecting_agents_Engagement_and_motivation_in_online_collaboration?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_11961802", "summary": "This paper explores the relationship between social engagement and motivation to share knowledge in a\r\nhybrid college class using a web infused curriculum. Online social engagement, operationalized through concepts such as connectivity, social presence and social space has been an important topic of research in web based education for more than a decade. An important sub-text of this research is that online social engagement supports higher levels of collaboration. Students who feel comfortable with and connected to their online learning community are much more likely to be active participants in that community,\r\nworking together to develop and build knowledge systems. Much of this research refers to the more social/participatory based educational theories of John Dewey and L.S. Vygotsky. There is though a second component of collaboration that helps drive community building in this theoretical frameworks; motivation to engage in a shared, relevant, goal oriented activity. While most theories on social engagement assume natural relationships between online social engagement and motivation to participate in a community, this relationship is not often discussed and examined very often. This paper specifically compares the relationship between classroom connectedness and motivation to share knowledge between students in a hybrid, web infused class and a more traditionally oriented class with a small web component. Analysis did find a highly significant relationship between connectedness and motivation to share knowledge in the hybrid class but not in the traditional class, suggesting an important relationship, but one based at least partially in targeted experience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37316999, "asset_id": 11961802, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2259773, "first_name": "Michael Steven", "last_name": "Williams", "domain_name": "baruch-cuny", "page_name": "MichaelStevenWilliams", "display_name": "Michael Steven Williams", "profile_url": "https://baruch-cuny.academia.edu/MichaelStevenWilliams?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2259773/719821/17590756/s65_michael_steven.williams.jpg"}, {"id": 29754711, "first_name": "Michael", "last_name": "Glassman", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MGlassman", "display_name": "Michael Glassman", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MGlassman?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3668, "name": "Student Motivation And Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Motivation_And_Engagement?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4828, "name": "Collaboration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collaboration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35254, "name": "Collaborative Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collaborative_Learning?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 81130, "name": "Hybrid Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybrid_Learning?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1191356, "name": "Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internet?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 4790880, "title": "ISC Sense of Place", "created_at": "2013-10-16T13:54:41.581-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/4790880/ISC_Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_4790880", "summary": "Please note that this is the original unpublished version which has now been peer reviewed and published (see 'Making Sense of a Sense of Place' above). The review process required some significant editing changes be made to this original version. \n\nThe term \u2018sense of place\u2019 has become a ubiquitous piece of phraseology in contemporary Western culture; however its meanings are as diverse as its use is common. The primary aim of this paper is to clarify more precisely what the term \u2018sense of place\u2019 actually means, in response to the driving thesis that its present multifarious use renders the term so amorphous in meaning, that its power of meaning is lost. To corroborate this supposition, examples of the term\u2019s multiple uses are portrayed, including its conflation with the related terms \u2018spirit of place\u2019 and genius loci. The Roman term genius loci is identified as the root from which both the terms \u2018spirit of place\u2019 and \u2018sense of place\u2019 stem, and in order to untangle their conflated use, the interrelated history of all three terms are mapped from their respective points of inception to present day. Having established this etymological and historical foundation, the importance of being linguistically precise in our use of the term \u2018sense of place\u2019 is argued within light of the added theses that, a) fostering the subjective reality of sense of place is essential to individual and social welfare, and b) that using the term more exactly is a necessary prerequisite to its being taken seriously enough to be incorporated into Western systems of governance and social policy. Finally, distinct definitions for each of the different terms are suggested and briefly discussed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32092949, "asset_id": 4790880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3648349, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Spittles", "domain_name": "murdoch", "page_name": "BrianSpittles", "display_name": "Brian Spittles", "profile_url": "https://murdoch.academia.edu/BrianSpittles?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3648349/1285219/1598931/s65_brian.spittles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 186853, "name": "Cultural Planning, Destiny, Sense of Place, Spirit of Place, Genius Loci, Cultural Mapping, Placemaking, Local Distinctiveness, Place Identity, Cultural Tourism, Literary Tourism, Gestalt, Culture-Led Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Planning_Destiny_Sense_of_Place_Spirit_of_Place_Genius_Loci_Cultural_Mapping_Placemak?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 49454266, "title": "Communities of Practice Transition Group, June 2021: Supporting the transition of students' sense of\u00a0belonging, identities and\u00a0communities throughout the\u00a0Academic Year", "created_at": "2021-06-29T06:26:04.201-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49454266/Communities_of_Practice_Transition_Group_June_2021_Supporting_the_transition_of_students_sense_of_belonging_identities_and_communities_throughout_the_Academic_Year?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_49454266", "summary": "This presentation, delivered on 29th June 2021 for the Communities of Practice Transition Group, is from my MA Dissertation \u201cSomewhere they belong: Understanding the impact and influence on UK Undergraduate Students\u2019 Transitions, Identities, Sense of Belonging and Communities within a diverse and changing Higher Education sector.\u201d \n\nThis literature review, through story telling of fictional cases, explored the theories and practice of transition, identities, sense of belonging and communities, and how all of these together can influence the students\u2019 journey throughout University.

years, researchers have explored differential STEM major declaration and persistence rates among groups in college. Little is known about the specific mechanisms through which social networks affect persistence in STEM majors. Based on surveys with 2,000+ engineering and nearly 500 LGBTQIA+ STEM undergraduates, as well as 80+ interviews, we found that students' social networks were key in their declaration and persistence in STEM by helping students feel they fit in STEM. Specifically, parents provided emotional support wherein their children felt encouraged that they would be able to succeed in their difficult majors. Parents and teachers provided advice to women and underrepresented students in which they warned students that they would experience discrimination in their programs, and when they did experience this, the advice students received helped them cope. Underrepresented students who participated in race/ethnicity-focused professional engineering organizations (e.g. National Society of Black Engineers) saw engineers like themselves and were more likely to persist in their engineering degree programs than underrepresented students who did not participate in these organizations. Looking across their undergraduate career, the effects of social networks were most profound on the persistence of Black students in engineering. In addition, LGBTQIA+ students actively carved out social networks that would be affirming of their identities, particularly their gender minority identities (i.e. transgender), which helped them persist. In sum, this research highlights how the advice from individuals in their social networks helps students persist, specifically by improving their feelings of belonging in STEM.

Because of its consequential effect on persistence, we pay special attention to the fit domain of CMES-student feelings of belonging in their engineering program. We examine 1) how student fit is affected by participatory social capital (i.e., participation in professional engineering organizations [PEOs] that have as part of their mission a goal to assist students in their STEM education and careers), as well as 2) the factors that affect students' decisions to participate in PEOs. Due to the traditional prioritization of majority norms in engineering programs, women and URM students' CMES may conflict with the cultures manifested in engineering departments. Analysis of interviews with 55 women and URM engineering students shows that PEOs, particularly gender-and race-focused PEOs, affect students' feelings of fit. PEOs affect student fit positively and primarily through expressive social capital-emotional support wherein students feel they fit in because PEOs provide a sense of community and opportunities to be around successful women and URM engineers. PEOs also allow students to build instrumental social capital, such as academic and professional skills, including networking and knowledge development. Encouragement from others and their desire to be around people like themselves played a central role in students joining PEOs. However, students identified time, financial, and fit issues that discouraged them from participating in PEOs. This investigation illuminates how socially distant others from PEOs affect student fit, extending previous work which uncovered how more proximal others affect fit as well as previous work finding that URM students participating in PEOs were more likely to persist in their engineering program.

With that comes major problems, one of which is our strong and inevitable need for a sense of belonging to a group of people. As social beings who depend on a sense of common values and beliefs, and seek commonality, the feeling that we belong is very important. The aim of this paper is to reflect on how games can increase our sense of belonging through the human-centered design of mechanics and games. The method used to do so will be a survey conducted with people from different backgrounds and nationalities, which explores the factors that make us feel that we belong. As a result of the survey, a list of things that increase our feeling of belonging was introduced, such as coming from different cultures, yet being supported and not judged, understanding each other's jokes, or having similar interests. The sense of belonging of the participants was also measured when they've lived in countries different from their own. The survey's results allow us to pick out things that revolve around that feeling and to design game mechanics that empower the feeling of belonging between groups of people. This paper's aim is to define such mechanics and to contribute to the impact of games on feelings of belonging. It also contributes to the debates on whether games should be recognized as a source of social support, especially since video games have grown out to be a popular medium, which connects people from all around the world and provides them the opportunity to foster connections and build skills.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82390159, "asset_id": 74126054, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 209499152, "first_name": "Ertu\u011frul", "last_name": "S\u00fcng\u00fc", "domain_name": "bahcesehir", "page_name": "Ertu\u011frulS\u00fcng\u00fc", "display_name": "Ertu\u011frul S\u00fcng\u00fc", "profile_url": "https://bahcesehir.academia.edu/Ertu%C4%9FrulS%C3%BCng%C3%BC?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/209499152/69301756/64746116/s65_ertu_rul.s_ng_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2605, "name": "Serious Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Serious_Games?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4417, "name": "Game Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Game_Design?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5199, "name": "Video Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Games?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5200, "name": "Video Game Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Video_Game_Design?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 32199, "name": "Prosocial Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prosocial_Behavior?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 50932, "name": "Games", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Games?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 458026, "title": "Students\u2019 sense of belonging in technical/vocational schools versus academic schools: the mediating role of faculty trust in students", "created_at": "2011-02-27T20:22:12.272-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/458026/Students_sense_of_belonging_in_technical_vocational_schools_versus_academic_schools_the_mediating_role_of_faculty_trust_in_students?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_458026", "summary": "Background\nSince the late 1960s, research has demonstrated repeatedly that students in lower tracks achieve less, as they develop an anti-school culture to overcome the status deprivation resulting from being in a lower track. In quantitative large-scale research this anti-school culture is usually assessed using poor academic attitudes or study disengagement, because anti-school norms disengage students from the learning process. The extent to which students in different tracks feel embedded in their school communities, their sense of school belonging, has rarely been examined, although academic engagement and sense of belonging are related to each other and to achievement.\n \nObjective \nThis article examines students\u2019 sense of belonging in secondary schools offering different tracks and the role played by the faculty\u2019s trust in the students.\n\nParticipants\nThe study is based on data from 3,475 students and 754 teachers in 28 technical/vocational schools and 3,376 students and 461 teachers in 22 academic schools in Flanders\u2014that is the Northern, Dutch-speaking part from Belgium.\n\nResearch design\nUse is made of (stepwise) multilevel analyses (HLM6).\n\nResults\nThe analyses show that students in technical/vocational schools have a significant lower sense of belonging than students in academic schools. This association disappears if we take into account faculty trust in students. The association between school type and perceived teacher support, a subdimension of the sense of belonging, is not mediated by faculty trust, but is due to the lower GPA of students in technical/vocational schools.\n \nConclusions\nThe results indicate that teachers play a crucial role in the divergent nature of students\u2019 social integration across different types of schools. In terms of strengthening students\u2019 connectedness to a technical/vocational school environment, our results indicate that strengthening teachers\u2019 level of trust in students could be crucial.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31320934, "asset_id": 458026, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 65699, "first_name": "Dimitri", "last_name": "Van Maele", "domain_name": "katho", "page_name": "DimitriVanMaele", "display_name": "Dimitri  Van Maele", "profile_url": "https://katho.academia.edu/DimitriVanMaele?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/65699/18497/5794473/s65_dimitri.van_maele.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2597, "name": "School and student wellbeing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_and_student_wellbeing?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3043, "name": "Trust", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trust?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7820, "name": "Teacher Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Research?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 35306, "name": "Technical and Vocational Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technical_and_Vocational_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 41032929, "title": "My class needs my voice: The desire to stand out predicts choices to contribute during class discussions", "created_at": "2019-11-23T06:31:18.755-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41032929/My_class_needs_my_voice_The_desire_to_stand_out_predicts_choices_to_contribute_during_class_discussions?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_41032929", "summary": "Aim(s): Across two studies, we examine links between students\u2019 perceptions of the role of contributions to class discussions in helping them stand out, the importance they place on contributing, and the observed frequency of their attempts to contribute.\n\nMethod/rationale: We purposefully sampled pre-service teachers at a large university in the US. Two research assistants tracked pre-service teachers\u2019 contribution attempts during in-class discussions. In study 1 (N = 164), mediational pathways were examined to understand whether and why students participated more during the semester when they perceived contributions as a means of standing out in class. In study 2 (N = 143), we administered a distinctiveness intervention to half of the participants at the beginning of the semester.\n\nFindings: Results of the first study revealed that participants who believed contributing to class discussions was a means to stand out placed higher importance on contributing and made more contribution attempts.

Importantly, the project was aligned with the whole of undergraduate degree structure in order to achieve findings with transferability to other schools and higher education institutions.\n\nThe project sits within the context of the continually evolving nature of the higher education sector which presents numerous practical opportunities and challenges, not least of which is the changing role of higher education in civil society more broadly.

Boey and Michelle Cahill, Contemporary Asian Australian Poets. This essay engages with three of these poets: Debbie Lim, Shen and James Stuart, and reads their poems through a diasporic lens. Contrary to scholarship that investigates belonging using the more orthodox ideas of home and land, this reading engages with fluidity and mobility through the depictions of water to better represent the diasporic experience. Further, these poems employ desire and the desiring subject to engage with the way diasporic belonging is figured as contested and contingent. Each of these elements will be explored in the poems in order to investigate the link between diasporic belonging and depictions of water.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50341235, "asset_id": 29874101, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56717759, "first_name": "Rosalind", "last_name": "McFarlane", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "RosalindMcFarlane", "display_name": "Rosalind McFarlane", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/RosalindMcFarlane?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56717759/14912149/15677371/s65_rosalind.mcfarlane.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3581, "name": "Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poetry?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8084, "name": "Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12677, "name": "Desire", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Desire?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 141957, "name": "Asian Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 255793, "name": "Transnationalism, Asian Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism_Asian_Australian_Literature?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 735300, "name": "Fluidity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Fluidity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1071133, "name": "Water Imagery In Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Water_Imagery_In_Literature?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1323303, "name": "Asian-Australian Poetry and Poetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian-Australian_Poetry_and_Poetics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2570325, "name": "Asian Australian Poetry", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Australian_Poetry?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 11732186, "title": "Emotional Belonging Precedes Learning (Book Chapter 2010)", "created_at": "2015-03-30T23:24:51.467-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11732186/Emotional_Belonging_Precedes_Learning_Book_Chapter_2010_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_11732186", "summary": "Abstract: A sense of belonging stimulates motivation and\ninvestment in group goals and thus is extremely important\nfor productive communities. In this chapter, we look at\ntwo research articles discussing the impact of exclusion,\nor thwarted belonging, and draw parallels with classroom\nlife. The main finding is that when one isexcluded, they\ncan become even more anti-social and isolated in their\nbehavior. Suggestions are given for decreasing the chance\nof initial social exclusion and for finding ways to alleviate\nit once it may have occurred. Classroom group dynamics\nespecially benefit when teachers are aware of the signs of\nsocial exclusion early on so that they can counter them with\ninclusionary moves. Emotional belonging precedes learning,\nnot only for each individual but for all members in a group.\nIn other words, we contend that the group learns less when\nsome members have been excluded through bullying, self selected exclusion, or social loafing.

Since the 1970s, waria from other islands have moved to Papua, seeking better economic prospects. These circumstances, along with wider social change, have attracted indigenous Papuan waria to the community. Against the backdrop of the salon work and the exuberant nightlife that is typically part of their lives, waria can be regarded as agents of beauty in their milieu. The practices of beauty that waria embody and produce reflect the history of internal colonisation, the available imagined communities, and transnational beauty culture, all of which foster categories of belonging. Drawing on anthropological fieldwork in coastal Papua, with an emphasis on the waria beauty pageant, I demonstrate how, in response to social exclusion, waria strive for recognition by enacting strategies of belonging. In their beauty practices, waria aspire to belonging on the transnational and national scales in order to pursue communal belonging. The article underlines how the accomplishment of beauty in Papua is tied to the nation as much as to local aspirations for modernisation, which in turn positions indigenous Papuan waria under intersectional circumstances of gender and racialised ideals of beauty.\n\nKEYWORDS: Waria, transgender, Indonesia, beauty, West Papua, national belonging, embodiment", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60712632, "asset_id": 40449564, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8965071, "first_name": "terje", "last_name": "toomistu", "domain_name": "ut-ee", "page_name": "TerjeCece", "display_name": "terje toomistu", "profile_url": "https://ut-ee.academia.edu/TerjeCece?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8965071/2928209/30882206/s65_terje.toomistu.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4920, "name": "Anthropology of Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Gender?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 10336, "name": "Ethnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12093, "name": "Theories of Gender and Transgender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Gender_and_Transgender?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 26798, "name": "Transgender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53954, "name": "West Papua", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/West_Papua?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 68023, "name": "Beauty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beauty?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1301756, "name": "Waria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Waria?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 36774955, "title": "Belonging and Unbelonging: Space, Identity, and Imagination", "created_at": "2018-06-04T04:20:56.210-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36774955/Belonging_and_Unbelonging_Space_Identity_and_Imagination?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_36774955", "summary": "Conference paper/introduction for the 3 sessions on \"Belonging and Unbelonging\", Intersections/Intersezioni Conference, Florence, 30 May -

When Churches lockdown, and the faithful can no longer congregate to worship, what does it mean to belong in the communion of the Church? This essay draws from the thought of Augustine to argue that physical distance is an external reminder of the interior fragmentation of human existence aching for wholesomeness, constantly seeking union with the unbounded Church through the redemptive and performative sufferings of Christ. For Augustine, the community of the Church transcends place, and (meaningful) suffering is central to effecting authentic belonging therein. Augustine articulates the problem of belonging in terms of defining the truth of humanity in contraposition to alterity (\u00a7 1). Subsequently, Augustine makes a forceful attempt to integrate alterity within identity in order to account for how belonging is brought about (\u00a7 2). Eventually, Augustine situates alterity at the core of the structure of belonging (\u00a7 3) and he delineates the notion of unbounded belonging accordingly (\u00a7 4). Finally, Augustine provides a dynamic account of belonging as sacramental unity across alterity (\u00a7 5). Specifically, individual human suffering produces community when joined to the sufferings of Christ\u2019s body, the Church (\u00a7 6).

Contrary to some published Western academic literature, the research results conclude that higher levels of successes are achieved by individuals with an external locus of control expectancy. The research presents evidence of a shift away from a world that appreciates leaders with an ultimate self-belief of control, independence and autonomy, to leaders that appreciate external forces, and recognise the importance of connection and community. This move is triggered by feelings of loneliness, guilt and tiredness of competition when only autonomy and independence are sought. These triggers are allowing individuals not to merely seek physiological or safety needs, but to seek belongingness and deep-care needs. The implication of this change in leadership style is a move away from narcissistic leadership styles, towards servant leadership styles.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61292207, "asset_id": 41012629, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34309838, "first_name": "Kurt", "last_name": "April", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "KApril", "display_name": "Kurt April", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/KApril?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34309838/12204746/55896466/s65_kurt.april.jpg"}, {"id": 34829399, "first_name": "Dr. Babar", "last_name": "Dharani", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "DrBabarDharani", "display_name": "Dr. Babar Dharani", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/DrBabarDharani?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34829399/10152872/37286372/s65_dr._babar.dharani.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2969, "name": "Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8807, "name": "Servant Leadership", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Servant_Leadership?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20471, "name": "Leadership Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leadership_Development?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38837, "name": "Servant Leadership (Business)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Servant_Leadership_Business_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 86018, "name": "Locus of Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Locus_of_Control?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 152419, "name": "Career Success", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Career_Success?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 223890, "name": "Leaders", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leaders?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1280778, "name": "External Locus of Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/External_Locus_of_Control?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1280779, "name": "Internal Locus of Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal_Locus_of_Control?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1282006, "name": "Belongingness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belongingness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1283219, "name": "Internal- External Locus of Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Internal-_External_Locus_of_Control?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1342394, "name": "Successful Career", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Successful_Career?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3456519, "name": "Level of success", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Level_of_success?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3456520, "name": "Deep-care needs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep-care_needs?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3456521, "name": "Deep-care", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Deep-care?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3456522, "name": "Locus of control expectancy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Locus_of_control_expectancy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3456523, "name": "Measuring success", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Measuring_success?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37422410, "title": "Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o oral: \"AQUARIUS: um filme sobre mem\u00f3ria, cidade e alma feminina\"", "created_at": "2018-09-15T15:12:02.560-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37422410/Apresenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_oral_AQUARIUS_um_filme_sobre_mem%C3%B3ria_cidade_e_alma_feminina_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37422410", "summary": "ABSTRACT:\nThis paper analyses, within a perspective of interactions connecting female memory, city and everyday events, the long feature film Aquarius (Brazil, Kleber Mendonc\u0327a Filho, 146 min, 2016).

The researcher tried to shed light specifically on the impact of the socio-economic factor on the current state of Amman's Neighborhoods, and their future. \nThe study used several approaches to achieve its goals: the historical evolution approach which aimed to review factors contributing to emergence and development of cities; the descriptive approach which aims to focus on the case study, surveying and content analysis through coding and analyzing answers of interviewees; and the narrative approach where people residing in the chosen neighborhoods were encouraged to tell their stories and experiences to help in understanding the reality of these neighborhoods, and factors and transformation points that affected their formation.\nThe study used factor analysis to uncover variances among the chosen neighborhoods Amman by analyzing thirty-eight economic, social, and demographic factors that have been presented in population and housing census for the year 2015. Nvivo program was used to statistically analyze data retrieved from interviews in the field study part of the study. \nThe study has concluded that the end of seventies and the beginning of the eighties of the twentieth century is considered a transformation point in the history of Amman city, as neighborhoods started to form according to the likeness in social and economic levels of its people, while disregarding the factors of shared ethnic origins or the shared place of where they have immigrated from, which established the origin of those neighborhoods before the seventies of the twentieth century, As the socio-economic factor has dominated the reality of life in Amman's neighborhoods, it became the main factor that impacted their emergence and formation. People started to head towards creating new neighborhoods according to resemblances in social and economic levels. Hence, it became obvious that this new factor has canceled older factors that have earlier affected the emergence of these neighborhoods. This factor has also dominated the current status and will affect the future status, as it led to decrease in social relationships among people residing the neighborhoods understudy, and turned them into shallow relationships based on advantage and personal interests, and have led to lack of feelings of belonging to the place of residence, and have led to decrease in decisions related to choosing residence near relatives or tribe or similar ethnical groups. The study concluded that there is no one unified theory for explaining the emergence of Amman neighborhoods that could be put forward. \nThe study recommended that future research should investigate peoples\u2019 movements among Amman\u2019s neighborhoods, and factors leading to these movements, and studying the role of functional housing and private housing in the emergence and development of new neighborhoods in Amman and other cities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65225155, "asset_id": 44739250, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26235250, "first_name": "Dr. Arij", "last_name": "Dagarah", "domain_name": "pass", "page_name": "DrArijDagarah", "display_name": "Dr. Arij Dagarah", "profile_url": "https://pass.academia.edu/DrArijDagarah?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26235250/7485375/19486073/s65_arij.albargothi.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 206, "name": "Social Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Change?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4484, "name": "Economic Growth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Growth?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16016, "name": "Citizenship and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 243427, "name": "Amman", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amman?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2357263, "name": "Greater Amman Municipality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Greater_Amman_Municipality?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 29665487, "title": "Queer Theory: The French Response", "created_at": "2016-11-04T06:28:42.160-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29665487/Queer_Theory_The_French_Response?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_29665487", "summary": "The notion of gender was debated in France long before the 2013 law on marriage equality.

This is exemplified in the current literature through reported experiences of loneliness, isolation, homesickness, and the feeling of being \u2018between two worlds\u2019. However, there is an absence of research that relates these issues with the established ability for architecture to influence occupant wellbeing. Few studies have focussed on the potential role of interior design in contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experiences of education. The aim of this doctoral thesis was to address this gap through a process of Participatory Action Research (PAR), in which data were collected by yarning and drawing with 27 current boarders (all Aboriginal people, 2 young men, 25 young women), 18 recent alumni (all Aboriginal people, 3 men, 15 women), and 7 boarding staff members (1 Aboriginal person, all women). Four major themes emerged that suggest a role for interior design in increasing student sense of belonging. These relate to the institutional characterisation of current boarding schools (Place Identity), an \u2018all or nothing\u2019 experience of social connectedness (Interior Architecture as a Social Atlas), the value of student participation in ongoing interior design actions (Spatial Voice), and the need for spaces that offer social and cultural relief (Third Space). From these themes, a new theoretical model for designing belonging is proposed - \u2018the feedback model\u2019. In this model, the built environment is conceptualised as a reciprocal storytelling tool for messages about identity and belonging. Although only a snapshot of voices is reported, it is proposed that the findings could have broader application to residential education settings.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65369532, "asset_id": 44859814, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23297980, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Whettingsteel", "domain_name": "curtin", "page_name": "EmmaWhettingsteel", "display_name": "Emma Whettingsteel", "profile_url": "https://curtin.academia.edu/EmmaWhettingsteel?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23297980/6328979/38624772/s65_emma.whettingsteel.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1607, "name": "Participatory Action Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_Action_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5553, "name": "Interior Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Design?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25474, "name": "Aboriginal education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aboriginal_education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 94266, "name": "Student Housing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Housing?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 111535, "name": "Boarding Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Boarding_Schools?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 8621641, "title": "Belonging: Australians, Place and Aboriginal Ownership.

Even if this can be aimed in \u2018good\u2019 emotions, sometimes this cannot be successful.

Spaces can be changed within time due to utilization and the user behavior in terms of perception, experience, cultural background and preferences.\nAim of the study is to examine the effects of the space on user behaviors in the variety of dorms that have common living areas. Furthermore, this research enhances the understanding of cultural differences of a similar age group\u2019s behaviors in dorms and how territorial behavior differs based on culture.  Spatial analyses addressed four behavioral contexts: personal space, territoriality, privacy and crowding.  Two dorms from two different countries having cultural differences are determined as case study area with mixed-gender dorms at Lublin University in Poland and single-gender dorms at D\u00fczce University in D\u00fczce, Turkey. In the present study, shared bedroom and common space usage of students influences environmental behaviors in terms of sharing behavior as well as the degree of personalization Data are collected through observations, interviews and photographic images. Acquired data are assessed in determined theoretical frame.\n\tThe results show that users generally want to transform the spaces for their needs;  and also their physical boundaries are defined according to their cultural backgrounds. It is observed that the spaces that provide personalization or a degree of alternative solution for socializing also affect to the sense of belonging of the dorm user who does not necessarily share concerns background with the neighbors. \n\nKeywords: Interior Space, Territorial Behavior, Cultural Differences, Spatial Transformation, University Dorms, Sense of Belonging\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50477408, "asset_id": 30021427, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 26389061, "first_name": "B\u00fc\u015fra", "last_name": "Berber", "domain_name": "manchester", "page_name": "b\u00fc\u015fraberber", "display_name": "B\u00fc\u015fra  Berber", "profile_url": "https://manchester.academia.edu/b%C3%BC%C5%9Fraberber?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/26389061/7305251/18199636/s65_b_ra.berber.jpg"}, {"id": 337823, "first_name": "Erincik", "last_name": "Edg\u00fc", "domain_name": "gplus", "page_name": "ErincikEdg\u00fc", "display_name": "Erincik Edg\u00fc", "profile_url": "https://gplus.academia.edu/ErincikEdg%C3%BC?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/337823/401486/13114896/s65_erincik.edg_.jpg"}, {"id": 7402109, "first_name": "Dilara", "last_name": "GOK\u00c7EN UNER", "domain_name": "duzce", "page_name": "DilaraGOK\u00c7ENUNER", "display_name": "Dilara  GOK\u00c7EN UNER", "profile_url": "https://duzce.academia.edu/DilaraGOK%C3%87ENUNER?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7402109/2717735/18794028/s65_dilara.g_k_en.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 61864, "name": "Cultural Differences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Differences?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 341011, "name": "Interior Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Space?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 736011, "name": "Spatial Transformation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Transformation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2449787, "name": "Territorial Behavior", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Territorial_Behavior?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 28022291, "title": "The Feeling of Migration: Narratives of Queer Intimacies and Partner Migration", "created_at": "2016-08-26T01:44:41.629-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28022291/The_Feeling_of_Migration_Narratives_of_Queer_Intimacies_and_Partner_Migration?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_28022291", "summary": "This dissertation analyzes narratives of queer partner migration. The purpose of the study is to examine how queer partner migrants and their Swedish partners experience the migration process by analyzing the emotions and feelings that emerge in the process. \n\nThe focus is the queer partner migration relationship, and what emotions and feelings \u2018do\u2019 to this relationship, but also how emotions and feelings structure the migration process. The study analyzes the work three different emotions \u2013 love, loss, and belonging \u2013 do in these migration processes, and how this work is described in the participant narratives. \n\nBy using affect theories and the concept of queer phenomenology, the dissertation shows how the work is connected to gender identity, sexual identity, race and whiteness, nationality, perceived proximity to Western-ness, class, language, and the migration narrative the migrating partner is (or is not) written into by way of the country they have migrated from. This is analyzed in relation to the theoretical frameworks of entanglement, homonationalism, and intimate citizenship. \n\nThe analysis shows that emotions and feelings structure the migration process for both more privileged and less privileged migrants, but in different ways. The understanding of who \u2018is\u2019 a migrant, and the preparedness for the feelings that arise in a migration process, are tied to the positions mentioned above, and the privileges these positions give, or do not give, the migrant access to. By focusing on emotions and feelings and what these do, the study also illustrates how the migration process affects the non-migrating partner who, amongst other things, engages in emotional labour to \u2018make\u2019 the migrating partner \u2018Swedish.\u2019 \n\nBoth narratives and storytelling are important throughout the dissertation, not only as the method used in the analysis but as the form of the dissertation.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48328622, "asset_id": 28022291, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 481465, "first_name": "Sara", "last_name": "Ahlstedt", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SaraAhlstedt", "display_name": "Sara Ahlstedt", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SaraAhlstedt?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/481465/916729/4075798/s65_sara.ahlstedt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10187, "name": "Love", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Love?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18880, "name": "Narrative Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Narrative_Analysis?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 23747, "name": "Loss and Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Loss_and_Trauma?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 30181, "name": "Gender Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76967, "name": "Homonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homonationalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 111399, "name": "Marriage Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marriage_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 125614, "name": "Queer Migrations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Migrations?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1316917, "name": "Privileged Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Privileged_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1377832, "name": "Intimate Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intimate_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2519071, "name": "Partner Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Partner_Migration?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 68630845, "title": "Social Connectedness in Physical Isolation: Online Teaching Practices That Support Under-Represented Undergraduate Students' Feelings of Belonging and Engagement in STEM", "created_at": "2022-01-18T13:20:44.213-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68630845/Social_Connectedness_in_Physical_Isolation_Online_Teaching_Practices_That_Support_Under_Represented_Undergraduate_Students_Feelings_of_Belonging_and_Engagement_in_STEM?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_68630845", "summary": "The COVID-19 outbreak spurred unplanned closures and transitions to online classes. Physical environments that once fostered social interaction and community were rendered inactive. We conducted interviews and administered surveys to examine undergraduate STEM students\u2019 feelings of belonging and engagement while in physical isolation, and identified online teaching modes associated with these feelings. Surveys from a racially diverse group of 43 undergraduate students at a Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) revealed that interactive synchronous instruction was positively associated with feelings of interest and belonging, particularly for students of color, while noninteractive instruction reduced social belonging, but was related to more cognitive engagement. Small group and one-on-one interviews with 23 of these students suggest that students derived feelings of connectedness from their instructors, peers, and prior experiences and relied on their sense of competency to motivate themselves in the course and feel a sense of belonging. Two embedded cases of students in physics classrooms are compared to highlight the range of student feelings of connectedness and competency during the lockdown. Findings reaffirm that social interaction tends to support belonging and engagement, particularly for under-represented (Black or African American and Hispanic) racial groups in STEM. STEM instructors who aim to support feelings of belonging and engagement in virtual learning environments should consider increasing opportunities for student\u2013student and student\u2013teacher interactions, as well as taking a flexible approach that validates and integrates student voice into instruction. Future research is needed to further explore the themes of relatedness and competency that emerged as aspects of course belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79046839, "asset_id": 68630845,

Yet behind the nation\u2019s official image of multicultural \u2018unity in diversity\u2019 lurk deep socio-economic inequalities and inter-ethnic tensions that are insistently critiqued in its literature. This book analyses how the idea of belonging \u2013 a sense of attachment to, and identification with, a place or people \u2013 is articulated in a range of contemporary francophone Mauritian novels. The island-nation\u2019s complex, contested history and the multi-ethnic composition of its modern-day population mean that belonging is a central but fraught issue in both reality and fiction. Adopting an eclectic, multi-dimensional theoretical framework, Waters explores how affirmative forms of affective belonging intersect with, and are frequently inhibited by, the exclusionary \u2018politics of belonging\u2019 at communal, national and international levels. Waters offers in-depth and comparative analyses of novels by Nathacha Appanah, Ananda Devi, Shenaz Patel, Bertrand de Robillard, Amal Sewtohul and Carl de Souza. Despite their striking thematic and formal diversity, these novels are shown to be characterised by a common rejection of dominant discourses of ethnic, diasporic affiliation and by a strong, common commitment to the ongoing, future-orientated project of Mauritian nationhood.

Written by two academic scholars who share a belonging to feminist post-humanist thought and a Muslim upbringing, we turn our attention to the everyday violence of the border regime in the hope of developing an architectural research methodology for working with precarious lives. A question that animates this chapter is what kinds of violence can/should we bear testimony to through our role as architects in relation to the spatial violence endured in refugee camps and in the circulatory movements of the undocumented? We address this question through a feminist lineage approaching witnessing as an embodied spatial practice. Emphasising the centrality of the body alongside an investment in the way emotions circulate across difference produces what we term \u201caffective witnessing\u201d. Through discussing an architectural design studio, we explore how we might register our affective witnessing basing it in a politics of belonging as distinct from the approach of humanitarian NGOs whose professionalised practice of witnessing is often a strategic exercise designed to produce evidence within institutional or legal contexts.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65414617, "asset_id": 44896084, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7864937, "first_name": "Aya", "last_name": "Musmar", "domain_name": "wwwuop", "page_name": "AyaMusmar", "display_name": "Aya Musmar", "profile_url": "https://wwwuop.academia.edu/AyaMusmar?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7864937/7094640/57599443/s65_aya.musmar.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6996, "name": "Migrant Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16997, "name": "Globalization And Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Higher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33005, "name": "Refugee Camps", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_Camps?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47736, "name": "Decolonial Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonial_Thought?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69094, "name": "Critical Spatial Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Spatial_Practice?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 486968, "name": "Racialised Pedagogies and Whiteness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racialised_Pedagogies_and_Whiteness?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 28258252, "title": "Chapitre 3 - Le propre de l'\u00e9trang\u00e9it\u00e9 au prisme des effets de sa rencontre et des efforts de son int\u00e9gration", "created_at": "2016-09-05T01:33:43.533-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28258252/Chapitre_3_Le_propre_de_l%C3%A9trang%C3%A9it%C3%A9_au_prisme_des_effets_de_sa_rencontre_et_des_efforts_de_son_int%C3%A9gration?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_28258252", "summary": "Chapitre trois de ma th\u00e8se (Venir \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 : une sociologie de l'hospitalit\u00e9 et de l'appartenance), soutenue en 2009.

A survey was conducted with 20 people living in the Companions' neighborhood. The effects and relationships of the physical characteristics of the urban space and the socio-economic characteristics of the individuals on the perception and sense of belonging were determined. According to the results of the survey, time and social ties in the field were found to be the strongest components affecting belonging.

Both authors have, during their childhood and adolescence, been confronted with a society that tried to exclude them for being \u2018different\u2019 and not fitting in the heterosexual norm. Suddenly, they don\u2019t belong anymore, but the need for belonging still exists, despite the insults they have been exposed to. By trying to identify exactly how their feeling of belonging is treated throughout their texts, the analysis deals with the process of transformation they undertake. It\u2019s about a re-appropriation of identity that is linked to the stigmatisation felt by the authors, upon being excluded from their families and native environment, due to their homosexuality. How does the need for belonging take form, not only in the authors\u2019 explicit discourse, visible to all, but also by more implicit stylistic means? Are there any indications to the style that can be associated with the expression of emotions in their texts? Combining socio-literary theories with stylistics, the aim is, on the one hand, to look into the role of the performative statements in the assignment of places in the societal hierarchy, as well as the individual\u2019s process of identity re-appropriation. On the other hand, the objective is to attempt a positioning of gay self-writing in the French autobiographical tradition, in order to determine whether or not one can consider this relatively recent emancipatory form of writing a specific genre \u2013 or sub-genre \u2013 of autobiographical writing. The analysis shows that the consequences of the performative statements issued by society are far-reaching, eclipsing not only the authors\u2019 feeling of self, but also triggering a perpetual self-questioning, where a constant sorting of memories takes up a central place in the process of identity re-appropriation. But it also demonstrates that gay self-writing has a performative power in that it is able to \u201cwrite back\u201d to society and take possession of a vacant autobiographical space.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59911166, "asset_id": 39733149, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42589080, "first_name": "J\u00f8rgen Holb\u00f8ll", "last_name": "Green", "domain_name": "lu", "page_name": "J\u00f8rgenGreen", "display_name": "J\u00f8rgen Holb\u00f8ll  Green", "profile_url": "https://lu.academia.edu/J%C3%B8rgenGreen?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42589080/14180450/20961903/s65_j_rgen.green.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 660, "name": "French Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1629, "name": "French Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4918, "name": "Gay And Lesbian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gay_And_Lesbian_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 6667, "name": "LGBT Issues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Issues?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7297, "name": "Autobiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autobiography?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 11169, "name": "Homosexuality and Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homosexuality_and_Literature?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 13158, "name": "LGBT Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Literature?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 41733, "name": "Homosexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homosexuality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 72394, "name": "LGBT Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 106154, "name": "Litt\u00e9rature Fran\u00e7aise", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Litt%C3%A9rature_Fran%C3%A7aise?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 19070807, "title": "Making Sense of a Sense of Place", "created_at": "2015-11-26T18:21:45.079-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19070807/Making_Sense_of_a_Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_19070807", "summary": "Please note that this is the published version of the 'ISC Sense of Place' document below. The review process required some significant editing changes from the original. \r\n\r\nThe term \u201csense of place\u201d has become a ubiquitous piece of phraseology in contemporary Western culture; however its meanings are as diverse as its use is common. The primary aim of this paper is to clarify more precisely what the term \u201csense of place\u201d actually means, in response to the driving thesis that its present multifarious use renders the term so amorphous in meaning, that its power of meaning is lost. First, to corroborate this supposition, examples of the term\u2019s multiple uses are portrayed, including its conflation with the related terms \u201cspirit of place\u201d and genius loci. Next a genealogical examination of the term \u201dsense of place\u201d is undertaken, beginning with its roots in the Roman terms genius and genius loci. The historical circumstances relating to the introduction of the term genius into the English language during the 14th century and genius loci during the 18th century are then appraised. The next phase of appraisal is the late 19th century emergence of the terms \u201csense of place\u201d and \u201cspirit of place\u201d within British and American literature, and their ostensible connections and conflations with genius and genius loci. Beyond this, a post-1900 linguistic shift is investigated whereby the older terms of genius and genius loci are gradually superseded by sense of place and spirit of place. The final section proposes some practical ramifications in being more precise in the use of each of these terms and distinct definitions are suggested for each to demonstrate that such clarifying differentiation and precision of meaning is possible.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40413964, "asset_id": 19070807, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3648349, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Spittles", "domain_name": "murdoch", "page_name": "BrianSpittles", "display_name": "Brian Spittles", "profile_url": "https://murdoch.academia.edu/BrianSpittles?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3648349/1285219/1598931/s65_brian.spittles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86090, "name": "Spirituality of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirituality_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 350457, "name": "Spirit of place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirit_of_place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 517962, "name": "Genius loci", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genius_loci?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1294462, "name": "Spirit of the Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spirit_of_the_Place?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 763574, "title": "Place, Place Identity, and Phenomenology (2012)", "created_at": "2011-07-20T13:04:42.982-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/763574/Place_Place_Identity_and_Phenomenology_2012_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_763574", "summary": "NOTE: The ideas and examples in this article are now much more fully developed in David Seamon, LIFE TAKES PLACE: PHENOMENOLOGY, LIFEWORLDS, AND PLACEMAKING (London: Routledge, 2018). The most important shift is the author's realizing that genius loci is part of a broader phenomenon that he identifies as \"common presence\"--\"the material and lived 'togetherness' of a place impelled by both its physical and experiential qualities\" (Seamon 2018, p. 87). I would ask readers of thIs article to complement their understanding by studying LIFE TAKES PLACE.\n\nABSTRACT OF ORIGINAL ARTICLE: As recent phenomenological studies have demonstrated (Casey 1997, 2009; Malpas 1999, 2006; Mugerauer 2008; Stefanovic 2000), the phenomenon of place is a multivalent structure sophisticated and complex in its existential constitution. In this chapter, I offer one phenomenological vantage point from which to examine this lived complexity. I contend that, as an integral structure of human life, place can be understood in terms of three dimensions: first, the geographical ensemble\u2014i.e., the material environment, including both its natural and human-made dimensions; second, people-in-place, including individual and group actions, intentions, and meanings; and, third, spirit of place, or genius loci.\n\nDrawing on the conceptual approach of \u201csystematics\u201d developed by the British philosopher J. G. Bennett, I argue that these three dimensions can engage in six different ways, each of which relates to one particular lived mode whereby place contributes to human life. These six modes are: (1) place interaction; (2) place identity; (3) place creation; (4) place intensification; (5) place realization; and (6) place release.\n\nI argue that place identity is important for understanding the nature of place but is complemented by other modes of relationship that together help clarify the complexity and richness of place and place experience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57516256, "asset_id": 763574, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 93547, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Seamon", "domain_name": "ksu", "page_name": "DavidSeamon", "display_name": "David Seamon", "profile_url": "https://ksu.academia.edu/DavidSeamon?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/93547/25922/29662134/s65_david.seamon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5178, "name": "Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6008, "name": "Place-Identity (Architecture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place-Identity_Architecture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7268, "name": "Place (Architecture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Architecture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7624, "name": "Place Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14617, "name": "Phenomenology of the body", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_the_body?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16391, "name": "Space And Place (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_And_Place_Art_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 23797, "name": "Phenomenology (Research Methodology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_Research_Methodology_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24135, "name": "Experiences of Place and Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experiences_of_Place_and_Space?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25616, "name": "Phenomenology of the Body (Philosophy)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_the_Body_Philosophy_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 26247, "name": "Ecophenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecophenomenology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28139, "name": "Place identity (Architecture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_identity_Architecture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 178742, "name": "Place Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 245241, "name": "J.

In fact, it is a rare occurrence to live and die in the settlements that were born as in ancient times. People change their homes repeatedly for a variety of reasons such as education and job opportunities, and higher quality of life. However, such mobility is sometimes voluntary and sometimes forced. In the process of urban transformation, where the mobility of the densely dwelling people is realized, the concept of place attachment becomes an important satisfaction parameter. If people leave their habitat in the process of transformation of the dwelling area, it causes the loss of sense of place. This leads to a decrease in the quality of life and the satisfaction level of the user.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59075349, "asset_id": 38970904, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2901284, "first_name": "ilkim", "last_name": "markoc", "domain_name": "yildiz", "page_name": "ilkimmarko\u00e7", "display_name": "ilkim markoc", "profile_url": "https://yildiz.academia.edu/ilkimmarko%C3%A7?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2901284/958634/64347954/s65_ilkim.markoc.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1786012, "name": "Placemaking Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Placemaking_Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 24656892, "title": "Enhancing the student experience", "created_at": "2016-04-22T04:51:16.526-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24656892/Enhancing_the_student_experience?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_24656892", "summary": "Discussion on the concept of 'the student experience' and  challenges to delivering this; what students value most in terms of their experience, and how institutional departments across the piste can work collaboratively to generate positive experiences for students.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44984495, "asset_id": 24656892, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83710, "first_name": "sarah", "last_name": "parkes", "domain_name": "newman", "page_name": "sarahparkes", "display_name": "sarah parkes", "profile_url": "https://newman.academia.edu/sarahparkes?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83710/23322/35982324/s65_sarah.parkes.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3456, "name": "Partnership Working", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Partnership_Working?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4828, "name": "Collaboration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Collaboration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7110, "name": "Student Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Engagement?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56421, "name": "Student Experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Experience?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 81405, "name": "Student retention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_retention?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 82174, "name": "University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/University?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 415913, "name": "Student transition, persistence, and retention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_transition_persistence_and_retention?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 39732187, "title": "Racial Microaggressions and Sense of Belonging at a Historically White University", "created_at": "2019-07-01T21:23:05.857-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39732187/Racial_Microaggressions_and_Sense_of_Belonging_at_a_Historically_White_University?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_39732187", "summary": "This study applied critical race theory to explore the racial microaggression experiences of students of color (i.e., African American, Asian American, Latinx, and Multiracial students) at a historically White university.

The findings indicated that African American students reported experiencing a significantly greater frequency of racial microaggressions than Asian American, Latinx, and Multiracial students.

Abstract: Emotions can be physical experiences. They may cause an unpleasant pressure on your shoulders, contract the skin over your collarbones, or make your arms or chest burn. They can fill your body with aggression, cause a pleasant warmth in your abdomen, or obstruct your breathing. This paper discusses emotions as physical and material phenomena\u2014as matter\u2014 and the possibility to understand them as an artistic medium that, comparable to clay, plaster or paint, can determine the character of artworks.\r\n\r\nTo explore emotions as artistic medium, I shall consider art scenes as \u201cemotional communities\u201d structured by systems of feelings (Ahmed, 2004, Rosenwein, 2010, 2002). Such structures prescribe certain relations between a given aesthetic expression and its supposed emotional force in particular settings. One does not have to agree with a system of feelings, or even share its dominant emotions, but within an emotional community it will still bind certain aesthetic gestures to particular emotions. This, in turn, affects inclusions and exclusions, art historiography, and judgements of quality within the community.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, I will analyse three art performances by Anna Linder, Line Skywalker Karlstr\u00f6m and Jenny Gr\u00f6nvall, which use the emotion of shame to problematize art scenes as emotional communities, from queer feminist perspectives.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57669268, "asset_id": 37679600, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56983080, "first_name": "Ellen", "last_name": "Suneson", "domain_name": "lu", "page_name": "EllenSuneson", "display_name": "Ellen Suneson", "profile_url": "https://lu.academia.edu/EllenSuneson?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56983080/18634571/33673199/s65_ellen.suneson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 254, "name": "Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1192, "name": "Feminist Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 35256, "name": "Shame", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shame?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 64453, "name": "Gestures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gestures?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 89799, "name": "Embarrassment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embarrassment?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 580358, "name": "Structures of Feeling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Structures_of_Feeling?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 996370, "name": "Aesthetic Judgement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetic_Judgement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1014433, "name": "Politics of Inclusion and Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_Inclusion_and_Exclusion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1642070, "name": "Emotional Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotional_Community?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 69135850, "title": "Loneliness, Grief, and the Lack of Belonging", "created_at": "2022-01-22T04:00:55.662-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/69135850/Loneliness_Grief_and_the_Lack_of_Belonging?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_69135850", "summary": "It seems plausible to maintain that loneliness involves experiencing the lack or absence of something. However, it is less clear what, exactly, is experienced as missing. In this chapter, I take my lead from the phenomenologist and psychiatrist, J. H. van den Berg, who emphasizes a distinctive way of experiencing one's surroundings.

Many of his short stories focus on the sense of despair and dislocation caused by the partition of Pakistan and India in 1947. Manto vividly recreates the anger and horrors of this period and the trauma of refugees uprooted and victimized by the delineation of arbitrary borders. As the characters in Manto's stories confront the ruthless inhumanity of Hindu-Muslim violence, murder, rape and mutilation-their only conceivable response is madness. \" (Alter 91) Thus Stephen Alter has correctly pointed out the characteristic of Manto's short stories that deal with partition: madness. As Alter says, although many writers have written great works on the partition of India creating a Pakistan, many works were from the point of view of what our society calls, \" normal \" people. But Saadat Hasan Manto has taken another step towards defining the trauma of partition by shifting the mike from the sane to the insane people. What would partition be for them? What does it feel like? Do they even care? Does their unstable mind and brain make them realize the trauma of getting ripped off from somewhere one belongs to? These questions are naturally to be pondered upon while reading this work. Along with this concept of madness and identity crisis comes a unique form of resistance. Manto thus worked on these, which made his work a masterpiece in today's world. One thing about this work which is compelling is that Manto did not take sides of either of the parties. His whole notion about partition was, \" Hindustan had become free. Pakistan had become independent soon after its inception but man was still slave in both these countries-slave of prejudice \u2026 slave of religious fanaticism \u2026 slave of barbarity and inhumanity. \" Thus, the ills already prevailed but partition fueled it with more hatred. The whole story is centered around the insane lot of Hindu and Muslim people from the then India and Pakistan, who are been send to their places, the places where their religion 'belongs' to. \" These people being the victims of partition have showed very reasonably and intelligently the resistance to the partition, when the news reached to them. The questions asked by the lunatics repeatedly carry an ambiguity, which needs to be justified and answered. Though for people living a rational and saner life, these people are mere commodities which need to be exchanged based on their religion, but for Manto these people are more rational and saner who possess the unconditional love and harmony among each other. \" (European Academic Research Vol II, Issue 7 / October 2014, 4). The controversial area throughout the play is a land called Toba Tek Singh, which was initially in India but now in Pakistan. This name also bears its own historical significance. As is mentioned in a certain blog post: Toba is a word in Punjabi that means 'Pond'. It is a district in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The town and district is named after a Sikh religious figure Tek Singh. Legend has it that Mr. Singh a kind hearted man served water and provided shelter to the worn out and thirsty travelers irrespective of any cast or creed who passed by a small toba which eventually was called Toba Tek Singh and surrounding settlement acquired the same name. Toba Tek Singh was developed by British toward the end of the 18th century when a canal system was built. People from all over Punjab moved there as farmlands were allotted to them. \" Thus, this kind of place after partition was nowhere to be figured out leading to the ultimate irony of the partition. The speaker of our short story Bishan Singh probably belonged to this place. This place which once belonged to all types of people irrespective of their caste now resisted partition by disappearing into thin air.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56059547, "asset_id": 36162055, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9500066, "first_name": "Heena", "last_name": "Godambe", "domain_name": "ruiacollege", "page_name": "HeenaGodambe", "display_name": "Heena Godambe", "profile_url": "https://ruiacollege.academia.edu/HeenaGodambe?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9500066/3038932/3571783/s65_heena.godambe.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11310, "name": "Partition literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Partition_literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41079, "name": "Alienation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alienation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 96098, "name": "Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resistance?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36990411, "title": "MESKHETIAN (AHISKA) TURKS IN TURKEY AND THEIR PERCEPTION OF SPATIAL BELONGING", "created_at": "2018-07-06T00:45:48.154-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36990411/MESKHETIAN_AHISKA_TURKS_IN_TURKEY_AND_THEIR_PERCEPTION_OF_SPATIAL_BELONGING?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_36990411", "summary": "In its various aspects, the subject of \"belonging\" has been an important fundamental indicator in terms of understanding the social belonging relations throughout the history of humanity.

The direction of the predominant preferences by the Meskhetian Turks regarding spatial belonging will be examined via the selected sample. It will be questioned how much the Governments in the position of being decision makers as the political power in Turkey in the 1992-2017 period affected the \"migration management\" policy on the Meskhetian Turks in terms of \"encouraging\" or \"discouraging\" arrival in Turkey. In addition, the subject of how much attention the Meskhetian Turks who have returned to Turkey at\nincreasing rates in the recent years draw in the public opinion and of how much social adaptation to the Turks in Turkey is achieved will be questioned through in-depth interviews. Moreover, their emotions about spatial belonging will be scrutinized.

University\u2019s Centre\r\nfor Trust, Peace and Social Relations, organised a peer-reviewed workshop titled\r\n\u2018Sense of Belonging in a Diverse Britain\u2019 inviting papers from scholars and relevant\r\npractitioners who wish to share and explore ideas and research findings concerning\r\nthe sense of belonging in contemporary Britain\u2019s diverse society. The Dialogue\r\nSociety sees a broad and seemingly reasonable consensus that a sense of belonging\r\nis vital for a thriving and peaceful society, and accordingly wishes to contribute to\r\nilluminating its character and effects, as well as exploring how a sense of belonging\r\ncan be cultivated.\r\n\u2018Sense of belonging\u2019 is a phrase often heard in discussions of the social cohesion\r\nand, in particular, instances of its breakdown. Following the urban disturbances\r\nof summer 2011, commentators across the spectrum speculated about how rioters\r\ncould have come to feel so little sense of belonging to their local area that they\r\ncould loot and torch their local shops and incite such fear in their communities.\r\nThe Reading the Riots research undertaken by LSE and the Guardian cited a sense\r\nof alienation as a widely-shared characteristic of the rioters, with barely half feeling\r\n\u2018part of British society.\u2019 The same questions about sense of belonging, or the lack of\r\nit, have been asked in the wake of terrorist attacks in which young British people\r\nbrought up in Britain have murdered fellow citizens. The need to belong is also\r\nfrequently cited as a key driver of gang membership.\r\nThe social problems and crime associated in public discourse with the lack of a sense\r\nof belonging are not the preserve of ethnic/cultural minorities. In this workshop,\r\nwe invited contributors to shed light on the nature, causes and effects of a sense\r\nof belonging and of its absence in minority and majority communities alike. We\r\nsought to examine the impact of a lack of sense of belonging, both in extreme cases\r\nsuch as crime and anti-social behaviour, as well as in a more general context. We\r\nhave a particular interest in contributions exploring how the absence of a sense of\r\nbelonging might be addressed.\r\nIn our call for papers, we invited researchers and practitioners to to address questions\r\nsuch as the following:\r\n\u2022 Do we need more clarity about British values in order to promote a sense\r\nof belonging in British society? If so, who identifies those values, and\r\nhow?\r\n\u2022 Has \u2018state multiculturalism\u2019 encouraged or undermined a sense of\r\nbelonging?\r\nWhere in British society are we seeing a lack of sense of belonging?\r\n\u2022 Is the cultivation of a sense of belonging best served by paying more\r\n(affirmative) attention to cultural difference, or less?\r\n\u2022 Does a strong sense of belonging to a particular cultural group tend to\r\nenhance or undermine people\u2019s relationships with the wider community?\r\n\u2022 How do we achieve a healthy balance between celebrating diverse\r\nidentities and cultivating a sense of common belonging to Britain? How\r\ncan families and communities keep their distinctive heritage alive while\r\ncultivating a sense of belonging where they are?\r\n\u2022 What factors - social, political, economic and/or cultural - encourage a\r\nsense of belonging in British society?\r\n\u2022 What are the most significant barriers to feeling a sense of belonging in\r\nBritain?\r\n\u2022 How far does immigration status (including citizenship) affect people\u2019s\r\nsense of belonging?\r\n\u2022 What is the role of sense of belonging, and/or the lack of it, in gangs,\r\nurban disturbances and \u2018home-grown\u2019 terrorism in the UK?\r\n\u2022 How does a lack of sense of belonging impact people\u2019s lives, aside from\r\nthe cases of those involved in crime or antisocial behaviour?\r\n\u2022 How do traditional British symbols such as the Union Jack function in\r\nBritish society (to encourage and express belonging and/or to exclude\r\nfrom belonging)?\r\n\u2022 \u2018United\u2019 Kingdom? In an age of devolution, and as Scotland debates an\r\nindependent future, is it to \u2018Britain\u2019 that British citizens feel they belong?\r\n\u2022 How far does Britain\u2019s foreign policy affect the sense of belonging of\r\nBritish citizens with roots abroad?\r\n\u2022 What role can/should the British education system play in instilling a\r\nsense of belonging?\r\n\u2022 What effect, if any, do faith schools have on pupils\u2019 sense of belonging to\r\nthe wider community?\r\n\u2022 What is the role of the third sector in encouraging a sense of belonging\r\namong diverse communities?\r\n\u2022 The controversy of citizenship tests: what must a person know in order\r\nto belong in Britain?\r\n\u2022 How far is the lack of a sense of belonging a (neglected) problem within\r\nmajority communities? How can the problem be addressed?\r\n\u2022 What can be done, by parents, schools, or voluntary organisations, to\r\nhelp young people negotiating complex identities to grow up with a\r\nsecure sense of belonging?\r\n\u2022 How far does faith shape where, and to whom, British citizens feel they belong?\r\n\u2022 Does nationalism necessarily involve placing limits on who can belong?\r\n\r\nWe are delighted to make the workshop papers available in this proceedings\r\npublication in which some of those questions and issues above are tackled. It should\r\nbe noted that the ideas expressed in this volume are those of the authors and do not\r\nnecessarily reflect the position of the Dialogue Society.

This, in turn, provides them with the opportunity to develop their creative processes. It is shown that artists\u2019-in-residence openness and willingness to travel internationally is, on the one hand, related to the development of information technology, and on the other, supported by travelling facilities, which have impact on lifelong learning and cultural maintenance. Whereas change of geographical environment is often associated to psychological and physical conditions, artists\u2019 statements reveal the dichotomy and paradox between globalization, collaboration and dispersion versus isolation, individualism and concentration. Possibilities for documenting and circulating artworks through digital communication tools and in-situ supply support and generate knowledge and recognition. All these possibilities, however, are challenged by uncertainty. The acknowledgment of cultural differences and barriers is expressed by artists in the most varied ways, especially through performance art and site-specific installations. As a source of inspiration, cross-cultural environments are negotiated by artists\u2019 hybrid identities, situated at the intersection of Western and Non-Western aesthetic traditions. Artists\u2019 cross-cultural environments are composed of international and intercultural communication issues and practices, where the sense of place, environmental awareness through multisensory experiences and the importance of everyday routines are reflected. \nMethodologically, this research is two-fold, based on a qualitative content analysis of selected artists-in-residence statements and artworks, and on a conceptual framework developed on social processes, artists\u2019 individual motivations and technology purposes.\n\nKeywords: artists-in-residence, mobility programmes, creative processes, cross-cultural environment, hybrid identities, mobility, technology, digital media, cultural hybridity, intercultural communication, sense of place, environmental awareness.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50738657, "asset_id": 30272146, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1550574, "first_name": "Rita", "last_name": "Vargas de Freitas Matias", "domain_name": "jyu", "page_name": "RitaVargasdeFreitasMatias", "display_name": "Rita Vargas de Freitas Matias", "profile_url": "https://jyu.academia.edu/RitaVargasdeFreitasMatias?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1550574/546972/15833382/s65_rita.vargas_de_freitas_matias.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 915, "name": "Art History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2869, "name": "Digital Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Digital_Media?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7454, "name": "Information Communication Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Communication_Technology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24129, "name": "Cross-cultural studies (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cross-cultural_studies_Culture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 57928, "name": "Travel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travel?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 110429, "name": "Environmental awareness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_awareness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 175238, "name": "Creative processes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creative_processes?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 213081, "name": "Contemporary Printmaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Printmaking?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37051595, "title": "Wrapped in the Flag of Israel: Mizrahi Single Mothers and Bureaucratic Torture -- Revised Edition with a New Afterword", "created_at": "2018-07-15T16:37:17.738-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37051595/Wrapped_in_the_Flag_of_Israel_Mizrahi_Single_Mothers_and_Bureaucratic_Torture_Revised_Edition_with_a_New_Afterword?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37051595", "summary": "What is the relationship between Mizrahi feminism and Israeli ultranationalism? What is the relevance of gender justice activism to the 2014 Gaza War and Israel\u2019s foreign policy? \n\nWrapped in the Flag of Israel Second Edition examines neoliberal bureaucracy in the Global South using feminist critical race theories. It interrogates the relationship between the State of Israel and its Mizrahi single mothers who are at the forefront of Mizrahi feminism. It also presents a model of bureaucracy as divine cosmology that preempts the agency of disenfranchised Mizrahim who are Israel\u2019s demographic majority. Mizrahi protests fall flat when the Israel-Palestine conflict dominates the headlines. While most studies of neoliberal bureaucracy employ a Foucauldian or Marxian lens, this book illustrates how Israeli bureaucracy draws on a theological essence that fuses religion, gender, and race into the foundations of citizenship. It sets out to understand why Mizrahi mothers remain loyal to a state that injures them though its bureaucratic system.\n\nThe extensive Afterword to the Second Edition connects intra-Jewish racial and gendered dynamics to the 2014 Gaza War. It tracks sequences that began with social protest and ended with elections that bolstered Israel\u2019s political right. In between came bloodletting between the IDF, the Palestinian Authority, and Israel\u2019s neighboring Arab states. The 2014 Gaza War was a watershed, but not only in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Under the smokescreen of war, Israel accelerated neoliberal economic reform. The first victims of this restructuring were Mizrahi single mothers. Palestinians, however, would pay the highest price for Israel\u2019s Mizrahi-Ashkenazi rift. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57002347, "asset_id": 37051595, "asset_type": "Work",

This brings into focus the women's shifting and multilayered negotiations for personal space and belonging. This book explores the life memories of the now aging female ex-combatants in the province of Niassa in northern Mozambique, looking at how the female ex-combatants' experiences of living in these northern landscapes have shaped their sense of socio-spatial belonging and attachment. It builds on the premise that individual embodied memory cannot be separated from social memory; personal lives are culturally shaped. Thus, the book does not only tell the history of a small and rather unique group of women but also speaks about wider cultural histories of body-landscape relations in northern Mozambique and especially changes in those relations. \n\nEnriching our understanding of the gendered history of the liberation struggle in Mozambique and informing broader discussions on gender and nationalism, this book will be of interest to students and scholars of African history, especially the colonial and postcolonial history of Lusophone Africa, as well as gender/women's history and peace and conflict studies. \n\nJonna Katto is Postdoctoral Researcher in African Studies at the Department of Languages and Cultures at Ghent University, Belgium.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61973295, "asset_id": 41836172, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 522024, "first_name": "Jonna", "last_name": "Katto", "domain_name": "helsinki", "page_name": "JonnaKatto", "display_name": "Jonna Katto", "profile_url": "https://helsinki.academia.edu/JonnaKatto?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/522024/183890/59555929/s65_jonna.katto.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3719, "name": "Combat Veterans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Combat_Veterans?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3896, "name": "African History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6337, "name": "Oral history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_history?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25594, "name": "Sensory Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensory_Ethnography?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 49663, "name": "Women and Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 150843, "name": "Liberation movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberation_movements?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 305834, "name": "History of Mozambique", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Mozambique?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 495135, "name": "Lusophone Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lusophone_Africa?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019274, "name": "Nationalism and Decolonization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_and_Decolonization?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 45643785, "title": "The psychometric evaluation of the sense of belonging instrument (SOBI) with Iranian older adults", "created_at": "2021-03-30T07:59:42.261-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45643785/The_psychometric_evaluation_of_the_sense_of_belonging_instrument_SOBI_with_Iranian_older_adults?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_45643785", "summary": "Background: A sense of belonging is a significant predictor of mental health and well-being in later life. A sense of belonging in childhood and adolescence contributes to a number of adult behavioural and psychological outcomes. A high sense of belonging has been associated with better health, longevity, psychological well-being, and disease recovery. Methods: In this study, the Persian version of the Sense of Belonging Instrument (SOBI) for older adults in Iran was evaluated psychometrically to develop an accurate measure for belonging. Participants in the study were 302 older adults, 60 years old and above, living independently in Iran and chosen through convenience sampling. Results: An exploratory factor analysis indicated that the four-factor structure, which included 16 items, accounted for 54.12% of the total variance, and was characterized by strong factor loadings, with values ranging from .50 to .87. Thereafter, a confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the four-factor latent structure of the SOBI, providing adequate data-model fit statistics. All latent structures were characterized by adequate-to-strong latent construct (H) internal reliability (\u03b1) coefficients. Conclusions: The Persian version of the SOBI is a useful tool in understanding older adult patients' sense of belonging when living independently within the community. The implications for practice and research are discussed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66139766, "asset_id": 45643785, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

The physiological\ncapacity for Dominicans to sense difference is culturally\nand politically filled by national, regional,\nand often under researched local understandings and\npractices that attempt to define \u201cambiguous notions\nof\u201d national identity and whiteness. Drawing on\n10 years of ethnographic data and personal encounters\nin the field and situating them within Post-September\n2013 Constitutional Court ruling, I argue\nthat through an examinations of these moments of\nnegotiable belonging a nuanced understanding of\nDominican national identity and its relation to\nwhiteness, race, class, and gender emerges, one that\ngoes beyond questions of citizenship rights and civil\nduty\u2014matters that lie within the state and its institutions\u2014to\nencounters in the streets among individuals\nwhose actions at times consolidate and\nnaturalize state power and national discourse, and\nat other times, contradict and challenge it.

These texts helped to formulate new narratives, articulate attitudes, and build relationships, create a sense of community within the protestors\u2019 side, which had its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices.\nFacebook served as an important platform for the initial appeal, for coordination between the participants, for reflections, and for identification of the opposing sides during the protests. It was a key space for sharing emotions, personal stories, humor and expressive forms of protest, making allusions to known literary works, historical events and world public figures.\nExploring the types of narratives and their contribution in identifying the opposing sides, the work is focused on digital stories that illuminate elements not covered by the professional media coverage and official reports. It traces the diverse forms, topics and expressive devices in the narratives, and identifies the categories of lore (eyewitness narratives, (re)telling of stories, jokes, poetry, songs, etc.). It provides juxtaposition of the patterns found in the text with the main events of each specific day. \nThe thesis provides several chapters that focus on: (1) a review of the historical context of the events; (2) an analysis of the data with reference to all categories and topics, and the main findings; (3) the role of humor and expressive devices in releasing the tension of the conflict and in helping to formulate the attitudes within the protestors\u2019 side; (4) evidence of the functions of personal stories as they build relationships, create a sense of community, and validate the participants\u2019 experiences and the significance of the events from the protestors\u2019 perspectives; (5) interpretation within this protest lore, and its impact on institutional changes of commemorative practices as in the example of the Nebesna Sotnia (Heavenly Hundred) narrative formation and its correlation to the repertoire of motifs and terms of the selected historical periods: the Cossack, the Ukrainian National Republic and World War II.\nThe study underlines the relevance of time and several patterns related to historical events, as Facebook posts immediately responded to the events occurring on the square and streets occupied by protestors, simultaneously with professional media outlets, and sometimes prior to them. These findings have important implications that go beyond the Ukrainian context in that they contribute to the further exploration of social networks functioning in relation to factual events.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53646657, "asset_id": 33632356, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50733725, "first_name": "Nataliya", "last_name": "Bezborodova", "domain_name": "ualberta", "page_name": "NBezborodova", "display_name": "Nataliya Bezborodova", "profile_url": "https://ualberta.academia.edu/NBezborodova?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50733725/13402307/23074490/s65_nataliya.bezborodova.jpg"}, {"id": 18655131, "first_name": "Nataliya", "last_name": "Bezborodova", "domain_name": "ualberta", "page_name": "NataliyaBezborodova", "display_name": "Nataliya  Bezborodova", "profile_url": "https://ualberta.academia.edu/NataliyaBezborodova?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18655131/5181899/5933291/s65_nataliya.bezborodova.jpg_oh_619547f8298819119fd26f835b267041_oe_54b4e0ef___gda___1420488318_37675f98ae4c425728acc950b430bdf2"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5310, "name": "Language, Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8769, "name": "Intangible cultural heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intangible_cultural_heritage?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11452, "name": "Memory Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11474, "name": "Commemoration (Memory Studies)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_Memory_Studies_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16391, "name": "Space And Place (Art)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_And_Place_Art_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19764, "name": "Intangible Cultural Heritage (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Culture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24135, "name": "Experiences of Place and Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Experiences_of_Place_and_Space?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 47191, "name": "Historical memory and Identity studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_memory_and_Identity_studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 68355, "name": "Imagining", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagining?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 78121, "name": "Memory Studies/historical Memory and Identity/", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_Studies_historical_Memory_and_Identity_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 82632, "name": "Memory and Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memory_and_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 94755, "name": "Community building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_building?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 123392, "name": "Social Theory, Urban and Cultural Studies, and the Interactions Between Urban Space, Politics, Memory, and Subjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Theory_Urban_and_Cultural_Studies_and_the_Interactions_Between_Urban_Space_Politics_Memor?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 151359, "name": "Anthropology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 157784, "name": "Space, place and culture;

To provide a real-world context for my argument, I present three narrative accounts of ordinary and out-of-the-ordinary place experiences written by interior designer Jane Barry (2012); British-African novelist Doris Lessing (1984); and sociologist Eric Klinenberg (2002). Using these three examples as evidence, I contend that place is an integral, non-contingent aspect of human life and helps to explain why well-being can typically be out of sight and thus not recognized as a significant dimension of one\u2019s day-to-day experience. I conclude that, because of the always-already-present reciprocity between human-immersion-in-place and lived obliviousness, professional efforts to enhance well-being might sometimes be more successfully accomplished indirectly by changing aspects of place, including creative neighborhood design and planning that facilitate place attachment and a strong sense of environmental belonging.\n\nFULL REFERENCE: Seamon, David.

"Literature abounds detailing the trauma experienced by Black and Latino males in traditional school environments, but less research has explored the role community-based youth programs play in specifically supporting Black and Latino males in counteracting, healing, growing, and thriving through the trauma experienced in educational contexts and beyond. In this qualitative research study examining the experience of eight Black and Latino male high school students attending programming at the Deep Center, a community-based afterschool program in the Deep South, participant observation data were triangulated with semi-structured interviews, analysis of creative artifacts (produced and performed), as well as organizational literature and materials. \nFindings indicate that Black and Latino males are incredibly aware of the negative, racialized, and deficit-based labels that exist about them and how those labels determine how they are perceived, treated, and ultimately disciplined, a process first experienced in elementary school. Some Black and Latino males are directly antagonized, questioned, and called thugs or in a variety of ways--whether intentional or unintentional--publicly humiliated, shamed, or discriminated against by teachers. And when they lash out, punishment is harsh, swift, and uncompromising, without any consideration of school personnel as perpetrators. As a result, Black and Latino males silence themselves or completely disengage and give up in traditional school environments because they feel like no one cares about them. But in Deep programming, Black and Latino males felt empowered, affirmed, liked/loved, respected, and free to be vulnerable, resulting in the crafting of healing literacies, which I call \u201crainbows,\u201d that use  autoethnography and performance to develop 1) a reflective art practice that empowers youth to describe their lived realities and engage in critical self-reflection, and 2) transformational relationships that create a safe and brave environment for vulnerability and critical caring and humanizing literacies, which, in turn, empower Black and Latino males to transform the conditions of their oppression through advocacy, activism, and art. The metaphor of \u201crainbows,\u201d inspired by a poem written by one of the youth participants, is used as a framework for examining the key components of healing literacies, based on the scientific explanation of how rainbows are formed, through reflection, refraction, and dispersion.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61890168, "asset_id": 41732543, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 52390110, "first_name": "Keith", "last_name": "Miller Jr.", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KeithMillerJr", "display_name": "Keith F Miller Jr.", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KeithMillerJr?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/52390110/13844337/32426501/s65_keith.miller_jr..png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 698, "name": "Men's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mens_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1601, "name": "Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3398, "name": "Educational Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3482, "name": "Adolescent Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adolescent_Literacy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4052, "name": "Arts Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4792, "name": "Juvenile Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Juvenile_Justice?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 9823, "name": "Multicultural Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multicultural_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 13283, "name": "Social Justice in Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Justice_in_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25992, "name": "Adolescent Education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adolescent_Education_Education_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 35686, "name": "Trauma", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 41314, "name": "Multimodal Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multimodal_Literacy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 51126, "name": "English Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 54487, "name": "Educational Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Inequality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 77068, "name": "Black Masculinity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Masculinity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 78309, "name": "Critical Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Literacy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 154002, "name": "Urban Education, Critical Theory/Pedagogy, Critical Literacies, Youth Culture, Hip Hop Culture, Curriculum & Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Education_Critical_Theory_Pedagogy_Critical_Literacies_Youth_Culture_Hip_Hop_Culture_Curr?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 237848, "name": "In and out-of-school literacy development of English language learners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In_and_out-of-school_literacy_development_of_English_language_learners?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 436480, "name": "Education of Black Males", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_of_Black_Males?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 41058897, "title": "MINORITIES, MAJORITIES, AND THE MONARCH: NATIONALIZING EFFECTS OF THE LATE OTTOMAN ROYAL PUBLIC CEREMONIES, 1808 -

The  researchers  hoped to gain  a  more  refined  understanding  of  the  identity  of  online  learners.  Participants  were interviewed one-on-one after which a Thematic Analysis was conducted.

The findings support previous research in illuminating the importance of interaction and finding that students differ in their desire for community however it was also found that participants experienced a disconnect between the act of studying and identifying as a student.

The lieu of these transformations, in Mansour\u2019s writings, is the poetic speaker, while, in Lispector\u2019s prose, it is to be found in her experiments with first-person narratives. The article suggests that we understand their major formal innovations as aesthetic comments on the complexities of belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59001942, "asset_id": 38903261, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 82282917, "first_name": "Susanne", "last_name": "Zepp", "domain_name": "cives-school", "page_name": "SusanneZepp", "display_name": "Susanne Zepp", "profile_url": "https://cives-school.academia.edu/SusanneZepp?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/82282917/19837460/23643607/s65_susanne.zepp.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 20972, "name": "Jewish Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40542, "name": "Clarice Lispector", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clarice_Lispector?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43538, "name": "Jewish Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jewish_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696942, "name": "Joyce Mansour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joyce_Mansour?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 768477, "name": "Politics of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 926581, "name": "Anti Essentialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anti_Essentialism?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 11766145, "title": "The Puzzle of Chuukese Mobility Patterns\u2014Contradictory, Dualistic, or Pluralistic?", "created_at": "2015-04-02T03:11:18.444-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11766145/The_Puzzle_of_Chuukese_Mobility_Patterns_Contradictory_Dualistic_or_Pluralistic?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_11766145", "summary": "Education, employment, and health care are the three main reasons given by Micronesians\nfor the ongoing flow of migrants to the USA.

For international students, moving from their 'home' countries to a new country entails significant changes in their everyday lives. Moving across continents and temporarily or permanently settling in a 'foreign' land are the stepping stones to an intensely mobile existence. They maintain transnational connections with their 'home' country, and move across and between different social spaces locally, primarily with the help of friendship networks. Framing the research around theoretical underpinnings of migration, transnationalism, and (im)mobilities in the context of 'home' for Indian students in London and Toronto, the research involved 72 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 36 students, together with self-directed photography of their everyday life and solicited week-long diaries. The research has two main aims. The first is to explore the emotional, material, sensorial, and embodied nature of 'home' and their spatialities in three different spaces: the city, university, and dwelling. Second, the research aims to unearth the multi-layered nature of their socio-spatial identities through their everyday spatialities. The main findings re-instated the importance of place as experiences of the students in the spaces of the city, university, and dwelling varied (and were also similar) in London and Toronto. Also, apart from diverse sociocultural backgrounds of the Indian students, there were characteristic differences in the motivations for migration. This also pointed towards the significance of place, with London and Toronto attracting two different kinds of Indian students.

One of these needs is the sense of belonging that we can accept as part of the identity. This sense of belonging comes third in the order of importance in the pyramid of needs of Abraham H. Maslow. In other words, as Maslow points out, it is inevitable that the individual, which we call belonging or belonging, feels belonging to a culture that will constitute an identity. Otherwise, it is inevitable that cosmopolitan types, who cannot hold on, are alienated from themselves, their society and culture. In this context, although Yahya Kemal never reached cosmopolitanism, this alienation and search for belonging continued for a long time. In the process of this search, Yahya Kemal, who completed the individual evolution with the effect of \u2018the other\u2019, completed the process of self- realization, which was expressed at the top of the pyramid of Maslow. This self-realization, which came to an end as a result of feeling his / her identity and belonging to an identity with everything, has enabled Yahya Kemal to capture the inner voice that would constitute the music of Turkishness and Islam in a very calm mood. While Yahya Kemal is looking for this endless voice of his identity, there are a number of factors that influence his life. This work is an attempt to follow a trace of his belonging with examples from his poems.\nKeywords: Yahya Kemal, belonging, alienation, cosmopolitanism, literature, poetry, sense of belonging, Maslow, other, Turkish, Islam, identity \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61599340, "asset_id": 41411514, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39631373, "first_name": "Cengiz", "last_name": "Karata\u015f", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CengizKarata\u015f2", "display_name": "Cengiz Karata\u015f", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CengizKarata%C5%9F2?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39631373/15395973/21146585/s65_cengiz.karata_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116356, "name": "Milliyet\u00e7ilik", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Milliyet%C3%A7ilik?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 144221, "name": "Istanbul", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Istanbul?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 328690, "name": "Yeni T\u00fcrk Edebiyat\u0131", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yeni_T%C3%BCrk_Edebiyat%C4%B1?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 639227, "name": "T\u00fcrk Dili Ve Edebiyat\u0131", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/T%C3%BCrk_Dili_Ve_Edebiyat%C4%B1-1?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2232371, "name": "Yahya Kemal Beyatl\u0131", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yahya_Kemal_Beyatl%C4%B1?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2613143, "name": "Aidiyet Duygusu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aidiyet_Duygusu?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 31540970, "title": "To bry or not to bry: The Social Meanings of Afrikaans Rhotic Variation in the South Cape", "created_at": "2017-02-21T03:24:23.026-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31540970/To_bry_or_not_to_bry_The_Social_Meanings_of_Afrikaans_Rhotic_Variation_in_the_South_Cape?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_31540970", "summary": "Afrikaans rhotic variation and the social meanings of an emplaced sound in the South Cape This dissertation investigates the social meanings of Afrikaans rhotic variation in a town in the South Cape region of the Western Cape Province. The study combines approaches to 'place as location' (traditional dialectology and sociolinguistics) and 'place as meaning' (ethnography and linguistic anthropology) to explore the relationship between geographical place, local social meanings and linguistic variation. Theoretically, I make use of the concept of indexicality, following Silverstein's (2003) indexical orders and Eckert's (2008) indexical fields. To date, there is no previous study that explores Afrikaans variation from these perspectives. The study therefore contributes to the development of Afrikaans linguistics. The participants are residents of Houtiniquadorp, which was a mission station in South Africa's colonial era and declared a Coloured residential area during apartheid. In South Africa, place has been politicised due to colonialism and apartheid. I argue that the racialisation of places contributes to Houtiniquadorpers' sense of locality and belonging. The linguistic form I focus on is Afrikaans /r/. Afrikaans phonetics texts describe alveolar-r [r] as standard, and uvular-r ([\u0280] or [\u0281]; bry-r) as a non-standard, regional feature. In Houtiniquadorp, [\u0280] and [r] variants of the (r) variable are used. My data collection methods were semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork. The linguistic variants were quantified from the interview data and description tasks. The qualitative data analysis focused on the participants' narratives about places, lived experiences, and meta-linguistic commentary. I discuss three different sets of results, all of which investigate how people in Houtiniquadorp use Afrikaans /r/ to index locality, belonging, and other forms of social meanings, particularly in the context of social and geographic mobility. I analyse metalinguistic comments, the frequency use of rhotic variants, and the use of variants in interaction. Uvular-r forms part of many Houtiniquadorpers' repertoires, and the participants show varying degrees of awareness of the sound as locally, and socially, meaningful. The results show that while uvular-r is an emplaced sound (i.e. a regional stereotype or dialect feature), the sound has various other non-place meanings that index macro-social categories such as residential status, gender and age. By looking at participants who use both variants, I argue that they use variation to index meaningful moments during the interview interactions.

Nevertheless, fan-related personality tests remain incredibly popular online. Building upon existing fan research, the present study tests whether fans may have other motivations for taking such personality tests, drawing upon prior research by Wann. Self-identified fans (N = 425, Mage = 26.41, SD = 8.44) completed measures regarding degree of identification with their fan interest, motivations to take fan quizzes, and frequency of taking fan personality quizzes. Highly-identified fans were found to more frequently take fan-related personality tests, an association significantly mediated by both self-esteem and escapism motivations, but not mediated by eustress, entertainment, belongingness, or family motivations. The results suggest that highly identified fans participate in more fan personality quizzes to escape from the hassles of everyday life and increase positive self-worth. These results are discussed with respect to their theoretical relevance \u2013 both for research on personality testing and on fan activities \u2013 as well as for their practical implications.",

work from experimental psychology that investigate, in an unusual and refreshingly precise way, long-standing human geographical concerns with tem-porality, place and subject formations, meaning-making and well-being. It is argued that the traffic of ideas and empirical findings between human geography and experimental psychology can be mutually profitable if, and only to the extent that, it encompasses a sustained epistemological, methodological and political critique of the disciplinary practices that have yielded those ideas and findings.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47657660, "asset_id": 27402385,

of San Diego, as well as the nearby reservations place themselves amidst a pluralism of diverse beliefs and behaviours, through negotiating notions of ethnic and cultural identity, and have it recognized by others. The Red Power movement, also known as the American Indian Movement (AIM), of the 1970s and 1980s enabled the Native Americans to establish themselves, to a certain extent, as a recognized and sovereign group within a national dimension, meaning the sociocultural dimension of North America s society. They achieved tribal and cultural sovereignty, yet how does it stand now? What does it mean to be Native American? Who can call themselves Native American and why? Which factors contribute to the formation of this identity? And how do the Natives maintain or revive traditions, and at the same time reconcile them with modern ways?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39024762, "asset_id": 16504241, "asset_type": "Work",

The starting point for the examination is that temporalities lie at the core of understanding this negotiation and that the connection between temporalities and difficult heritage remains poorly understood and theorized in previous research. In order to fully explore the temporalities of difficult heritage, the book investigates places in which the incident of violence originated within different time periods. It examines one example of modern violence (Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina), one example of where the associated incident occurred during medieval times (the Gazimestan monument in Kosovo), and one example of prehistoric violence (Sandby borg in Sweden). The book presents new theoretical perspectives andprovides suggestions for developing sites of difficult heritage, and will thus be relevant for academic researchers, students, and heritage professionals.

A rhetoric of authenticity was thus borne out in the aftermath of partition. This rhetoric promoted and preserved an ideal of Irishness that stood in contradiction to the tensions of duality manifest in the newly-created Northern Ireland. Issues around national identity and belonging south of the border, while they did not reflect the protracted violent conflict in Northern Ireland, became increasingly relevant, and indeed fraught, with the increase in immigration to Ireland during the Celtic Tiger years (1997-2005). These boom years saw over half a million migrants settle in Ireland, many of whom were from previously unrepresented countries and ethnicities. This paper argues that colonial memory and postcolonial categorizations have played a significant role in the emergence of the communities of \u2018New Irish\u2019, which is evidenced in the fictional work of a number of contemporary writers, including Roddy Doyle and Ursula Rani Sarma. National anxieties around naming and labeling, around matters of integration and multiculturalism, and fundamentally around citizenship and belonging can all find their origins in Ireland\u2019s partition history.

It analyzes how the contemporary realities of Maya migration, coupled with enduring legacies of dispossession and cultural appropriation, shape migrants\u2019 everyday engagements with material culture. Indigenous migrants\u2019 manipulation of re-purposed objects that link migrant life to both pueblo culture and archaeological inheritance has an altered significance in the context of transnational migration. Through tactile and visual engagements with objects (re-)signified as indices of Maya identity and cultural distinction, migrants re-possess a tangible heritage and craft a \u201cheritage aesthetics\u201d that affords custodianship of place, home, and belonging. In turn, the objects employed in this process act upon migrants to solidify an emergent indigenous ethnic identity that rests upon sensibilities of connection to both their homeland and a pre-Hispanic past. \nKEYWORDS: ethnicity, identity, indigenous people, migration, Mexico \n\nRESUMEN\nEste art\u00edculo trata la materializaci\u00f3n del hogar y la herencia en el contexto de la migraci\u00f3n ind\u00edgena de Yucat\u00e1n, M\u00e9xico, a los Estados Unidos. Analizo la manera en que la realidad contempor\u00e1nea de la migraci\u00f3n Maya, junto con el largo legado de desarraigo y de apropiaci\u00f3n cultural, forman la manera en que los migrantes interact\u00faan d\u00eda a d\u00eda con la cultura material que los rodea. La manipulaci\u00f3n por los migrantes ind\u00edgenas de objetos a los cuales se les asignan prop\u00f3sitos nuevos que enlazan la vida migrante a la cultura del pueblo y a la herencia arqueol\u00f3gica, toma una prominencia y un significado particular en el contexto de la migraci\u00f3n transnacional. A trav\u00e9s de encuentros t\u00e1ctiles y visuales con objetos re-definidos que funcionan como indicadores de la identidad Maya y la distinci\u00f3n cultural, los migrantes se re-apoderan de la herencia tangible y crean una \u201cest\u00e9tica de herencia\u201d que les permite reclamar custodia de lugar, hogar, y pertenencia. En retrospectiva, los objetos usados en este proceso permiten que el migrante solidifique una identidad ind\u00edgena \u00e9tnica emergente que depende de conexiones emocionales con su hogar al igual que con su pasado pre-Hisp\u00e1nico. \nPALABRAS CLAVES: etnicidad, identidad, indigenismo, migraci\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53476179, "asset_id": 16701119, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4720346, "first_name": "Deanna", "last_name": "Barenboim", "domain_name": "slc", "page_name": "DeannaBarenboim", "display_name": "Deanna Barenboim", "profile_url": "https://slc.academia.edu/DeannaBarenboim?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4720346/1995018/6547619/s65_deanna.barenboim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 808, "name": "Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 17715, "name": "Maya Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maya_Archaeology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 43514, "name": "Mayan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mayan_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 97592, "name": "Yucatec Maya", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Yucatec_Maya?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 16299157, "title": "Paasi, Anssi (2005): Review on Cresswell, T: Place: a short introduction.

Experiences of racialization, poverty, immigration, gender, and sexuality juxtaposed against defined institutionalized norms and dominant narratives speak to how disability is not only conceived but also experienced. Drawing upon transnational and citizenship theory, this thesis proposes employing a new framework of analysis, centralizing the experience of social citizenship and belonging as an indicator of broader structural equity. Situated in the field of education, theoretical considerations also explore how growing market fundamentalism shapes public schools and contributes to the systematic exclusion of poor and racialized students through mechanisms of disablement such as reduced academic programs and special education placement.\r\n\r\nThis body of work includes three separate, but related, studies exploring historical and current incidences of institutional exclusion. In particular, the nuanced relationship of exclusion to race, class, gender, generational status, and sexuality, complicated with the identification of impairment, is explored. One of the most profound findings of this research is that, although there is much discussion in Disability Studies of the construction of impairment labels, this is the first quantitative analysis to substantiate these claims. Results also indicate that the classroom represents the most stratified space in which student groups defined by race, exceptionality, class, and generational status experience the greatest sense of exclusion. Evidence shows that employing a lens of citizenship and belonging is an authoritative tool in identifying the existence of inequities distributed among myriad identity groups. Furthermore, evidence lends credence to the notion that identification of disability is intimately linked to race, gender, and class contexts.\r\n\u2003\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47997169, "asset_id": 11928278, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5473000, "first_name": "Gillian", "last_name": "Parekh", "domain_name": "yorku", "page_name": "GillianParekh", "display_name": "Gillian Parekh", "profile_url": "https://yorku.academia.edu/GillianParekh?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5473000/2402652/2796376/s65_gillian.parekh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1062, "name": "Special Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Special_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1298, "name": "Alternative Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alternative_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2196, "name": "History of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2260, "name": "Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Disability_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2595, "name": "Critical Disability Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Disability_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2808, "name": "Poverty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poverty?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2818, "name": "Education and Youth Exclusion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_Youth_Exclusion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3210, "name": "Segregation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Segregation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3512, "name": "Educational Inequalities (class;

Across six studies we primed motivational orientations that were either congruent or incongruent with participants\u2019 chronic orientations and then assessed their performance on subsequent tasks that require cognitive resources. Consistent with the primed interference hypothesis, we found that incongruity between temporary and chronic motivational orientations undermined participants\u2019 (a) inhibition of incorrect but highly accessible responses, (b) mental arithmetic, (c) analytical reasoning, and (d) resistance to temptation. These results, which were observed following the activation of motivations for promotion or prevention (Studies 1\u22122 and 5\u22126), high or low need for belonging (Study 3), and high or low power orientations (Study 4), illustrate the broad implications of holding incongruent chronic and primed orientations", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 12056546, "asset_id": 1309507, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 45717, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Molden", "domain_name": "northwestern", "page_name": "DanielMolden", "display_name": "Daniel Molden", "profile_url": "https://northwestern.academia.edu/DanielMolden?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/45717/14441/11232539/s65_daniel.molden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2672, "name": "Personality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Personality?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2825, "name": "Power (social)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Power_social_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11106, "name": "Self Control", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Control?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14504, "name": "Regulatory Focus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regulatory_Focus?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 22220, "name": "Priming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Priming?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 45909, "name": "Self-regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-regulation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 65998, "name": "Belonging Needs and Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_Needs_and_Regulation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 283423, "name": "Ego depletion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ego_depletion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 284758, "name": "Goal pursuit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Goal_pursuit?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 39865598, "title": "The Social Architecture of Belonging in the African Pentecostal Diaspora", "created_at": "2019-07-18T07:53:09.257-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39865598/The_Social_Architecture_of_Belonging_in_the_African_Pentecostal_Diaspora?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_39865598", "summary": "From megachurches in movie theatres to prayer groups held in living rooms, Pentecostals worldwide are constantly carrying out religious activities that ultimately aim to integrate diverse worshippers into the kingdom of God. Born-again Christians refashion their 'ways of being' by breaking down and re-establishing the interpersonal relationships shaped and changed by emerging diasporic modernities. I examined some of these changing ways of being by comparing the discursive practices of African Pentecostal pastors in Johannesburg (South Africa) and Bilbao (Spain). These case-studies demonstrate how these migrant-initiated churches create a 'social architecture', a platform on which African worshippers find social and spiritual integration in increasingly globalized contexts. I argue that the subdivision of large congregations into specialized fellowship groups provides African migrants with alternative strategies to achieve a sense of belonging in an expanding diasporic network. Their transformative mission of spiritual education, by spreading African(ized) and Pentecostal values according to age, gender, or social roles, helps to uplift them from being a marginalized minority to being a powerful group occupying a high moral ground.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60048445, "asset_id": 39865598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2600590, "first_name": "Rafael", "last_name": "Cazarin", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "RafaelCazarin", "display_name": "Rafael Cazarin", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/RafaelCazarin?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2600590/827922/40467066/s65_rafael.cazarin.jpg"}, {"id": 47890605, "first_name": "ISOR", "last_name": "Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "ISORResearchinSociologyofReligion", "display_name": "ISOR - Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/ISORResearchinSociologyofReligion?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47890605/12617103/20584883/s65_isor.research_in_sociology_of_religion.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 217, "name": "Sociology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Religion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2170, "name": "Ethnography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2794, "name": "Sociology of Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Emotion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3870, "name": "African Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5312, "name": "African Religion in Africa and the Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Religion_in_Africa_and_the_Diaspora?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19721, "name": "Pentecostalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pentecostalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 161014, "name": "Social Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Integration?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 3982540, "title": "Relationship between History and a Sense of Belonging \u2013 Russian Speaking Minority Integration in Latvia", "created_at": "2013-07-08T20:57:27.430-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/3982540/Relationship_between_History_and_a_Sense_of_Belonging_Russian_Speaking_Minority_Integration_in_Latvia?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_3982540", "summary": "The article will analyze the role of history and sense of belonging development for integration and naturalization efforts in Latvia.

In this article, we build on this perspective in three ways. First, we test whether the preventive influence of school belonging acts at the individual or school level. Secondly, we test whether a distinction should be made between the different actors with whom students bond at school, by assessing whether perceived teacher support, school belonging, and peer attachment relate differently to school misconduct. Lastly, the present study investigates whether the associations of bonding with teachers, peers and the school with school misconduct differ by socio-ethnic school context. Multilevel analyses were performed on data from the Flemish Educational Assessment. The sample consisted of 11,872 students (51.4% female) in 85 schools, most of whom were natives (88.8%), with immigrants (11.2%) mostly having Turkish or Moroccan backgrounds (both about 30% of immigrants in the sample), and others Southern-European (16%), Eastern-European (8%), North-African (5%), or other (17%) backgrounds. Results showed that the students\u2019 individual feelings of bonding with peers, teachers and school associate with school misconduct, rather than the overall school cohesion. Results further showed that, while higher perceived teacher support and school belonging related to less school misconduct, higher peer attachment was associated with higher rates of school misconduct.

La centralit\u00e9 de la qu\u00eate, raison d'\u00eatre de ces voyages, tient \u00e0 trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui constituent les axes de r\u00e9flexion qu'adoptent les articles ici r\u00e9unis : premi\u00e8rement, intrins\u00e8que au projet de \u00ab retour \u00bb, la qu\u00eate est mise en r\u00e9cit et les narrations du voyage sont des narrations de soi ; deuxi\u00e8mement, elle est ce qui leur donne forme, ce qui mod\u00e8le le d\u00e9roulement du voyage, ses s\u00e9quences temporelles et son d\u00e9ploiement dans l'espace ; et enfin, troisi\u00e8mement, elle est une mise \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de l'appartenance, o\u00f9 se joue une tension entre familiarit\u00e9 et \u00e9tranget\u00e9.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78005742, "asset_id": 67034370, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 240222, "first_name": "Anne-Christine", "last_name": "Tr\u00e9mon", "domain_name": "ehess", "page_name": "AnneChristineTr\u00e9mon", "display_name": "Anne-Christine Tr\u00e9mon", "profile_url": "https://ehess.academia.edu/AnneChristineTr%C3%A9mon?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/240222/356030/2879577/s65_anne-christine.tr_mon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3462, "name": "Kinship (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kinship_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12644, "name": "Commemoration and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_and_Memory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19870, "name": "Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Research?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 168105, "name": "Kinship and Family Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kinship_and_Family_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 475468, "name": "Roots Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Roots_Tourism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 951126, "name": "Ethnicity and Identity Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_Identity_Politics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1476624, "name": "Diasporic Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporic_Tourism?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44660795, "title": "Gez\u00e4hmte Schizophrenie.

into a Western travel ideal so heavily invested in freedom? When one reflects on travel stories in the West the initial response seems clear: there is no belonging. From the colonial binaries of \u201chome/away\u201d, \u201cself/other\u201d and \u201cfree/unfree\u201d, to New Age claims of belonging on the road, to the world,  or as a global soul \u2013 hinting at the end of belonging all together \u2013 Western travel \u201cideals\u201d have been built upon a precarious fascination with the individual\u2019s choice of how to be \u201cfree\u201d and where to \u201cbelong\u201d. But as contemporary philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy asks, what would such a self-determining free decision mean if it was not also an attempt to remain untouched by every obstacle in life and to maintain a comfortable distance from entering into relations with others?...\n\n...This chapter shifts the focus from the \u201csubject\u2019s freedom\u201d to the experience of freedom itself. Working within and against the Enlightenment ideals that equate travel with free selfhood and a displaced mode of belonging, I begin with a proposition set out by Jean-Luc Nancy in The Experience of Freedom that freedom itself unfolds as a shared exposure with the world.

The central Athens of previous years is now a terrain of conflict and metamorphosis and the city\u2019s walls are screaming a thousand stories. In other words, city walls are the canvas and social conditions the paint in a gallery of untold stories. Redefined symbols, decomposed stereotypes, re-visioned aesthetics, and antiracist slogans are the tools for the transformation of walls into social diaries. In this light, street art is examined as a form of social diary, a visual history of marginalised and minority groups. Street art captures the need for self-expression in a changing environment, and street artists actively participate in the production of culture in the micro-level by consciously contributing to the need for urban re-visions. \n\nhttp://www.soclabo.org/index.php/laboratorium/article/view/460", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 45997340, "asset_id": 7135971, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1238505, "first_name": "Myrto", "last_name": "Tsilimpounidi", "domain_name": "220", "page_name": "MyrtoTsilimpounidi", "display_name": "Myrto Tsilimpounidi", "profile_url": "https://220.academia.edu/MyrtoTsilimpounidi?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1238505/639311/40788964/s65_myrto.tsilimpounidi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 220, "name": "Visual Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 863, "name": "Visual Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 925, "name": "Visual Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3225, "name": "Visual Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Culture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3351, "name": "Subcultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subcultures?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16742, "name": "Urban Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Sociology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16892, "name": "Street Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Street_Art?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 21346, "name": "Graffiti", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Graffiti?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25869, "name": "Art, Culture and Social Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_Culture_and_Social_Change?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 60757, "name": "Visual Research Methods", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Research_Methods?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 65241, "name": "Sociologia Urbana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociologia_Urbana?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 79533, "name": "Athens", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Athens?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 83222, "name": "Economic Crisis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Economic_Crisis?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 102891, "name": "Urban social segregation, Urban sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_social_segregation_Urban_sociology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 190296, "name": "Graffiti, Street Art and Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Graffiti_Street_Art_and_Writing?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 526852, "name": "Street Art and Revolution", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Street_Art_and_Revolution?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 704960, "name": "Street Art and Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Street_Art_and_Performance?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 711113, "name": "Street Art and Graffiti", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Street_Art_and_Graffiti?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 1265840, "title": "HOW CULTURE SHAPES COMMUNITY: Bible Belief, Theological Unity, and a Sense of Belonging in Religious Congregations", "created_at": "2012-01-19T01:15:48.525-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1265840/HOW_CULTURE_SHAPES_COMMUNITY_Bible_Belief_Theological_Unity_and_a_Sense_of_Belonging_in_Religious_Congregations?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_1265840", "summary": "Feeling that you belong in a group is an important and powerful need.

Ecological peril, both in the form of extreme weather events and slow-onset impacts of environmental degradation, has serious repercussions for the already prevailing conundrum that the conception of citizenship entails. Proliferation of 'natural' disasters and acceleration of environmental degeneration in recent times have caused large-scale involuntary displacement and consequently a rupture in the sense of 'belonging', which is the cornerstone of citizenship. Thus, it is imperative that the notion of 'citizenship' is reconceptualised in the light of the lived reality of environmental displacement that produces new forms of precarity while disrupting the sense of being-a-citizen. Displacement caused by a fragile and volatile ecology paves the path for a gradual waning of citizenship rights, often leading to loss of avenues for meaningful citizen engagement, thereby making environmental displacement an exemplary case for understanding how 'citizenship' operates as a place-based relation. This article will discuss the precarious conditions of environmentally displaced people and delineate the intractable chasm between the ideas of 'administered' citizenship and 'lived' citizenship. I argue that drawing on 'processual' aspects of citizenship becomes imperative against the backdrop of the rapid degradation of ecosystems which calls for a reworking of the 'political' sphere and a reformulation of the idiom of 'citizenship'.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67668530, "asset_id": 49284368, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 67163777, "first_name": "NABANITA", "last_name": "SAMANTA", "domain_name": "iitbombay", "page_name": "NABANITASAMANTA", "display_name": "NABANITA SAMANTA", "profile_url": "https://iitbombay.academia.edu/NABANITASAMANTA?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/67163777/23718659/47690909/s65_nabanita.samanta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3126, "name": "Political Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Ecology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16226, "name": "Materiality (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Materiality_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54195, "name": "Spatiality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatiality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 149474, "name": "Anthropocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropocene?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 354768, "name": "Citizenship rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_rights?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 590235, "name": "Environmental Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Displacement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 767812, "name": "Right to have rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Right_to_have_rights?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1415813, "name": "Capitalocene", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capitalocene?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3572518, "name": "Lived Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lived_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4002159, "name": "Ecoprecarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecoprecarity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031750, "name": "spatialised nature of political relation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/spatialised_nature_of_political_relation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031751, "name": "Citizens' Claim-making abilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizens_Claim_making_abilities?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031752, "name": "Ecodisasters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecodisasters?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031753, "name": "ecological amnesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ecological_amnesia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031754, "name": "Hydraulic citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hydraulic_citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031755, "name": "Embodied displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodied_displacement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4031756, "name": "Being-in-place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Being_in_place?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 38575480, "title": "Nebesna Sotnia : Formation of a New Narrative from Protest Lore to Institutionalized Commemorative Practice", "created_at": "2019-03-18T10:57:32.242-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38575480/Nebesna_Sotnia_Formation_of_a_New_Narrative_from_Protest_Lore_to_Institutionalized_Commemorative_Practice?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_38575480", "summary": "English\n\nThe one hundred people shot dead on the Maidan were given the collective name Heavenly Hundred (Nebesna Sotnia).

They represent a venue where a gendered Muslim subject is constituted, and discourses about national and transnational belonging are articulated. These\nprocesses take place against the backdrop of complex post-Soviet nation-building, the resurgence of nationalism and xenophobia, gendered moralization campaigns, the promotion of an urban middle-class modernity, general decline in income levels of ordinary people and political instability in the larger Muslim world. This article examines the narratives that circulate in Muslim Magazine and Musulmanka and analyzes the modes of belonging and recognition that they espouse. I argue that the magazines depict respectable and productive Muslim citizens of Russia who are normalized and assimilated through the replication of privileged consumption norms and of labor and\nleisure practices. The intimate juxta-political publics that flourish on the pages of these magazines endorse a disciplined minority citizen who adheres to dominant gender norms. This incorporates difference into legible similarity and relegates contentious politics of gender, class and racial privilege to the private domain. Along with the (unrequited) desire for national belonging, these magazines demonstrate affiliations with the global ummah. These discourses are frequently saturated with depoliticizing emotion and operate through exclusions. Hence, through the disciplining power of the market and intimacy, these magazines articulate desires for national belonging.\nSimultaneously, they reveal affective transnational attachments, which although expanding the possibilities of belonging significantly constrain them", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46040651, "asset_id": 25362043, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Data were collected from two different study groups via two questionnaires that included the Cyberbullying Offending Scale, Social Media Use Questionnaire, Social Connectedness Scale, General Belongingness Scale, Short Depression-Happiness Scale, and Single Item Self-Esteem Scale. Study 1 comprised 804 high school students (48% female; mean age 16.20 years). Study 2 comprised 760 university students (60% female; mean age 21.48 years). Results indicated that problematic social media use and cyberbullying perpetration (which was stronger among high school students) were directly associated with each other. Belongingness (directly) and social connectedness (indirectly) were both associated with cyberbullying perpetration and problematic social media use. Path analysis demonstrated that while age was a significant direct predictor of problematic social media use and cyberbullying perpetration among university students, it was not", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56847138, "asset_id": 36895110, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 320455, "first_name": "Mark", "last_name": "Griffiths", "domain_name": "nottinghamtrent", "page_name": "MarkGriffiths", "display_name": "Mark D Griffiths", "profile_url": "https://nottinghamtrent.academia.edu/MarkGriffiths?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/320455/79042/86543/s65_mark.griffiths.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1580, "name": "Cyberpsychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberpsychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2553, "name": "Social Networking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Networking?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10666, "name": "Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bullying?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11256, "name": "School Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Bullying?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12756, "name": "Cyberbullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberbullying?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 46528, "name": "Self-Esteem", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-Esteem?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 64892, "name": "Social connectedness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_connectedness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 215257, "name": "Cyberbullying in Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cyberbullying_in_Schools?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1036283, "name": "School Bullying and Cyberbullying Among Adolescents", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Bullying_and_Cyberbullying_Among_Adolescents?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1045367, "name": "Social Connectedness Scale", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Connectedness_Scale?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 29947153, "title": "Sense of Place and Belonging in a Redeveloping Waterfront Area.pdf", "created_at": "2016-11-18T13:35:12.843-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29947153/Sense_of_Place_and_Belonging_in_a_Redeveloping_Waterfront_Area_pdf?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_29947153", "summary": "This study seeks to understand and illustrate how landlords, owner-occupiers and tenants feel about both the place, and fellow residents of Ocean Village, Southampton, UK.

In that regard, social media is of particular importance for young believers that connect with their peers via platforms such as Instagram. There are conflicting views on the functioning of social media platforms: they are either conceptualized as superdiverse spaces, in which social boundaries can be overcome, or as resulting in separate bubbles that foster exclusive exchanges between like-minded people sharing certain characteristics, including religious affiliation. This article assesses online religious activities based on qualitative research involving 41 young, urban, religious Instagram users of different faiths. We demonstrate how young believers\u2019 interactions on social media produce thematically bound content bubbles that are considerably homogeneous when it comes to religion, but superdiverse in other areas. Religious activities online often have an affirmative effect on religious belonging. This is especially true for young people that perceive themselves in a minority position and search for like-minded people online. We have found that religious content bubbles are clustered around religious traditions. Interreligious exchange (e.g., between Christians and Sikhs) is largely absent, whereas intrareligious boundaries (e.g., between Lutherans, Catholics, and Pentecostals) become blurred. This suggests that differences within religious traditions are losing significance in a digitalized world, while interreligious boundaries remain", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81566266, "asset_id": 72771357, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3448776, "first_name": "Christoph", "last_name": "Novak", "domain_name": "oeaw", "page_name": "ChristophNovak", "display_name": "Christoph Novak", "profile_url": "https://oeaw.academia.edu/ChristophNovak?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3448776/1168922/1492620/s65_christoph.novak.jpg"}, {"id": 76919659, "first_name": "Katharina", "last_name": "Limacher", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KatharinaLimacher", "display_name": "Katharina Limacher", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KatharinaLimacher?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2613, "name": "Diversity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diversity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8002, "name": "Youth Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Culture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 29547, "name": "Interreligious Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interreligious_Dialogue?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 63660, "name": "Religion online", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_online?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 107368, "name": "Vienna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Vienna?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 379760, "name": "Religious Identity and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Identity_and_Youth?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 716916, "name": "Instagram", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Instagram?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 61516944, "title": "Left Out: A Review of Women's Struggle to Develop a Sense of Belonging in Engineering", "created_at": "2021-11-11T05:53:06.530-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61516944/Left_Out_A_Review_of_Womens_Struggle_to_Develop_a_Sense_of_Belonging_in_Engineering?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_61516944", "summary": "Unmet or thwarted belonging needs have been implicated in multiple studies of women in engineering in college and in the engineering workforce. A wide range of other challenges that women face in engineering are tightly linked to deficits in belonging. Furthermore, many women face intersectional factors across race and ethnicity that make it even more difficult to belong. This literature review looks at women's struggles in engineering in the context of the fundamental psychological need to belong. Studies that investigate belonging are reviewed, as are major contributors to unmet or thwarted belonging including gender identity threat and normative and numerical male dominance. Belonging is not the only psychological need that is inadequately met for women in engineering, but it is a common factor in multiple contexts and the situation worsens as women progress in their career pathways. Studies of belonging among women in engineering underscore the importance of supporting women in fulfilling this basic need even when the cultural transformation of engineering into a gender-balanced

We propose a review and discussion of these concepts, framed by a context that since the post-structuralism and postmodernism has established a certain hegemony of cultural relativism, primordialism and essentialism, that in order to broaden the look of the social and areas rights, naturalize cultural differences making issues such as social identities closer to biology than social relations, practices and speeches product.\n\nKeywords: Identity, belonging, essentialism, indigenous rights", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51354339, "asset_id": 30928321, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 285173, "first_name": "Alvaro", "last_name": "Bello", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AlvaroBello10", "display_name": "Alvaro Bello", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AlvaroBello10?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/285173/58205/29435833/s65_alvaro.bello.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 11383310, "title": "Psychoterratic geographies of the Upper Hunter region, Australia", "created_at": "2015-03-11T20:57:51.828-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11383310/Psychoterratic_geographies_of_the_Upper_Hunter_region_Australia?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_11383310", "summary": "In May 2010 the proposed Bickham coal mine near the Pages River in the Upper Hunter region of Australia was formally rejected because of its potentially deleterious impacts on hydrology and the likely negative impacts on a valuable thoroughbred breeding region.

The running of herds over mountain pastures was organized by state entities (kolkhozes and sovkhozes) and the great majority of animals were effectively state-owned.  The state system maintained roads and vehicles for livestock transport, the provision of veterinary services, and the marketing of wool and meat, as well as the provision for the other needs of Kyrgyz pastoralists\u2019 livelihoods.  Today, the pastoral landscape is scattered with the ruins of large livestock shelters, the doors and roofs of which have been pilfered for the needs of a much more small-scale, privately organized economy.  As ownership of livestock and machinery passed to private hands in the mid-1990s, there was initially a catastrophic collapse of livestock herding as a basis of livelihood for most herders.  As communities sought to reconstruct their future in the absence of the reliable state, their sense of belonging shifted from state entities to traditional concepts of relatedness remembered from their primordial past.  Yet while the initial privatization was organized on the premise that collectivities based on extended kinship would replace the state organization, this proved unworkable in many ways.  Such collectivities then fragmented and livelihoods became organized around families in the narrower sense.  Thus, in a twenty year period, Kyrgyz herders have shifted from relying on the state organization of their lives, to an unstable primordial kinship, and now to a new set of orienting principles which hinge on complex assessments of what can assure the future.  In this paper, based on fieldwork in Nar\u00efn Province, we will examine how these transformations have taken place in pastoral livelihoods, as well as the challenges that have emerged in this environment of rapidly changing belonging in relation to livelihoods, kinship and the state.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36714121, "asset_id": 10966434, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2543214, "first_name": "Baktibek", "last_name": "Isakov", "domain_name": "manas", "page_name": "BIsakov", "display_name": "Baktibek Isakov", "profile_url": "https://manas.academia.edu/BIsakov?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2543214/792355/985008/s65_baktibek.isakov.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3462, "name": "Kinship (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kinship_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6032, "name": "Central Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_Asian_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 82287217, "title": "Modern Monarchic Visibility in Eurasian Empires.", "created_at": "2022-06-28T01:52:35.069-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82287217/Modern_Monarchic_Visibility_in_Eurasian_Empires?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_82287217", "summary": "The purpose of this chapter is to introduce a new conceptual framework to facilitate the analysis of central power embodied by the ruler/dynasty and the changing patterns of its public staging in the nineteenth century.

Things have only gotten more complex in the 21st century where the bipolar world of the Cold War and \u201cthe end of history\u201d has given way to a multicentric, polyglot cacaphony where culture has replaced class as the dominant signifier and language has become the major expressive vehicle of that shift. In the European Union alone, there are 23 official languages, the UN has 6 official languages, and battles over language as the emblem of culture are evident among peoples affirming their identity everywhere - from Quebec to Catalonia, Rwanda to East Timor.\u201d\n\nWhither belonging in all this? The symposium presents belonging as a critical issue for sociocultural psychiatry and for global mental health. The notion of belonging sutures together the social questions of identity and affiliation to psychoanalytic questions of memory and representation to build a crucial construct for social psychiatry and psychotherapy in the 21st century.\n\nIleana Botezat-Antonescu\u2019s presentation, \u201cBelonging to the group of psychotherapy professionals: Between interdiction and proliferation in different political contexts in Romania,\u201d demonstrates that \u201cBelonging to a\nprofessional group just as psychotherapists do from other part of the world (Western Europe or the Americas), was a cherished dream for many Romanian psychiatrists or clinical psychologists before December 1989. We try to follow the developmental process of psychotherapy from the belonging concept perspective toward the cultural and political\ncontext in a communist\u2013totalitarian and a democratic society and examine its evolution.\u201d\n\nDrozdstoj Stoyanov\u2019s contribution is an empirical study of \u201cBelonging dimensions in psychological climate and personality as predictors of vulnerability to burn-out.\u201d His discussion highlights that, \u201cThe evidence from our pilot study as well as complementary case studies reveal the relevance of belonging as embedded in personality and psychological climate to the emergence of burn out. The following inter-connected study dimensions may elicit belonging: cooperativeness and self-transcendence in personality; cohesion and fairness in the psychological climate\nat work place and depersonalization as measurement of burn out.\u201d\n\nBibliography:\n\n1.

Empirical research shows that, indeed, across cultures, people hope that life experience will eventually make them wiser. The problem is that, to date, the academic study of wisdom and of the processes by which it can be learned has been dominated by psychologists. The first part of the article reviews the state-of-the-art psychological scholarship on wisdom to show how that conceptualization lacks geographical sensitivity and therefore misses some of the crucial geographical mechanisms by which people become wiser. The second part of the article singles out and focuses on one such mechanism, namely, the learning of wisdom through geographical dislocations. By drawing on insights from the study of international migration, exile, and transculturation in postcolonial contexts, the final part of the article suggests specific learning processes that might strengthen the hypothesis that geographical dislocations and the attendant cross-cultural experiences they generate are often conducive to wisdom. La sabidur\u00eda es a la vez uno de los tipos de conocimiento m\u00e1s esquivos y m\u00e1s valorados. La investigac\u00ed on emp\u00edrica en verdad muestra que en todas las culturas la gente espera que la experiencia de la vida eventualmente los haga m\u00e1s sabios. El problema es que hasta ahora el estudio acad\u00e9mico sobre la sabidur\u00eda y sobre los procesos por medio de los cuales\u00e9sta puede alcanzarse ha estado dominado por los psic\u00f3logos. La primera parte del art\u00edculo revisa el estado del arte de la erudic\u00ed on psico\u00ed ogica sobre este particular, para mostrar c \u00b4 omo esa conceptualizac\u00ed on carece de sensibilidad geogr\u00e1fica y en consecuencia deja de considerar algunos de los mecanismos geogr\u00e1ficos cruciales mediante los cuales la gente se hace m\u00e1s sabia. La segunda parte del art\u00edculo escoge y se concentra en uno de tales mecanismos, o sea, el aprendizaje de la sabidur\u00eda por medio de las dislocaciones geogr\u00e1ficas. A partir de la perspicacia del estudio de la migrac\u00ed on internacional, el exilio y la transculturac\u00ed on en contextos poscoloniales, la parte final del art\u00edculo sugiere procesos de aprendizaje espec\u00edficos, que podr\u00edan fortalecer la hip\u00f3tesis de que las dislocaciones geogr\u00e1ficas y las experiencias culturales de vasto espectro generadas por aquellas a menudo llevan a la sabidur\u00eda.

We argue that the practices of the biopolitics of citizenship and governmentality\u2014surveillance, immigration documents, employment forms, birth certificates, tax forms, drivers\u2019 licenses, credit card applications, bank accounts, medical insurance, car insurance, random detentions, and deportations\u2014enclose, penetrate, define, limit, and frustrate the lives of undocumented 1.5-generation Latino immigrants. We examine data from a random-sample telephone survey of 805 Latinos and 396 whites in Orange County, California, to provide general patterns that distinguish 1.5-generation Latino immigrants from their first-generation counterparts and to suggest the contours of their lives as undocumented immigrants. We then examine in-depth interviews with 80 respondents also in Orange County who provide extensive qualitative information and personal narratives. The analysis shows how abjectivity and illegality constrain daily life, create internalized fears, in some ways immobilize their victims, and in other ways motivate them to engage politically to resist the dire conditions of their lives.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 23725004, "asset_id": 1564699, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 994967, "first_name": "Roberto G.", "last_name": "Gonzales", "domain_name": "upenn", "page_name": "RobertoGGonzales", "display_name": "Roberto G.

However, from an emic perspectives, the Jewish people are native to the Land of \nIsrael. They belong there through their ancestral lineage, and therefore are merely returning. This \nassumption brings with it some far-reaching consequences, that are worth researching. For one, from \nwhere does the assumption come that one belongs in a place that one has never been? And how \ndoes one create an affective connection to a place that one only knows from stories? These questions \nlead to the question that is central to this research: How is a relationship with an ancestral homeland \ndeveloped, appropriated and performed upon by ethnic return migrants, in order to create and \nmaintain a sense of attachment and belonging to a place one does not factually originate from? With \nthis research I have aimed to find out how and why people create a sense of belonging and \nattachment. Accordingly, I found out that performativity plays an important role both in the \nconfirmation of ones sense of belonging, but also as a consequence of the identity one takes upon \nhimself when he develops a sense of belonging.\nIn this research I propose different routes to the development of a sense of belonging that \noccur in the Diaspora, based on cultural memory. I argue that a sense of place attachment is \ndeveloped, in relation to the places that are central in the normative and formative texts of the\ncultural memory. Finally, I come to the conclusion that a sense of belonging and place attachment \ncome together through performativity. In order to better understand the performative action of these \npeople, I have proposed to analyze them as a social movement. As social actors, people have taken \nupon themselves the goals and motivations of the settlement movement, of which they are part. In \nan attempt to reach these goals, performative action is used to move others in their support, \nconfirming their identity and legitimacy both to the inside, as well as to the outside.

Currently, there is a nativist perspective prevalent in the Netherlands. This nativist perspective considers people who were \u2018first there\u2019 a native of a country. This perspective is translated in the binary used to differentiate between natives and non-natives, namely \u2018autochthone\u2019 for a person without a migrant background and \u2018allochthone\u2019 for a person with a migrant background. While it is never explicitly mentioned, natives are assumed to be white, Christian citizens without a migration background. A striking question that could follow out of this is: where does this place white migrants with a variety of religious beliefs? An example is Bosnians in the Netherlands. Bosnians are a multi-ethnic, multi-religious group, consisting of Muslim Bosniak, Catholic Bosnian Croats, and Orthodox Bosnians Serbs. During the violent war in Bosnia-Herzegovina that lasted from 1992 until 1995, many Bosnians fled the country and ended up staying in the Netherlands. Today, there is a Bosnian community in the Netherlands with a growing second-generation. While they are considered to be a successful group because of high education levels and low unemployment levels, how does this group experience the Netherlands themselves?\n\nThis thesis investigated self-reported identity, belonging, and possible factors that influence identity and belonging. This led to three research questions: How are identity and sense of belonging conceptualized in second-generation Bosnian migrants in the Netherlands? What factors influence identity and sense of belonging for second-generation Bosnian migrants? How do identity and belonging differ between the ethno-religious groups in second-generation Bosnian migrants? To answer these questions, 15 Bosnians born in the Netherlands were interviewed. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with five Bosnian Serbs, five Bosniaks, and five Bosnian Croats. Questions asked about identity, home, sense of belonging, and possible transnational relations that impact identity and belonging.\n\nAs for sense of belonging, findings showed that all second-generation Bosnians experience a feeling of being \u2018in-between borders\u2019 or in \u2018no-man\u2019s-land.\u2019 Both countries feel like home, but neither country feels like home at the same time. As for identity, findings showed that Bosnians use different labels to identify themselves. Possibilities are Bosnian Dutch, Dutch Bosnian, (Bosnian) Serb Dutch, (Bosnian) Croat Dutch, (Bosnian) Serb, (Bosnian) Croat, and Dutch. The majority of second-generation Bosnians used a label that was a combination of a Bosnian and Dutch identity. Even the people who used an identity label that contained one country, all of the interviewees expressed being a product of both countries. So, both countries matter inbelonging and identity formation. However, it often is a feeling of being in-between identities and in-between countries. There are differences found between the three ethno-religious groups. Compared to the Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats, Bosniaks did not use \u2018Dutch\u2019 as their identity label. Bosniaks either identified as Bosnian or Bosnian Dutch. Bosniaks also shared that religion is an essential factor to explain feelings of non-belonging in the Netherlands. Thus, while all second-generation Bosnians experience feelings of not belonging in both countries, being Muslim is a crucial factor in this feeling of non-belonging for Bosniaks in the Netherlands. Out of these findings, it can be concluded that the nativist perspective plays a role in the conceptualization of identity and belonging in second-generation Bosnians in the Netherlands. Being a white Christian Dutch citizen with a Bosnian background results in feelings of non-belonging, but this particularly seems the case for white Muslim Dutch citizens with a Bosnian background. The possible explanation for these findings is that the stigmatization and criminalization of Muslims in the Netherlands lead to being treated as a non-native Dutch citizen and therefore to feeling like a non-native Dutch citizen. So, considering Dutch citizens with a migrant background and particularly Muslim Dutch citizens with a migrant background as non-natives result in feelings of being in \u2018no-man\u2019s-land.\u2019", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60873489, "asset_id": 40594112, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 104351576, "first_name": "Amra", "last_name": "\u017deri\u0107", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "Amra\u017deri\u0107", "display_name": "Amra \u017deri\u0107", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/Amra%C5%BDeri%C4%87?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11001, "name": "Second generation identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_generation_identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64064, "name": "Bosnia and Herzegovina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 90837, "name": "Second Generation Immigrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Generation_Immigrants?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 168328, "name": "Islam in the Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Netherlands?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 169804, "name": "The Netherlands", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Netherlands?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 192726, "name": "Religious Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 467318, "name": "Second Generation Migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Generation_Migrants?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1185372, "name": "Bosnian Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bosnian_Diaspora?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3405080, "name": "second generation bosnians", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/second_generation_bosnians?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 40026669, "title": "Spatial tactics of Hong Kong street hawkers: A case study of Fa Yuen Street", "created_at": "2019-08-06T23:52:12.466-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40026669/Spatial_tactics_of_Hong_Kong_street_hawkers_A_case_study_of_Fa_Yuen_Street?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_40026669", "summary": "Fa Yuen Street, a bustling street, is an open and public market located at the edge of the Mong Kok District where I have lived for years. The street is not simply a place where people practice the daily activities of buying and selling. It is also a place where a sense of belonging is formed.\nAs argued by different scholars (e.g. Mumford 1998; Jacobs 1961; Lefebvre 1991; Cresswell 2004), the street can be seen as a platform where a person\u2019s communication takes place. This platform, in turn, helps shape a local community of diversity and contributes to the building of intimate relationships among people. Fa Yuen Street has gradually turned into a packed space that accommodates about 233 hawker stalls (each small stall occupies a space of 3 x 4 foot) and 139 street-level shops. Interconnected interactions between different stakeholders (such as hawkers, residents, shop owners, etc.) have contributed to the creation of a tightly knit community and long-term relationships.\nThe paper explores a range of inter-related perspectives on human interactions in the street. In addition, the paper combines photo-documentation and information graphics not just to illustrate but to analyze the spatial tactics of street stall owners. It presents six types of street stalls and ten spatial tactics that, together, represented the unique street culture of Hong Kong.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60222648, "asset_id": 40026669, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 121678598, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Kwok", "domain_name": "cpce-polyu", "page_name": "BrianKwok", "display_name": "Brian S .

This qualitative sociological study focuses on this new flow of international migrants to Shanghai, China\u2019s \u2018global city\u2019. According to Chinese government sources, 130,000 foreign nationals were residing legally in Shanghai in 2008 (Lu 2008: 273), but unofficial estimates are higher. Consular and chamber of commerce officials I interviewed estimated that roughly 70,000 to 100,000 Japanese, 20,000 to 30,000 Americans and 12,000 to 20,000 Germans were living in Shanghai on various types of visas. With the partial exception of Chinese-heritage immigrants, this is an ethnically and racially \u2018other\u2019 population, with relatively few cultural and familial ties to China. These migrants are negotiating a complex outsider\u2013insider relation to the host society typical of diasporic community formation, \u2018a process not of absolute othering, but rather of entangled tension\u2019 (Clifford 2006: 451). Shanghai expatriates make claims to urban citizenship, but these largely symbolic claims are limited and contingent (Farrer 2010a).  This paper extends this research empirically by contrasting the claims of \u201cbelonging\u201d and \u201cnot belonging in the city\u201d through interviews with expatriates interviewed in Shanghai. I contrast the different ways in which foreign settlers and sojourners in Shanghai describe their sense of belonging and not-belonging in the city. The larger goal is to critically examine the claim that Shanghai has already become a multicultural city.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32866129, "asset_id": 3646925, "asset_type": "Work",

Based upon ethnographic research in Chengdu, I explore how Tibetan urbanites navigate the sensorially intense market, sorting its sights, sounds, and smells to determine who and what belongs as authentically Tibetan Buddhist. In the process, I argue, they are laying claim to an ability to feel the in/authentic acquired through being born and raised as a Tibetan. This practical ability is what I call an aesthetic habitus. Yet, many Tibetans fear this ability is being eroded; it is no longer clear who and what belongs, contributing to anxieties that Tibetans as a distinct ethnoreligious community will be extinguished.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75744233, "asset_id": 63257018, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5102066, "first_name": "Trine", "last_name": "Brox", "domain_name": "ku-dk", "page_name": "TrineBrox", "display_name": "Trine Brox", "profile_url": "https://ku-dk.academia.edu/TrineBrox?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5102066/3298788/12462835/s65_trine.brox.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 808, "name": "Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1526, "name": "Sensors and Sensing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sensors_and_Sensing?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2905, "name": "Tibetan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2906, "name": "Buddhist Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Buddhist_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7773, "name": "Everyday Aesthetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Everyday_Aesthetics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 8240, "name": "Tibet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibet?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 13025, "name": "Habitus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Habitus?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14150, "name": "Urban Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Culture?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 18313, "name": "Tibetan Buddhism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tibetan_Buddhism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19866, "name": "Material Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Religion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 20602, "name": "China studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China_studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 33457, "name": "Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 96769, "name": "Commercialisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commercialisation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1346031, "name": "Chengdu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chengdu?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 40594811, "title": "The Impact of Informational and Motivational Social Media Communication on First-year Students\u2019 Levels of Hope, Career Goals, Academic Self-efficacy, Sense of Belonging, Grades, and Retention", "created_at": "2019-10-11T15:15:47.385-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40594811/The_Impact_of_Informational_and_Motivational_Social_Media_Communication_on_First_year_Students_Levels_of_Hope_Career_Goals_Academic_Self_efficacy_Sense_of_Belonging_Grades_and_Retention?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_40594811", "summary": "First-Year Seminar (FYS) courses are commonly used by higher education institutions to onboard new students, while also increasing academic success and retention. This mixed-methods study explored how using a social media platform, Slack, impacted hope, academic self-efficacy, career goals, sense of belonging and how these variables impacted student GPA, course grades, and retention after the first semester of study. The sample was formed from a total group of 1,000 incoming first-year students, with an n=131 participating during the pretest, posttest, or both surveys during the time of the study.  The sample population was placed into three groups, with one intervention group receiving motivational and informational Slack Messages, another group receiving only informational Slack messages, and a control group that received neither.  The 8 week intervention, which provided students motivational messages and videos through Slack, was provided to students in order to compare how the use of such material would compare to FYS courses that did not use such an intervention. The quantitative findings found no significant difference among the three groups after the end of the first semester of study. However, the results did find that academic self-efficacy and rejection and exclusion, in terms of one\u2019s feelings towards sense of belonging, correlated and predicted FYS course grades and GPA at the end of the semester, while hope and careers goals did not.  Qualitative results found that students who built connections with their peers and faculty, participated on campus, and could connect non-course activities with their major of study, had a deeper perception of their sense of belonging to campus. Further qualitative results about the intervention pointed to a need to improve how Slack was used in the intervention groups\u2019 FYS courses, in order for the intervention to better impact students perceptions of the variables explored in the study.  Qualitative results also pointed to many students having a deep understanding of what motivates them to succeed, how they can bridge the gap between academic study and their future careers, and how to work with others to achieve their dreams. Consequently, this study provides an insight into a potential intervention that can be used with students that is free and easy to setup, but needs further exploration into how the intervention can be best used to help students develop themselves.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60874051, "asset_id": 40594811, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11332357, "first_name": "Ryan", "last_name": "Eller", "domain_name": "csumb", "page_name": "RyanEller", "display_name": "Ryan Eller", "profile_url": "https://csumb.academia.edu/RyanEller?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11332357/10602859/11834751/s65_ryan.eller.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3668, "name": "Student Motivation And Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Motivation_And_Engagement?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4684, "name": "First Year Experience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Year_Experience?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48862, "name": "Social Media and Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media_and_Higher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 66911, "name": "Career Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Career_Development?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 104446, "name": "Academic achievement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_achievement?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 39712162, "title": "Belonging in Space: Informal Learning Spaces and the Student Experience", "created_at": "2019-06-27T18:33:29.278-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39712162/Belonging_in_Space_Informal_Learning_Spaces_and_the_Student_Experience?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_39712162", "summary": "In the face of diverse challenges to traditional higher education (HE) models, creating and defining the value of an on\u2010campus student experience has become a key concern for HE institutions.

I stress the role of identification rather than identity, relationality, processuality and performativity in understanding the relations between nationhood and homosexuality. Homosexual subjects attaining the rituals of national bereavement break the chains of interlinked subject positions and social expectations. In doing so, nationhood is rendered a \u201chybrid\u201d space of identification for the homosexual subject. Consequently, mourning becomes an act of \u201cqueering\u201d the nation, a wilful subversion of culturally and traditionally sanctioned performative recollections of nationhood (Polishness).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37938320, "asset_id": 9824189, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7982, "first_name": "Roberto", "last_name": "Kulpa", "domain_name": "napier", "page_name": "RobertoKulpa", "display_name": "Roberto Kulpa", "profile_url": "https://napier.academia.edu/RobertoKulpa?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7982/2872/105912061/s65_roberto.kulpa.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8104, "name": "Mourning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mourning?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10802, "name": "Subversion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Subversion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27363, "name": "Poland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Poland?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76967, "name": "Homonationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homonationalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 159218, "name": "Death, Grief, and Mourning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Death_Grief_and_Mourning?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 234644, "name": "Mourning and melancholia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mourning_and_melancholia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 640768, "name": "Melancholic Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melancholic_Nationalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 640769, "name": "Melancholic Sexual Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Melancholic_Sexual_Politics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 832210, "name": "LGBT In Central and Eastern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/LGBT_In_Central_and_Eastern_Europe?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1723408, "name": "Queer Melancholia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Melancholia?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 9484825, "title": "Exploring the Sense of Belonging and the Notion of Home in Margaret Atwood's Cat's Eye", "created_at": "2014-11-24T21:19:42.379-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9484825/Exploring_the_Sense_of_Belonging_and_the_Notion_of_Home_in_Margaret_Atwoods_Cats_Eye?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_9484825", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35716859, "asset_id": 9484825, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 22203442, "first_name": "Fatin", "last_name": "Syuhada", "domain_name": "upm", "page_name": "FatinSyuhada", "display_name": "Fatin Syuhada", "profile_url": "https://upm.academia.edu/FatinSyuhada?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/22203442/6074076/10788840/s65_fatin.syuhada.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2418, "name": "Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27647, "name": "Margaret Atwood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Margaret_Atwood?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30044, "name": "Abraham Maslow", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Abraham_Maslow?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 148001, "name": "Hierarchy of Needs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hierarchy_of_Needs?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 367617, "name": "Choice Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choice_Theory?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 2451521, "title": "Venir \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9.

The study expands the analyses of the soldier characters in the plays by juxtaposing the theories of belonging and sense of belonging with related studies on several other psychological concepts, such as recognition, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and transference.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68977257, "asset_id": 51135571, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37784, "first_name": "Mustafa", "last_name": "Bal", "domain_name": "etu", "page_name": "MustafaBal", "display_name": "Mustafa  Bal", "profile_url": "https://etu.academia.edu/MustafaBal?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37784/12552/99839/s65_mustafa.bal.jpg"}, {"id": 105773044, "first_name": "\u00c7a\u011fan", "last_name": "F\u0131rt\u0131na", "domain_name": "metu", "page_name": "\u00c7a\u011fanF\u0131rt\u0131na", "display_name": "\u00c7a\u011fan F\u0131rt\u0131na", "profile_url": "https://metu.academia.edu/%C3%87a%C4%9FanF%C4%B1rt%C4%B1na?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 947, "name": "Theatre Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1332, "name": "Theatre History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3381, "name": "Contemporary British Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_British_Theatre?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6222, "name": "Drama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Drama?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 9396, "name": "Contemporary Drama", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Drama?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12737, "name": "Sarah Kane", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sarah_Kane?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 29102, "name": "Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theatre?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 36864, "name": "In-Yer-Face Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In-Yer-Face_Theatre?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 36865, "name": "In Yer Face Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/In_Yer_Face_Theatre?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 49234, "name": "Contemporary Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Theatre?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 109750, "name": "Anthony Neilson", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthony_Neilson?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 841574, "name": "Blasted", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Blasted?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1282006, "name": "Belongingness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belongingness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3852500, "name": "Penetrator (play by Anthony Neilson)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Penetrator_play_by_Anthony_Neilson_?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 45607700, "title": "Storyscapes of place: First Nation youths' photographic depictions of home", "created_at": "2021-03-24T10:16:03.436-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45607700/Storyscapes_of_place_First_Nation_youths_photographic_depictions_of_home?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_45607700", "summary": "Cultural continuity and a sense of belonging are of central importance to the health and wellness of Indigenous youth.

This photovoice project investigated how a group of high school students in a remote Canadian First Nations community would represent positive elements of their day-today lives. What resulted were a series of photo essays, or storyscapes, that expressed the value that youth placed on family, friends, traditional activities, sports, and the deep connection to land, lake, and sky. Youth shared parts of their identity-forming life worlds through their storyscapes. Their embodied knowledge of place, self, and spirit were fed by deeper feelings of belonging and interacting with their social, physical, and spiritual environments.

In the year that followed the Brexit referendum, reported hate crimes rose by 29%, prompting fears that the vote had given new license to simmering feelings of racial resentment (Achiume 2018). Scholars typically define \u2018racism\u2019 as the belief that groups can be defined by certain innate characteristics (Murji and Solomos 2015).\n\nThere are numerous examples of recent cases in which victims were abused for being \u2018illegal\u2019, or told to \u2018go home\u2019, regardless of their citizenship status (Jones et al 2017). The beliefs that underlie these incidents of hate crime \u2013 that it is possible to tell whether someone is \u2018truly\u2019 British on the basis of superficial markers such as skin-colour, ethnic dress or accent alone \u2013 reveal the enduring power of racial thinking in society today. Yet race isn\u2019t the only lens through which minorities in Britain have been understood.\n\nAs migrants from across the world have come to settle in Britain, and as communities, policymakers and popular sentiment have adapted to their presence, a range of competing discourses have emerged, to characterise diversity in different ways. Cosmopolitanism, multiculturalism, tolerance and nativism are just a few of the prevalent discourses for understanding and discussing diversity in Britain.\n\nContents\n\n1.

In this research paper, I study how this double background affects the college experience of students at Harvard. I interviewed eleven undergraduate students who are first-generation and international, who come from all parts of the world: Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. I found that most of their experiences are aligned with what the literature suggests. An interesting finding is that they feel they do not fit either with first-generation or with other international students, feeling alienated in the community.

ISSN # 0160-2601.\n______________________________________________________________\nA multitude of diverse attributes is required for effective urban performance at various scales ranging from the immediate context of public buildings to central urban spaces, and from urban corridors to residential neighbourhoods. Following their earlier works (GRIERSON, 2014; MUNRO and GRIERSON, 2016; SALAMA, 2011; SALAMA and WIEDMANN, 2013; and SALAMA et al., 2016) the guest editors frame these qualities under a cycle of three main symbiotic pillars: the imagined, the measured, and the experienced, which contribute to the development of insights that elucidate various parameters for exploring urban performance. These three pillars stem from the Lefebvrian arguments and his theory on the production of space, which postulates a triadic relationship of three different but related types of spaces: the conceived (Imagined), the perceived (measured) and the lived (experienced).\n\nPrimarily, Lefebvre de\ufb01ned \u2018conceived space\u2019 as the space which is theorised by scientists and planners, known as \u2018representations of space\u2019, representations that are intangible and are entrenched in the principles, imperatives, beliefs and visions of experts, decision makers, and those who are in a position to impose their personal notion of \u2018order\u2019 onto concrete reality. The second is \u2018perceived space\u2019, the space of \u2018spatial practice\u2019 de\ufb01ned as the space where movement and interaction takes place, where networks develop and materialise. Consequently, it includes both daily routines at an individual level and urban realities such as the networks that link places designated for work, leisure and \u2018private\u2019 life (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 38). The third is \u2018lived space\u2019, which is explained as the unconscious, non-verbal direct relation between people and space. This is the space that is occupied through associated images and symbols (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 39). The current body of knowledge on Lefebvre\u2019s work suggests that the \u2018conceived space\u2019 is abstract and tactical and where authority functions, the \u2018perceived space\u2019 is a pragmatic, physical space encompassing flows of investment, workforce, and information and that this where the conceived and lived spaces are construed. Salama and Wiedmann (2013) suggest that the \u2018lived space\u2019 is the most subjective space, involving the actual experience of individuals that is performed in the \u2018perceived space\u2019 and as a result of the \u2018conceived space\u2019.\n\nIn our call for papers, the premise was that contributions to this issue of Open House International (OHI) would address the way in which decision-making processes, led by policy makers and discipline experts, contribute to successful urban environments; how the social and spatial practices of key actors (investors, developers, and users) manifest diverse urban activities; and how users attach to places and identify with their surroundings as a basis for social and spatial justice. Contributions were expected to address one of the three pillars while offering implications on the other two.  In response we have received more than 40 abstracts, and subsequently identified 19 for further development into full papers towards submission for review.

Therefore, kink communities are vital for creating safe spaces for people who identify as kinky. In this article, I discuss the ways in which the sense of belonging is created in the Finnish kink communities, in particular in their kink events. In kink communities solidarity acts as an important aspect in creating a feeling of belonging. It manifests in shared experiences and knowledge, etiquette rules and consensuality, dressing up in fetish attire and volunteer work at associations. Through interviews, written kinky life stories and participant observation I have examined the experiences of individuals, myself included, to obtain an understanding of the kink phenomenon and the elements that contribute to the sense of belonging. For some people it is important to be able to attend kink events and have face-to-face encounters, whereas others are part of a community online. Yet, the mere existence of the kink community might be enough for an individual to achieve a feeling of belonging to a community.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54137865, "asset_id": 34222425, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 67255949, "first_name": "Johanna", "last_name": "Pohtinen", "domain_name": "utu", "page_name": "JohannaPohtinen", "display_name": "Johanna Pohtinen", "profile_url": "https://utu.academia.edu/JohannaPohtinen?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/67255949/17497157/65882195/s65_johanna.pohtinen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3114, "name": "Queer Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Queer_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10336, "name": "Ethnology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 26054, "name": "BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Sadomasochism), Kink, Fetish", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/BDSM_Bondage_Discipline_Sadomasochism_Kink_Fetish?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 27903, "name": "Affect (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 32489233, "title": "(2017) Energy Talk, Temporality, and Belonging in Austerity Greece.

However, winter 2012\u20132013 and 2013\u20132014 witnessed a return en-masse to open-fires and wood-burning stoves as a means for people to heat their homes, something locals associate with material poverty, pre-modernity, and pre-Europeanization. Drawing on ethnographic research in the town of Trikala, central Greece, this article demonstrates how \"energy talk\" provides a prism through which locals discuss the past, the future, and increasing poverty, and reassess their belonging in a modern Europe.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52675447, "asset_id": 32489233, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1231864, "first_name": "Daniel M.", "last_name": "Knight", "domain_name": "st-andrews", "page_name": "DanielMKnight", "display_name": "Daniel M.

Israel by Jews from Western countries has been growing over recent years. Jerusalem attracts more of these mainly religious immigrants than any other city in Israel, and many choose to live in the Baka neighbourhood. These lifestyle/homecoming migrants come to Israel for religious and ideological reasons, seeking a sense of belonging to place. Paradoxically, such belonging is only found, I argue, when living in a community of expatriates who share a similar culture, background, ideology and lifestyle. The article focuses on the aspects in which sociabilities of Anglo and French immigrants are being formed in Baka, through either real-life or virtual means. The Anglo and French 'bubbles' in Baka, which are separate from each other, are formed through people's daily routines. People meet and communicate in synagogues, parks, shops, educational institutions, at cultural events, with Facebook contacts and more. The 'bubbles' are both functional and limiting. While they enable immigrants to find support as they deal with the difficulties of immigration, they also make it harder to assimilate into Israeli society. While migrants gain a sense of belonging in their new locale, they do so from within the 'bubble' and remain strangers outside of it.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56845767, "asset_id": 8376170, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5720371, "first_name": "Hila", "last_name": "Zaban", "domain_name": "kinneret", "page_name": "HilaZaban", "display_name": "Hila Zaban", "profile_url": "https://kinneret.academia.edu/HilaZaban?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5720371/2477391/65989179/s65_hila.zaban.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 43809, "name": "Jerusalem", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jerusalem?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 275662, "name": "Lifestyle Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lifestyle_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898916, "name": "Homecoming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homecoming?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 2281223, "title": "TEMPORARILY \u201cHOME\u201d Welcoming cities for homelessness : future scenarios of temporary houses in the urban contest ", "created_at": "2012-12-12T01:37:04.991-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2281223/TEMPORARILY_HOME_Welcoming_cities_for_homelessness_future_scenarios_of_temporary_houses_in_the_urban_contest?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_2281223", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 31216957, "asset_id": 2281223, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2879763, "first_name": "Elena Enrica", "last_name": "Giunta", "domain_name": "polimi", "page_name": "ElenaEnricaGiunta", "display_name": "Elena Enrica Giunta", "profile_url": "https://polimi.academia.edu/ElenaEnricaGiunta?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2879763/1543363/1873509/s65_elena_enrica.giunta.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22455, "name": "Asylum seekers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asylum_seekers?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22656, "name": "Hospitality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 124587, "name": "Temporary migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Temporary_migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 362579, "name": "Home and belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_and_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 703081, "name": "Hospitality Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality_Design?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 1936863, "title": "Beyond validity of general admissions tests: The \u2018will to acceptance\u2019 in the US graduate school complex", "created_at": "2012-09-14T15:58:01.097-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1936863/Beyond_validity_of_general_admissions_tests_The_will_to_acceptance_in_the_US_graduate_school_complex?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_1936863", "summary": "Many universities require submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores with applications thereby invalidating other general measurements.

No doubt that, every act of migration has a \u2018challenge\u2019 in itself. The most important of these challenges is the acquiring of livable place that evolves due to the need for shelter that is one of the most essential needs of humankind. On that point, the task of the people, who specialized in the disciplines of design and architecture, is to draw this contemporary issue through the spatial aspects of migration. Today, the spatial distribution of migration in Turkey is divided into two groups as accommodation centers and cities in general. In the case of emergency, well-intentioned accommodation centers were built as temporal response to this problem to find an immediate solution. It is aimed that meeting the basic human needs in the proper way, but these spaces couldn\u2019t give the feeling of being at home. Instead of staying in the accommodation centers, due to the various difficulties and dissatisfactions experienced in these areas, the process of acquiring a place by migrating to various cities results with establishing a \u2018home\u2019. In the process of searching for livable place and re-establishing of the home, individuals past experiences and the role of the new place in memories becomes essential.

While the State of Israel rejected the presence of non-Jewish migrants, many citizens accepted them. Latinos grew to favor cultural assimilation to Israeli society. In 2005, after a large-scale deportation campaign that drew criticism from many quarters, Israel made the historic decision to legalize the status of some undocumented migrant families on the basis of their cultural assimilation and identification with the State. By doing so, the author maintains, Israel recognized the importance of practical belonging for understanding citizenship and national identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52238402, "asset_id": 697224, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 514615, "first_name": "Barak", "last_name": "Kalir", "domain_name": "uva", "page_name": "BarakKalir", "display_name": "Barak Kalir", "profile_url": "https://uva.academia.edu/BarakKalir?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/514615/196469/26355017/s65_barak.kalir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 954, "name": "Social Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2604, "name": "Israel Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5349, "name": "Irregular Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irregular_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 7313, "name": "Labor Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Labor_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 9731, "name": "Irregular/Informal Settlements Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Irregular_Informal_Settlements_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12570, "name": "Undocumented Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Undocumented_Immigration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16471, "name": "Sociology of Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16622, "name": "Contemporary International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_International_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19051, "name": "Transnational Labour Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Labour_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 34642, "name": "Israel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 42371, "name": "Israel and Zionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel_and_Zionism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 48036, "name": "International Migration and Immigration Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration_and_Immigration_Policy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 157969, "name": "Latinoamerica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latinoamerica?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 9798354, "title": "Burial and Belonging", "created_at": "2014-12-16T09:56:55.633-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9798354/Burial_and_Belonging?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_9798354", "summary": "This article explores the role that funerary practices and burial decisions play in the construction of national and political identities amongst muslim immigrants in Germany. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with Islamic undertakers, migrant families, and religious leaders in Berlin it argues that the act of burial serves as a powerful means to assert belonging in migratory settings. While local burial laws impact the feasibility of Islamic funerary rites, this article suggests that family ties, ideas about the soil, and feelings of social exclusion play a larger role in shaping burial outcomes than the laws of the dead. By conferring a sense of fixity or permanence to identities that are more fluid or ambivalent in life, determining where a dead body belongs helps demarcate social and communal boundaries.

While the association between school belonging and teacher support and school belonging and exposure to bullying are well documented in the literature, less is known about how these relationships vary depending on students' socioeconomic status (SES). The aim of this study was to investigate whether SES moderated the relationship between school belonging and these school-related factors. The sample was drawn from the 14,273 Australian 15 and 16-year-olds who completed the 2018 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) survey. Linear regression analyses revealed that the association between school belonging and teacher support was not moderated by SES and there was a positive relationship between SES and sense of school belonging, even after accounting for teacher support, exposure to bullying and other student and school characteristics. Despite limitations, this study fills a gap in the literature, provides a foundation for further research to build on, and has potential implications for how safety should be promoted for students of both high and low SES for teacher support to more strongly influence their sense of school belonging.

While waria form a visible social category, they suffer from various prevailing stigmas, of which a significant share is tied to some cultural assumptions embedded in the mainstream understanding of Islamic morality. While most waria do not feel comfortable practising their religion in public, many describe their subjectivity along the distinction between their bodies and their inner sense of gender as God\u2019s will. Consequently, permanent bodily modifications are associated with the notion of sin. These conceptions have enabled a specific form of Indonesian transgender embodiment. This article addresses the bodily negotiations of waria against the background of their religious sensitivities and aspirations for belonging. The spiritually grounded sentiments in relation to their bodies and the sense of gender on one hand, and the signs of increased focus on embodied expression of religiosity among waria on the other, signal the desire for reimagining belonging to Indonesian (Muslim) society. Religious sensitivity, while being the major cause of anxieties on both personal and societal levels, has provided waria with important frameworks which enhance their own relative acceptance of their embodied subjectivity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 81929265, "asset_id": 73389682, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8965071, "first_name": "terje", "last_name": "toomistu", "domain_name": "ut-ee", "page_name": "TerjeCece", "display_name": "terje toomistu", "profile_url": "https://ut-ee.academia.edu/TerjeCece?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8965071/2928209/30882206/s65_terje.toomistu.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2624, "name": "Transgender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transgender_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4707, "name": "Indonesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4920, "name": "Anthropology of Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Gender?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 11155, "name": "Women and Gender Issues in Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Gender_Issues_in_Islam?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12093, "name": "Theories of Gender and Transgender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Gender_and_Transgender?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12693, "name": "Body Image", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Body_Image?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 84377, "name": "Body Modification", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Body_Modification?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 90384, "name": "Feminist Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminist_Anthropology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1301756, "name": "Waria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Waria?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 72063033, "title": "Who \u201cBelongs\u201d?

I argue that, within the partial involution of social bonds that market economy creates, two aspects of local cultural intimacy get progressively divorced:\u00a0familiality (the basis of collective identification) is denied, whereas familiarity (recognition of shared avoidance of state rules) is intensified.\u00a0The key to this process is a massive shift to idioms of nuclear family, that underline not the sameness but equivalence of self-interests as the ultimate explanation of social life. Here, people are recognized as responsible for their families and engaged in interest-driven activities of all kinds to fulfil that responsibility. Establishing a homology between politicians and \u2018ordinary people\u2019, familiarisation of interest creates a space of coexistence and mutuality between the citizens and the bureaucrats, and a critical resource for making politics close and \u2018sincere\u2019 again. But, at the same time, it marks all claims of common identity to seem as false and exploitative. Everyone works for themselves and their own families, my interlocutors claimed, and this is what makes our interests comparable. But precisely because of that, they can never share the same interests. Harking back to Thatcher\u2019s infamous saying that there is \u2018no thing such as society: only individual men, women, and families\u2019 - I suggest that familiarity is a relational modality in which resemblance\u00a0is recognized, whereas identity is denied, instituting new forms of bonds that go beyond the collectivist ethos of nation states.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57150237, "asset_id": 35226664, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 278797, "first_name": "Ivan", "last_name": "Rajkovi\u0107", "domain_name": "univie", "page_name": "IvanRajkovi\u0107", "display_name": "Ivan Rajkovi\u0107", "profile_url": "https://univie.academia.edu/IvanRajkovi%C4%87?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/278797/57341/97768370/s65_ivan.rajkovi_.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3472, "name": "Political Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5903, "name": "Postsocialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postsocialism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15875, "name": "Anthropology of Kinship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Kinship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 44835, "name": "Serbian Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Serbian_Politics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 55540, "name": "Post-yugoslav politics, Post-socialism and EU integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-yugoslav_politics_Post-socialism_and_EU_integration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 73699, "name": "Corruption", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Corruption?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 78630, "name": "Serbia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Serbia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 84290, "name": "Familiarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Familiarity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 95215, "name": "Cultural Intimacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Intimacy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 364874, "name": "Kragujevac", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kragujevac?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 564401, "name": "Morals and Markets", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Morals_and_Markets?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 576621, "name": "Self Interest", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Interest?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1379515, "name": "Anthropology of Kinship and the Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Kinship_and_the_Family?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 35059295, "title": "Seeking Economic and Social Justice in Singapore.pdf", "created_at": "2017-11-05T08:24:29.361-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35059295/Seeking_Economic_and_Social_Justice_in_Singapore_pdf?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_35059295", "summary": "Singapore is known worldwide for its rapid economic growth and high quality of life. However, not all Singaporeans are reaping the benefits of the good life that has been associated with their country\u2019s economic success. To communicate their discontent, approximately 5,000 Singaporeans voiced their criticisms, concerns, and hardships at a rare public protest in downtown Singapore on February 16, 2013. The protest was geared towards the government\u2019s recommendation to increase migration to Singapore in order to sustain its economic growth. The protest was organized by the nonprofit organization transitioning.org, which represents the unemployed and underemployed in Singapore. Although protests of this size are uncommon in Singapore, a brief review of the country\u2019s history reveals a series of struggles that have been ignited by ethnic/racial tensions, rapid social change, and growing income and wealth inequalities. This paper examines current struggles for economic and social justice in Singapore. It investigates the factors that contributed to public protests and a riot, and the ways in which transitioning.org tries to obtain economic and social justice for Singapore\u2019s underprivileged.

A children\u2019s rights regime should ideally be responsive to the complementary needs \u201cto be\u201d and the need \u201cto become\u201d within the right to identity. Granting the right to autonomy, responding to the child\u2019s need \u201cto become,\u201d and overcoming adult paternalism is often perceived as the most advanced and most problematic stage in the evolution of child law. This perception is misleading. The need to be one\u2019s self is sometimes neglected by advocates of children\u2019s rights, though it is well embedded in social science literature.

In particular, many M\u0101ori suffer significant health and wellbeing inequalities compared to the non-M\u0101ori population. In an effort to reduce such inequalities, there is a growing consciousness of the need to better understand the cultural and place-specific determinants that affect the health and wellbeing of population groups in different environments. This article explores how environmental and cultural connections to land enable the development of place-specific and culturally-driven principles that promote the health and wellbeing of M\u0101ori populations.

Human capital were to become as mobile as financial, human individuals as free to roam the globe as the goods and services they produced and consumed. The perks of the global village would inexorably reduce the significance of place-bound communities. As globalization began to reap financial turmoil, political disaffection, economic injustice and social dislocation, triumph turned uncertainty and the demarcation lines of identity and belonging, new and old, inherited and invented, terrestrial and virtual, open and closed, soon criss-crossed the European landscape. Add to this the immediate dislocating effects of rapid and large-scale migration, and it is not hard to see why the spectre of homelessness might again come to haunt European societies.

Networks, festivities, practices and habits of Bangladeshis in Lavapi\u00e9s are generally oriented towards Bangladesh. Nevertheless, Bangladeshis dub their restaurants and other businesses \" Indian \" as part of an ethnic marketing strategy that uses national/identitarian descriptions as a resource. This self-denomination is explained through historic and cultural links to India, though the practice also evolved within the framework of colonial relations to Britain. As will be shown, the restaurant and food business in which Bangladeshis in Lavapi\u00e9s engage emerged over centuries of cultural criss-crossings between Europe and the Indian subcontinent, only more recently being introduced to Spain. These translocal dynamics in the historic and contemporary dimensions of migrants' experiences result in the possibility of highly contextual activations of self-descriptions and self-representations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43071087, "asset_id": 22453896, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9793784, "first_name": "Lara", "last_name": "J\u00fcssen", "domain_name": "flacsoandes", "page_name": "LaraJ\u00fcssen", "display_name": "Lara  J\u00fcssen", "profile_url": "https://flacsoandes.academia.edu/LaraJ%C3%BCssen?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9793784/13911317/27109148/s65_lara.j_ssen.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 27, "name": "Entrepreneurship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entrepreneurship?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3128, "name": "Sociology of Food and Eating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Food_and_Eating?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4000, "name": "Anthropology of Food", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Food?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4138, "name": "Hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 18895, "name": "Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangladesh?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 23342, "name": "Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 39356, "name": "Translocality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translocality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53034, "name": "Cultural hybridity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_hybridity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 148438, "name": "Anthropology and Sociology of Food, Taste and the Senses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_and_Sociology_of_Food_Taste_and_the_Senses?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 153884, "name": "Multilingual Studies, Identity Studies, Border identities, hybridity, multilingualism, poetry, bilingual poetry, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, globalization studies, third culture kids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Studies_Identity_Studies_Border_identities_hybridity_multilingualism_poetry_bilin?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 176490, "name": "Migraci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migraci%C3%B3n?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 178842, "name": "Soziologie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Soziologie?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 305899, "name": "India Bangladesh relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/India_Bangladesh_relations?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 360608, "name": "Sociolgia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolgia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 498626, "name": "Entangled Histories", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Entangled_Histories?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 513745, "name": "Migrant entrepreneurship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_entrepreneurship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 6530199, "title": "\u201cI am working-class\u201d: Subjective self-definition as a missing measure of social class and socioeconomic status in higher education research.

However, recent research in psychology and sociology has stressed the more subjective and intersectional nature of social class.  The authors argue that it is important to consider subjective self-definitions of social class and SES alongside more traditional objective measures.

In examining the particular situation of each Baltic state and the response to international pressure for integration and social inclusion policy, Muiznieks, Rozenvalds and Birka note the roles of threat-perception, the historic context, the linguistic and citizenship policy, as well as socio-economic inequality, in facilitating Russian-speakers\u2019 sense of belonging to their respective Baltic state. While ostensibly aimed at fostering a sense of belonging to the national state, Baltic integration and social inclusion policy has often had a contradictory effect, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the emphasis on the majority language and culture as a prerequisite for access to citizenship and formal membership has enhanced the threat-perceptions of minorities, and led to their alienation or identification with the external homeland of Russia. In Lithuania, early inclusion of minorities into the polity has had a beneficial long-term impact in terms of their identification with their country of residence, demonstrated by the fact that Russian-speakers express a greater sense of belonging to Lithuania. A review of the available survey data on the Baltic states suggests that the same cannot be said for Estonia and Latvia, where minorities express a weak sense of belonging to the state. This suggests a challenging road ahead for Estonia and Latvia in achieving social cohesion, understood by minorities as a sense of membership in the community and feelings of mutual recognition. Furthermore, all three Baltic states, Latvia in particular, have yet to address growing socio-economic inequality, which threatens to cause long-term difficulties for social cohesion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35196269, "asset_id": 3982598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3764761, "first_name": "Ieva", "last_name": "Birka", "domain_name": "lu-lv", "page_name": "IevaBirka", "display_name": "Ieva Birka", "profile_url": "https://lu-lv.academia.edu/IevaBirka?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3764761/1360295/6153530/s65_ieva.birka.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4500, "name": "Baltic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Baltic_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1153800, "title": "Edmund Husserl's Homeworld & Alienworld in Alan Ball\u2019s HBO Television Series, SIX FEET UNDER  (2013)", "created_at": "2011-12-13T02:57:59.159-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1153800/Edmund_Husserls_Homeworld_and_Alienworld_in_Alan_Ball_s_HBO_Television_Series_SIX_FEET_UNDER_2013_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_1153800", "summary": "\"This chapter provides one phenomenological interpretation of writer and director Alan Ball\u2019s popular Home Box Office cable-television series, Six Feet Under, which completed its fifth and final season in 2005.

What is less well known is how very much these youngsters want to learn at school. Children and adolescents from violent backgrounds, like others, equate education with a hopeful future and are eager to attend. However, when they do go to school, the violence that they experience leaves them terrified to think. Instead they resort to concrete enactments that make completing school work nearly impossible. Attachment based research suggests that thinking about thinking is a neuropsychological capacity that is co-created with caregivers, parents and teachers. People with \u201creflective function\u201d \u201cmentalize,\u201d that is, they think about what they are thinking and what others might be thinking. This capacity is part of what is lost when caregivers and the surrounding community are replete with random violence. The fact that we know how mentalization is created implies that it may be possible to restore, by creating conditions in the classroom that can foster it. Following an extensive review of psychoanalytic literature and theory, this paper offers a case example of a mentalization based approach to helping children affected by violence to tolerate their affects, survive putting words to experience, begin to mentalize, and through that process, succeed at school.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67281539, "asset_id": 48869881, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33747827, "first_name": "Martha", "last_name": "Bragin", "domain_name": "percprogram", "page_name": "marthabragin", "display_name": "Martha Bragin", "profile_url": "https://percprogram.academia.edu/marthabragin?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33747827/55398400/59721743/s65_martha.bragin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2072, "name": "Aggression (Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aggression_Psychology_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16834, "name": "Attachment Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Attachment_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 246379, "name": "Mentalizing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mentalizing?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 378964, "name": "Violence Against Women and Children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Violence_Against_Women_and_Children?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1010088, "name": "Reparation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reparation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3973459, "name": "Classroom Intervention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classroom_Intervention?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44485507, "title": "ENCOUNTERING AUTHENTICITY IN THE CONTACT ZONE?

Moreover, it analyses the newly opened third-wave caf\u00e9s, pubs, and theatres as new territories and ya\u015fam alan\u0131 (life space) of dissident urban youth. The in-depth interviews with new shop-owners and geospatial analysis of Moda neighbourhood suggest that gentrification produced a socio-spatial segmentation of politically differentiated consumption places in Moda neighbourhood.

On the other, I analyze how youth negotiate such discourses of invisibility by forming a revocable sense of belonging.

International in scope and open to contributions from all over the world, the series presents theoretically robust and empirically rigorous studies of students' and staff experiences of \"race\" and \"belonging\" in educational settings, where these experiences include a broad range of elements such as: student life, student representation and participation, curriculum design and delivery, diversity of reading lists and assessment, discipline and career progression, Anti-Blackness, political resistance, and related subjects such as populism, colonialism and imperialism. Books in the series are united by the belief that \"belonging\" (and \"unbelonging\") is an important issue for all peoples, and that it is not possible to understand contemporary educational institutions or experiences without understanding the extent to which issues to do with racial and ethnic (in)equality can impact organisational and individual senses of identity, work, community, values and funding. In this way, the series offers a broad perspective on \"race,\" \"ethnicity\" and \"belonging\" that considers the intersections of these ideas and contexts from a multiplicity of lenses. It offers a unique resource for academics and researchers working in the fields of educational leadership, sociology of education, anthropology of education and organisational behaviour, amongst others.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58625883, "asset_id": 38553912, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4261419, "first_name": "Jeffrey", "last_name": "Brooks", "domain_name": "curtinedu", "page_name": "JeffreyBrooks", "display_name": "Jeffrey S Brooks", "profile_url": "https://curtinedu.academia.edu/JeffreyBrooks?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4261419/1690965/2268594/s65_jeffrey_s..brooks.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11639, "name": "Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 15312, "name": "Philosophy Of Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Race?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16069, "name": "Critical Race Theory and Whiteness theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory_and_Whiteness_theory?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 17433, "name": "Race And Ethnicity (in ) migration of indigenous people", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_And_Ethnicity_in_migration_of_indigenous_people?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 18677, "name": "Race and Schooling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Schooling?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19231, "name": "Race and ethnicity (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_ethnicity_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28507, "name": "History of Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 29719, "name": "Critical Mixed Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Mixed_Race_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 149890, "name": "Race and identity in post-apartheid South Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_identity_in_post-apartheid_South_Africa?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 957019, "name": "Sociology of Ethnicity and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Ethnicity_and_Race?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37641398, "title": "Belonging to Paesens-Moddergat: friction in a village next to the Wadden-Sea", "created_at": "2018-10-24T07:02:07.470-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37641398/Belonging_to_Paesens_Moddergat_friction_in_a_village_next_to_the_Wadden_Sea?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37641398", "summary": "In the Netherlands there is a trend of people leaving rural areas, especially small towns. The Dutch government calls these regions that are dealing with a declining population and availability of work shrinkage regions. Due to this, houses in these regions are fairly cheap making them interesting for especially highly educated people from urban areas that are in search for a more peaceful life outside  the tumult of the city. This thesis is about Paesens-Moddergat, a small village that is located in a shrinkage region. Paesens-Moddergat is originally a fishing village located right next to the Wadden Sea. Due to the changing local interests, as the region is relying more and more on tourism, and the influx of so called \u2018newcomers\u2019 to the town, it is dealing with friction between original inhabitants and newcomers. This thesis proposes that this friction is one of different human-environment relations and feelings of belonging the inhabitants have. Furthermore, thesis demonstrates that the village of Pae-sens-Moddergat has always been divided in several ways. In order to demonstrate this, this thesis is divided in three chapters. The first chapter is a contextual chapter showing how the history of the vil-lage is linked to the contemporary situation and social dynamics of the place. In the second chapter different feelings of belonging are covered. Here is demonstrated how these various feelings of be-longing the inhabitants have can lead to friction. The third chapter explorers the various attitudes towards outside organisations that the inhabitants have and how this is linked to the relation the in-habitants have with their environment.

"Abstract\n\nStudying change is at the heart of any investigation into social life, whilst continuity is seen as central to a stable identity over time. Change is an unsettling, but inevitable, part of everyday life; continuity speaks of repetition over time, unity and the comfort of belonging. This paper examines how themes of nostalgia and authenticity are evoked in telling family histories in order to negotiate change and create a continuous story of belonging. Three family histories demonstrate how material objects, places and claims of family resemblances are used to create both authentic identities and authentic selves belonging to the wider community. Where there is a break in the family story and the \u2018world of restorable reach\u2019 is no longer available nostalgia creeps in to replace personal stories with communal ones. Through using both nostalgia, to inform a sense of loss and sometimes a shared past, and authenticity, to create a sense of continuity within an overall arc of change, this paper shows how family histories can work to maintain identities over time, retaining a sense of ontological security and belonging in place.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47037239, "asset_id": 12091172,

In these texts, the author does not attempt a definition of the concept of city, nor concerns himself with an urbanistic discussion. However, it is possible to observe a certain perspective, a benajminean way to face the topic of the city, that is also related to the actions of remembering and writing. That is, the method that Benjamin uses to approach the\nmodern urban phenomena is completely mediated by subjectivity and the written language. In that way, his evocation of the cities of Berlin and Paris comes to be paradigmatic and allows us to deduce the notion of modern city upon which Benjamin articulates the texts analyzed in this research. Finally, this essay proposes that the benjaminean method, as well as his conception of the modern city, is related to the urban fragmentary nature that is the product of industrial capitalism, which could influence his perception of the modern city as a place of disintegration of sense.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65890253, "asset_id": 45356213, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 31705420, "first_name": "Nelson", "last_name": "Zu\u00f1iga", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NelsonZu\u00f1iga", "display_name": "Nelson Zu\u00f1iga", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NelsonZu%C3%B1iga?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31705420/76054020/64573059/s65_nelson.zu_iga.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8330, "name": "Walter Benjamin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Walter_Benjamin?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10758, "name": "Modernity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 84393, "name": "IMAGINARIOS URBANOS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/IMAGINARIOS_URBANOS?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 195586, "name": "Modernidad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernidad?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 331846, "name": "Urban Imaginaries", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Imaginaries?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 438308, "name": "Sentido", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sentido?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 513445, "name": "Philosophy of the City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_the_City?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1256489, "name": "Filosof\u00eda Del Arte Historia E Historiograf\u00eda Del Arte Y De La Ciudad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Filosofia_Del_Arte_Historia_E_Historiografia_Del_Arte_Y_De_La_Ciudad?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1400349, "name": "Ciudad Moderna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ciudad_Moderna?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1653341, "name": "Modern City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_City?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3526427, "name": "fragmentariedad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/fragmentariedad?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44259621, "title": "Law and emotional belonging.

This article seeks to analyze the processes of familiarization and restoration of unfinished genealogies as one of the possible ways to reflect heterogeneous pasts, present lives rebuilt in cities, and future political projects in meaningful memories. Methodology: Based on a collaborative methodology - focused on ethnographic approaches based on qualitative methods for the production of original information with an emphasis on fieldwork - I have shared various activities, visits and trips with my interlocutors. These communities are the result of particular processes of group formation that are characterized by the migration and arrival of people from different places and with different trajectories. Conclusions: The Mapuche-Tehuelche recognize themselves as one and the same community in the cities when they begin to associate certain physical appearances, life stories and/or indigenous surnames with broader histories of violence, state subjugation, family breakdown and forced migrations. That becoming together as historical subjects produced novel categories of family, ancestry and community. Originality: The article is a contribution to a better understanding of other and diverse creative ways of thinking together as a family, community and/or village, and how these practices enable the regeneration of links in urban contexts marked by histories of domination and various forced migrations. \n\nKeywords: Argentina, genealogical memories, Mapuche-Tehuelche, relationships, sense of belonging.\n\nOutras formas de construir parentesco: processos de familiariza\u00e7\u00e3o e mem\u00f3rias geneal\u00f3gicas entre os Mapuche-Tehuelche do litoral e do vale de Chubut (Patag\u00f4nia, Argentina)\n\nResumo: objetivo/contexto: em 2009, quando comecei a trabalhar junto com as comunidades Mapuche-Tehuelche da regi\u00e3o litor\u00e2nea e do vale da prov\u00edncia de Chubut (Patag\u00f4nia, Argentina), compartilhei, com elas, o objetivo de colocar em hist\u00f3ria e em contexto as v\u00e1rias experi\u00eancias de ser juntos nas cidades. Este artigo busca analisar os processos de familiariza\u00e7\u00e3o e restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de genealogias inacabadas como uma das formas poss\u00edveis de constelar, em mem\u00f3rias significativas, passados heterog\u00eaneos, vidas presentes refeitas nas cidades e futuros projetos pol\u00edticos. Metodologia: com base em uma metodologia colaborativa \u2014 focada em abordagens etnogr\u00e1ficas baseadas nos m\u00e9todos qualitativos de produ\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00f5es originais, com \u00eanfase no trabalho de campo \u2014 compartilhei v\u00e1rias atividades, visitas e viagens com meus interlocutores.

Conclus\u00f5es: nas cidades, os Mapuche-Tehuelche se reconhecem como um mesmo povo quando associam certas apar\u00eancias f\u00edsicas, hist\u00f3rias de vida e/ou sobrenomes ind\u00edgenas a hist\u00f3rias mais amplas de viol\u00eancia, opress\u00e3o estatal, reestrutura\u00e7\u00e3o familiar e migra\u00e7\u00e3o for\u00e7ada.

Guided by these principles, we identified five drivers that impact student belonging at the university, and proposed a measurement framework to form an 'index' of belonging that can be tracked and reported.

The participants were 117 prospective teachers at a state university in Ankara. In order to collect data, a personal information form, a belonging scale and a community of inquiry instrument were used. The belonging scale was adapted into Turkish by Ersanl\u0131 and Ko\u00e7yi\u011fit (2013) from a scale developed by Hagerty and Patusky (1995). The community of inquiry instrument was adapted into Turkish by Ozturk (2012) from a scale developed by Arbaugh, Cleveland-Innes, Diaz, Garrison, Ice, Richardson and Swan (2008). According to the results, the overall sense of belonging to prospective teachers was found to be at a good level. It can be said that blended learning activities by prospective teachers don\u2019t cause social alienation and isolation. Teacher candidates\u2019 social, instructional and cognitive presence perception is at a good level and were found to be similar to each other.

Drawing upon empirical data from two case studies, we conceptualize belonging as a process of sense-making tied to place and value. We find that social class identity and locality play a vibrant role in the shaping of young people's identities. In seeking to understand how social experiences of young people are lived within classed, ethnic and gendered life worlds, we draw on sociological scholarship of youth, place and space.

It does so in dialogue with two broad, interrelated bodies of literature, citizenship and transnationalism, which have examined issues of belonging, exclusion, mobility and access to rights among transnational migrants, while highlighting the renewed capacity of the state to regulate both people\u2019s movements and migrants\u2019 actual access to public entitlements. My dissertation challenges three sets of claims shaping research and policy agendas on migrant transnationalism and citizenship, and questions the hegemonic analytical and methodological approaches underlying them.\nMy research has been carried out at two distinctive analytical and empirical levels. On the one hand, I examine the \u201ctechnologies of citizenship\u201d (Ong 2003, Fujiwara 2008) deployed by the government to transform Argentina into a diverse, inclusive and Latin American nation over the past decade, paying particular attention to Kirchnerismo\u2019s creation of a \u201cnew legality\u201d for the Paraguayans, Bolivians and Peruvians in the country. On the other\nhand, I analyze the \u201chorizontal dimensions of citizenship processes\u201d (Neveu 2005, Pickus and Skerry 2007, Gagn\u00e9 and Neveu 2009) among these migrants in urban, peripheral and rural\nareas of the partido of La Plata. Namely, I study the extent to which migrants\u2019 socio-economic circumstances have changed in tandem with their new legal status (as nationals of the\nMERCOSUR in Argentina with rights equal to those of its citizens) and the \u201cinclusive citizenship\u201d policies deployed by the government.\nMy dissertation pays particular attention to the grounding and embodiment of rights by examining how migrants\u2019 new legal status translates into everyday life depending on a) where\nthey live and work, and b) their perceived social status by other migrants and non-migrants. On the one hand, I look at urban, peripheral and rural areas of La Plata as zones of graduated\nsovereignty (Ong 1999) where particular governmentality regimes have emerged in tandem with the settlement of often ethnically marked groupings, whose entitlements and obligations\ndiffer from those in other zones. On the other hand, I examine how social status is produced through everyday social interaction by transposing socially constructed distinctions, such as race, class, gender and national origin, into formal systems of exclusion (Gregory 2007). My ethnographic analysis of what I shall call lim\u00edtrofes\u2019 experiences of legality demonstrates that\ntheir formal equality vis-\u00e0-vis Argentinians, far from being merely given as a new legal status evenly guaranteed to all, is both unequally experienced by diverse migrants and differently\nenforced in geographic areas governed by distinctive governmentality regimes (Foucault 1978).\nKeywords : anthropology, socio-cultural anthropology, ethnography, transnationality, migration, regional integration, citizenship, state, MERCOSUR, Argentina.\n\nDe mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ma th\u00e8se examine les m\u00e9canismes des processus sociaux, \u00e9conomiques et politiques ayant contribu\u00e9, souvent de mani\u00e8re contradictoire, \u00e0 la (re)d\u00e9finition des crit\u00e8res d\u2019adh\u00e9sion au sein de la nation et de l\u2019Etat. Elle le fait par le\ndialogue au sein de deux grands corps de litt\u00e9rature intimement li\u00e9s, la citoyennet\u00e9 et le transnationalisme, qui se sont pench\u00e9s sur les questions d\u2019appartenance, d\u2019exclusion, de mobilit\u00e9 et d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux droits chez les migrants transnationaux tout en soulignant la capacit\u00e9 accrue de l\u2019Etat \u00e0 r\u00e9guler \u00e0 la fois les d\u00e9placements de personnes et l\u2019acc\u00e8s des migrants aux\ndroits. Cette th\u00e8se remet en question trois principes qui influencent la recherche et les programmes d\u2019action publique ayant trait au transnationalisme et \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 des\nmigrants, et remet en cause les approches analytiques h\u00e9g\u00e9moniques et m\u00e9thodologiques qui les sous-tendent.\nL\u2019\u00e9tude a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e \u00e0 deux niveaux distincts d\u2019analyse empirique et analytique. D\u2019une part, nous examinons les \u00ab technologies de la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00bb (Ong 2003, Fujiwara 2008) qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es par le gouvernement pour transformer l\u2019Argentine en une nation latinoam\u00e9ricaine diverse et inclusive pendant la derni\u00e8re d\u00e9cennie, en nous int\u00e9ressant particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation, par le Kirchnerisme, d\u2019une \u00ab nouvelle l\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb pour les Paraguayens, les Boliviens et les P\u00e9ruviens r\u00e9sidant dans le pays. D\u2019autre part, nous analysons la \u00ab dimension horizontale des processus de citoyennet\u00e9 \u00bb (Neveu 2005, Pickus and Skerry 2007, Gagn\u00e9 and Neveu 2009) chez ces migrants dans des aires urbaines, p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques et rurales du partido de La Plata. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, nous examinons dans quelle mesure les conditions socio\u00e9conomiques des migrants ont chang\u00e9 suite \u00e0 leur nouveau statut l\u00e9gal (en tant que ressortissants du MERCOSUR en Argentine, dont les droits sont \u00e9gaux \u00e0 ceux des\ncitoyens) et aux politiques de \u00ab citoyennet\u00e9 inclusive \u00bb d\u00e9ploy\u00e9es par le gouvernement.\nCette th\u00e8se se penche particuli\u00e8rement sur les fondations et l\u2019incarnation (\u00ab embodiment \u00bb) des droits en examinant comment le nouveau statut l\u00e9gal des migrants se manifeste au quotidien en fonction de a) o\u00f9 ils vivent et travaillent, et b) leur statut social\nper\u00e7u par les autres migrants et non-migrants. D\u2019une part, nous examinons les aires urbaines, p\u00e9riph\u00e9riques et rurales de La Plata en tant que \u00ab zones de souverainet\u00e9 gradu\u00e9e \u00bb (Ong 1999), o\u00f9 des r\u00e9gimes de gouvernementalit\u00e9 locaux sp\u00e9cifiques se sont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s en lien avec l\u2019installation de groupes ethniques souvent distincts, et dont les droits et devoirs diff\u00e8rent de\nceux d\u2019autres zones. D\u2019autre part, nous \u00e9tudions la fa\u00e7on dont le statut social est produit \u00e0 travers les interactions sociales quotidiennes en transposant des distinctions construites\nsocialement telles que race, classe, genre et origine nationale, en syst\u00e8mes d\u2019exclusion formels (Gregory 2007). Notre analyse ethnographique de ce que nous appelons les \u00ab exp\u00e9riences de\nl\u00e9galit\u00e9 \u00bb des migrants d\u00e9montre que leur \u00e9galit\u00e9 formelle vis-\u00e0-vis des Argentins, loin d\u2019\u00eatre simplement donn\u00e9e comme un nouveau statut l\u00e9gal uniform\u00e9ment garanti pour tous, est \u00e0 la\nfois in\u00e9galement v\u00e9cue par les divers migrants, et diff\u00e9remment respect\u00e9e dans les zones g\u00e9ographiques dirig\u00e9es par divers r\u00e9gimes de gouvernementalit\u00e9 (Foucault 1978).\nMots-cl\u00e9s : anthropologie, anthropologie

article I introduce the concept of cultural resonance to understand the construction of things and meanings in the material and immaterial sense. The notion of resonance is theorized as an intangible affect that the material thing has beyond its formal boundaries within larger planes of perception creating dynamic relationships among humans/nonhumans and illustrating cultural decisions of material as vibrant matter. As material has vibrancy and frequency it has then the capacity to evoke an emotional and affective response to a similarity of material, style and/or form. Such response can be coded as a sensory aesthetic empathy that links to constituting subjective belonging in the ancient world. In order to explore how cultural resonance might be useful in an archaeological context, this article will utilize copper arrowheads documented from the 1978-79 excavations at the site of Ganeshwar, in the state of Rajasthan, India.

However, from an emic perspectives, the Jewish people are native to the Land of Israel. They belong there through their ancestral lineage, and therefore are merely returning. This assumption brings with it some far-reaching consequences, that are worth researching. For one, from where does the assumption come that one belongs in a place that one has never been? And how does one create an affective connection to a place that one only knows from stories? These questions lead to the question that is central to this research: How is a relationship with an ancestral homeland developed, appropriated and performed upon by ethnic return migrants, in order to create and maintain a sense of attachment and belonging to a place one does not factually originate from? With this research I have aimed to find out how and why people create a sense of belonging and attachment. Accordingly, I found out that performativity plays an important role both in the confirmation of ones sense of belonging, but also as a consequence of the identity one takes upon himself when he develops a sense of belonging. In this research I propose different routes to the development of a sense of belonging that occur in the Diaspora, based on cultural memory. I argue that a sense of place attachment is developed, in relation to the places that are central in the normative and formative texts of the cultural memory. Finally, I come to the conclusion that a sense of belonging and place attachment come together through performativity. In order to better understand the performative action of these people, I have proposed to analyze them as a social movement. As social actors, people have taken upon themselves the goals and motivations of the settlement movement, of which they are part. In an attempt to reach these goals, performative action is used to move others in their support, confirming their identity and legitimacy both to the inside, as well as to the outside.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 96305332, "first_name": "Shannon", "last_name": "witlox", "domain_name": "uppsala", "page_name": "Shannonwitlox", "display_name": "Shannon witlox", "profile_url": "https://uppsala.academia.edu/Shannonwitlox?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/96305332/21025115/39981878/s65_shannon.witlox.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11563, "name": "Performance and performativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance_and_performativity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26445, "name": "Judaism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Judaism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37116, "name": "Religious Zionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Zionism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 42371, "name": "Israel and Zionism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Israel_and_Zionism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 61638967, "title": "Citizenship: from three to seven principles of belonging", "created_at": "2021-11-13T06:31:27.674-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61638967/Citizenship_from_three_to_seven_principles_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_61638967", "summary": "Conventionally, three 'laws' are said to govern the recognition of citizenship.

Five members of the Learning Community (LC), an English conversation community, were interviewed three times over the course of one semester about their language learning histories and their experiences in the LC. This data was analyzed inductively and subsequently categorized according to Wenger\u2019s (2010) modes of identification \u2013 engagement, imagination, and alignment. The findings of the study indicated that members\u2019 identification with the practice of the LC was connected to a desire for an accessible learning environment, attaining membership in an international imagined community of English users, and the ability to negotiate sociocultural norms for their own purposes. This study highlights a bidirectional relationship between the \u201cbaggage\u201d that members bring with them and the everyday practice developed over the course of the LC\u2019s two-year history.

The present study specifically addresses the role of individual resources and community dimensions with reference to academic communities facing COVID-19-related lockdowns and the changes that these have implied. An online questionnaire was administered to 1124 Italian University students. It detected their sense of belonging and of responsible togetherness with reference to their academic community through community dimensions, their student self-efficacy as an individual resource, and their academic stress-potentially stemming from studying in the middle of a pandemic. A multiple mediation model was been run with structural equation modeling. The results show that both the community dimensions associate with higher student self-efficacy and the sense of responsible togetherness, while also associating with lower academic stress. Moreover, student self-efficacy, in turn, associates with lower academic stress and mediates the relationships between both community dimensions and students' academic stress levels. From these findings, the protective role that community dimensions can exert on an individual's life becomes apparent. Building on this, further strategies should be implemented to reinforce personal and community resources in order to strengthen individuals against potentially stressful circumstances.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65126055, "asset_id": 44654585, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 62484765, "first_name": "Flora", "last_name": "Gatti", "domain_name": "unina", "page_name": "FloraGatti", "display_name": "Flora Gatti", "profile_url": "https://unina.academia.edu/FloraGatti?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/62484765/17123683/20645174/s65_flora.gatti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 76422, "name": "Academic Stress", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Academic_Stress?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82174, "name": "University", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/University?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 106025, "name": "Student Self-Efficacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Self-Efficacy?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3557864, "name": "Covid-19", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Covid-19?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3594697, "name": "COVID-19 PANDEMIC", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/COVID-19_PANDEMIC?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3824810, "name": "Sense of Responsible Togetherness (SoRT)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Responsible_Togetherness_SoRT_?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44424432, "title": "Appropriation And Sense Of Belonging In Public Space: Parque Estoril (Seville)", "created_at": "2020-11-03T01:40:15.383-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44424432/Appropriation_And_Sense_Of_Belonging_In_Public_Space_Parque_Estoril_Seville_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_44424432", "summary": "As a central element of daily life, the urban public space can work as a field of identification and emotional relationship.

protecting transnational ecosystems, highlighting the importance of sociological research on the potentially 'other-ing' impacts of mainstream conservation policy discourse. We draw on research in the Chimanimani Trans-Frontier Conservation Area (TFCA) on both sides of the Zim-babwe\u2013Mozambique border, scrutinizing simplifications inherent in terms such as ''illegal foreigners'' that obfuscate histories and contemporary realities of cross-border social ties. Engaging perspectives of park authorities and chiefs as well as people who have taken up artisanal mining, we explore two related themes\u2014how 'belonging' is negotiated as well as how conservation agendas are instrumentalized by state and non-state actors. Bringing attention to gaps between policy discourses surrounding TFCAs and territorialized practices of exclusion, the article concludes by calling for greater attention to the mutating significance of colonially established boundaries as well as the dynamic influences of social networks in borderland spaces.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57030439, "asset_id": 37078614, "asset_type":

Distinctiveness Theory (Brewer, 1991), we propose that students will exhibit increased self-regulatory persistence and performance to satisfy their needs for assimilation and differentiation.

A within-persons hierarchical linear model revealed that the more students perceived enacting these behaviors as satisfying their assimilation or differentiation needs, the more important they considered such behaviors to be. In Study 2, we manipulated assimilation or differentiation motives and provided students with false information that success on a word task was associated with either fitting in or standing out. As predicted, participants in the need for assimilation condition performed better and spent more time on a task allegedly associated with fitting in. By contrast, participants in the need for differentiation condition performed better and spent more time on a task allegedly associated with standing out.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50858255, "asset_id": 1805053, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 264534, "first_name": "DeLeon", "last_name": "Gray", "domain_name": "ncsu", "page_name": "DeLeonGray", "display_name": "DeLeon Gray", "profile_url": "https://ncsu.academia.edu/DeLeonGray?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/264534/95073/868707/s65_deleon.gray.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 248, "name": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3481, "name": "Student Achievement Motivation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Achievement_Motivation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 75482361, "title": "Does It Matter Where College Students Live?

This qualitative study explored the experiences of six newly arrived migrant women who attended community ESOL classes (English for Speakers of Other Languages), focusing on the women\u2019s social interactions in English, the places in which social interactions took place and their sense of belonging. Belonging is defined as feeling at ease with oneself and one\u2019s surroundings (Miller, 2003). Data was gathered over one and a half years, using narrative interviews and oral diaries, and analysed using thematic and classic content analysis methods. The study concluded that women\u2019s social interactions took place in four main spheres: local community, public services, work and home. Data demonstrated that social interactions in English affected women\u2019s feelings of belonging from four aspects: material, relational, cultural and temporal. Findings indicated that social interactions supported women to build trust in people who were different to them and to learn cultural knowledge, practices and acceptable behaviours not formally taught in their ESOL sessions, which supported participants to gain access and to feel at ease in unfamiliar spheres.\nThis study will help teachers to recognise the contribution of social interactions to their students\u2019 language development and integration; policy-makers to plan for future ESOL and integration programme development and funding; and assist organisations in designing more effective community ESOL programmes. Recommendations include for practitioners to plan for activities to support social interactions outside the classroom, to consider the importance of digital skills in enabling ESOL learners to participate in online social interactions, and a more joined-up approach with public service organisations to support staff in those roles to understand how to best support migrant clients who are learning English.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65292527, "asset_id": 44796321, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30647353, "first_name": "Nafisah", "last_name": "Graham-Brown", "domain_name": "ioe", "page_name": "NafisahGrahamBrown", "display_name": "Nafisah Graham-Brown", "profile_url": "https://ioe.academia.edu/NafisahGrahamBrown?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30647353/17873299/38469906/s65_nafisah.graham-brown.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11442, "name": "Community Cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Cohesion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 60827, "name": "Social cohesion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_cohesion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 161014, "name": "Social Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Integration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 169010, "name": "ESOL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESOL?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 356037, "name": "Skills for Life (ESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Skills_for_Life_ESOL_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 399195, "name": "ESOL Learners, ESL Learners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ESOL_Learners_ESL_Learners?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 625630, "name": "Language Socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Socialization-1?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 635156, "name": "Migrant Women", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Women?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 652283, "name": "Identity/ies and Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_ies_and_Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2467300, "name": "Second language socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_language_socialization?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2540442, "name": "Migration, identity and belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_identity_and_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3844076, "name": "Esol and Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Esol_and_Integration?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44194543, "title": "We're From Here, Too: Identity and Belonging among 1.5-and Second-Generation Latinxs in Nashville, Tennessee", "created_at": "2020-09-29T12:01:56.184-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44194543/Were_From_Here_Too_Identity_and_Belonging_among_1_5_and_Second_Generation_Latinxs_in_Nashville_Tennessee?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_44194543", "summary": "This study investigates the perceptions and experiences of 1.5- and second-generation Latinxs in the new immigrant destination of Nashville, Tennessee, with regard to the concepts of belonging, identity, and sense of place.

Our findings reveal how this population navigates through and in between the various communities that encompass their lives while simultaneously balancing social inclusion/exclusion, educational and career aspirations, and marginalization by national and state politics.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64556543, "asset_id": 44194543, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59256, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Chaney", "domain_name": "mtsu", "page_name": "JamesChaney", "display_name": "James  Chaney", "profile_url": "https://mtsu.academia.edu/JamesChaney?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/59256/626281/17965228/s65_james.chaney.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 272, "name": "Social Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 298, "name": "Latino/A Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latino_A_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3394, "name": "Southern Studies (U.S. South)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Studies_U.S._South_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4374, "name": "Immigration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8154, "name": "American South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/American_South?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 43412, "name": "Social and cultural geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_cultural_geography?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 46524, "name": "Hispanic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hispanic_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 124766, "name": "Sence of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sence_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 226448, "name": "Tennessee", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tennessee?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 391715, "name": "Ethnicity and National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_National_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1559757, "name": "Latinos in Nashville", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latinos_in_Nashville?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2450956, "name": "Latinx Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latinx_Studies?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 43930394, "title": "Do you feel like you belong?", "created_at": "2020-08-23T16:24:56.798-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43930394/Do_you_feel_like_you_belong?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_43930394", "summary": "People have a natural need to connect and belong.

At the same time, the role of emotional labour involved in feeling 'at home' and the sense of ontological security and everyday belonging that families develop post-migration can benefit from further exploration. Drawing on data collected with Eastern European migrant families in Scotland, this article explores intergenerational understandings of (in)securities by comparing parents' and children's views on their lives post-migration. It shows that, while adults constructed family security around notions of stable employment and potential for a better future, children reflected more on the emotional and ontological insecurities which families experienced. Family relationships are often destabilised by migration, which can lead to long-term or permanent insecurities such as family disintegration and the loss of a sense of recognition and belonging. The article reflects on the ways in which insecurities of the past are transformed, but are unlikely to be resolved, by migration to a new country. It does this by grounding the analysis in young people's own understandings of security and by examining how their narratives challenge idealised adult expectations of family security and stability post-migration. It also shows that young people's involvement in migration research brings an important perspective to the family dynamics post-migration , challenging adult-centred constructs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57119705, "asset_id": 37168618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 755437, "first_name": "Daniela", "last_name": "Sime", "domain_name": "strathclyde", "page_name": "DanielaSime", "display_name": "Daniela Sime", "profile_url": "https://strathclyde.academia.edu/DanielaSime?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/755437/256617/6803129/s65_daniela.sime.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3454, "name": "Children and Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children_and_Families?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 95023, "name": "Ontological Security", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ontological_Security?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 35822990, "title": "What is Meant By \u201cA Sense of Belonging\u201d and is it Possible to \u201cBelong\u201d in a Globalised World?", "created_at": "2018-02-02T06:23:17.955-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35822990/What_is_Meant_By_A_Sense_of_Belonging_and_is_it_Possible_to_Belong_in_a_Globalised_World?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_35822990", "summary": "During the 1990s, globalisation became a term very popular and it was used to suggest a variety of international challenges facing nation states (Korpi, 2006). Many homogeneous societies have been transformed into multicultural1 communities in which people from different cultural backgrounds and ethnicities live together (Martens, Dreher and Gaston, 2010). Globalisation theorists emphasise that in a world characterised by virtual communication, institution, objects, and people at great speed across large distances, social life cannot be seen firmly located in particular places with clear boundaries; therefore, identities are mobile and transient. Social scientists have been preoccupied with understanding a sense of belonging linked to the kinship networks, or family ties, that bind the different members of \u201ctraditional\u201d or so-called \u201ctribal\u201d communities. In order to distinguish one group from another, they sought to determine who was related to whom, and how (Baumeister and Leary, 1995). In modern societies today, it makes sense to think of humans as individuals. We have got individual bodies, individual minds, and individual goals and ambitions. But it must be said that being human is not about being an individual anymore. It is about belonging to a particular group of individuals. \u201cWho we are?\u201d is a very simple question but it can be defined by the social networks and communities to which we belong. When someone asks to describe ourselves, we reply this question by talking about our relationships to people and places \u2013 as sons, mothers, husbands, or friends; as members of nations, ethnic groups, or neighbourhoods; as employees; as consumers of certain brands and the lifestyles that go with them (Giddens, 1998). Through membership within these groups, we make statements about the kinds of people, beliefs, and values that we want to be associated with and, ultimately, the kinds of people we are. In subtle and complex ways, people\u2019s lives, as individuals, only become meaningful through our associations with others.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55700348, "asset_id": 35822990, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3995528, "first_name": "Alper Bilgehan", "last_name": "Yard\u0131mc\u0131", "domain_name": "pamukkale", "page_name": "AlperBilgehanYard\u0131mc\u0131", "display_name": "Alper Bilgehan Yard\u0131mc\u0131", "profile_url": "https://pamukkale.academia.edu/AlperBilgehanYard%C4%B1mc%C4%B1?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3995528/1511213/31756348/s65_alper_bilgehan.yard_mc_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35228117, "title": "NL's Vital Signs 2017", "created_at": "2017-11-22T19:38:16.733-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35228117/NLs_Vital_Signs_2017?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_35228117", "summary": "Newfoundland and Labrador's Vital Signs report is a comprehensive, reader-friendly look at how the communities of the province are faring in key quality-of-life areas.

In this perspective, the concept of \u2018home\u2019 involves the development of emotional attachments and feelings of belonging to particular places that result in a sense of familiarity and comfort, and is closely related to well-being. Following this, the meaning of \u2018home\u2019 is not only related to the physical place but may involve symbolic constructions of Heimat (Huber and O\u2019Reilly, 2004) \u2013 \u2018spaces of belonging\u2019 (and identity) at different geographical scales \u2013 the local, national or transnational communities in which people think of themselves of \u2018feeling at home\u2019 (Morley, 2001).

Perhaps, we can describe social support as enjoying warm and secure bonding, living in a tight community, having a close circle of friends, being part of a family-oriented home, belonging to an intimate sphere of people, flourishing in an interactive environment, having daily input from significant others, relying on colleagues in time of need, and growing up in a warm culture... all of these, and more, are features portraying the rich aspects of social support. Although the styles, means, techniques, and manifestations change across time and location, the core nature, function, and value of meaningful support remain the same. The psychosocial literature is full of definitions, discussions, and illustrations of what it means to have nurturing relationships with tangible resources. Fundamentally, the concept of social support can be defined as an available help, a ready assistance, and a personal care from many sources and places, together sharing sustainable aid in different ways and forms, at different times and stages, and for different reasons and a variety of needs. Social support is rather a phenomenon that facilitates survival in time of crisis, connects a particular need with a corresponding resource, empowers function during difficulty, and increases resiliency in time of adversity. Therefore, the benefits of such a support are both in intervention and prevention to enable further mobility and enhance personal growth. This phenomenon draws from the gains of living in close community (bonding, intimacy, and sustenance) and the new emphasis of positive psychology (health, strength, and virtue).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48104623, "asset_id": 27822036, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50318667, "first_name": "Naji", "last_name": "Abi-Hashem", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NajiAbiHashem", "display_name": "Naji Abi-Hashem", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NajiAbiHashem?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/50318667/13239128/105627275/s65_naji.abi-hashem.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3279, "name": "Psychotherapy and Counseling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychotherapy_and_Counseling?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3332, "name": "Resilience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resilience?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 42162, "name": "Emotions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 48550, "name": "Religious Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 64810, "name": "Psychological well-being", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychological_well-being?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 27752883, "title": "KEPEMIMPINAN (LEADERSHIP) SENSE OF BELONGING MUHAMMAD VIONO 3215100078 SANTIAGO CALATRAVA", "created_at": "2016-08-13T12:00:09.044-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27752883/KEPEMIMPINAN_LEADERSHIP_SENSE_OF_BELONGING_MUHAMMAD_VIONO_3215100078_SANTIAGO_CALATRAVA?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_27752883", "summary": "1. Umum Kepemimpinan (leadership) adalah kemampuan seseorang (yaitu pemimpin) untuk mempengaruhi orang lain (yaitu yang dipimpin atau pengikut-pengikutnya). Kepemimpinan juga merupakan suatu kompleks dari hak-hak dan kewajiban yang dapat dimiliki oleh seorang atau suatu badan. Sebagai suatu proses sosial, kepemimpinan meliputi segala tindakan yang dilakukan seseorang atau sesuatu badan yang menyebabkan gerak dari warga masyarakat. Kepemimpinan ada yang bersifat resmi (formal leadership) yaitu kepemimpinan yang tersimpul didalam suatu jabatan. Ada pula kepemimpinan karena pengakuan dari masyarakat akan kemampuan seseorang untuk menjalankan kepemimpinan. Sedangkan kepemimpinan yang bersifat tidak resmi (informal leadership) adalah kepemimpinan yang resmi di dalam pelaksanaannya selalu harus berada di atas landasan-landasan atau peraturan-peraturan resmi. Sehingga dengan demikian daya cakupnya agak terbatas. Kepemimpinan tidak resmi, mempunyai ruang lingkup tanpa batas-batas resmi, karena kepemimpinan demikain didasarkan atas pengakuan dan kepercayaan masyarakat. Ukuran benar tidaknya kepemimpinan tidak resmi terletak pada tujuan dan hasil pelaksanaan kepemimpinan tersebut, menguntungkan atau merugikan bagi masyarakat. Walaupun seorang pemimpin (yakni yang melaksanakan kepemimpinan) yang resmi tidak boleh menyimpang dari peraturan-peraturan resmi yang menjadi landasanya, akan tetapi dapat melakukan kebijaksanaan yang dapat memancarkan kemampuan mereka sebagai pemimpin. Misalnya, kebijaksanaan tersebut dapat diwujudkan di dalam memilih waktu untuk melaksanakan peraturan-peraturan atau memilih orang-orang yang langsung berhubungan dengan masyarakat untuk melaksanakan peraturan dan seterusnya. Kepemimpinan yang tidak resmi dapat digunakan pula di dalam suatu jabatan resmi dan tentu saja lebih leluasa di dalam masyarakat yang belum dipungut peraturan-peraturan resmi. Dalam bidang terakhir tadi, seorang pemimpin dapat menggerakan kekuatan-kekuatan masyarakat untuk mencapai suatu tujuan tertentu.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48027854, "asset_id": 27752883, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40686699, "first_name": "muhammad", "last_name": "vio", "domain_name": "panduaninstalasi", "page_name": "muhammadvio", "display_name": "muhammad vio", "profile_url": "https://panduaninstalasi.academia.edu/muhammadvio?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40686699/13767122/14875745/s65_muhammad.vio.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 119785, "name": "Tugas kuliah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tugas_kuliah?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 390675, "name": "Kepemimpinan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kepemimpinan?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 26506141, "title": "The Belonging Project Report 2011 Phase 1: Planting the seeds A Phase 1: Planting the Seeds", "created_at": "2016-06-26T06:02:02.280-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26506141/The_Belonging_Project_Report_2011_Phase_1_Planting_the_seeds_A_Phase_1_Planting_the_Seeds?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_26506141", "summary": "The Belonging Project is a four-year pilot project to investigate, design and trial an integrated program and school-based approach to enhancing the RMIT undergraduate cohort experience.\n\nIn the Belonging Project narrative model (the model), each student\u2019s sense of identity and belonging is built incrementally across the three years of their undergraduate degree program.

Taking Lebanese immigrants\u2019 forms of identification, community attachments and cultural expression as manifestations of diaspora experiences, Dalia Abdelhady delves into the ways members of Lebanese diasporic communities move beyond nationality, ethnicity and religion, giving rise to global solidarities and negotiating their social and cultural spaces.\n\nThe Lebanese Diaspora explores new forms of identities, alliances and cultural expressions, elucidating the daily experiences of Lebanese immigrants and exploring new ways of thinking about immigration, ethnic identity, community, and culture in a global world. By criticizing and challenging our understandings of nationality, ethnicity and assimilation, Abdelhady shows that global immigrants are giving rise to new forms of cosmopolitan citizenship.",

Is a global digital citizen the same as merely a digital citizen? While talk of digital citizenship has increased in recent years, usually centered on a capitalist drive, encouraging a full electronic participation in society and a responsibility to digital commerce, many questions remain unanswered.

And are these \u201crights\u201d universal, and in such a case, what does \u201cuniversal\u201d mean? What are the legal parameters of netizenship, and what will they be as globalization further takes hold? Is democracy critical to citizenship, or is it not?

Undeniably, the young who claims they belong to Europe and the world are most often graduates, urban, socially integrated and living in the western Europe.

Belonging is the sense of mattering and interpersonal connectedness: a basic human need, it enhances motivation and drives behaviour (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Strayhorn, 2012). Generally, its application within higher education has been to discrete student cohorts, often based on ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status or first-year transitioning status (Hurtado & Carter, 1997; Strayhorn, Bie, Dorime-Williams, & Williams, 2016; Ribera, Miller & Dumford, 2017).

It can also be impacted by the design of the built environment, in this case by the interior design of boarding schools. Within the emerging literature pertaining to experiences of boarding school for Aboriginal students in Australia, issues of loneliness, isolation, homesickness, and the feeling of being 'between two worlds' are commonly reported. However, there is currently a dearth of literature that connects these issues with a potential role for design. Therefore, the aim of this project was to address this gap through Participatory Action Research (PAR) in which data was collected through yarning and drawing with 52 participants. 27 current boarders (all Aboriginal people, 2 male, 25 female), 18 recent alumni (All Aboriginal people, 3 male, 15 female), and 7 boarding staff members (1 Aboriginal person, all female) participated. Four themes emerged that suggest a role for interior design in increasing student sense of belonging.

There is a gap, however, in understanding the role that social capital and networks play in constructing diasporic communities and identities, which can ultimately lead to curiosity around people's heritage and spark the desire to travel for heritage tourism and VFR reasons. The Portuguese diaspora in South Africa have roots dating back to the 15th century when European explorers first landed in the Cape. Since then, significant immigration events have occurred where the community has evolved and integrated into South African society at varying levels. There are numerous examples of the Portuguese social and economic footprint in the country but despite its significant presence, it has been for the most part under researched. The 1 st S\u00e3o Jorge Scouts Group is an instructive case study into how Portuguese immigrants in the wake of the wars in their previous homes in Angola and Mozambique, came together to create an identifiably Portuguese social group in the context of the international Scouting movement. This paper focuses on the making of diasporic communities and the particular role of social capital and networks in the construction of Portuguese identity retained by the scouts group, and contributes to the larger discourse on immigrant integration, sense of belonging and their links to tourism. Key interviews revealed fundamental areas of relevance to the diasporic experience, including notions of identity, the role of religious institutions and a developed sense of community and belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60351549, "asset_id": 40135750, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 310927, "first_name": "Maisa", "last_name": "Correia Adinolfi", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "MaisaCorreia", "display_name": "Maisa  Correia Adinolfi", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/MaisaCorreia?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/310927/96279/9057356/s65_maisa.correia.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1233, "name": "Social Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Networks?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 75189, "name": "Boy Scouts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Boy_Scouts?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 145107, "name": "Sense of Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 416195, "name": "Portuguese Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Portuguese_Diaspora?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 500256, "name": "Scouts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Scouts?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 578007, "name": "Diaspora Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Tourism?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 39712060, "title": "The RMIT belonging strategy: fostering student engagement in higher education", "created_at": "2019-06-27T17:50:01.614-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39712060/The_RMIT_belonging_strategy_fostering_student_engagement_in_higher_education?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_39712060", "summary": "Belonging emerged in the 1990s as a conceptual framework to promote student success, retention and engagement in Higher Education (Tinto, 1993; Hurtado & Carter, 1997). Belonging is the sense of mattering and interpersonal connectedness: a basic human need, it enhances motivation and drives behaviour (Baumeister & Leary, 1995; Strayhorn, 2012). Generally, its application within higher education has been to discrete student cohorts, often based on ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status or first-year transitioning status (Hurtado & Carter, 1997; Strayhorn, Bie, Dorime-Williams, & Williams, 2016; Ribera, Miller & Dumford, 2017).\nRMIT University, Australia\u2019s second largest higher education provider, has a diverse student body. Student retention at RMIT University remains relatively high, however, recent evaluations have indicated that students believe the university is not doing enough to help foster a sense of belonging and friendship. In response, the university has positioned student belonging as a major strategic focus area in 2017-2018, and has developed a whole of institution RMIT Belonging Strategy. The strategy emerges from an extensive internal stakeholder consultation process and builds on the research of The Belonging Project (Clarke & Wilson, 2016). The strategy identified and tested five drivers that impact student belonging at the university, and proposed a measurement framework to form an \u2018index\u2019 of belonging that can be tracked and reported using existing university data sets.

In A Place to Call Home, Ernesto Casta\u00f1eda offers a uniquely comparative portrait of immigrant expectations and experiences. Drawing on fourteen years of ethnographic observation and hundreds of interviews with documented and undocumented immigrants and their children, Casta\u00f1eda sets out to determine how different locations can aid or disrupt the process of immigrant integration. Focusing on New York City, Paris, and Barcelona\u2014immigration hubs in their respective countries\u2014he compares the experiences of both Latino and North African migrants, and finds that subjective understandings, local contexts, national and regional history, and religious institutions are all factors that profoundly impact the personal journey to belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56742481, "asset_id": 36793953, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13117, "first_name": "Ernesto", "last_name": "Castaneda", "domain_name": "american", "page_name": "ErnestoCastaneda", "display_name": "Ernesto  Castaneda", "profile_url": "https://american.academia.edu/ErnestoCastaneda?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13117/4057242/4733160/s65_ernesto.castaneda.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 13006, "name": "Immigration History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration_History?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 27336, "name": "France", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/France?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 40516, "name": "Spain", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spain?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 40517, "name": "Barcelona", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Barcelona?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 54319, "name": "Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minorities?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 91839, "name": "Paris", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paris?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 233530, "name": "Homing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homing?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 248366, "name": "New York", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_York?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 773147, "name": "Urban Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Life?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 36545469, "title": "Monograph - The Making and Meaning of Relationships in Sri Lanka", "created_at": "2018-05-01T14:38:39.724-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36545469/Monograph_The_Making_and_Meaning_of_Relationships_in_Sri_Lanka?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_36545469", "summary": "Explores how university students navigate uncertainty and search for meaning in their daily lives Investigates how university students in Colombo navigate sex and sexuality Is based on thorough ethnographic interviews with local respondents This book proposes that romantic relationships\u2014filtered through various socio-cultural sieves\u2014 can lead to the development of affective kin bonds, which underlie our sense of personhood and belonging.

University students' romantic relationships, which they gloss as 'serious,' appear to be processual and non-linear, and are considered to be stabilising forces which are pitched against the inherent uncertainty in young people's lives.

whether, in this respect, they adopted the specific attitudes and behaviours of the city they live in or not, and whether they have feelings for civic responsibility to the city or not. The impacts of migration on sense of urbanity are a controversial topic from various aspects. In this paper, the sense of urbanity is analysed in the specific sample of senior high school students and young people preparing for university in K\u0131r\u0131kkale. The reason for choosing K\u0131r\u0131kkale as a universe of this study is a city formed by migration, and maintained to be a migration and emigration city. Cluster sampling method as one kind of probabilistic sampling is used in this study, and the selected sample for the research is 2000 people in the 17-25-age range.

The chapter argues for the need of a spatial and relational approach to education and youth studies in rural places that moves beyond universal constructions of youth transitions that reflect certain dominant values of prescribed policy patterns that are understood as normative, neutral and natural. It proposes that to understand and interrupt these processes of exclusion it is essential that biographies, identities, relations and localities are render visible. The chapter highlights different studies and conceptualizations that promote a spatial and relational approach, which work towards subverting homogeneous and hegemonic views of youth in rural spaces in favor of multidimensional understanding of what it means and entails to grow up beyond the metropolis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58553239, "asset_id": 28899466, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 374207, "first_name": "Hernan", "last_name": "Cuervo", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "HernanCuervo", "display_name": "Hernan Cuervo", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/HernanCuervo?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/374207/14359177/15286310/s65_hernan.cuervo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 46644, "name": "Social Inequality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Inequality?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 365521, "name": "Rural Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Youth?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 27095048, "title": "Citizenship-belonging: a socio-cultural perspective on Koreans in London", "created_at": "2016-07-19T04:34:36.846-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27095048/Citizenship_belonging_a_socio_cultural_perspective_on_Koreans_in_London?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_27095048", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47347975, "asset_id": 27095048, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 50966745, "first_name": "Edward", "last_name": "Howell", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "EHowell", "display_name": "Edward Howell", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/EHowell?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3902, "name": "Korean Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Korean_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 26506185, "title": "The Belonging Project.

It is taken as a priori, given and therefore static, whereas society is changing, dynamic (Urry, 2000: 133).  Local places are seen as irrelevant, because now we live in an homogenous global world where \u2018local\u2019 infers a sentimental attachment to history (Appadurai, 1995: 214; Massey, 1994: 5).  Here I shall argue that that places are not a priori, but are created interactively. Beginning from Heidegger\u2019s (1971) Building, Dwelling, Thinking I will explore how places \u2018gather\u2019 leading to an examination of the entanglement of local places and local life stories. Having established place as a thoroughly social entity the contrasting ideas of the \u2018global\u2019 and the \u2018local\u2019 will be scrutinised showing how the particularity of place is connected to its people and their practices. Using case studies from my research in Wigan as illustration I will show how building gathers both landscape and peoplescape; building brings together neighbourhoods; building leads from place to place. Places are not merely an effect of human agency but are created performatively as material intra-activity (Barad, 2003), not merely a backdrop to the performance of human or social life.

While I acknowledge this phenomenon, a re-appraisal of the naming practice in Eucalyptus allows us to transcend the legacy of polarised colonial and anthropocentric perspectives. Holland\u2019s status may be interpreted positively in view of Neil Evernden\u2019s concept of \u2018individual-inenvironment\u2019: if so, the act of naming represents humankind\u2019s constructive attempt at establishing a sense of place within a new territory. Bail\u2019s protagonists exemplify different stages in this process of interrelatedness between the human and non-human realms, one that resists a conventional subject-object relationship. Whereas the ambivalent Holland embodies a factual and existential naturalism, the imaginative approach to the treescape of his daughter Ellen and her storytelling suitor fully emancipates them from the commodifying effect of Holland\u2019s naming competition. Bail\u2019s aesthetics reflects the dissolving boundary between the self and environment: deployed in the suitor\u2019s fable-like stories and Bail\u2019s rich prose, the ecopoetic devices of anthropomorphism and zoomorphism defy the rational laws of Western realism. This ecopoetics of interrelatedness restores the agency of the eucalypts while negating the concept of a traditionally dominant human presence in the environment. In Eucalyptus, taxonomy reveals the reciprocal dynamics of a genuine interpenetration: Holland\u2019s \u2018bush garden\u2019 becomes a global space that combines European (symbolised by Holland and the stories) and Australian (the eucalypts) identities. Thus, Bail projects a creative site of transcultural dialogue at the level of the terrain through the complementary processes of physical and subjective interrelatedness.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40843811, "asset_id": 19785457, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2555577, "first_name": "Jessica", "last_name": "Maufort", "domain_name": "ulb", "page_name": "JessicaMaufort", "display_name": "Jessica Maufort", "profile_url": "https://ulb.academia.edu/JessicaMaufort?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2555577/797373/43245454/s65_jessica.maufort.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21325, "name": "Ecopoetics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecopoetics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23193, "name": "Environmental Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Humanities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 132900, "name": "Commonwealth and Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commonwealth_and_Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 282404, "name": "Postcolonial Ecocriticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Ecocriticism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 463931, "name": "Naming Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Naming_Practices?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1669790, "name": "Storied Matter", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Storied_Matter?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2259212, "name": "Biological and cultural interrelatedness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biological_and_cultural_interrelatedness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2259213, "name": "Self-reflexive nature writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self-reflexive_nature_writing?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 10088979, "title": "Stress and Return to Sport: Interventions for ACL Injury Recovery", "created_at": "2015-01-09T08:16:39.918-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10088979/Stress_and_Return_to_Sport_Interventions_for_ACL_Injury_Recovery?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_10088979", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36211431, "asset_id": 10088979, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24576005, "first_name": "Angel", "last_name": "Brutus", "domain_name": "rockies", "page_name": "AngelBrutus", "display_name": "Angel Brutus", "profile_url": "https://rockies.academia.edu/AngelBrutus?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24576005/6643301/7507616/s65_angel.brutus.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 71987, "name": "Connectedness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Connectedness?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1124976, "name": "Support Needs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Support_Needs?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1751616, "name": "Psychosocial Implications of Sport Injury and Rehabilitation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychosocial_Implications_of_Sport_Injury_and_Rehabilitation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2254271, "name": "Multiracial and Multiethnic Athlete Experiences of Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiracial_and_Multiethnic_Athlete_Experiences_of_Intersectionality?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 15141995, "title": "Imaginaries of return migration: Switzerland as the \"safe haven\"?", "created_at": "2015-08-24T04:31:36.360-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/15141995/Imaginaries_of_return_migration_Switzerland_as_the_safe_haven_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_15141995", "summary": "Draft paper for the PREMIG-conference \"thinking about going 'home' -

Without going further into the methodological weaknesses of the early literary regional geography (see Brosseau 1994: 335-7), and noting that other conceptualizations and approaches have partly replaced the use of the concept \u2018region\u2019,1 still, regions do matter today. A few years ago, John Tomaney published an interesting three-piece series of articles in Progress in Human Geography discussing the main orientations of contemporary regional geography. Tomanay divided the main directions into three separate thematic groups: \u2018institutions\u2019 (2014), \u2018belonging\u2019 (2015) and \u2018well-being\u2019 (2016). In what follows, I am going to scrutinize not only how these thematic groups can be and have been used in literary geography, but also show how these three themes become interlinked.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 84662416, "asset_id": 77243503, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25815541, "first_name": "Juha", "last_name": "Ridanp\u00e4\u00e4", "domain_name": "oulu", "page_name": "JuhaRidanp\u00e4\u00e4", "display_name": "Juha Ridanp\u00e4\u00e4", "profile_url": "https://oulu.academia.edu/JuhaRidanp%C3%A4%C3%A4?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25815541/7072802/20817191/s65_juha.ridanp_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 262, "name": "Human Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 279, "name": "Regional Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Regional_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4470, "name": "Literary Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9964, "name": "Well-Being", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Well-Being?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 349421, "name": "Cultural Institutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Institutions?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 70210662, "title": "\u201cThey have no taste in Morocco.\u201d Home furnishing, belonging, and notions of religious (im)perfection among white Dutch and Flemish converts in Morocco", "created_at": "2022-02-01T03:59:42.141-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/70210662/_They_have_no_taste_in_Morocco_Home_furnishing_belonging_and_notions_of_religious_im_perfection_among_white_Dutch_and_Flemish_converts_in_Morocco?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_70210662", "summary": "This article focuses on furnishing practices in the domestic space of the homes of white Flemish and Dutch Muslim female converts to Islam who made hijra (Islamic migration) to Morocco.

However, remarkably, once settled in Morocco, many experience discontent with regard to a perceived \u201clack of true Islam\u201d in the country. To gain insight into the positions and experiences of these women, I look at how they create a sense of belonging through furnishing practices in the domestic space of their new homes.

This article argues that excavating the encounters and memories around campus monuments can serve as an entry point for unfolding how systems of colonization and white supremacy persist in higher education, offering a critical re-imagining of the concept of belongingness. Guided by McKittrick and Massey\u2019s feminist decolonial spatial theories and Barad\u2019s conceptualization of memory and re-membering, the article excavates two campus monuments: a boulder commemorating confederate soldiers and a clocktower honoring the legacy of the first Black students at the University. These monuments are memory objects, memorializing particular moments in time on campus, and thus becoming part of the current reproductions of place. Through tracing the memories of campus monuments into the entanglements of the present climate of higher education, this article offers implications and considerations for institutions grappling with their history and responsibility to the past.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65543441, "asset_id": 44999673, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 25528929, "first_name": "Maureen", "last_name": "Flint", "domain_name": "uga", "page_name": "MaureenFlint", "display_name": "Maureen Flint", "profile_url": "https://uga.academia.edu/MaureenFlint?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/25528929/11807462/27897690/s65_maureen.flint.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12135, "name": "Qualitative Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12644, "name": "Commemoration and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commemoration_and_Memory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21994, "name": "Spatial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatial_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47736, "name": "Decolonial Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Decolonial_Thought?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 102674, "name": "College Students", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/College_Students?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 111959, "name": "Karen Barad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Karen_Barad?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 148028, "name": "Monuments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monuments?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 206734, "name": "Campus Climate", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Campus_Climate?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 215860, "name": "Doreen Massey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Doreen_Massey?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 460026, "name": "Monuments & Memorials", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monuments_and_Memorials?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2783761, "name": "Confederate Monuments", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Confederate_Monuments?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44183387, "title": "Sense of belonging predicts persistence intentions among diverse dental education students: A multi-institutional investigation", "created_at": "2020-09-28T09:23:56.744-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44183387/Sense_of_belonging_predicts_persistence_intentions_among_diverse_dental_education_students_A_multi_institutional_investigation?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_44183387", "summary": "To succeed in dental school, students need both academic and social experiences that are correlated with perceived membership and persistence.

Findings have significant implications for future policy, practice, and research, but also raise important questions for dental educators in the U.S.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64544002, "asset_id": 44183387, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4803905, "first_name": "Terrell", "last_name": "Strayhorn", "domain_name": "vuu", "page_name": "TerrellStrayhorn", "display_name": "Terrell L Strayhorn", "profile_url": "https://vuu.academia.edu/TerrellStrayhorn?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4803905/2047946/36525701/s65_terrell.strayhorn.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12515, "name": "Persistence/Retention", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persistence_Retention?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18004, "name": "Equity and Social Justice in Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equity_and_Social_Justice_in_Higher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38239, "name": "Dental Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dental_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 43682103, "title": "Narratives of National Belonging: Citizenship, Race and the Creation of  Latinas' Ethnicities in Exile in the United States", "created_at": "2020-07-21T10:46:50.573-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43682103/Narratives_of_National_Belonging_Citizenship_Race_and_the_Creation_of_Latinas_Ethnicities_in_Exile_in_the_United_States?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_43682103", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63984216, "asset_id": 43682103, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 138372979, "first_name": "Suzanne", "last_name": "Oboler", "domain_name": "prismatjjay", "page_name": "suzanneoboler", "display_name": "Suzanne Oboler", "profile_url": "https://prismatjjay.academia.edu/suzanneoboler?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/138372979/46125398/35742849/s65_suzanne.oboler.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10767, "name": "Exile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14464, "name": "Marginalized Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marginalized_Identities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34327, "name": "Intersectionality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersectionality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 391715, "name": "Ethnicity and National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity_and_National_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3741494, "name": "latina literature, latinx studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/latina_literature_latinx_studies?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 42956137, "title": "Browsing for Cunzaigan on WeChat: Young People's Social Media Presence in Accelerated Urban China", "created_at": "2020-05-05T23:13:02.163-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42956137/Browsing_for_Cunzaigan_on_WeChat_Young_Peoples_Social_Media_Presence_in_Accelerated_Urban_China?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_42956137", "summary": "This article examines how young Chinese adults living in urban areas experience cunzaigan (a Chinese word that translates to 'sense of existence') through sharing mundane life moments on the social media platform-WeChat.

Drawing on their experience of temporal social presence on WeChat, we contend that technological developments, which have been identified as a key motor of social acceleration, can also be harnessed as a resource to serve ontological and social purposes in an accelerated social context.

Turkish military organizational culture makes employees feel part of an exclusive organization where adherence to heroism, honor, patriotism, and loyalty represent a common identity.

The book critically explores the concept of belonging and how it can respond to contemporary problems in not only the traditional domains of citizenship and migration, but also in detention practices, queer and feminist politics, Australian literature and fashion, technology, housing and rituals.\n\nDrawing on examples from Australia, Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States, each topic is examined as a different kind of problem for the future \u2013 as a toil, an intensity or a promise. Ultimately, the collection argues that creating new ways to belong in contemporary times means reimagining the traditional terms on which belonging can happen, as well as the social itself. Read on their own, each chapter presents a compelling case study and develops a set of critical tools for encountering the empirical, epistemological and ontological challenges we face today. Read together, they present a diverse imagination that is capable of answering the question of belonging in, to and with the future.\n\nSocial Beings, Future Belongings shows how belonging is not a static and universal state, but a contingent, emergent and ongoing future-oriented set of practices.

This article makes a contribution exploring school belonging among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds, in an emerging economy (Mexico), and using a qualitative methodology that prioritize meanings and experiences of individuals. Focusing on three dimensions (stigmatization processes, school climate, and social relations with teacher and peers), we capture how the engagement of adolescents with their schooling process is shaped by institutional as well as sociocultural aspects. The study provides significant implications for a continuous professional development of high schools in disadvantaged contexts regarding student involvement, teacher support, and social recognition.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88387192, "asset_id": 39358781, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 12907032, "first_name": "Gonzalo A.", "last_name": "Sarav\u00ed", "domain_name": "ciesas", "page_name": "GonzaloASarav\u00ed", "display_name": "Gonzalo A.

In a Kantian manner, I ask about the conditions of possibility of this right. More clearly, I ask, given political conditions of the globe today, is the universal right of hospitality possible? Today, the human categories of refugee and illegal migrant are a significant and conspicuous part of the social reality in Western democracies. Relegated to invisibility in the margins of these societies, members of these human categories are often neither eligible for the comprehensive protection of nation states nor in a condition to obtain full access to their human rights. As impoverished migrants and displaced refugees from the Global South, they are living in limbo. They exist trapped between two poles: the hope of admission into wealthy Western societies on the one hand, and the fear of exclusion and deportation on the other. Thus, they are living the life of Homo limbus. \nMarked by flight, flux, uncertainty and instability, Homo limbus lives in a perpetual \u201cstate of exception\u201d, as Georgio Agamben would say, and signifies an assembly of racialised bodies whose lives are not \u201cgrievable\u201d, since grievability is a feature of lives that matter, as Judith Butler would contend. Such a state of being reveals not only a world burdened by heritages of colonialism, slavery and racism, but also the limits of nation states as the defining framework for addressing global problems of migration. It brings to the fore a need for global democracy and international approaches to human rights and their application. In other words, we need shifts in mindsets, approaches and paradigms, which entails critically re-examining oppressive historical perspectives and narrow national frameworks in order to be able to adequately address global flows of refugees and migrants. \nIn this essay I am going to focus on how global developments and the \u201crefugee crisis\u201d in Europe have necessitated a rethinking of nationalism, territoriality, border-crossings and citizenship. However, European nationalists propagate a return to nationalism and birth right. This confrontation has made migration the defining challenge of European communities. Thus, it is not simply the admission or deportation of a few refugees that is at stake, but the basic values of freedom, equality, justice and respect for others, as well as the rule of law, human rights and democracy. At present, liberal democracies are experiencing a crisis whose outcome is uncertain. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57986656, "asset_id": 37970699, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8291071, "first_name": "Rasoul", "last_name": "Nejadmehr", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RasoulNejadmehr", "display_name": "Rasoul Nejadmehr", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RasoulNejadmehr?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8291071/2832460/3306385/s65_rasoul.nejadmehr.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5709, "name": "Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 22656, "name": "Hospitality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hospitality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 38429, "name": "Global South", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_South?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 39869, "name": "Refugees", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 65876, "name": "Transnational Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_Democracy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 80845, "name": "State of exception", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_of_exception?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 96320, "name": "Dwelling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dwelling?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 101074, "name": "Nation-State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nation-State?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 444440, "name": "Intercultural Dialogues", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Dialogues?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 472739, "name": "Homo sacer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homo_sacer?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1027900, "name": "Dissensus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dissensus?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1028949, "name": "Migrantion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrantion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1177870, "name": "The subject", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_subject?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3083113, "name": "homo limbus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/homo_limbus?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3083114, "name": "Aesthetic regimes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Aesthetic_regimes?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37360251, "title": "\"At night we heard hyenas and jackals howling.\" The diary of a South Tyrolean from the Italo-Abyssinian War (1935-1936)", "created_at": "2018-09-07T06:51:39.373-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37360251/_At_night_we_heard_hyenas_and_jackals_howling_The_diary_of_a_South_Tyrolean_from_the_Italo_Abyssinian_War_1935_1936_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37360251", "summary": "This is my MA thesis, which I published in 2016.

It is an expression of the work I and others have been presenting on the concept of Existential Migration (Madison, 2006; Yates, 2015). One of the outcomes of this research is a reconceptualisation of 'home' as interaction rather than the usual assumption that home refers to a geographical location, usually one's origin.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51802596, "asset_id": 31442408, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11531, "first_name": "Greg", "last_name": "Madison", "domain_name": "londonfocusing", "page_name": "GregMadison", "display_name": "Greg  Madison", "profile_url": "https://londonfocusing.academia.edu/GregMadison?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11531/3849/4735655/s65_greg.madison.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2581, "name": "Existential Phenomenological Psychotherapy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existential_Phenomenological_Psychotherapy?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4421, "name": "Homelessness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homelessness?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5619, "name": "Humanistic-Existential", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanistic-Existential?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11282, "name": "Existential Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existential_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 60539, "name": "Forced and Voluntary Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Forced_and_Voluntary_Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 67525, "name": "Existentialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existentialism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 30508032, "title": "Nicole Gallant et C\u00e9line Friche - \u00catre ici et l\u00e0-bas tout \u00e0 la fois : r\u00e9seaux sociaux en ligne et espaces d\u2019appartenance chez les jeunes immigrants au Qu\u00e9bec", "created_at": "2016-12-18T11:48:09.287-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30508032/Nicole_Gallant_et_C%C3%A9line_Friche_%C3%8Atre_ici_et_l%C3%A0_bas_tout_%C3%A0_la_fois_r%C3%A9seaux_sociaux_en_ligne_et_espaces_d_appartenance_chez_les_jeunes_immigrants_au_Qu%C3%A9bec?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_30508032", "summary": "R\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nL\u2019article aborde l\u2019utilisation d\u2019Internet dans les r\u00e9seaux sociaux locaux et transnationaux de jeunes migrants en r\u00e9gion au Qu\u00e9bec, afin de cerner les rapports entre ces r\u00e9seaux et les identit\u00e9s (au sens de sentiments d\u2019appartenance).

The young people surveyed all use the Internet to stay in contact with their immediate family and friends in their homeland, but make very little use of it \u2014 and especially use it in a different way \u2014 with their new friends in Quebec. With the exception of two respondents who completely reject the idea of belonging, the migrants surveyed all identify with their homeland, and most of them also identify with Quebec. The latter, whether intentionally or not, have developed a social network that includes native-born Quebeckers. This finding provides evidence of the role played by others in the development of conceptions of self in the Internet age.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50953973, "asset_id": 30508032, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 56871304, "first_name": "Lien social", "last_name": "et Politiques", "domain_name": "inrs", "page_name": "LiensocialetPolitiques", "display_name": "Lien social et Politiques", "profile_url": "https://inrs.academia.edu/LiensocialetPolitiques?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56871304/14945838/15701862/s65_lien_social.et_politiques.jpg"}, {"id": 31610310, "first_name": "Nicole", "last_name": "Gallant", "domain_name": "inrs", "page_name": "NicoleGallant", "display_name": "Nicole Gallant", "profile_url": "https://inrs.academia.edu/NicoleGallant?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/31610310/18998297/18943996/s65_nicole.gallant.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1233, "name": "Social Networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Networks?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17679, "name": "Online social networks", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Online_social_networks?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 285400, "name": "Youth Use of Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Use_of_Internet?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 464017, "name": "Homeland", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homeland?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 643150, "name": "R\u00e9seaux Sociaux", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reseaux_Sociaux?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1295291, "name": "Pays D'origine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pays_Dorigine?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593097, "name": "R\u00e9seaux sociaux locaux et transnationaux de jeunes migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/R%C3%A9seaux_sociaux_locaux_et_transnationaux_de_jeunes_migrants?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593098, "name": " Jeunes migrants en r\u00e9gion au Qu\u00e9bec", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jeunes_migrants_en_r%C3%A9gion_au_Qu%C3%A9bec?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593099, "name": "Utilisation d\u2019Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Utilisation_d_Internet?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593100, "name": "Sentiments d\u2019appartenance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sentiments_d_appartenance?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593101, "name": "R\u00f4le d\u2019autrui dans la construction des repr\u00e9sentations de soi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e8re d\u2019Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/R%C3%B4le_d_autrui_dans_la_construction_des_repr%C3%A9sentations_de_soi_%C3%A0_l_%C3%A8re_d_Internet?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593102, "name": "Young Immigrants in Quebec", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_Immigrants_in_Quebec?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593103, "name": "Local and transnational social networks by young migrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_and_transnational_social_networks_by_young_migrants?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2593104, "name": "Role played by others in the development of conceptions of self in the Internet age", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Role_played_by_others_in_the_development_of_conceptions_of_self_in_the_Internet_age?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 29768511, "title": "Language Learning and Identity", "created_at": "2016-11-09T16:23:05.796-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29768511/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_29768511", "summary": "Linguistic identity is crucial in determining whether or a language learner attains communicative competence in an L2.

Results showed 18% of the variance in perceived ethnic and gender career barriers were predicted by sex, acculturation, and college environment. As expected, sex, acculturation, and college environment negatively predicted perceived ethnic and gender career barriers. Latinas anticipated discrimination in future worksites more than Latino males. Acculturation and a welcoming college environment that supported diverse students predicted lower perceived ethnic and gender career barriers. Enculturation did not significantly predict perceived career barriers. Supporting the hypothesis, an interaction effect between sex and college environment predicted perceived career barriers.

As a narrative of legal status, the acquisition of full membership is the transition from alien to citizen, from stranger to rights-holder, from foreigner to governor. As a narrative of social belonging, the story is one of integration over time, a transition from out-group to in-group which is expected to be completed within a span of two or three generations. But these versions of the national narrative fit the historical experience of some ethnic and racial groups more than that of others, and there are egregious exceptions to the normative tale. We write as a lawyer and a sociologist interested in the relationship of our disciplines\u2019 perspectives on these narratives, and on the linkages between the political and the social realms that are reflected in U.S. models of membership. We argue that the way people are invited or welcomed to become members of the society influences their joining behavior which, in turn, influences how the society invites others to join it. Further, we note that the formulation of public policy helps to produce the conditions that affirm the public policies. A nation concerned about and committed to the successful integration of a large and growing resident immigrant population needs to adopt policies that help orient and acculturate immigrants, provide skills and access, and foster tolerance and non-discrimination. The state should model the behavior - such as attachment, commitment and loyalty - that it seeks from its newest members. Anti-immigrant policies are not integrative policies, even if they provide quasi-coercive incentives to naturalization. Models of membership are not free-standing. Like other self-fulfilling prophecies, those models are influenced by the very phenomenon they purport to be classifying. Preservation of the inclusionary model is important not just on principled grounds, but because the model produces the designed outcome and thereby promotes the national interest.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38110418, "asset_id": 13718907, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4475610, "first_name": "Rub\u00e9n G.", "last_name": "Rumbaut", "domain_name": "uci", "page_name": "RubenGRumbaut", "display_name": "Rub\u00e9n G.

Starting from African examples, places of prolific expression of the phenomenon, this article shows how autochthony plays the role of capital that can be invested, valued and profited from. The structure of this capital carries within itself the seeds of conflict. The article analyses how the stabilization of its value requires the execution of specific strategies. Among these strategies, I will focus in greater depth on voting. The relationship between capital, autochthony and elections will thus bring us back to debates that animate political science: in new municipalities, autochthony as capital is at the heart of

I discuss here a few of the major opposing poles, which I gather into three main groups: (a) Temporality: changefamiliarity; consummation-perpetuation; (b) Freedom: freedom-bondage; belongingpossessing; (c) The good-fortune of the partner: jealousy-compersion. Coping with these conflicts requires several conceptual distinctions; the key ones discussed here are the distinction between romantic intensity and romantic profundity and the distinction between extrinsically and intrinsically valuable activities. While admitting the presence of the opposing poles, I argue that in profound love, these poles can coexist. Such coexistence has significant consequences for the nature of romantic relationships, for instance, admitting the presence of romantic ambivalence and indifference and acknowledging the value of brief, casual sexual encounters.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86759886, "asset_id": 80347634, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11858249,

The ethnographic narratives explore the ways in which the Marwaris as patrons of charity are used as a category for understanding the \u201cself\u201d\u2013 as a migrant or otherwise in the city. Thus, rendering the question of how long does a migrant view herself as the \u201cmigrant\u201d important. A response to such a question unravels the conflictual meanings attached to the concept of belonging; and also outlines the shifts in the meanings of community life and the \u201cself\u201d over time.

Following this there has been a concentration of high-density residential accommodation built around many rail lines and stations, leading to an influx of new residents to these areas. Prior research from Bangkok and studies from some Western cities suggest that the exclusiveness of such forms of housing and their habitation by often higher-income residents may lead to low levels of social interactions and mixing between the new and old populations. Generally though, studies related to this in the context of condominiums are limited, and there has been no research into the influence of mass transit on such neighbourhood social dynamics. Drawing on the literature related to social mixing, and in particular social mixing in the context of new-build gentrification, this research presents the results of a structured questionnaire designed to measure and compare social mixing, levels of attachment and sense of community between newcomers and incumbent residents in a neighbourhood by a transit station. Although further qualitative research in a wider mix of locations is necessary to reach firm conclusions, initial findings from this study area suggest that there is currently limited mixing between the two populations and new residents have less attachment to the area than the existing residents. Given the continuing pace of development, this may have possible implications for neighbourhood social dynamics of many communities living around transit stations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65422887, "asset_id": 44671109, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14658607, "first_name": "Russell", "last_name": "Moore", "domain_name": "shu", "page_name": "RussellMoore", "display_name": "Russell D Moore", "profile_url": "https://shu.academia.edu/RussellMoore?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14658607/4218785/5730616/s65_russell.moore.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10096, "name": "Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Thailand?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116525, "name": "Social Dynamics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Dynamics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 199671, "name": "Bangkok", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bangkok?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 957131, "name": "Social Mixing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Mixing?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44582939, "title": "Belonging and participation at stake.

Theoretical references of the research were based in literature in the field of Education and Psychology, such as: Black Psychology and African Psychology. In order to collect the data two Black angoleiros that made university were visited and detailed conversations was done. Well as, it was made a Circle of Conversations that count on with two mestres and three professores-mestrandos of Capoeira Angola, which contributed to a more collective understanding of how the ethnic-racial belonging can be built inside a group that cultivates African traditions. The study was conducted with inspiration in Phenomenology and data were analyzed based on meanings expressed by the participants. The research shows that Be Black in Brazil is very difficult, but the practice of Capoeira Angola promotes both the psychological health and the strengthening of ethnic-racial belonging both in Blacks and in Non-Black. This happens because the Capoeira Angola educational processes are an anti-racist pedagogy, which encourage both the learning to live in diversity and the learning to fight to transform the society in a place more just, equalitarian and democratic. Thus, it is clear those Capoeira Angola knowledges and their own ways to transmit it, can strengthen the implementation of policies of Affirmative Action in Brazil.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59102253, "asset_id": 38995440, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9960814, "first_name": "Dra.

ISSN # 0160-2601. \n______________________________________________________________\nA multitude of diverse attributes is required for effective urban performance at various scales ranging from the immediate context of public buildings to central urban spaces, and from urban corridors to residential neighbourhoods. Following their earlier works (GRIERSON, 2014; MUNRO and GRIERSON, 2016; SALAMA, 2011; SALAMA and WIEDMANN, 2013; and SALAMA et al., 2016) the guest editors frame these qualities under a cycle of three main symbiotic pillars: the imagined, the measured, and the experienced, which contribute to the development of insights that elucidate various parameters for exploring urban performance. These three pillars stem from the Lefebvrian arguments and his theory on the production of space, which postulates a triadic relationship of three different but related types of spaces: the conceived (Imagined), the perceived (measured) and the lived (experienced). \n\nPrimarily, Lefebvre de\ufb01ned \u2018conceived space\u2019 as the space which is theorised by scientists and planners, known as \u2018representations of space\u2019, representations that are intangible and are entrenched in the principles, imperatives, beliefs and visions of experts, decision makers, and those who are in a position to impose their personal notion of \u2018order\u2019 onto concrete reality. The second is \u2018perceived space\u2019, the space of \u2018spatial practice\u2019 de\ufb01ned as the space where movement and interaction takes place, where networks develop and materialise. Consequently, it includes both daily routines at an individual level and urban realities such as the networks that link places designated for work, leisure and \u2018private\u2019 life (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 38). The third is \u2018lived space\u2019, which is explained as the unconscious, non-verbal direct relation between people and space. This is the space that is occupied through associated images and symbols (LEFEBVRE, 1991, p. 39). The current body of knowledge on Lefebvre\u2019s work suggests that the \u2018conceived space\u2019 is abstract and tactical and where authority functions, the \u2018perceived space\u2019 is a pragmatic, physical space encompassing flows of investment, workforce, and information and that this where the conceived and lived spaces are construed. Salama and Wiedmann (2013) suggest that the \u2018lived space\u2019 is the most subjective space, involving the actual experience of individuals that is performed in the \u2018perceived space\u2019 and as a result of the \u2018conceived space\u2019. \n\nIn our call for papers, the premise was that contributions to this issue of Open House International (OHI) would address the way in which decision-making processes, led by policy makers and discipline experts, contribute to successful urban environments; how the social and spatial practices of key actors (investors, developers, and users) manifest diverse urban activities; and how users attach to places and identify with their surroundings as a basis for social and spatial justice. Contributions were expected to address one of the three pillars while offering implications on the other two.  In response we have received more than 40 abstracts, and subsequently identified 19 for further development into full papers towards submission for review. The outcome of a rigorous review process concluded with the identification of 11 papers published in this issue.  Addressing various contexts in Europe and the Middle East, the papers represent diverse efforts undertaken by committed scholars in universities and academic institutions in Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Qatar, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.\n___________________________________________________\nPlease see more in the attached editorial document\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58801595, "asset_id": 38715217, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 27312, "first_name": "Ashraf M.", "last_name": "Salama", "domain_name": "strath", "page_name": "AshrafMSalama", "display_name": "Ashraf M.

By taking the cue from preliminary fieldwork carried out in some Sardinian migrant associations based in Turin, Pavia, and Bologna, the talk will tackle how Sardinia is imagined outside the borders of the island and the intermingling of several forms of belongings (Sardinian, Italian, and European) in the social and cultural activities of those associations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58591844, "asset_id": 38522882, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4593768, "first_name": "Gianmarco", "last_name": "Mancosu", "domain_name": "ulondon", "page_name": "GianmarcoMancosu", "display_name": "Gianmarco Mancosu", "profile_url": "https://ulondon.academia.edu/GianmarcoMancosu?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4593768/1913911/22567483/s65_gianmarco.mancosu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 80231, "name": "Sardinia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sardinia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 242778, "name": "Insularity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Insularity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 245207, "name": "Letteratura sarda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Letteratura_sarda?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 426709, "name": "Sardinian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sardinian_history?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 958174, "name": "Cultural Associations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Associations?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 38395978, "title": "'We want to be there for everyone': Imagined spaces of encounter and the politics of place in a super-diverse neighbourhood", "created_at": "2019-02-20T05:19:12.460-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38395978/We_want_to_be_there_for_everyone_Imagined_spaces_of_encounter_and_the_politics_of_place_in_a_super_diverse_neighbourhood?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_38395978", "summary": "In the context of increasingly diverse urban populations in European cities, neighbourhood organizations are often seen as offering spaces of encounter that can foster a sense of belonging.

Drawing on fifteen months of ethnographic fieldwork in Cuba between 2005 and 2016, the chapter highlights the moral foundations of these two approaches, uncovering their contextual emergence, meaningful coexistence, and implications. The analysis reveals the competing subjectivities and spheres of belonging that Cubans and tourists navigate, shedding light on the stakes, challenges and opportunities of \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018cunning\u2019 love in these relationships across difference and inequality.

We argue that a sense of belonging is not merely defined by place but relies on the quality of relationships that, through reflexive and ritual practices, operate in different domains of life. The performance of these everyday practices gives meaning and value to the identity of the subject and to the places. We use the insights from a longitudinal, mixed-methods study in Australia to interpret quantitative data on the formation of belonging among students in rural, southern Italy to elucidate the social mechanisms through which young people acquire in two rural realities that are different but both characterized by uncertainty, fluidity and social fragmentation. Iinterpretation of the Italian findings using the longitudinal qualitative Australian approach reveals that young people\u2019s belonging can no longer be attributed to ascribed factors, defined as a fixed property, but appears as a continuous process where affective and cultural relational practices, sedimented over time through the daily rituals structured in social relations, give meaning and value to the identity and belonging of young people in the places where they live.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 82948815, "asset_id": 36925657, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 374207, "first_name": "Hernan", "last_name": "Cuervo", "domain_name": "unimelb", "page_name": "HernanCuervo", "display_name": "Hernan Cuervo", "profile_url": "https://unimelb.academia.edu/HernanCuervo?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/374207/14359177/15286310/s65_hernan.cuervo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6013, "name": "Performativity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performativity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 365521, "name": "Rural Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rural_Youth?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 36895332, "title": "Exclusionary moments: Queer desires and migrants' sense of (un)belonging", "created_at": "2018-06-22T07:21:56.837-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36895332/Exclusionary_moments_Queer_desires_and_migrants_sense_of_un_belonging?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_36895332", "summary": "Migration to Iceland has increased considerably in recent decades, and after the labour market was opened up to EU workers in 2006, migrants from countries in Central and Eastern Europe have become by far the largest immigrant group.

This article discusses an under-researched area within queer migration studies: migrations from Central and Eastern Europe to a small population in Northern Europe, and their sense of belonging to their ethnic community, the queer community and wider Icelandic society. The overreaching theme of this study is \u201cexclusionary moments,\u201d while the sub-themes relate to social class (dis) identification, shame and emotional work, and participants' sense of (un)belonging. This study is based on semistructured interviews, and argues that shame is placed on participants through differential power structures, but also highlights participants' agency within those cultural scenarios.

Perceived self-class similarity buffered the negative association between social class and depressive symptoms. However, importance and salience of social class identity amplified the associations between social class and anxiety and life satisfaction.

Drawing on anthropological discussions of the relationship between death, social reproduction, and HIV/AIDS I argue that moral discourses and practices surrounding the epidemic in Northwest Tanzania are intimately intertwined with local notions of order and disorder. Furthermore, they are tied to individual and collective concerns about the implications that the high numbers of premature deaths among young men and women are perceived to have on the continuity of whole families and communities. Focusing on the case studies of several young HIV-infected women and men who finally died from the consequences of AIDS I show that the infected persons themselves, as well as their relatives, draw on a wide range of\u2014sometimes mutually contradictory\u2014strategies in dealing with the disease in cultural, religious, or moral terms (including the reference to witchcraft or the violation of ritual prescriptions). In conclusion, I argue that the various strategies and practices surrounding HIV/AIDS-related illnesses and deaths have become an integral part of the negotiation of kinship relations in rural Tanzania, as well as of the moral state of \"modern\" society in general.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33610200, "asset_id": 6938694, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

However, little systematic attention has been paid toward belonging for young children. Mechanisms for inclusion connect to belonging in the context of diversity that is regularly a part of school settings. Two-Way immersion (TWI) programs provide one educational context ideally suited for exploring the constructs of belonging and inclusion in linguistically and culturally diverse settings. This study explores how kindergarteners articulate a sense of belonging in a socio-linguistically diverse international Two-Way immersion school. Focus groups were conducted with kindergarteners asking children to help English and Spanish language dominant puppets understand what it would be like as a new student at the school and what they would need to fit in and belong. Findings reveal that these kindergarteners recognize the utility of language but do not segregate peers by language group. Language proficiencies were articulated as a procedure for being able to 'do school.' These young children appear to experience language diversity as a 'de facto' context and something to manage procedurally. Comments on friendship-making also express the importance of conforming to concrete social interpersonal norms, namely friendship as compliance to social norms and procedures of asking someone to be your friend and being nice. A consideration of inclusion as the negotiation of belonging in this diverse context allows us to consider the specific ideas and solutions of these kindergarteners as a shared project of belonging in which they all work to enact inclusion.

It can also be impacted by the design of the built environment, in this case by the interior design of boarding schools. Within the emerging literature pertaining to experiences of boarding school for Aboriginal students in Australia, issues of loneliness, isolation, homesickness, and the feeling of being 'between two worlds' are commonly reported. However, there is currently a dearth of literature that connects these issues with a potential role for design. Therefore, the aim of this project was to address this gap through Participatory Action Research (PAR) in which data was collected through yarning and drawing with 52 participants. 27 current boarders (all Aboriginal people, 2 male, 25 female), 18 recent alumni (All Aboriginal people, 3 male, 15 female), and 7 boarding staff members (1 Aboriginal person, all female) participated. Four themes emerged that suggest a role for interior design in increasing student sense of belonging. These relate to the institutional characterisation of current boarding schools (Place Identity), avoiding 'all or nothing' social interaction through flexible spaces (Interior Relationships), allowing student participation in ongoing interior design (Spatial Voice), and the provision of spaces that offer social and cultural relief (Third Space). These are described in this paper using the voices of the participants. It is proposed that, although these findings report only a particular collection of voices, the potential application of these ideas may be broad and of benefit to many students.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65369522, "asset_id": 44859807, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 23297980, "first_name": "Emma", "last_name": "Whettingsteel", "domain_name": "curtin", "page_name": "EmmaWhettingsteel", "display_name": "Emma Whettingsteel", "profile_url": "https://curtin.academia.edu/EmmaWhettingsteel?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/23297980/6328979/38624772/s65_emma.whettingsteel.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 927, "name": "Indigenous or Aboriginal Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_or_Aboriginal_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1607, "name": "Participatory Action Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_Action_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5553, "name": "Interior Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interior_Design?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23791, "name": "Third Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Space?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 111535, "name": "Boarding Schools", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Boarding_Schools?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44609594, "title": "The Secrets of Life", "created_at": "2020-11-30T18:54:06.346-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44609594/The_Secrets_of_Life?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_44609594", "summary": "What are the secrets of life? The first secret of life is that we should unravel the full potential of emotions and imagination. We live in a culture that underestimates them. Emotions have their own language, and its own way to understand themselves. The best way to develop emotionally is by practicing emotions. And imagination is key in all our activities. We actually live in an imagined world. Art in general is especially useful to develop both our emotions and our imagination. \n      The second secret of life is that we should further display our existential belonging. There is a belonging potential with the biological and physical world that surround us, that is also highly underdeveloped in our culture. There is an overemphasis in social status and social achievements, to the detriment of our belonging relation with the existential universe. Amongst the many activities that can help us to further display our existential belonging we can mention: praying, meditating, running, swimming, taking the sun, listening birds singing in the forest, watching dolphins in the middle of the ocean, interacting with a cat or a dog, watching the moon. We are surrounding by a marvelous material and biological universe to which we have a natural belonging potential \u2013 we should use it in full. The first route to existential belonging is our physical and mental health. \n     The third secret of life is that we should develop in its entirety our social self. Contemporary societies overemphasize the economic status and have seriously deteriorated the quality of their integrative systems. Individualism is not an evolutionary characteristic; it is a cultural one. We are social beings; individualism is just a preferential route that Western societies have chosen for social status to be defined. And despite the success of economic competition in capitalism, it is only one of the venues for social life. Economic success will never be able by itself to fully produce the quality of social belonging that an individual requires. We need to have a full social life participating in many social spheres, many of which are very far away from any economic interest. Education is the key to further develop our social self. \n     The fourth secret of life is to learn to love plentifully. Love provides the emotional centrality needed for proper belonging by any of the three ways. Love is evolutionary what connects the mother with the child and what starts the process of socialization required for survival. A secure personality capable to belong emotionally to the external universe is consequence of a good belonging quality; provided by the mother or care giver the first twelve months. Emotional stability is required to be able to further develop belonging and to reason properly. The family and close friends are crucial in providing the emotional centrality of love. The lack of love can be substituted by social significance and existential significance, but only to some extent. Socially, having children is required for survival. Individually, whether to have children or not is a personal choice; but to decide not to have them, certainly reduces the quality of our overall belonging. \n     In The Secrets of Life, we discuss three central well being topics: health, education, and family and friends. But they are addressed within a broader evolutionary belonging framework.\n  \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65073988, "asset_id": 44609594, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 73821536, "first_name": "Carlos", "last_name": "Obregon", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "CarlosObregon", "display_name": "Carlos F Obregon", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/CarlosObregon?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/73821536/20020549/19799917/s65_carlos.obregon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 248, "name": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 586, "name": "Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Sciences?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1517, "name": "Exercise Physiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exercise_Physiology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2827, "name": "Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mental_Health?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3454, "name": "Children and Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children_and_Families?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3595, "name": "Individuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Individuality?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3851, "name": "Obesity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Obesity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 6574, "name": "Family", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Family?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16288, "name": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Health?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 16834, "name": "Attachment Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Attachment_Theory?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 23534, "name": "Individualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Individualism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25804, "name": "Neurobiology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neurobiology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 50456, "name": "Sports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sports?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 84734, "name": "Existence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existence?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 234974, "name": "Freedom of movement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Freedom_of_movement?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44268106, "title": "The moderating effect of social capital on co-regulated learning for MOOC achievement", "created_at": "2020-10-10T07:21:22.191-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44268106/The_moderating_effect_of_social_capital_on_co_regulated_learning_for_MOOC_achievement?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_44268106", "summary": "The aim of this paper is to track down elements of self-regulated learning in a massive open online course regarding social capital.

Britain's decision to leave the EU caused uncertainty for CEE 1.5 generation young people at a time when many of them were consciously reflecting on their beings, becomings, and belongings. The majority of young people asserted a sense of belonging to Britain whilst simultaneously feeling a sense of \"in-between-ness.\" Many young people wanted to remain living in Britain, at least in the short term, and felt a sense of belonging to Britain. Our focus on the potential intergenerational impact of Brexit suggests that CEE young people and parents may view possibilities for the future differently; we examine some of the key reasons for these differences from the young people's perspectives. KEYWORDS 1.5 generation, Brexit, Central and Eastern Europe, migration, young people 1 | INTRODUCTION \"Brexit means Brexit,\" the Prime Minister, Theresa May, famously declared in the aftermath of the EU Referendum in June 2016. At the time of writing, in June 2018, Britain has triggered Article 50, and negotiations on Britain's exit from the EU are ongoing. However, the public is still unclear over the details of what kind of relationship Britain will have with the EU once it leaves in March 2019, if the agreed period of negotiations is not extended by agreement with the EU member states. What has become clear, in the time since the 2016 Referendum, is that Brexit is very likely to have significant implications not just for Britain's place in Europe, but also for its demographic makeup and promoted national identity. A significant aspect in the build-up to the Brexit Referendum was the debate on immigration. Questioning the exclusively economic explanation for the majority pro-Brexit vote, Virdee and McGeever (2017) examine the discursive dimensions of the Leave campaign and show how this was built on a narrative which aimed to reinstate the sovereign will of the British people, exemplified through slogans such as \"Let's take back control .\" Indeed, the Leave campaign led by both the UKIP party and sections of the Conservative party focused on a politics of reasserting Britishness as an identity which must be preserved and reasserted in the face of the threat of increasing immigration. Virdee and McGeever (2017) call this a politics of nationalist resentment, which comes in a long history of racialised identities constructed in relation to migrants and feelings of national belonging, and debates on who has a right to belong.

Drawing on 69 semi-structured interviews with Italians and Spaniards living in London and Berlin, this article shows that the sense of belonging to one or more political communities and boundary work are related to individual experiences and can change due to structural eventualities such as the Brexit referendum. While identification with the host society is rare, attachment to the home country is quite common as a result of people's everyday experiences. Cultural changes and European/cosmopolitan identification are linked to exposure to new environments and interaction with new cultures, mostly concerning those with previous mobility experience , as well as to a sentiment of non-acceptance in the UK. However, such categories are not rigid, but many times self-identification and attachments are rather blurred also due to the uncertainty around the duration of the mobility project. This makes individual factors (gender, age, family status, employment, education) that are often considered as determinants of identification patterns all but relevant.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61172897, "asset_id": 40886528, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4271515, "first_name": "Iraklis", "last_name": "Dimitriadis", "domain_name": "unimib", "page_name": "IraklisDimitriadis", "display_name": "Iraklis Dimitriadis", "profile_url": "https://unimib.academia.edu/IraklisDimitriadis?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4271515/1697777/7133875/s65_iraklis.dimitriadis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1219, "name": "Southern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southern_Europe?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8011, "name": "Intra-European Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intra-European_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 597972, "name": "Intra-European Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intra-European_Mobility?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 40154993, "title": "Working Identities", "created_at": "2019-08-23T08:04:35.376-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40154993/Working_Identities?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_40154993", "summary": "An interdisciplinary briefing document by Dr Eva Selenko, published ahead of the Cumberland Lodge conference on 'Working Identities', held on 11-12 March 2019.\n\nThis document explores current thinking and research around working identities, and offers an analysis of labour situations in the UK today, in relation to their impacts on identities and belonging.\n\nThe following ideas were highlighted for discussion at the conference:\n\n- Working identities (which can be defined as peoples\u2019 understandings of who they are, in relation to work) are both informed by, and inform, the social environment in which work takes place.\n\n- People need to enact their identities in positive encounters with others, in order to feel validated and confirmed in those identities.\n\n- New labour realities can pose particular challenges for people\u2019s working identities: 1) They can provoke identity discontinuity/disruption, where people no longer feel able to enact the work identity they want to (e.g. because of unemployment, sectoral changes, technological changes to the existing job, or feelings of enforced \u2018falseness\u2019); 2) They can give rise to feelings of identity confusion, particularly when jobs fail to offer the necessary structures to allow for identity development; 2) They can limit peoples\u2019 opportunities for positive social validation (e.g. because work is less visible, or the work/non-work situation is stigmatised).\n\n- New labour realities make identity particularly salient to people: workers want to understand what is happening to them, and to integrate this understanding into their own self-understanding. These labour realities can be perceived as \u2018sense-breaking\u2019, \u2018meaningless\u2019 or \u2018excluding\u2019 \u2013 all of which can be motivating factors in identity formation.\n\n- When confronted with these new labour realities, certain coping behaviours are observed amongst workers that can be ascribed to impacts on identity: 1) Nostalgia might be adopted as a strategy for dealing with disrupted identity; 2) Frustrated identity enactment might lead to aggression; 3) Occupational identity change might be observed, but only with certain preconditions.\n\n- It seems that giving people opportunities to enact new and more positive identities, or to experience greater social validation, can help them to navigate the choppy waters of 21st-century labour realities\n\nKey findings and recommendations from the multi-sector, interdisciplinary conference that took place in March will be presented at a report launch in London on 27 November 2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60374001, "asset_id": 40154993, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 85903957, "first_name": "Cumberland", "last_name": "Lodge", "domain_name": "cumberlandlodge", "page_name": "cumberlandlodge", "display_name": "Cumberland Lodge", "profile_url": "https://cumberlandlodge.academia.edu/cumberlandlodge?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/85903957/27920295/28733350/s65_cumberland.lodge.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 465, "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Artificial_Intelligence?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1235, "name": "Sociology of Work", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Work?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7176, "name": "Unemployment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Unemployment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12189, "name": "Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 35704, "name": "Identity Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Formation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 48047, "name": "Trade unions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trade_unions?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 48442, "name": "Working Class Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Class_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 652640, "name": "New World of Work", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_World_of_Work?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 740685, "name": "Precarious work", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Precarious_work?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 770578, "name": "Working Identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Working_Identities?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 981521, "name": "Occupational Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Occupational_Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1656345, "name": "Zero Hours Contracts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zero_Hours_Contracts?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2719451, "name": "Bullshit Jobs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bullshit_Jobs?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3157028, "name": "digital platform economy and vulnerable workers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/digital_platform_economy_and_vulnerable_workers?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 39680890, "title": "Performing languages of belonging: transcultural representations in Adichie\u2019s Americanah and Zadie Smith\u2019s On Beauty", "created_at": "2019-06-24T04:03:11.323-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39680890/Performing_languages_of_belonging_transcultural_representations_in_Adichie_s_Americanah_and_Zadie_Smith_s_On_Beauty?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_39680890", "summary": "\u201cIn any instance of at least written language, there is no such thing as a delivered presence, but a re-presence, or a representation,\u201d Edward Said writes in the first pages of his introduction to Orientalism. He thus illustrates how representations of the Orient were just that: representations. Yet this quote can take on another meaning in the context that interests us here: the writers that will be the focus of this paper do not simply deliver a presence either, they re-present minorities that have been under-represented for centuries, and they reclaim both language and representations to tell a plurality of stories, undermining what Adichie called \u2018the single story\u2019 about the Other. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Zadie Smith are two female writers who, in addition to their representations of racial issues, include the gender dimension to the prickly question of belonging. \nThis paper shall focus on Adichie\u2019s Americanah and Smith\u2019s On Beauty, which both deal with the next to impossible integration of coloured women in a white society. Despite their social achievements, coloured women are constantly reminded of their otherness, which leads them to perform their sense of belonging, all the while remaining acutely aware of their vulnerability. The objective of this paper will be to define the forms taken by these performances and to analyse the manifold discursive devices used to illustrate and highlight them. Hazel Carby wrote about Gilroy\u2019s The Black Atlantic that it placed black people as \u2018central participants in the creation of the modern world\u2019 and we will examine whether Adichie and Smith place black women as actresses in the creation of a transcultural world or whether their representations of this transcultural world point to its own limits.\n\nTalk given at a Conference in the University of Liverpool, in June 2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46134734, "first_name": "Julia", "last_name": "Siccardi", "domain_name": "univ-paris3", "page_name": "JuliaSiccardi", "display_name": "Julia Siccardi", "profile_url": "https://univ-paris3.academia.edu/JuliaSiccardi?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/46134734/12808255/103651108/s65_julia.siccardi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 59676, "name": "Zadie Smith", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zadie_Smith?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 77969, "name": "Identity and Alterity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Alterity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 312734, "name": "Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chimamanda_Ngozi_Adichie?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 38964158, "title": "Peer Reviewed Conference Paper Design for Social Change: Harnessing the Student Voice to Prevent Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment", "created_at": "2019-04-28T18:31:58.006-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38964158/Peer_Reviewed_Conference_Paper_Design_for_Social_Change_Harnessing_the_Student_Voice_to_Prevent_Sexual_Assault_and_Sexual_Harassment?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_38964158", "summary": "Respect.Now.Always. is an Australia-wide campaign to address and eliminate sexual assault and harassment within universities.

Using a participatory design research approach, DIRC developed insights on UTS student experiences in interacting with UTS.

This unique design research approach was made possible through careful work establishing trust with senior stakeholders, and leads the way for more novel activations to engage the community in preventing sexual assault and harassment.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59067611, "asset_id": 38964158, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 110860637, "first_name": "Catharine", "last_name": "Pruscino", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "CPruscino", "display_name": "Catharine Pruscino", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/CPruscino?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/110860637/26169769/24779088/s65_catharine.pruscino.jpg"}, {"id": 48033825, "first_name": "Bridget", "last_name": "Malcolm", "domain_name": "uts", "page_name": "BridgetMalcolm", "display_name": "Bridget Malcolm", "profile_url": "https://uts.academia.edu/BridgetMalcolm?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48033825/17945769/17958684/s65_bridget.malcolm.jpg"}, {"id": 112839750, "first_name": "Domenic", "last_name": "Svejkar", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DomenicSvejkar", "display_name": "Domenic Svejkar", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DomenicSvejkar?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1578, "name": "Participatory Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Participatory_Research?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3470, "name": "Community Engagement & Participation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Engagement_and_Participation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20453, "name": "Culture Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture_Change?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 82715, "name": "Human-Centered Design", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human-Centered_Design?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 38538659, "title": "Young Finnish Somalis Exploring their Belonging within Participatory Performative Research", "created_at": "2019-03-12T12:07:37.982-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38538659/Young_Finnish_Somalis_Exploring_their_Belonging_within_Participatory_Performative_Research?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_38538659", "summary": "Purpose - This chapter discusses the belonging of second-generation Finnish Somalis based on a participatory performative research project conducted in Helsinki with young second-generation immigrants.

In these productions, the search for multiple homes and belonging formed a narrative that was expressed in both the audiovisual materials and the written stories. \nFindings - The performative approaches and audiovisual methods employed in the study assisted the participants in dealing with questions of belonging and othering by emphasizing the strength and multifacetedness offered by outsider positions. In the \"potential spaces\" created in the project setting, memories and experiences could be expressed in symbolic form, discussed, and rearticulated.

Belonging - Mana whenua is a crucial construct in Aotearoa New Zealand\u2019s early childhood curriculum, Te Wh\u0101riki, described as contributing to well-being, confidence to try new things, and identity. Belonging is a basic human need that develops in the context of\nrelationships with people, places and things, within contexts of families and communities. Yet, despite its prominence as a curriculum strand, the processes of coming to belong and supporting belonging through early childhood education, especially where different cultural beliefs require negotiation, are not well understood.\nThe three presentations in this symposium will discuss initial findings from two research projects focused on refugee and immigrant families in early childhood education. These are a Marsden\u2013funded project, Refugee families in early childhood education: constructing pathways to belonging, and a TLRI project, Strengthening belonging and identity of refugee and immigrant children through early childhood education.\n\nBoth projects use a design-based implementation research approach within early childhood centres involving cycles of data gathering, theory building, critical analysis and evaluation, and adaptation of design. Video-recording, story-telling, documented learning stories, drawing and interviewing are specific methods being used to gather data with children and families. Teachers are researching with academics in\nthese projects.\n\nData is being analysed thematically and conversation analysis used to investigate cultural nuance and specific aspects of interactions that are significant to the participants.\n- Thematic analysis is used to build stories of belonging in context through analysis of videotaped episodes, interview data and documentation. This iterative approach will involve going back to the\ndata and literature as we collaborate with participants, fine-tune the analysis and theorise.\n- Conversation analysis is used to provide insight into the ways in which children attend to past experiences in their home country in their talk and play with peers and teachers. Membership categorisation analysis is used for detailing how children refer to their belonging in everyday\nconversation, and also by observing how they choose to gain membership with other children and adults.\n\nOur aims are to construct a new theoretical model with exemplars that will generate improved understandings of bicultural belonging and identity for refugee and immigrant families in New Zealand. This\nresearch is transformative in aiming to generate critical thinking and shifts in understanding in order to support a more inclusive society.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58118179, "asset_id": 38090680, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1320777, "first_name": "Elaine", "last_name": "Khoo", "domain_name": "independentresearcher", "page_name": "ElaineKhoo", "display_name": "Elaine Khoo", "profile_url": "https://independentresearcher.academia.edu/ElaineKhoo?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1320777/2988168/10917759/s65_elaine.khoo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 887, "name": "Teaching and Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_and_Learning?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3136, "name": "Qualitative methodology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Qualitative_methodology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3753, "name": "Early Childhood Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Early_Childhood_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 618644, "name": "Refugee and migrant children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugee_and_migrant_children?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37816955, "title": "Sense of place in a small community", "created_at": "2018-11-20T16:44:59.222-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37816955/Sense_of_place_in_a_small_community?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37816955", "summary": "Dr Ian Willis describes his passion for the sense of place and community identity of his home town", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57816761, "asset_id": 37816955, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4533674, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Willis", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "IanWillis", "display_name": "Ian Willis", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/IanWillis?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4533674/4171393/4858177/s65_ian.willis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 881, "name": "Community History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4156, "name": "Local History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Local_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6492, "name": "Storytelling", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Storytelling?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 856344, "name": "Community Identiy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Identiy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1928445, "name": "Small regional museums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Small_regional_museums?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37549538, "title": "The Embodiment of Place: Boorlinge, Inkommers and the Struggle to Belong", "created_at": "2018-10-08T04:41:42.479-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37549538/The_Embodiment_of_Place_Boorlinge_Inkommers_and_the_Struggle_to_Belong?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37549538", "summary": "This chapter investigates how the embodiment of place and belonging (in terms of place identities) are constructed and contested in narrative discourses of residents from a peri-urban, Afrikaans-dominant town located in South Africa\u2019s South Cape region. In the early nineteenth-century, the area was inhabited by Houteniquas, who were a regional Khoekhoe group. I refer to the town as Houtiniquadorp to protect the participants\u2019 anonymity. The pseudonym reflects the complex entanglement of the place\u2019s pre-colonial heritage with the post-colonial reality in which Afrikaans is the most spoken language in the area. The Afrikaans word dorp (\u2018town\u2019) embodies the colonial history of which Afrikaans itself is a product. It is found that residents have created emic place identities depending on things like how recently they or their families arrived in the town and how many generations their ancestral connection reaches back. Through a discourse analysis of interview narratives, it is found that these new identities can be traced back to historical struggles to belong, resistance to newcomers, and discourses of authenticity. The argument is made that in-migration contributed to how residents position themselves and others as authentic or marginal, and in the process created various embodied place identities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57524934, "asset_id": 37549538, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140289, "first_name": "Yolandi", "last_name": "Ribbens-Klein", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "YolandiRibbensKlein", "display_name": "Yolandi Ribbens-Klein", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/YolandiRibbensKlein?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140289/86214/20738472/s65_yolandi.ribbens-klein.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2718, "name": "Linguistic Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistic_Anthropology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5044, "name": "Embodiment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Embodiment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5579, "name": "Authenticity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authenticity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25270, "name": "Afrikaans (Language and Literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrikaans_Language_and_Literature_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 25618, "name": "Phenomenology of Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37343078, "title": "Suicidio.

By merging legal and theoretical analysis, this article contributes a reading of the Court's case law which suggests that the tension between the political and apolitical is visible as a common thread in the Court's use of identity. In case law concerning paternity, the Court appears to hold a specific view of what is presented as an unquestionable part of identity. This ostensibly pre-political notion of identity becomes untenable in cases where the nature of an identity feature, such as the headscarf, is contended or a minority has adopted a national identity that conflicts with the majoritarian national identity. The Court's approach to identity in such cases reflects a paradox that is inherent to identity; identity is personal while simultaneously constituted and shaped by overarching power mechanisms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55633795, "asset_id": 35758145, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14609804, "first_name": "Yussef", "last_name": "Al Tamimi", "domain_name": "eui", "page_name": "YussefAlTamimi", "display_name": "Yussef Al Tamimi", "profile_url": "https://eui.academia.edu/YussefAlTamimi?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14609804/23864377/22877662/s65_yussef.al_tamimi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12040, "name": "Jacques Derrida", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Derrida?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30045, "name": "Homi Bhabha (Cultural Theory)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homi_Bhabha_Cultural_Theory_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 34230948, "title": "Shadow Subjects: A Category of Analysis for Empathic Stancetaking", "created_at": "2017-08-15T05:27:26.410-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34230948/Shadow_Subjects_A_Category_of_Analysis_for_Empathic_Stancetaking?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_34230948", "summary": "This article analyzes conversational and material data collected during 12 months of fieldwork at a secondary school in southeast Spain.

In this paper, I will explore the themes of exile and return, and how these can lead to an underlying anxiety of inclusion and exclusion. Firstly, I will give a brief overview of Camus' pied-noir status as an influential factor in his writings, before looking more closely at two of these stories, discussing the ways in which they explore these themes in relation to Camus' absurdism. Finally, I will briefly point to how such themes might be understood in relation to the wider themes of anxiety, recognition, and rootedness, which will hopefully lead to further discussion on what belonging looks like, and what it means to be simultaneously included and excluded.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51788871, "asset_id": 31424617, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 954602, "first_name": "Alison", "last_name": "Brady, PhD", "domain_name": "ioe-ac", "page_name": "AlisonBrady", "display_name": "Alison M Brady, PhD", "profile_url": "https://ioe-ac.academia.edu/AlisonBrady?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/954602/6122242/24249475/s65_alison.brady.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7943, "name": "Recognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Recognition?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10767, "name": "Exile", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17214, "name": "Return Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Return_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21760, "name": "Camus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Camus?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 34215, "name": "Albert Camus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Albert_Camus?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 36802, "name": "Absurdism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Absurdism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 67525, "name": "Existentialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existentialism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 215475, "name": "Pieds-Noirs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pieds-Noirs?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 240932, "name": "Rootedness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Rootedness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2494727, "name": "Philosophy of the Absurd", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_the_Absurd?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2621081, "name": "Philosophy of Anxiety", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_Anxiety?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 29033945, "title": "Liminality & Belonging: the Politics of Conversion in an Eastern Orthodox Church", "created_at": "2016-10-09T12:59:26.512-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29033945/Liminality_and_Belonging_the_Politics_of_Conversion_in_an_Eastern_Orthodox_Church?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_29033945", "summary": "St. John\u2019s Orthodox Church waited fi fteen years before converting to Orthodoxy from its charismatic evangelical past.

We explored whether the mental strategy of daydreaming about significant others could have similar effects by acting as an imaginary substitute when loved ones are unavailable. Following a loneliness induction, participants (N = 126) were asked to either daydream about a significant other, daydream about a non-social scenario or complete a control task. Social daydreamers showed significantly increased feelings of connection, love and belonging compared to non-social daydreamers and control participants. Consistent with the proposition that social daydreaming replenished connectedness, social daydreamers also behaved more pro-socially and expressed less of a desire to interact with others after daydreaming. These findings demonstrate that through imagination, social daydreaming can replenish connectedness providing a potential strategy for enhancing socio- emotional well-being.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38262614, "asset_id": 14302229, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3072164, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Totterdell", "domain_name": "sheffield", "page_name": "PeterTotterdell", "display_name": "Peter Totterdell", "profile_url": "https://sheffield.academia.edu/PeterTotterdell?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3072164/2594979/3014336/s65_peter.totterdell.jpg"}, {"id": 797947, "first_name": "Giulia", "last_name": "Poerio", "domain_name": "york", "page_name": "GiuliaPoerio", "display_name": "Giulia Poerio", "profile_url": "https://york.academia.edu/GiuliaPoerio?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/797947/3855144/4510253/s65_giulia.poerio.jpg"}, {"id": 398080, "first_name": "Eleanor", "last_name": "Miles", "domain_name": "sussex", "page_name": "EleanorMiles", "display_name": "Eleanor Miles", "profile_url": "https://sussex.academia.edu/EleanorMiles?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/398080/99000/115463/s65_eleanor.miles.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 254, "name": "Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9456, "name": "Emotions (Social Psychology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotions_Social_Psychology_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12478, "name": "Emotion Regulation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotion_Regulation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15838, "name": "Imagination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagination?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 115029, "name": "Loneliness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Loneliness?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 759844, "name": "Daydreaming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Daydreaming?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 14236696, "title": "Two sides of the same coin: Factors that support and challenge the wellbeing of refugees resettled in a small urban centre.", "created_at": "2015-07-20T16:47:44.063-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14236696/Two_sides_of_the_same_coin_Factors_that_support_and_challenge_the_wellbeing_of_refugees_resettled_in_a_small_urban_centre?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_14236696", "summary": "For refugees who undergo permanent resettlement, characteristics of the resettlement context influence their ability to heal from pre-migration persecution and achieve a sense of wellbeing.

This conceptualization questions the centrality of identity in the debates on migration and diasporas, and it makes visible how belonging emerges from the existential process of making sense of one's location between the self and others.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86513981, "asset_id": 79980216, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 34691075, "first_name": "Bruno", "last_name": "Lefort", "domain_name": "uta-fi", "page_name": "BrunoLefort", "display_name": "Bruno Lefort", "profile_url": "https://uta-fi.academia.edu/BrunoLefort?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/34691075/10125680/11298040/s65_bruno.lefort.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3900, "name": "Anthropology of Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Mobility?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 6736, "name": "Lebanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lebanon?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28473, "name": "Existential Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Existential_Anthropology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 54114, "name": "Canada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Canada?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1028140, "name": "Homemaking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Homemaking?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 79660040, "title": "Betwixt and between.

In this ethnographic study, I analyze the sociopolitical implications of this process. I examine how and why the Alawite and Christian Arab communities that identify themselves as indigenous peoples of Antakya have found themselves in the newly mapped Defne. I demonstrate how and through what spatial and identity practices these indigenous communities and key political stakeholders compete over the cultural heritage of Hatay and Antakya. Doing so, I aim to reveal the power relations behind the new cartography for Hatay while witnessing and documenting Antakya's (re)make and Defne's metamorphosis into the built and imaginary landscapes of the nation at the Turkish-Syrian border. My research has shown that Defne, now with its non-Sunni population, stands as a sign of difference and segregation in Hatay\u2019s new ethno- sectarian landscape, in contrast to Antakya, which has been Sunnified due to recent official districting practices.

A focus on belonging thus allows a dynamic examination of the mutual influence between self and society, and of how everyday practices are both regulated and creative, and hence generative of social change.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77369842, "asset_id": 66015253, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66030884, "first_name": "Vanessa", "last_name": "May", "domain_name": "cresc", "page_name": "VanessaMay", "display_name": "Vanessa May", "profile_url": "https://cresc.academia.edu/VanessaMay?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 206, "name": "Social Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Change?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 209, "name": "Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 31697, "name": "Self", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 41286, "name": "Everyday Life", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Everyday_Life?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 587481, "name": "Moi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moi?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 61242562, "title": "Racial Microaggressions and Sense of Belonging at a Historically White University", "created_at": "2021-11-07T17:00:50.094-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/61242562/Racial_Microaggressions_and_Sense_of_Belonging_at_a_Historically_White_University?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_61242562", "summary": "This study applied critical race theory to explore the racial microaggression experiences of students of color (i.e., African American, Asian American, Latinx, and Multiracial students) at a historically White university.

Women use food literacy to teach, learn, and practice the way Buddhism feels and etch it into their own\nand others\u2019 emotional, social, and material bodies. By recognizing women as stewards of religion, particularly through food literacy, we also elucidate how women\u2019s uses of mundane practices illuminate food literacy as a value carrier that generates belonging through food.

While there was no significant relation between Social-related ESM use and employee belongingness, there was a statistically significant relationship between Work-related ESM use, age generation groups, and employee belongingness. Overall, Generation-X employees showed a higher belongingness score compared to Millennials, and even higher compared to Generation-Z employees. The results indicate that using an internal social media technology for work-related purposes can help employees feel that they belong and are a part of the social makeup of the organization.

While one of the most significant moments which re-defined settler-Indigenous relationship took place around the turn of the twenty-first century, the critical scholarship examining settler anxieties regarding the sense of (un)belonging is flourishing in the post-Mabo period, as is the production of cultural and literary narratives engaging with this topic. This article explores two recent memoirs of settler belonging in Australia and contextualises them in a broader tradition of settler memoirs in the first decade of this century. By comparing and contrasting Tim Winton\u2019s Island Home (2015. London: Picador) and Kim Mahood\u2019s Position Doubtful (2016. Melbourne: Scribe), the article demonstrates a visible shift from earlier forms of writing settler (un)belonging, which often thematised settler anxiety and desire to belong through various acts of appropriating Indigenous ways of belonging. Winton\u2019s and Mahood\u2019s memoirs, however, offer a different vision of settler belonging: one that is deeply embedded in local, bioregional and environmental histories, recognition of Indigenous knowledges as significant agents shaping post-Mabo aesthetics and politics, and a commitment to transformation of settler relationship with the land from territory to Country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64519862, "asset_id": 43679253, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 665112, "first_name": "Martina", "last_name": "Horakova", "domain_name": "muni", "page_name": "MartinaHorakova", "display_name": "Martina  Horakova", "profile_url": "https://muni.academia.edu/MartinaHorakova?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/665112/1194085/1495973/s65_martina.horakova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1930, "name": "Australian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27997, "name": "Australian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Literature?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36393, "name": "Settler Colonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_Colonial_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107550, "name": "Settler colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Settler_colonialism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 185486, "name": "Tim Winton", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tim_Winton?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 40941138, "title": "Coloured execs battle to get to the top", "created_at": "2019-11-15T14:39:12.480-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40941138/Coloured_execs_battle_to_get_to_the_top?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_40941138", "summary": "New research from the University of Cape Town\u2019s Graduate School of Business shows that coloured professionals are struggling to transcend apartheid-imposed labels of identity and that this has negatively affected them in the workplace \u2014 making it harder for them to succeed at senior management levels.

"In this essay I discuss artworks by a sample of young people with a Muslim background who\nparticipated in the Numur\u2014Islam and I exhibition, which was organised as part of the Young Muslims and\nResilience (2016-2018) research project. Art exhibitions were staged in November 2017 and March 2018 with\neighteen young adult participants/co-researchers. Their artworks included video and textile installations,\nphoto collages, paintings, calligraphy and poetry, dealing with issues such as faith, dialogues between\nreligious communities, gender, belonging and sexual diversity. Here I concentrate on some works by the\nparticipants who stated that they leaned on Sufism or spirituality in their working processes, or whose\nworks expressed qualities that may be reflected through the spectrum in which rhizomes of Sufi ways of\nunderstanding human existence in the world are present. In their artworks, the participants created fresh\nideas about possible encounters, which I interpret as being linked to modern and postmodern ideas of\nrelationships between spaces and \u201cbecoming communities.\u201d Likewise, these ideas can be traced to our\ncommon philosophical heritage, which is partly based on spiritual mystic thought and practices of different\nreligions. By using art, the participants could embody this legacy, create spaces for themselves and open\nlandscapes for discussions between Muslim believers and people with different religions and worldviews.\nKeywords: art-based and performative approaches, ethnopoesis, gender and sexuality, spirituality, Sufism, transformative actions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58734744, "asset_id": 38624724, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 87917, "first_name": "helena", "last_name": "oikarinen-jabai", "domain_name": "aalto-fi", "page_name": "helenaoikarinenjabai", "display_name": "helena  oikarinen-jabai", "profile_url": "https://aalto-fi.academia.edu/helenaoikarinenjabai?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/87917/24505/67471/s65_helena.oikarinen-jabai.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3783, "name": "Contemporary Spirituality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Spirituality?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14970, "name": "Muslims in Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Europe?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17240, "name": "Contemporary Sufism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Sufism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33562, "name": "Intercultural dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_dialogue?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3175755, "name": "Arts-based and Performative Methodologies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arts-based_and_Performative_Methodologies?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37731901, "title": "Who \" Belongs \" ?

The nationalising effects of state policies perpetuate the embeddedness of membership in the exclusionary community of the nation rather than effectively promulgating enactments of inclusive civic state membership. Drawing on the chosen example of Slovenia as a relatively new nation-state and a recent country of immigration, the paper offers new insights into migrant experiences as illustrations of the need to relegate to the dustbin of history the existing practices of preferential treatment for members of the dominant nation. Arguing that it is essential to study migration in conjunction with nationalism, the paper urges a more inclusive theoretical perspective which would take account of migrants.

For many of those characters, neither the sense of home nor their integration in society come as a given.\nIn Smith\u2019s novels, the question of home is addressed in various ways depending on the ethnicity of the characters. The objective of this paper is to focus on the sense of home as understood and lived by Caribbean women, and more generally Black women, in Zadie Smith\u2019s White Teeth, On Beauty and NW. In those novels, some women leave their beautiful houses which no longer feel like homes (Kiki Belsey in On Beauty and Natalie Blake in NW) while others seem to settle more easily (Clara Bowden in White Teeth). In On Beauty, Carlene Kipps, a Trinidadian woman, mother of two, genuinely horrified by the thought of living alone, quotes a line from a poem (actually, a line written by Nick Laird, Smith\u2019s husband): \u2018There is such a shelter in each other\u2019 (Smith, 93). These elements suggest that the sense of home may not be tied to a place, an actual house, but to the intimacy of relationships. It also goes against the view of home as feminine, as a haven. As feminist geographer Doreen Massey suggests, home can actually be \u2018a place of conflict\u2019 and \u2018many women have had to leave home precisely in order to forge their own version of their identities\u2019 (Massey, 11), which is what happens to Kiki Belsey and Natalie Blake. If all these feminine characters have a house, not all of them have a home. According to Massey, the concepts of spaces and places are articulated in terms of social relations, places being defined on a smaller scale, by personal and intimate relations. The aim of this paper is to examine how this concept of space and place as social relations is developed in Zadie Smith\u2019s novels. I intend to analyse how these women, members of the Caribbean diaspora, create a sense of home for themselves, particularly when their houses are not hospitable anymore. I\u2019ll also explore how their race and gender impact both their social relations and their home-building.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 46134734, "first_name": "Julia", "last_name": "Siccardi", "domain_name": "univ-paris3", "page_name": "JuliaSiccardi", "display_name": "Julia Siccardi", "profile_url": "https://univ-paris3.academia.edu/JuliaSiccardi?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/46134734/12808255/103651108/s65_julia.siccardi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1138, "name": "Women's Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6259, "name": "Caribbean Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Literature?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19915, "name": "Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gilles_Deleuze_and_Felix_Guattari?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 23763, "name": "Caribbean women's writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_womens_writing?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 34542, "name": "Caribbean Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caribbean_Diasporas?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 59676, "name": "Zadie Smith", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Zadie_Smith?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 215860, "name": "Doreen Massey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Doreen_Massey?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1569558, "name": "Territorialisation et D\u00e9territorialisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Territorialisation_et_Deterritorialisation?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 36912662, "title": "'Travel Book to Africa'.

Instead of assuming that political and socio-economic uncertainty necessarily lead to chaos, the organizers invite papers that focus on phenomena such as economic speculation and gambling, political and moral interventions, religious divination, youth gangs and student movements.\nBy exploring the potential of uncertainty, especially in relation to the construction of belonging, we follow the assumption that \"uncertainty is productive\" (Cooper/Pratten 2015). Considering ways in which uncertainty shapes young people's ways of being in the world and belonging to places and people can enhance a more varied understanding of the category \u201cbelonging\u201d. We are interested not only in how a feeling of belonging may counter or outdo uncertainty, but rather how belonging emerges or is formed as a result of uncertainty. \nWe are especially interested in contributions (English or German) that \u2013 by using ethnographically saturated data \u2013 discuss practices that form new or stabilize existing socio-cultural groups not despite uncertainty, but by recognizing and experimenting with it. This includes exploring how and why young people claim affiliation with particular groups, precisely in situations of uncertainty, and the purpose this serves in regard to remaking and transcending modes of belonging to a collective.\nWe particularly invite presenters that offer ethnographic insights which serve a comparative use that goes beyond a singular focus on one 'southern' region or 'south-south' comparison, but instead draw attention to the similarities between and productive forces of uncertainties that make young people belong across the world.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51483267, "asset_id": 31050009, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 13848728, "first_name": "Mario", "last_name": "Schmidt", "domain_name": "uni-koln", "page_name": "MarioSchmidt", "display_name": "Mario Schmidt", "profile_url": "https://uni-koln.academia.edu/MarioSchmidt?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/13848728/3840103/4493247/s65_mario.schmidt.jpg"}, {"id": 3324486, "first_name": "Franziska", "last_name": "Fay", "domain_name": "uni-mainz", "page_name": "FranziskaFay", "display_name": "Franziska Fay", "profile_url": "https://uni-mainz.academia.edu/FranziskaFay?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3324486/1111745/40478214/s65_franziska.fay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1557, "name": "Youth Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9434, "name": "Chaos Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chaos_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19052, "name": "Children and Youth", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children_and_Youth?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 25953, "name": "Young People", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Young_People?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 61603, "name": "Uncertainty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uncertainty?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 24705906, "title": "Transnational Processes of Identification and Belonging Among Children and Young People of Migrant Descent", "created_at": "2016-04-24T03:31:45.848-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24705906/Transnational_Processes_of_Identification_and_Belonging_Among_Children_and_Young_People_of_Migrant_Descent?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_24705906", "summary": "In order to recognize young people as independent social agents, a great deal of research has focused on developing understandings of their senses of identity and belonging outside of the realm of the family. As relevant and necessary as these contributions are, they do not allow for an exploration of the role that relationships within the family or across generations may play in young people\u2019s sense of self. Taking into account the relational context of the family is necessary to develop better understandings of the experiences and affiliations of children of migrant descent who may live embedded in transnational families and their extended social networks. The chapter starts by exploring the research which has foregrounded the roles of children and young people in processes of transmigration and incorporation into receiving societies, illuminating the ways in which they actively negotiate experiences of inclusion and exclusion. It then considers the contributions made by research on transnational families and emotional and symbolic transnationalism that aid our understanding of the cross-border connections of later generation young people. These contributions highlight the relevant roles that transnational family networks and their emotional circuits play in recreating attachments which may figure saliently in the senses of self of young children of migrants. Paying attention to the roles that emotional and symbolic transnational attachments play in the senses of identity and belonging of children of migrant descent can enrich conceptualizations of transnationalism and contribute to understandings of children\u2019s emotional and imaginative agency.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11285120, "first_name": "Rosa", "last_name": "Mas Giralt", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "RosaMasGiralt", "display_name": "Rosa Mas Giralt", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/RosaMasGiralt?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11285120/3312101/3897833/s65_rosa.mas_giralt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 283427, "name": "Migrant Families", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Families?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 383595, "name": "Children and Young People", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Children_and_Young_People?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 23397223, "title": "\"Cara citt\u00e0, cara vita!\" Mitopoiesi dei luoghi in Adriano Guerrini.

increasingly interconnected, globalized, world a paradoxical preoccupation with \u2018belonging\u2019 draws scholarly attention. This concern with belonging has most dramatically come to the fore in post-Suharto Indonesia in the form of various communal conflicts. Less violent in character, the importance of \u2018belonging\u2019 is also voiced in the state-dependent Eastern Indonesian town of Kupang as suspicions regarding informal favoring in local civil service. Informal preferencing in civil service is assumed to be based on ethnic favoring. Reflecting a popular social discourse for marking differences rather than a social reality, however, a focus on ethnicity is more obscuring than helpful in analyzing how informal favoring takes place. This article therefore aims to address the usefulness of ethnicity as an analytical concept. Drawing on several ethnographic examples this article argues that social capital -if necessary complemented with other forms of capital- instead of \u2018ethnicity\u2019 facilitates informal preferencing in Kupang\u2019 s service.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40846063, "asset_id": 19789100, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40332219, "first_name": "Sylvia", "last_name": "Tidey", "domain_name": "fieldguides", "page_name": "SylviaTidey", "display_name": "Sylvia Tidey", "profile_url": "https://fieldguides.academia.edu/SylviaTidey?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40332219/11019339/14600653/s65_sylvia.tidey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24748, "name": "Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27879, "name": "Racial and ethnic discrimination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Racial_and_ethnic_discrimination?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 78388, "name": "Bureaucracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bureaucracy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 82489, "name": "State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 100694, "name": "Civil Service", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Civil_Service?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 19775936, "title": "Daphna Oyserman, Daniel Brickman, Deborah Bybee, Aaron Celious", "created_at": "2015-12-21T19:00:57.181-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19775936/Daphna_Oyserman_Daniel_Brickman_Deborah_Bybee_Aaron_Celious?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_19775936", "summary": "Minority boys are at risk of academic disengagement.

The question of where and what constitutes \u2018home\u2019 for migrants is central to understanding processes of integration, sustained transnational ties, and return considerations, because reflections about \u2018home\u2019 are reflective of belonging. Based on analysis of migrants\u2019 and descendants reflections about the possibility of return migration, this paper asks: how is \u2018home\u2019 located in the transnational social field, and in which ways do the mutually overlapping spatial, temporal, emotional and rational dimensions of home matter? The paper draws on semi-structured interviews and focus groups with a total of 75 migrants and descendants from Pakistan and Poland living in Norway. Data from the two migrant groups with distinct migration histories are combined. Perhaps surprisingly, more similarities than differences are found between the two groups, with regard to their reflections about belonging. Considerations about return are found to be revealing of changing perspectives on home. For many there is an inherent ambivalence, reflected in home being located here, or there, or both, or neither. However, both migrants\u2019 and descendants exert agency in their own ways of locating \u2018home\u2019 and managing the spatial, temporal, emotional and rational dimensions involved.",

"work_12327935", "summary": "Sensing Nature; Knowing Nature is a programme I have been conducting in Aruvacode, Nilambur, Kerala for the past ten years or so (from 2003). Each and every time, during the programme, the children have proved the fact over and over again that they are born geniuses and just need to be left alone to make sense of the world. (See the link http://naturallearning.blogspot.in). Making sense of the world is both an inward and an outward process and senses are our doorways to both the outer and the inner worlds. When our senses ,which are our tools for knowing, get developed and sensitized these worlds reveal their secrets. \nWe are all born with a sense/meaning making instinct. This urge in us drives us to engage with the world. \u2018Meaning making\u2019 is an act of situating ourselves in the world, to know what the world offers us, to be, to live in the world.\nThe process of making sense of the world is a natural one and involves a concrete engagement with the environment which is the field in which one lives. Everything one sees / feels/ hears  \u2013 ones own body , the people around  ; plants, animals, insects, water, earth etc. are all subjects of observation, connection and engagement. From this concrete engagement one observes, abstracts and draws conclusions, asks more questions, creates more doubts- there is a dedicate balance between certainty and doubt, a constant crossing over between the unknown and the known. This \u2018known\u2019 is never \u2018certain\u2019. There is constant flux. This process can only happen authentically, independently and individually. In this act the child learn to be patient, unafraid, to plan, to make, to abstract, to explore, to innovate, to make connections, to take risks, to take responsibility for one self and even to be self disciplined.

The aim of this study is to identify and critically review the evidence on school-based interventions that increase a sense of school belonging in adolescents. Seven electronic databases and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1999 to February 2021 using \u2018school belonging\u2019 and \u2018intervention\u2019 amongst the key search terms. A total of 22 controlled trials were identified with 14 studies reporting effective school-based interventions for enhancing a sense of adolescent school belonging. Successful interventions targeted students\u2019 strengths and promoted positive interactions between students and between school staff and students. Overall, this review found a paucity of interventions that intentionally aimed to develop adolescent school belonging. Inconsistencies in terminology use and definitions describing school belonging were identified even when similar measurement tools were utilised.

Using 103 sixth-primary school graders, in a pretest-posttest design, results showed that relatedness among students improved when students were given chances to play context-specific games. Following these results, teachers and other educational practitioners are recommended to allow school-children to play African-based games together with those innovated outside Africa.

Based on the Programme for International Student Assessment\u2019s most recent edition, Portugal\u2019s database of 7,325 15-year-old students was analysed. We selected 438 immigrant cases with two objectives: (1) to evaluate the impact of the length of exposure in the host country on three dependent variables of school adjustment: sense of belonging, perceived loneliness and attitudes towards school (expectations of educational and professional opportunities); (2) to evaluate the differences in results for the same dependent variables, but considering the first and second generation of immigrants in Portugal. For the data analysis, sampling weights and plausible values were analysed with the International Database Analyzer. The results show that students who have been in the country for a year or less have greater difficulties and increased significant differences compared to other migrant groups in the referred indices of self-concept and inclusion. However, other groups, especially those with periods of long-term residence between four and five years, also face substantial levels of school maladjustment.\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 77165616, "asset_id": 65669749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48437335, "first_name": "CEPS", "last_name": "Journal", "domain_name": "uni-lj", "page_name": "CEPSJournal", "display_name": "CEPS  Journal", "profile_url": "https://uni-lj.academia.edu/CEPSJournal?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48437335/19742431/26795729/s65_ceps.journal.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 45610, "name": "Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Programme_for_International_Students_Assessment_PISA_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 54318, "name": "Immigrants", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrants?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69256, "name": "Generations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generations?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 321147, "name": "Self Concept", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_Concept?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2026765, "name": "School Adjustment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Adjustment?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2450926, "name": "Length of Residence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Length_of_Residence?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 63302019, "title": "Romov\u00e9 jako m\u00edstn\u00ed obyvatel\u00e9?

Belonging, Gypsyness, and the Politics of Space in an eastern Slovak village abstract: Based on long-term ethnographic research in one eastern Slovak village, this paper explores the complex issue of the role of place in the (self-) identification of Roma. Applying both a diachronic and a synchronic perspective, the author focuses on the mechanisms of the territorialisation of the Roma that led to the preservation of the historical continuity of the Romani settlement and to its territorial stigmatisation. He shows how local identification and position in the residential structure of the village studied here translated into a more enduring differentiation among Roma themselves. The author argues that crucial to understanding this process is the racialised category of 'Gypsyness', through which the Roma were singled out as 'less local'. 'Gypsyness' was also strongly associated with the space of the settlement and at the same time served as a generally accepted reason for its very existence. By setting up their own strategy of social mobility and striving to achieve fullfledged local belonging, the Roma, to a large extent, subscribed to the dominant logic of 'Gypsyness' and thus reproduced it, but they also transformed some of its characteristics, integrating it into their own understanding of their sociability in an environment of historically rooted non-Romani dominance.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75776845, "asset_id": 63302019, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14025313, "first_name": "Jan", "last_name": "Ort", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JanOrt", "display_name": "Jan Ort", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JanOrt?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14025313/4862245/5593958/s65_jan.ort.jpg_oh_95565f6d9a7c65ba5f6e2196bbf533a8_oe_54b5df27___gda___1421561195_00716196e15722e9a18a31d51c49de4f"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11866, "name": "Romani Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Romani_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45426, "name": "Central and Eastern Europe", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Central_and_Eastern_Europe?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53547, "name": "Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 62485084, "title": "The Marrow of Longing", "created_at": "2021-11-26T09:29:52.813-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62485084/The_Marrow_of_Longing?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_62485084", "summary": "The Marrow of Longing, Celeste Nazeli Snowber\u2019s deeply personal and interpersonal third book of poetry, traces the inherited trauma of the Armenian genocide, lessons learned in kitchen conversations, fragmented memories of grandparents, parents\u2019 love letters, prayers in the night, and bodily yearnings. \u201cFragments can hold a world,\u201d she says.

I argue that these feelings are not a matter of a cognitive failure but rather an expression of the absence of a more pervasive background feeling of belonging. Contemporary accounts of we-intentionality promise but ultimately fall short in explaining this sense of belonging. Gerda Walther offers an alternative account of communal experiences. Her notion of \"habitual unification\" can explain the background feelings of belonging that are woven through the individual's everyday experience of being in a shared world. Having unified with another person, the world feels different. It is now experienced in light of a \"we.\" This is not only the case in actual, singular person-toperson encounters. Unification with others becomes habitual: it retreats into the background of the individual's awareness, colouring their experience of the world. Thus sedimented, it forms a background sense of belonging to a shared world. Unification is enabled by experiencing others as being similar in a significant way, such as having the same experiences, values, or basic attitude: in Walther's words, as being a \"human, who also\u2026.\" This, I shall argue, is impacted through traumatizing experiences. Trauma survivors struggle to experience others as \"humans, who also\u2026,\" resulting in a failure of unification and thus impeding feelings of belonging. Trauma testimonies also suggest that actively seeking out recognition of similarities and shared aspects of experience may once again enable experiencing others as \"humans, who also\u2026,\" thus enabling unification and re-establishing a sense of belonging.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 69143347, "asset_id": 51403638, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7387213, "first_name": "Lillian", "last_name": "Wilde", "domain_name": "iubh", "page_name": "LillianWilde", "display_name": "Lillian Wilde", "profile_url": "https://iubh.academia.edu/LillianWilde?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7387213/3606718/38483748/s65_lillian.wilde.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6106, "name": "Trauma Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Trauma_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27806, "name": "PTSD", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/PTSD?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41079, "name": "Alienation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alienation?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50926, "name": "Joint Action", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Joint_Action?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1167809, "name": "Gerda Walther", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gerda_Walther?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 49177961, "title": "Call for paper: Special Issue\" Pivoting Healthcare Education Online: Perspectives, Challenges, and Prospects\"", "created_at": "2021-06-08T19:05:38.959-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49177961/Call_for_paper_Special_Issue_Pivoting_Healthcare_Education_Online_Perspectives_Challenges_and_Prospects_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_49177961", "summary": "This Special Issue is seeking papers on perspectives and challenges in moving online during this time, and the opportunities it has created.

The family chest she had brought from Norway, in which she kept all the treasures, all the memories from the homeland, would become her shelter during a locust plague that ravages the settlement. Torn by remorse for having left her country and parents, Beret seeks refuge from the wrath of God, hiding with her children in the very object that was so dear to her, her sole remembrance of an intangible past.

The analysis is based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Spain and Cuba. By focusing on disjunctures between the aspirations and positionings of returnees, and the way in which they are perceived and treated by their fellow nationals in Cuba, I show how identifications and belongings are played out, negotiated, and reframed in these return visits. The experience and assessment of relations with family, friends, and the country more generally leads migrants to rethink the parameters of their \u201cbeing Cuban\u201d and their place in Cuba.

Chile is especially interesting in this context, as Sweden accepted the largest number of Chilean political refugees in Europe after the 1973 military coup. The article argues that the work of Swedish hip-hop artists who actively address a Chilean background through their work can be read as narratives of belonging in a number of different ways. This specific negotiation of a Chilean identity becomes intelligible as a narrative of belonging in Sweden against the background of othering and segregation processes, and a form of multiculturalism that affirms both difference and equality. It creates belonging as a reaction to othering processes that are visible in both the persisting segregation in housing and labour markets along ethnic and racial lines, as well as the election of the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing, anti-immigration party into the Swedish national parliament in 2010, 2014, and most recently in 2018. It also creates belonging in the context of a multiculturalism debate that stresses difference as desirable, that is, as a means of inclusion into mainstream society. The article argues that, if being different means being part of a group, individuals will set out to define their specific difference, in this case by creating narratives of belonging that connect them to a specific (idealized) version of a Swedish past, in order to define their membership within that group.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62074211, "asset_id": 41951126, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 856490, "first_name": "Susan", "last_name": "Lindholm", "domain_name": "su-se", "page_name": "SusanLindholm", "display_name": "Susan Lindholm", "profile_url": "https://su-se.academia.edu/SusanLindholm?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/856490/934109/1169731/s65_susan.lindholm.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34139, "name": "Hip-Hop Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hip-Hop_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39869, "name": "Refugees", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Refugees?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44814, "name": "Sweden", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sweden?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 40858921, "title": "MODALILAR SEMT\u0130NE NE KADAR BA\u011eLI?", "created_at": "2019-11-06T06:42:01.575-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40858921/MODALILAR_SEMT%C4%B0NE_NE_KADAR_BA%C4%9ELI?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_40858921", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 550677, "first_name": "Aylin", "last_name": "Senturk (PhD)", "domain_name": "istanbultek", "page_name": "AylinSenturk", "display_name": "Aylin Senturk (PhD)", "profile_url": "https://istanbultek.academia.edu/AylinSenturk?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/550677/198445/4159726/s65_aylin.senturk.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 39709193, "title": "Immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia: A Sense of Belonging and Acceptance in the New Social Environment", "created_at": "2019-06-27T06:36:48.623-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39709193/Immigrants_from_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_in_Croatia_A_Sense_of_Belonging_and_Acceptance_in_the_New_Social_Environment?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_39709193", "summary": "According to the 2011 census, among the 584,947 people born abroad who live in Croatia\n70 per cent were born in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H).

Through the Yatra Ratha Festival, Hare Krishna devotees and Hindu immigrants together appropriate the public space to express themselves in the city where they live. I propose to discuss the role of performance in the public space as an expressive practice that provides moments of union between a diverse group of immigrants living in Lisbon who, despite having similar religious practices associated with Hinduism, belong to different religious groups and countries of origin. I argue that through the Ratha Yatra, participatory performance in the form of collective mantras, singing and dancing, becomes fundamental to creating a sense of belonging to the city of Lisbon.\n\nDownload article here: http://unipub.uni-graz.at/mcsj/periodical/titleinfo/3497119", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 249074, "first_name": "Debora", "last_name": "Baldelli", "domain_name": "fcsh", "page_name": "DeboraBaldelli", "display_name": "Debora Baldelli", "profile_url": "https://fcsh.academia.edu/DeboraBaldelli?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/249074/53693/23713383/s65_debora.baldelli.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16472, "name": "Transnational migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnational_migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19046, "name": "Migration (Anthropology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Anthropology_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33481, "name": "Social Mobility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Mobility?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 181201, "name": "Art in public space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art_in_public_space?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 619396, "name": "Anthropology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Religion?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1661398, "name": "Hare Krishnas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hare_Krishnas?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1799040, "name": "Movimento Hare Krishna", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Movimento_Hare_Krishna?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 38345459, "title": "A descriptive study of race and gender differences in how instructional style and perceived professor care influence decisions to major in STEM", "created_at": "2019-02-13T07:56:17.945-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38345459/A_descriptive_study_of_race_and_gender_differences_in_how_instructional_style_and_perceived_professor_care_influence_decisions_to_major_in_STEM?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_38345459", "summary": "Background: Women and students of color are widely underrepresented in the majority of STEM fields. In order to investigate this underrepresentation, we interviewed over 200 male and female college seniors, primarily women\nand people of color, who either majored in STEM or started but dropped a STEM major. Here, we focus on one section of the longer interview that focused on students\u2019 perceptions of professor care as well as perceived and\npreferred instruction style. Additionally, we look at correlations between professor care, course interactivity, and sense of belonging. In our analysis, we examine student responses through the lens of gender, race, and their\nintersections.\n\nResults: We found that white women perceived their STEM professors cared about them and their learning the most while women of color reported the least perceived care. Notably, men, regardless of race, reported similar\nperceptions of professor care. We found that students commonly report their STEM courses were lecture-based but say they would prefer more active approaches. In particular, we found that women who left STEM majors\nreported more lecture-based instruction while stating the highest preference for active learning environments. We found that perceiving their professors cared was related to a greater sense of belonging in STEM. Additionally, we\nfound that students who reported active classrooms also reported more professor care in their STEM field.\n\nConclusions: Our findings indicate that active teaching environments may positively impact students\u2019 sense of belonging and desire to continue in STEM and that this impact may be higher for underrepresented students.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58397400, "asset_id": 38345459, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88223424, "first_name": "Katherine", "last_name": "Rainey", "domain_name": "colorado", "page_name": "KatherineRainey", "display_name": "Katherine Rainey", "profile_url": "https://colorado.academia.edu/KatherineRainey?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88223424/26954067/25401705/s65_katherine.rainey.jpg"}, {"id": 88322207, "first_name": "Roslyn", "last_name": "Mickelson", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "RoslynMickelson", "display_name": "Roslyn Mickelson", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/RoslynMickelson?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 102504423, "first_name": "Stephanie", "last_name": "Moller", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "StephanieMoller2", "display_name": "Stephanie Moller", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/StephanieMoller2?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7024, "name": "Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 21498, "name": "Affect/Emotion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Affect_Emotion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 24294, "name": "Gender and Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Race?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28493, "name": "STEM Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/STEM_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 50118, "name": "Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representation?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 101071, "name": "Interactivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interactivity?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 38158407, "title": "Language, Locality, and Transnational Belonging: Remitting the Everyday Practice of Cultural Integration", "created_at": "2019-01-15T11:47:20.802-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38158407/Language_Locality_and_Transnational_Belonging_Remitting_the_Everyday_Practice_of_Cultural_Integration?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_38158407", "summary": "This article explores how \u2018ordinary\u2019 German migrants in the United States reflected upon their local integration and transnational belonging with reference to their language practice in the period 1820\u20131970. The analysis is based on approximately 8,000 letters sent by around 700 German-speaking migrants who wrote, over varying time periods, to family members and friends still living in their places of origin. These letters provide insights into the migrants\u2019 transnational communication networks over an extended time and from across the United States. Until the emergence of a fully centralised bureaucracy during the interwar period, most legislation affecting the living conditions of migrants varied significantly between US states. This raises the question whether the practices and narratives of belonging captured in the personal letters vary accordingly across locations, especially with regard to the balance between local and transnational belonging. Tracing this variation in sub-national destination characteristics, we argue that feelings of transnational belonging are not directly responsive to shifts in political conditions and resulting policies but rather pragmatic adaptations tailored to a particular local context. The maintenance of the German language or German community ties expressed in the letters also conveys an everyday practice of resistance or adaptation to local language policies in the US and remits concrete ideas about what it means to uphold a German identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58225499, "asset_id": 38158407, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2131130, "first_name": "F\u00e9lix", "last_name": "Krawatzek", "domain_name": "oxford", "page_name": "FelixKrawatzek", "display_name": "F\u00e9lix Krawatzek", "profile_url": "https://oxford.academia.edu/FelixKrawatzek?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2131130/691322/6929860/s65_f_lix.krawatzek.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4131, "name": "Transatlantic History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transatlantic_History?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11203, "name": "International Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 83861, "name": "Letters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Letters?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 99915, "name": "Integration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Integration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37820671, "title": "Placed on the side-line: maintaining and contesting local \u2018inkommers\u2019 peripheries in an endocentric \u2018boorling\u2019 place", "created_at": "2018-11-21T04:52:21.828-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37820671/Placed_on_the_side_line_maintaining_and_contesting_local_inkommers_peripheries_in_an_endocentric_boorling_place?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37820671", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 140289, "first_name": "Yolandi", "last_name": "Ribbens-Klein", "domain_name": "uct", "page_name": "YolandiRibbensKlein", "display_name": "Yolandi Ribbens-Klein", "profile_url": "https://uct.academia.edu/YolandiRibbensKlein?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/140289/86214/20738472/s65_yolandi.ribbens-klein.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2433, "name": "Place and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 37720460, "title": "\u2018When entertaining isn\u2019t enough\u2019: Fan motivation and word of mouth spreading of fan interests", "created_at": "2018-11-07T08:40:22.045-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37720460/_When_entertaining_isn_t_enough_Fan_motivation_and_word_of_mouth_spreading_of_fan_interests?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_37720460", "summary": "The motivational factors driving fanship and their relationship to the promotion of one's fandom were assessed in two cross-sectional survey studies of American undergraduate students (Study 1, n = 354, Study 2, n = 896).

In contrast, the entertainment value of one's fan interest was not associated with the likelihood of promoting fan activity via word of mouth.

Drawing on social identity theory and positive psychology, this study investigated women\u2019s responses to the social environment of physics classrooms. It also investigated STEM identity and gender disparities on academic achievement and flourishing in an undergraduate introductory physics course for STEM majors. 160 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory physics course were administered a baseline survey with self-report measures on course belonging, physics identification, flourishing, and demographics at the beginning of the course and a post-survey at the end of the academic term. Students also completed force concept inventories and physics course grades were obtained from the registrar. \nResults. Women reported less course belonging and less physics identification than men. Physics identification and grades evidenced a longitudinal bidirectional relationship for all students (regardless of gender) such that when controlling for baseline physics knowledge: (a) students with higher physics identification were more likely to earn higher grades; and (b) students with higher grades evidenced more physics identification at the end of the term. Men scored higher on the force concept inventory than women, although no gender disparities emerged for course grades. For women, higher physics (versus lower) identification was associated with more positive changes in flourishing over the course of the term. High-identifying men showed the opposite pattern: negative change in flourishing was more strongly associated with high identifiers than low identifiers. \nConclusions. Overall, this study underlines gender disparities in physics both in terms of belonging and physics knowledge. It suggests that strong STEM identity may be associated with academic performance and flourishing in undergraduate physics courses at the end of the term, particularly for women.

Currently nortecaucanos demonstrate a temporal coexistence of diverse modes of subsistence and a complex range of residential strategies between neighboring municipalities and urban centers nearby. Most combine small family farming and gold mining, with intermittent involvements in economies based on urban services, industrial manufacturing, commercial cattle farming, and cash crop agriculture. This dissertation is an ethnographic and historiographic exploration of the ground and outcome of livelihood struggles and affective engagements with such landscapes of extraction and histories of exploitation. A central point of this dissertation is how these racialized experiences and labor regimes have interacted with forms of belonging shaping each other in uneven and paradoxical ways.

This chapter shows how a tradition such as a Walking Day can create shared social memories, which in turn helps to create a shared sense of belonging in a particular place \u2013 what might be called a community. Beginning with a short history of the tradition, the discussion then moves on to examine the different aspects that go to make up a Walking Day: people, places, weather, music, dress, memory.

The impact of residential status, namely that of becoming a landlord, owner-occupier or tenant, is generally discussed in the literature in terms of these groups relationships with each other and the organisation of their daily life in terms of its similarities and differences. However, there has been little research to analyse the above aspects in terms of the role of social media. Existing studies have not adequately addressed the issue of the differences between different tenure groups in terms of the impact of social media. This new area requires further attention in order to re-evaluate existing studies from an online communication perspective. How does online involvement vary with residential status? This project sheds new light on the neglected issue of social media in the creation of place and belonging in a specific area, as related to residential status. In addition, when comparing this research with the existing literature, it is clear that differences in personal interests, preferences, age and generation also influence online involvement. In this project, the author considers Ocean Village in Southampton as an example of a redeveloping waterfront area in order to demonstrate the differences between owner-occupiers, tenants and landlords in terms of the function of social media to achieve creation of their place and belonging. .", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56078873, "asset_id": 36179325, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5530991, "first_name": "Yahya", "last_name": "AYDIN", "domain_name": "aybu", "page_name": "YahyaAYDIN", "display_name": "Yahya AYDIN", "profile_url": "https://aybu.academia.edu/YahyaAYDIN?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5530991/10646878/32570467/s65_yahya.aydin.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 277, "name": "Urban Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9246, "name": "Social Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Media?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12420, "name": "Neoliberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Neoliberalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 17656, "name": "Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28131, "name": "Urban Waterfronts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Waterfronts?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 30947, "name": "The Internet", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Internet?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 296333, "name": "Place Making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Making?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 501009, "name": "Community participation and engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_participation_and_engagement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 572021, "name": "Waterfront Regeneration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Waterfront_Regeneration?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1019275, "name": "Belonging and Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Belonging_and_Citizenship?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 34277298, "title": "Nixon, T. 2005: \"Foundations of a World City - London's historic environment and its future\" in 'London's Environment, Prospects for a Sustainable World City', J Hunt (ed), 350pp", "created_at": "2017-08-19T12:52:41.530-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34277298/Nixon_T_2005_Foundations_of_a_World_City_Londons_historic_environment_and_its_future_in_Londons_Environment_Prospects_for_a_Sustainable_World_City_J_Hunt_ed_350pp?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_34277298", "summary": "Chapter contributed to the volume on major developments that have greatly affected London's environment, showing how policies and practical developments interact, toward setting London on a more sustainable course for the future.

This article argues that out of the long relationship between EU cultural politics and the domain of tangible heritage, there has grown a parallel approach to European belonging. By tracing acts of Europe-making in political statements used to justify financial support, and discussing their effect on co-funded archaeological projects, a Janus-face is identified. One side places authority in the past, articulating a European commonality through site characteristics or time periods. The other places authority in the present, promoting a more flexible understanding of heritage. Since the EU has increasingly (and unwillingly) come to share the rhetorical figure of \u2018European heritage\u2019 with anti-immigration groups calling for solidarity among \u2018native Europeans\u2019, the question of which side takes precedence is of great consequence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61591529, "asset_id": 33490429, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 525123, "first_name": "Elisabeth", "last_name": "Niklasson", "domain_name": "aberdeen", "page_name": "ElisabethNiklasson", "display_name": "Elisabeth Niklasson", "profile_url": "https://aberdeen.academia.edu/ElisabethNiklasson?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/525123/185650/17258554/s65_elisabeth.niklasson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 392, "name": "Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5346, "name": "Archaeological Method & Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeological_Method_and_Theory?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 27137, "name": "European Union Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/European_Union_Politics?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30639, "name": "Archaeology and politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Archaeology_and_politics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 43212, "name": "Politics of the Past in Present", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politics_of_the_Past_in_Present?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 380460, "name": "EU Cultural Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/EU_Cultural_Policy?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 33432316, "title": "Population Genetics and Belonging: A Cultural Analysis of Genetic Ancestry (Palgrave Macmillan 2017)", "created_at": "2017-06-13T00:51:47.457-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/33432316/Population_Genetics_and_Belonging_A_Cultural_Analysis_of_Genetic_Ancestry_Palgrave_Macmillan_2017_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_33432316", "summary": "This book explores how human population genetics has emerged as a means of imagining and enacting belonging in contemporary society.

The paper contributes to existing theory by examining the influence that time has on a woman solo diner's 'single' participation unit, her ability to lay claim to public space and her relationship with the surrounding social environment. The paper concludes by exploring what the new trend of solo dining can offer and the consequences this has for how sociologists conceptualise sociality in public spaces.", "downloadable_attachments":

important role in academic achievement, but there is a group of students beating the odds and becoming successful despite the socioeconomic background of their families. Purpose of the Study: The study aimed to define how resilient students succeed at school despite their socioeconomically disadvantaged background and examine the relationship between academic achievement and other factors related to school. Method: Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to answer the research questions. The rate of resilient students in Turkey has been analyzed among 15-year-olds taking the PISA 2012 assessment. According to PISA 2012 Mathematics performance, Turkey had 322 resilient students. Of these, 46.9% were female and 53.1% were male. Findings: According to the PISA 2012 mathematics performance, 7% of students in Turkey are considered resilient. Findings indicate that almost all resilient students score 482 and higher. This means that there are no resilient students performing below baseline (level 2) in Turkey. One of the other findings was that resilient students feel connected to school and have positive feelings towards school. Self-belief in achievement, being happy with achievement, greater engagement in academic activities, social skills, feeling a sense of belonging to school, and positive feelings towards school were the traits of the resilient students in Turkey. There is no correlation between resilient students' sense of belonging to school, attitudes towards school in terms of learning outcomes, and perceived success control, and their mathematics performance on the PISA 2012.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51489986, "asset_id": 31055943, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7576416, "first_name": "Leyla", "last_name": "YILMAZ FINDIK", "domain_name": "hacettepe", "page_name": "LeylaYILMAZFINDIK", "display_name": "Leyla YILMAZ FINDIK", "profile_url": "https://hacettepe.academia.edu/LeylaYILMAZFINDIK?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7576416/15472694/16087094/s65_leyla.yilmaz_findik.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3332, "name": "Resilience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resilience?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 91916, "name": "School", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 28642489, "title": "Fluidity and flexibility of ''belonging'': Uses of the concept in contemporary research", "created_at": "2016-09-21T06:34:23.133-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28642489/Fluidity_and_flexibility_of_belonging_Uses_of_the_concept_in_contemporary_research?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_28642489", "summary": "Studies framing ''belonging'' as a key focus and a central concept of research have increased significantly in the 2000s.

Jerusalem attracts more of these mainly religious immigrants than any other city in Israel. They are a desired population by the State of Israel, and for many reasons can be considered privileged immigrants. The way Diaspora Jews imagine Israel and Jerusalem plays a crucial role in their decision to move there. Many of these lifestyle/homecoming immigrants find their way to Baka, where they can live near other expatriates and enjoy the comforts of the ethnic enclave. The paper deals with the spatial and cultural implications that privileged lifestyle migration has on the space in which it settles. It focuses particularly on the case-study of English- and French-speaking Jewish immigrants who live in Baka and on their effects on the neighbourhood\u2019s gentrification process, its real estate

high degree of socio-cultural invisibility, i.e. lack of official recognition and limited cultural/ethnic organisation. It draws on a project conducted with 10 Latin American and Latino British families (totalling 30 adults and dependent children of 8\u201318 years of age) and 14 other informants and stakeholders in the Yorkshire and Greater Manchester regions. The paper analyses the senses of everyday belonging of the adult participants and the role that conditions of socio-cultural invisibility play in their experiences. Significant here are the lack of ethno-cultural local spaces and reluctance to embrace pan-ethnic identifications, which bring to the fore the relevance of other local social contexts and of transnational ties as sites of everyday belonging. It is argued that by paying attention to the emotions and emotional compromises that constitute migrants' senses of belonging, it is possible to develop nuanced insights into the diversity of ways in which migrants experience processes of incorporation and combine bonds to sending and receiving societies.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11285120, "first_name": "Rosa", "last_name": "Mas Giralt", "domain_name": "leeds", "page_name": "RosaMasGiralt", "display_name": "Rosa Mas Giralt", "profile_url": "https://leeds.academia.edu/RosaMasGiralt?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11285120/3312101/3897833/s65_rosa.mas_giralt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2319, "name": "Place Attachment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Place_Attachment?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34823, "name": "Latin American Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Migration?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 63057, "name": "Emotional Geographies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emotional_Geographies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 4242555, "title": "\u201cI love my house.

A century old, black & white clapboard farmhouse outside of Kingston, Ontario was where I called home. Having grown up and left it behind, I find I have developed a certain amount of nostalgia or homesickness regarding my mostly positive memories and recurring dreams that take place there. The house is not lost, in fact my parents still live there, and I return several times each year to retrace my childhood rituals, sleep in my old room, dream in my old bed, eat, play and reminisce in my old home. I can return to my home, but not my childhood, and yet the two seem inseparable. This space houses my dreams and memories of childhood; floorboards, doorknobs, and wallpaper are all triggers for recollection, the ornamentation of the home is a connective entity into my past. As my parents grow older, they are finding they don\u2019t want to be so isolated, alone in a house too big for just the two of them. The possibility of them selling the house looms heavily on my mind. I don\u2019t want to lose this special place. This is a study of the way in which an individual becomes bound to architecture, psychologically and physically, using the home to which I feel so connected as a guide. I\u2019ve grown apart from my house in the years since I moved out, and much of the connection has been broken. In place of this connection, at my return, there is a certain sense of the unfamiliar in this familiar space. How can I make this intangible connection both apparent and relevant to someone else?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32399972, "asset_id": 4242555, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14730, "first_name": "Tracey Eve", "last_name": "Winton", "domain_name": "uwaterloo", "page_name": "TraceyEveWinton", "display_name": "Tracey Eve Winton", "profile_url": "https://uwaterloo.academia.edu/TraceyEveWinton?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14730/4934/2967520/s65_tracey_eve.winton.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 268248, "name": "Traditional house", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Traditional_house?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 550010, "name": "Farmhouses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Farmhouses?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 888250, "name": "Imagination and Private Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Imagination_and_Private_Space?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 10089886, "title": "In/Out of Place", "created_at": "2015-01-09T10:02:34.176-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10089886/In_Out_of_Place?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_10089886", "summary": "An assignment analysing how being the sense of being in and out of place is highlighted in both Philip Sheldrake's article 'Human identity and the particularity of place' (2001) and David Turton's writing on the way a changing sense of place has influenced the Ethiopian Mursi tribe\u2019s worldview over the past 35 years.

However, it also plays a key role in the practice of religious violence. The paper addresses the relationship between felt belonging, which is established in shared religious experiences, and different expressions of religious hostility. By means of a phenomenological analysis based on the work of Bernhard Waldenfels, the author distinguishes between different modes of religious self-localization. On the one hand, the performative moments of religious practices are reconstructed, unfolding their effect even in regular and less intensive experiences. On the other hand, the intrinsically shared nature of religious assemblies becomes describable, which includes the co-actors in the process of religious self-constitution. Due to the existential and shared nature of this self-constitution, violent affects appear to be group-directed, which particularly encourages the self-sacrificial behavior that seems to distinguish religious violence. This methodological focus on performative communitarization keeps the study also interoperable with a variety of meaning-based theories, promoting phenomenology as a resourceful method for a philosophical division of labor.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88360253, "asset_id": 82759949, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 57916146, "first_name": "Georg", "last_name": "Harfensteller", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "GeorgHarfensteller", "display_name": "Georg Harfensteller", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/GeorgHarfensteller?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/57916146/15178537/56957052/s65_georg.harfensteller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5178, "name": "Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12824, "name": "Intersubjectivity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intersubjectivity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30906, "name": "Phenomenology of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phenomenology_of_Religion?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 40186, "name": "Social Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Phenomenology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52768, "name": "Bernhard Waldenfels", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bernhard_Waldenfels?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 582257, "name": "Hostility", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hostility?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 960598, "name": "Religious and Political Violence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_and_Political_Violence?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1222772, "name": "Religious and Magical Practices", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_and_Magical_Practices?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 82517244, "title": "Encountering authenticity in the \u2018contact zone\u2019?

The author argues that the students\u2019 narratives highlight the potential and possibilities for supporting Black male success through BMI-type programs.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 88186929, "asset_id": 82229802, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 202742665, "first_name": "Derrick", "last_name": "Brooms", "domain_name": "utk", "page_name": "DerrickBrooms", "display_name": "Derrick R Brooms", "profile_url": "https://utk.academia.edu/DerrickBrooms?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/202742665/84513032/73147443/s65_derrick.brooms.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2621, "name": "Higher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Higher_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7109, "name": "Student support", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_support?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7110, "name": "Student Engagement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Student_Engagement?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16605, "name": "Persistence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persistence?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 44006, "name": "Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 87981, "name": "Black Males", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Males?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 131644, "name": "Black Male Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Black_Male_Studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 436480, "name": "Education of Black Males", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_of_Black_Males?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 81857238, "title": "Relationships among parental alcoholism, sense of belonging, resilience and depressive symptoms in Korean people", "created_at": "2022-06-19T19:38:18.016-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81857238/Relationships_among_parental_alcoholism_sense_of_belonging_resilience_and_depressive_symptoms_in_Korean_people?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_81857238", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87755253, "asset_id": 81857238, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 141407621, "first_name": "Hyunhwa", "last_name": "Lee", "domain_name": "unlv", "page_name": "HyunhwaLee", "display_name": "Hyunhwa Lee", "profile_url": "https://unlv.academia.edu/HyunhwaLee?f_ri=76942", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 221, "name": "Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 226, "name": "Clinical Psychology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Clinical_Psychology?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 586, "name": "Health Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Health_Sciences?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 588, "name": "Nursing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nursing?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2827, "name": "Mental Health", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mental_Health?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 3332, "name": "Resilience", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resilience?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 703254, "name": "Adult Children of Alcoholics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Adult_Children_of_Alcoholics?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 706975, "name": "Depressive Symptoms", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Depressive_Symptoms?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1593911, "name": "Koreans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Koreans?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 81078761, "title": "Sense of Place and Belonging in Developing Culturally Appropriate Therapeutic Environments: A Review", "created_at": "2022-06-09T03:44:12.778-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81078761/Sense_of_Place_and_Belonging_in_Developing_Culturally_Appropriate_Therapeutic_Environments_A_Review?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_81078761", "summary": "The connection the M\u0101ori, the Indigenous people of Aotearoa-New Zealand, have to the land is threatened by the effects of colonisation, urbanisation and other factors. In particular, many M\u0101ori suffer significant health and wellbeing inequalities compared to the non-M\u0101ori population. In an effort to reduce such inequalities, there is a growing consciousness of the need to better understand the cultural and place-specific determinants that affect the health and wellbeing of population groups in different environments. This article explores how environmental and cultural connections to land enable the development of place-specific and culturally-driven principles that promote the health and wellbeing of M\u0101ori populations. It argues that concepts of place, belonging, landscape and wellbeing play an important role in linking environment and culture as well as in contributing to creating therapeutic spatial environments that promote both human health and ecosystems.

The story is about the protagonist, Elaine, revisiting her childhood memories, where she learned about friendship, longing and betrayal. Although she was being bullied by her own best friends, Elaine remained with them as she feared being alienated. Despite the many years spent outside Toronto and away from her sad childhood memories, Elaine still felt that her hometown was her real home. The notions of belongingness used in this analysis are aided by Abraham Maslow\u201fs Hierarchy of Needs and William Glasser\u201fs Choice Theory.

The article is based on an anthropological study of transnational professionals who are part of a diverse expatriate community in Amsterdam. The analysis shows how these professionals draw on cosmopolitanism to define themselves as \u2018non-nationals\u2019.

Generally, its application within higher education has been to discrete student cohorts, often based on ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status or first-year transitioning status (Hurtado & Carter, 1997; Strayhorn, Bie, Dorime-Williams, & Williams, 2016; Ribera, Miller & Dumford, 2017).

The study combines approaches to &amp;#39;place as location&amp;#39; (traditional dialectology and sociolinguistics) and &amp;#39;place as meaning&amp;#39; (ethnography and linguistic anthropology) to explore the relationship between geographical place, local social meanings and linguistic variation. Theoretically, I make use of the concept of indexicality, following Silverstein&amp;#39;s (2003) indexical orders and Eckert&amp;#39;s (2008) indexical fields. To date, there is no previous study that explores Afrikaans variation from these perspectives. The study therefore contributes to the development of Afrikaans linguistics. The participants are residents of Houtiniquadorp, which was a mission station in South Africa&amp;#39;s colonial era and declared a Coloured residential area during apartheid. In South Africa, place has been politicised due to colonialism and apartheid. I argue that the racialisation of places contributes to Houtiniquadorpers&amp;#39; sense of locality and belonging. The linguistic form I focus on is Afrikaans /r/. Afrikaans phonetics texts describe alveolar-r [r] as standard, and uvular-r ([\u0280] or [\u0281]; bry-r) as a non-standard, regional feature. In Houtiniquadorp, [\u0280] and [r] variants of the (r) variable are used. My data collection methods were semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork. The linguistic variants were quantified from the interview data and description tasks. The qualitative data analysis focused on the participants&amp;#39; narratives about places, lived experiences, and meta-linguistic commentary. I discuss three different sets of results, all of which investigate how people in Houtiniquadorp use Afrikaans /r/ to index locality, belonging, and other forms of social meanings, particularly in the context of social and geographic mobility. I analyse metalinguistic comments, the frequency use of rhotic variants, and the use of variants in interaction. Uvular-r forms part of many Houtiniquadorpers&amp;#39; repertoires, and the participants show varying degrees of awareness of the sound as locally, and socially, meaningful. The results show that while uvular-r is an emplaced sound (i.e. a regional stereotype or dialect feature), the sound has various other non-place meanings that index macro-social categories such as residential status, gender and age. By looking at participants who use both variants, I argue that they use variation to index meaningful moments during the interview interactions.

(100% FREMMED?) is an art project consisting of 250 life stories of individuals who were granted asylum in Denmark between 1956 and 2019. Thus, it can be said to form a collective portrait that inserts citizens of refugee backgrounds into the narrative of the nation, thereby expanding the idea of national identity and culture. 100% FOREIGN? allows us to think of participatory art as a privileged site for the exploration of intersubjective relations and the question of how to \u201crepresent\u201d citizens with refugee experience as well as the history and practice of asylum. The conflicting aims and perceptions involved in such representations are many, as suggested by the opening sentence of Hannah Arendt\u2019s 1943 essay \u201cWe, Refugees\u201d: \u201cIn the first place, we don\u2019t like to be called \u2018refugees\u2019\u201d.

In Thailand, self-nationalization is instigated by the governing agency through repeated, regular, mandatory, public performances of loyalty through which individuals create the nation collectively. These performances create automatic feelings to the nation, establishes national others as fearsome, and rule through the basic human need of belonging.

What is less well known is how very much these youngsters want to learn at school. Children and adolescents from violent backgrounds, like others, equate education with a hopeful future and are eager to attend. However, when they do go to school, the violence that they experience leaves them terrified to think. Instead they resort to concrete enactments that make completing school work nearly impossible. Attachment based research suggests that thinking about thinking is a neuropsychological capacity that is co-created with caregivers, parents and teachers. People with \u201creflective function\u201d \u201cmentalize,\u201d that is, they think about what they are thinking and what others might be thinking. This capacity is part of what is lost when caregivers and the surrounding community are replete with random violence. The fact that we know how mentalization is created implies that it may be possible to restore, by creating conditions in the classroom that can foster it.

Tinto's (2017) model of student motivation and persistence is reconceptualised to apply to the academic staff by considering their self-efficacy beliefs, sense of belonging and perceptions of career relevance on their motivation levels and adaption to a new environment. Design/methodology/approach-Utilising Tinto's (2017) reconceptualised model for academics, this study provides insights into motivation and capacity to adapt during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents observations and reflections from five academics from three universities across two countries in relation to self-efficacy, sense of belonging and perception of career relevance. Findings-The findings of this study state that self-efficacy beliefs, a sense of belonging and perceptions of career relevance combine to drive both academics' motivation levels and their ability to adapt to the changing landscape. Self-efficacy was influenced by factors such as struggles with adaptation to new online technologies and researching and teaching in a virtual environment. Academics' sense of belonging was found to be challenged in unprecedented ways because of physical isolation and sometimes unfavourable home working environments. Perceptions of career relevance were found to be challenged by adverse developments such as reduced promotional opportunities, cuts in resourcing and job insecurity. Originality/value-This paper makes three important contributions. First, Tinto's (2017) model of student motivation and persistence is extended to examine academic motivation, adaption and persistence.

However, remarkably, once settled in Morocco, many experience discontent with regard to a perceived \u201clack of true Islam\u201d in the country. To gain insight into the positions and experiences of these women, I look at how they create a sense of belonging through furnishing practices in the domestic space of their new homes. I am interested in how various senses of belonging are expressed and come together in relation to their construction of religious belonging and place, and are renegotiated through domestic decoration practices. Building on literature on home, transnational migration, conversion, and material religion, I demonstrate that mechanisms of distinction and notions of religious (im)perfection intersect in the organization of the domestic space. Based on ethnographic accounts, I argue that my interlocutors bring a \u201cculturalized\u201d West-European Islam to Morocco, with tastes and sensibilities that jostle uneasily against local Moroccan religious practices but also allows them to repair some of the privileges they lost upon their conversion in their homeland.

Drawing on interview data collected from 42 European Union nationals, namely Finnish and Polish migrants living in Scotland, we explore how European Union migrants' decision-making and strategies for extending their stay in the United Kingdom, or returning to their country of origin, are shaped by and, in turn, shape their belonging and ties to their current place of residence and across state borders. In particular, we draw on the concept of embedding, which is used in migration studies to explain migration trajectories and decision-making. Our key argument is that more attention needs to be paid to the socio-political context within which migrants negotiate their embedding.

In particular, many M\u0101ori suffer significant health and wellbeing inequalities compared to the non-M\u0101ori population. In an effort to reduce such inequalities, there is a growing consciousness of the need to better understand the cultural and place-specific determinants that affect the health and wellbeing of population groups in different environments. This article explores how environmental and cultural connections to land enable the development of place-specific and culturally-driven principles that promote the health and wellbeing of M\u0101ori populations. It argues that concepts of place, belonging, landscape and wellbeing play an important role in linking environment and culture as well as in contributing to creating therapeutic spatial environments that promote both human health and ecosystems. A set of principles is developed that allows for the landscape design of such therapeutic environments while accommodating the socio-cultural and environmental values that promote health and wellbeing of both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori people.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64845137, "asset_id": 44428369, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2255483, "first_name": "Bruno", "last_name": "Marques", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "BrunoMarques", "display_name": "Bruno Marques", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/BrunoMarques?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2255483/718686/70033390/s65_bruno.marques.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3116, "name": "Space and Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Space_and_Place?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3183, "name": "Landscape Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Landscape_Architecture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8331, "name": "Indigenous Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Knowledge?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 12200, "name": "Sense of Place", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Place?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 22466, "name": "Therapeutic Landscapes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Therapeutic_Landscapes?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 44295268, "title": "Post Essentialist Belonging in Portuguese: Herberto Helder (1930-2015)", "created_at": "2020-10-14T05:34:56.421-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44295268/Post_Essentialist_Belonging_in_Portuguese_Herberto_Helder_1930_2015_?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_44295268", "summary": "This article offers some reflections on a post-essentialist understanding of belonging for analysing literary texts.

Based on multi-sited fieldwork, this article examines the return journeys to Lesuai, an ancestral settlement in the remote central southern highlands of Timor-Leste, which was abandoned during the Indonesian invasion and restored in the later years of occupation. Lesuai community believes the spirit realm exerts an overwhelming influence over their general well-being, compelling \u2018house\u2019 members to renew their connection with knua to maintain family ties and benefit from ancestral protection. Closer ethnographic attention reveals how the motivations, experiences and understandings of \u2018return\u2019 to origin places are highly personal, gendered and generational. Broadly, these return mobilities demonstrate the agency, adaptability and resilience of conflict-affected populations.

Drawing on qualitative field research (participant observation, interviews and photography), the book discusses examples from six international resort destinations spread across four continents: the Gold Coast, Australia; Phuket and Koh Phangan, Thailand; Canc\u00fan, Mexico; Miami, USA; and Ibiza, Spain.\n\nThe book reviews the material and symbolic production of lived spaces in these resorts, considering the mutually constitutive, mutually transformative relations between their spatial formations, built environments, popular imaginaries, representations, narratives of identity, rhythms, and the experiences and practices of both tourists and locals. In doing so, it argues for more nuanced ways of conceptualising tourism, globalisation and spatiality, reimagining how these phenomena unfold in lived spaces.\n\nTaking a cultural studies approach to urban analysis, the book demonstrates the value in embracing complexity, fluidity, partiality and uncertainty. It will be of interest to students and researchers of tourism, geography, cultural studies, development studies, anthropology and sociology.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3244776, "first_name": "Zelmarie", "last_name": "Cantillon", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "ZelmarieCantillon", "display_name": "Zelmarie Cantillon", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/ZelmarieCantillon?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3244776/1074042/28743146/s65_zelmarie.cantillon.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 263, "name": "Cultural Geography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Geography?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 909, "name": "Tourism Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tourism_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7860, "name": "Cultural Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Tourism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16967, "name": "Spatiality (Cultural geography)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Spatiality_Cultural_geography_?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 19915, "name": "Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gilles_Deleuze_and_Felix_Guattari?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 24136, "name": "Henri Lefebvre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Henri_Lefebvre?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 34269, "name": "Urban Imaginary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Imaginary?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 54082, "name": "Resort", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Resort?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 74237, "name": "Cultural Heritage and Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage_and_Tourism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 143637, "name": "Right to the city", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Right_to_the_city?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 183924, "name": "Mass Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mass_Tourism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 204366, "name": "Urban cultural studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_cultural_studies?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 215860, "name": "Doreen Massey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Doreen_Massey?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 37160757, "title": "War and Photography.

As a result, these studies suggest that British converts to Islam are conceived as \u2018bridge builders\u2019 or as existing in \u2018liminal\u2019 space. Yet these frameworks leave converts out-of-place and positioned as double strange. Drawing on narrative interviews with British converts to Islam this paper argues that such conceptions do very little to understand their experiences as Muslims and as British, instead confining them to the existing terms of the debates, and as such leaves them in something of a conceptual wilderness. Taking Simmel\u2019s Stranger as a starting point, I argue that converts, who both explicitly and implicitly draw a line between \u2018religion\u2019 and \u2018culture\u2019 with regard to Islam and Muslims, offer a challenge and different perspective on what these terms can mean in Britain today and thereby contribute to these discussions. This divide is contentious, complex, and problematic.  Nevertheless, by taking the culture-religion divide as a prism through which to explore ideas and aspects of identity and belonging, moves can be made towards viewing converts in-place. The divide suggests the need to put the religious at the centre and it is in this way that varying horizons of ways of being can be brought into conversation. In this paper I trace the various lines of this religion-culture divide to explore how British converts to Islam do and do not relate to Islam, Muslim communities and wider society. This involves consideration of the dynamic interplay between the personal and the social, as well as, importantly, the Divine.

First, it provides a brief overview of historical developments and respective cultural policies leading up to such mass-scale objectification of royalty in each empire. In the process, it introduces a novel theoretical framework, based on the concept of modern ruler visibility, conveyed via the annual secular public ruler celebrations (royal birthday, accession day, etc.). Second, drawing on a large body of archival and printed evidence from the two empires, the paper analyzes the drivers and dynamics of desirability of 'ruler objects' and the linkages between the respective non-market and market channels of distribution. In this vein, it identifies two shifts in dissemination and socialization over time: a) from elite members to commoners, and b) from the public to the private sphere. For example, the appeal of status symbols, such as medals and orders, which form the bulk of early 'ruler objects', meant for elite socialization only, grew exponentially over time as did their royal bestowal thereby extending the realm of symbolic cooptation of the populace. At the same time, the increasingly ceremonious decoration of new public buildings with 'royal objects' at their inauguration elicited a more intense competition between private companies for the right to do the same (via advertisement boards, store front logos, endorsements, etc.). Both trends originated in the above-mentioned festivities and served as vehicles for subject loyalty and monarchic patriotism. In addition, the paper sheds light on empire-specific trends, such as the Ottoman shift away from ruler visibility in the 1880s and 1890s, under Sultan Abd\u00fclhamid II, which led to a split in royal objectification: a) away from portraits, towards \" Long Live the Sultan \" banners for Muslims and b) unchanged for domestic non-Muslims. Thus, faith also became a determinant of consumer culture. Finally, this paper demonstrates the limits of royal objectification by reviewing actual cases of monarchic hyper-sensitivity and censorship on the consumption of royal images (in pubs, brothels, etc.) despite their owners' best intentions in order to avoid disrepute or trivialization. In short, the paper addresses some key intersections between changing notions of monarchic sovereignty and legitimacy, on the one hand, and nascent consumer trends and popular belonging, on the other.\n\n\u201cHistory of Consumer Culture: Objects, Desire and Sociability\u201d Conference\n\n23-25 March 2017, Gakushuin University, Tokyo, JAPAN\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54333883,

"dom_id": "work_31873987", "summary": "By the end of the 18th- and the beginning of the 19th-Century, some painters of two somewhat antagonist groups of artists based in Dresden and in Rome, embraced the so-called wandering motif and rediscovered the importance of walking about in shaping the perception of landscape, but in doing so, they also found themselves constructing their own cultural identity. By this time, wandering was not only a cultural symbol, but also an actual praxis among many artists and artisans, out of economic and aesthetical reasons.\nFor the artist colony in Rome, wandering received a public collective dimension: not only they worked, lived close by or even in the same house together, they also walked about and experienced nature together, and put these experiences in text and images, and in the process, they rediscovered pieces of their own fatherland within foreign landscapes. The artists based in Dresden, on the other hand, and despite the increasing popularity of Mediterranean landscapes, exploring the different regions of the fatherland became a means to retrieve from nature, mostly through a solitary confrontation, the necessary elements to construct a cultural identity.\nBy taking the examples of Carl Philipp Fohr and Caspar David Friedrich, two important figures of each of these groups, and who embraced walking both as praxis and as an aesthetic necessity, I would like to explore the role that wandering plays in the construction of identity, both personal and cultural, local and global. I will argue that the paradigm of wandering, indeed as counter-movement against the advances of technologies in mobility, not only found an expression within the imagery of both artists, hence becoming part of their artistic production and statements, but it also helps us to understand a deeper sense of belonging and identity construction that is ought to be found through the temporality of walking and contemplation.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 203944, "first_name": "Carlos", "last_name": "Idrobo", "domain_name": "utu", "page_name": "CarlosIdrobo", "display_name": "Carlos Idrobo", "profile_url": "https://utu.academia.edu/CarlosIdrobo?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/203944/368601/20125970/s65_carlos.idrobo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6453, "name": "German Romanticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Romanticism?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 112904, "name": "Caspar David Friedrich", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caspar_David_Friedrich?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 556408, "name": "The Wanderer", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Wanderer?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1250183, "name": "German Romantic Painters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Romantic_Painters?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 2624849, "name": "Carl Philipp Fohr", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Carl_Philipp_Fohr?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 30713525, "title": "The role of social capital and community belongingness for exercise adherence: An exploratory study of the CrossFit gym model.", "created_at": "2017-01-03T02:20:59.185-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30713525/The_role_of_social_capital_and_community_belongingness_for_exercise_adherence_An_exploratory_study_of_the_CrossFit_gym_model?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_30713525", "summary": "This is the first study to measure the \u2018sense of community\u2019 reportedly offered by the CrossFit gym model.

The present contribution will give some insights on music as a vector of religious belonging: a female choir of a mosque in Lake Geneva Metropolitan Region has interpreted Beethoven's Ode to Joy with a new text about the glory of the messenger; a regional event on the edge of political and religious expression has united music from Syria, Kosovo and Tunisia in order to put on stage the cosmopolitan characteristics of Swiss Muslims.

The results show that the ways in which migrants inhabit their homes are related to their processes of settling down,since through the material culture, the belonging to their two worlds, the one they came from and the one they settled into, is daily negotiated, generating the ambivalence of  being here and there simultaneously. Their homes become transnational, where emerges a cultural syncretism between two worlds that coexist: Peru is symbolized by photography and food, both of which allow the reproduction of their belonging and cultural identity, and Chile is represented by technological artifacts, which embody their sacrificing labour and courage, and allow them to feel part of the host society.",

Their definitions, needs, and strategies of integration and their integration experiences vary though, depending on the combination of their generational status, educational level, ethnicity/nationality, and age. This variation is not reflected by policies and how society treats them, which hampers their integration. Furthermore, many women do feel at home in the Netherlands. Nonetheless, the more they integrate, the greater their exposure to assimilative pressures. This can diminish their sense of home, thereby thwarting their integration process.

This study is based on prolonged and ongoing ethnographic research in the community. Specifically, I will focus on the skills and larger learned conceptual saberes related to familia and comunidad knowledge through the acquired practices of physical and emotional spacial coordination. Children and teenagers in Nocutzepo learned to practice responsible physical and emotional coordination within familia and comunidad space by engaging primarily in household economic practices and collective, collaborative efforts such as collective labor, and festivities. Physical coordination demonstrated competency in managing well with others in limited physical and emotional space since notions of personal space in Nocutzepo ranged from very small to nonexistent. Emotional coordination involved children and youths\u2019 consideration of others\u2019 social and emotional needs in relation to, and in addition to, their own; thus, their emotional needs were always in relation to others (Kawagley, 1999; Brayboy & Maughan, 2009). Coordination involved not just physical maneuvering in limited space for a variety of activities, but also an emotional commitment to familia and to la comunidad. Overall, this study finds that through responsible coordination, children and youth learned to maneuver, not just in limited physical space, including sometimes having several generations of familia members living in the same house compound or in close proximity, but also to organize their emotional commitments and needs around other familia members, and eventually around the comunidad\u2019s needs, including community collective labor.

"summary": "In contemporary times, there is a compelling need to understand the nature of positive community relationships that value diverse others. This dissertation is a hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry into the essence of what it means to feel a sense of community. Specifically, I explored this phenomenon from the perspective of middle school teachers and students through the following questions: What meanings do students and teachers ascribe to feeling, experiencing, and developing a sense of community in their classes? To what extent do students\u2019 and teachers\u2019 ideas about feeling a sense of community include the acceptance of individual differences? Together these questions contributed to the overarching question, what is the essence of feeling a sense of community? As the data pool for the research, I used 192 essays and 218 posters from students who had been asked to write or draw about their visions of a positive classroom community where they felt a sense of community. I conducted 9 teacher interviews on the topic as well. My findings revealed one overarching ontology, Being-in-Relation, which outlined a full integration between individuality and community as a \u201cway of being.\u201d I also found five attributes that are present when individuals feel a sense of community: Supporting Others, Dialogue, An Ethic of Respect and Care, Safety, and Healthy Conflict. Contributions from this research include extensions to the literature about community; clarity for those who wish to establish a strong foundation of community relationships within formal and non-formal educational programs; insight that may assist educators, leaders, and policy makers within formal educational systems; and an opportunity to consider the extent to which the findings may point toward broader implications.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1137140, "first_name": "Kate", "last_name": "Cassidy", "domain_name": "brocku", "page_name": "KateCassidy", "display_name": "Kate  Cassidy", "profile_url": "https://brocku.academia.edu/KateCassidy?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1137140/399347/20649373/s65_kate.cassidy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4874, "name": "Middle School/Level Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Middle_School_Level_Education?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10666, "name": "Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bullying?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11256, "name": "School Bullying", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/School_Bullying?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15348, "name": "Hermeneutic Phenomenology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hermeneutic_Phenomenology?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 110109, "name": "21st Century Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/21st_Century_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 145107, "name": "Sense of Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 160042, "name": "Psychological Sense of Community", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Psychological_Sense_of_Community?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 187354, "name": "Social and Emotional Wellbeing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Emotional_Wellbeing?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 994571, "name": "New Paradigm Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Paradigm_Education?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 994574, "name": "New Era Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Era_Education?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 270554, "title": "Feeling diasporic", "created_at": "2010-07-22T00:47:59.385-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/270554/Feeling_diasporic?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_270554", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 122805, "first_name": "Lauren", "last_name": "Wagner", "domain_name": "unimaas", "page_name": "LaurenWagner", "display_name": "Lauren B Wagner", "profile_url": "https://unimaas.academia.edu/LaurenWagner?f_ri=76942", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/122805/32839/12063450/s65_lauren.wagner.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2937, "name": "Diasporas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diasporas?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8084, "name": "Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15194, "name": "Social belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_belonging?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15567, "name": "Diaspora Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_Studies?f_ri=76942", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16089, "name": "Multiple Belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiple_Belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28104, "name": "Anthropology of Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Diaspora?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 28106, "name": "Diaspora and transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Diaspora_and_transnationalism?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 56160, "name": "Home, Belonging and Displacement", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Home_Belonging_and_Displacement?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 76942, "name": "Sense of belonging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sense_of_belonging?f_ri=76942"}, {"id": 1476602, "name": "ANTHROMOB", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/ANTHROMOB?f_ri=76942"}]}, {"id": 806886, "title": "Complexities of belonging in democratic/democratizing societies: Islamic identity, ethnicity and citizenship in the Netherlands and Aceh", "created_at": "2011-08-05T17:45:10.949-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/806886/Complexities_of_belonging_in_democratic_democratizing_societies_Islamic_identity_ethnicity_and_citizenship_in_the_Netherlands_and_Aceh?f_ri=76942", "dom_id": "work_806886", "summary": "In this paper we will explore the purported tension that lies between one\u2019s so-called\r\nIslamic identity and the demands of civic identity\u2014seen as proof of \u201cintegration\u201d\u2014\r\nin liberal democratic societies, and show that the relationship is philosophically and\r\nexistentially more complex than advocates of the \u201cclash of civilizations\u201d thesis or\r\n\u201cdemocratic Islam\u201d admit.
