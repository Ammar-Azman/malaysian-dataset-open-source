The capabilities are bookmark, print, search, zoom in, and zoom out. The major work in this project is to manually input the English King James and the Yoruba versions of the Bible. The accuracy of the input is very critical. Also, the system is be able to retrieve accurately any referenced verse of the bilingual Bible. The application was implemented on a laptop and tested. It was found to be working very well.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38367739, "asset_id": 14613316, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id":

writing in Kreol in madrassahs, while they have never been exposed to Kreol literacy in mainstream education. At the point where Kreol is being introduced as an optional school subject, and given that the Mauritian Muslim community has made particular use of written Kreol in the madrassah, this community becomes an interesting test case to explore its language and literacy ideologies with respect to Kreol. A case study approach was used to investigate madrassah informants&amp;#39; language and literacy ideologies, their attitudes to and perceptions of Kreol at the madrassah and at school. The findings reveal that they tolerate written Kreol at the madrassah, but that they use a French-Kreol literacy variety and aspire to shift to French in the near future. Furthermore, they have ambivalent attitudes towards the introduction of Kreol as an optional school subject and potential medium of instruction. These findings are discussed in relation to the micro-practices occurring in the madrassah and the macro-context, both of which reinforce dominant historically situated popular ideologies about Kreol literacy.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2293025, "first_name": "Mooznah", "last_name": "Auleear Owodally", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MooznahAuleearOwodally", "display_name": "Mooznah Auleear Owodally", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MooznahAuleearOwodally?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2293025/2694992/3137135/s65_mooznah.auleear_owodally.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2397, "name": "Religious Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religious_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5780, "name": "Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ideology?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7099, "name": "Case Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Case_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8031, "name": "Socialization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Socialization?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 38244, "name": "French", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/French?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 62436, "name": "Interviews", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interviews?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 42886650, "title": "\u0410\u041d\u0410\u041b\u0418\u0417 \u041e\u0428\u0418\u0411\u041e\u041a \u0412 \u0420\u0415\u0427\u0418 \u0420\u0423\u0421\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0413\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0420\u042f\u0429\u0415\u0413\u041e \u0422\u0423\u0420\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0413\u041e \u0413\u0418\u0414\u0410", "created_at": "2020-04-29T00:44:32.688-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42886650/%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%90%D0%9B%D0%98%D0%97_%D0%9E%D0%A8%D0%98%D0%91%D0%9E%D0%9A_%D0%92_%D0%A0%D0%95%D0%A7%D0%98_%D0%A0%D0%A3%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%9E%D0%93%D0%9E%D0%92%D0%9E%D0%A0%D0%AF%D0%A9%D0%95%D0%93%D0%9E_%D0%A2%D0%A3%D0%A0%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%98%D0%A7%D0%95%D0%A1%D0%9A%D0%9E%D0%93%D0%9E_%D0%93%D0%98%D0%94%D0%90?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_42886650", "summary": "The article discusses errors and inaccuracies in the speech of an educated Russian-speaking tourist guide (Russian L-2) to increase the communicative competence of guides, as well as improving the training programs of Russian as L-2.

The guide\u2019s speech is characterized by a small percentage of morphological errors, but a large number of lexical and semantic inaccuracies in the use of nouns, especially adjectives, adverbs and verbs, as well as a frequent mixing of speech styles.

Also important but often overlooked is the continuing development of the language(s) these pupils already speak and their value in learning majority languages and subjects. This article asks what the functions of multilingual practices\nduring Multilingual Study Guidance are and how they help recently arrived pupils in the Swedish school reach the learning goals of subjects in the Swedish curriculum. A functional analysis of linguistic  ethnographic data shows how using languages pupils understand to reformulate, explain, discuss and raise task, metalinguistic and sociocultural awareness, creates a temporary space for translanguaging, which facilitates subject knowledge development in Swedish and other languages. It is argued that recognition and expansion of this space has the potential to improve opportunities for recently arrived pupils\u2019 on-going multilingual development.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50918224, "asset_id": 30479398, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 16090867, "first_name": "Anne", "last_name": "Reath Warren", "domain_name": "uppsala", "page_name": "AnneReathWarren", "display_name": "Anne  Reath Warren", "profile_url": "https://uppsala.academia.edu/AnneReathWarren?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/16090867/9860111/10990409/s65_anne.reath_warren.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 973080, "name": "Translanguaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translanguaging?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1786727, "name": "Swedish Education System", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Swedish_Education_System?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 44617223, "title": "Bilingual Education for Indigenous Peoples in Mexico", "created_at": "2020-12-01T18:26:33.114-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44617223/Bilingual_Education_for_Indigenous_Peoples_in_Mexico?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_44617223", "summary": "This handbook article sumarizes de history and present state of indigenous education in Mexico from a perspective of bilingualism.

Nowadays, scholars admit on \nthe relevance of the L1 in CLIL and legislation gradually adapts to these indications. We have conducted a pilot \nstudy among primary school teachers in the autonomous region of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain, in order to check how these issues are tackled at school. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to establish a comparison between the main views expressed by stakeholders \ninvolved in CLIL. The study presents a review of recent trends and studies in CLIL research that take into account the role of the L1 in methodology and in \nassessment, and it shows how recent policy changes in our region have adapted to research.

Sin \nembargo, esta descripci\u00f3n general ignora los contextos docentes donde se emplea la lengua materna (L1). La elecci\u00f3n de la lengua puede tener consecuencias tanto en la metodolog\u00eda, en situaciones de aula que \nfavorezcan el uso de la L1, como en los instrumentos de evaluaci\u00f3n. Actualmente, los investigadores admiten la importancia de la L1 en AICLE y la legislaci\u00f3n sigue \ngradualmente sus indicaciones. Se ha llevado a cabo un estudio piloto entre maestros de Educaci\u00f3n Primaria en la comunidad aut\u00f3noma de Castilla-La Mancha, Espa\u00f1a, con el fin de comprobar c\u00f3mo se abordan estos temas/retos en la escuela.

instructional materials in Hiligaynon. This journey is reflected in our qualitative approach to research and development which concluded with the completion of six Hiligaynon Big Books. The different competencies for kindergarten were divided into themes which became the focus of our book. As a group, we discussed about each theme and volunteered to engage in writing based on our interest, experiences and above all our expertise. The process of writing the stories brought us back to our own childhood days and reminded us of the simplicity of life in the perspective of having been children ourselves. We included the rich culture of the region and the sophistication of Hiligaynon language which was taken for granted for quite some time. The writing experiences made us realize that expressing ideas and emotions in Hiligaynon will have a greater impact on conceptual understanding to the reader or listener. This is because the words used reflected the language learned first at home. We were more convinced to embrace the use of the mother tongue when we saw the fruition of our passion. We feel our passion for the use of the language will be transmitted to the kindergarten teachers when they read the stories to the children. We were inspired to share the six big books to the teachers who will be using Hiligaynon as the first language. We showcased the reading of our exemplars entitled Pinasahi Ako, Si Inday kag si Toto, Maeskwela na Ako, Matam-is nga Tinapay, Mahampang Kita and Buta Buta to a group of kindergarten teachers during a training.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75676117, "asset_id": 63161660, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 123082220, "first_name": "Daisy", "last_name": "Rosano", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "DaisyRosano", "display_name": "Daisy Rosano", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/DaisyRosano?f_ri=28221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 185219826, "first_name": "Marievic", "last_name": "Violeta", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MarievicVioleta", "display_name": "Marievic Violeta", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MarievicVioleta?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/185219826/57352244/45569422/s65_marievic.violeta.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 826988, "name": "Hiligaynon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hiligaynon?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2533926, "name": "big books", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/big_books?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42682263, "title": "Cognition toward Mother Tongue", "created_at": "2020-04-09T13:30:51.465-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42682263/Cognition_toward_Mother_Tongue?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_42682263", "summary": "This quantitative investigation involved 1,054 pre-service teacher respondents with mean age =\n20.21 (SD=3.124).

Since the late 20th century, the ecology of language, sometimes known as \u201cecolinguistics\u201d or \u201clanguage ecology,\u201d has become an umbrella term for a wide range of perspectives that seek to make connections between language and environment: using concepts related to ecology to understand social environments for multilingualism, analyzing discourses of environment and environmentalism, and describing relationships between biological and cultural diversity. While each of these perspectives is useful in its own way for understanding aspects of language in society, and all of them overlap in meaningful ways, the focus here is on the first perspective since it is arguably the most widely used with respect to the study of language (in) education. In this regard, the ecology of language is a conceptual orientation to critical thinking about multilingualism in and around teaching and learning.  From this point of view, the ecology of language highlights the importance of being aware of the social and political environment in which language learning and teaching takes place. This includes paying attention to how language education relates to large-scale linguistic ecosystems like regions, countries, and cities as well as to small scales like communities, schools, classrooms, and interpersonal interactions.

People were told\nthat globalization would bring a significant boost in transportation, communication, and information, which would\ncontribute to the foundation of the \u201cglobal village\u201d. Many predictions came true. One new trend was evident to\nsupport all the new innovations\u2014most leaders wanted to integrate English in their own educational system. Around\nthe world, schools promoted English in order to meet the competitive market that globalization had created. In fact,\nsome linguists predicted that English was going to take over other languages, and that it could actually take some\nindigenous languages to their eternal rest. Today, there is a new trend that shows more and more countries\npromoting mother tongue-based education (MTBE). Due to the fact that this is a fairly new paradigm shift, it is\ncatching a lot of government and educational leaders off-guard. Based on careful survey of a number of countries\npromoting mother tongue education and recent research studies on MTBE, this presentation synthesizes common\nfactors that either promote or hinder MTBE. It concludes with recommendations of what must be in place for\nsuccess to happen when switching to MTBE, especially in the Asian context.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37657273, "asset_id": 12422223, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2728616, "first_name": "Safary", "last_name": "Wa-Mbaleka", "domain_name": "bethel", "page_name": "SafaryWaMbaleka", "display_name": "Safary Wa-Mbaleka", "profile_url": "https://bethel.academia.edu/SafaryWaMbaleka?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2728616/880652/34139723/s65_safary.wa-mbaleka.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 5470, "name": "East Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Asia?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 5471, "name": "South Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asia?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 8605, "name": "Language Policy and Politics of Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy_and_Politics_of_Identity?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 9379, "name": "Asia Pacific Region", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asia_Pacific_Region?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 9918, "name": "Teaching of Foreign Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_of_Foreign_Languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 15439, "name": "Teaching English As A Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_As_A_Foreign_Language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 17617, "name": "Native Languages of the Americas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_Languages_of_the_Americas?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 19011, "name": "First Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 50569, "name": "Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 99517, "name": "English as a Foreign Language (EFL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_as_a_Foreign_Language_EFL_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 150730, "name": "Mother-Tongue Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother-Tongue_Literacy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 178059, "name": "Language policy and planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_policy_and_planning?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 827606, "name": "English As a Second Language (ESL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_As_a_Second_Language_ESL_?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 40965316, "title": "IMPORTANCE OF MOTHER TONGUE IN PRIMARY EDUCATION", "created_at": "2019-11-17T22:04:47.288-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40965316/IMPORTANCE_OF_MOTHER_TONGUE_IN_PRIMARY_EDUCATION?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_40965316", "summary": "This article explores the impact of primary school experience on young children's psychological feature attainments at entry to grade school and analyses data collected as part of a wider longitudinal study.

The study adapted the modified version of Ejieh\u2019s (2004) questionnaire, such modifications were done by Tonio and Ella (2019) in their study for it to fit in the Philippine educational context. Using Chronbach\u2019s Alpha, Tonio and Ella\u2019s (2019) modified questionnaire garnered a 0.80 rating for reliability. The questionnaire was administered online, and the data were obtained from 70 secondary teachers of sixteen (16) public high schools in the Zamboanga del Sur province. The data were analyzed using the frequency and mean computation as well as thematic analysis. The results indicate that generally, the teachers disagree that the MTB-MLE policy is in good principle as they believe that it will not make the lessons interesting to students, and that it will not enable them to understand their lessons \neasily. In addition, some of the most recurring challenges associated with the policy include reading and instruction comprehension difficulties, degradation of English language literacy and proficiency, language and/or \ncommunication barrier between the teacher and the students, poor vocabulary and other grammar issues, teaching difficulty in Math, and difficulty in learning a second language (L2). Some recommendations obtained from the participants include the call for additional funding and support for MTB-MLE teachers, abolishing the policy and switching to the old curriculum, and revising some aspects of the policy to better suit the linguistic diversity of the country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 85902816, "asset_id": 79050855, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 219311244, "first_name": "Friendly Mark H.", "last_name": "Andrino", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "FriendlyMarkHAndrino", "display_name": "Friendly Mark H.

We argue that centering critical consciousness\u2014or fostering among teachers, parents, and children an awareness of the structural oppression that surrounds us and a readiness to take action to correct it\u2014can support increased equity and social justice in TWDL education. We elaborate four elements of critical consciousness: interrogating power, critical listening, historicizing schools, and embracing discomfort. We illustrate these elements with examples from TWDL research and practice. In addition, we describe how critical consciousness impacts and radicalizes the other three core goals, in turn supporting the development of more successful, equitable, and socially just TWDL

"summary": "This article focuses on the pedagogical beliefs, practices and ideological assumptions of 15 teachers who work with mother tongue instruction in Sweden. Despite support through provisions in Swedish laws, mother tongue instruction is clearly a marginalized subject, not least due to its non-mandatory status, the limited time allocated for it and the fact that the subject and its teachers are often contested in public debate. In this study, the teachers\u2019 narratives center round issues of legitimacy, both for the subject per se and for the teachers\u2019 right to be viewed as \u2018real\u2019 teachers. In this paper, we highlight how the teachers link mother tongue instruction to the notion of a \u2018common heritage\u2019 and how they see themselves as advocates and role models for the mother tongue. The teachers raise the status of mother tongue instruction in a transformational way, to a subject that is essential and can have a positive impact for a group of students who would otherwise be at a disadvantage in the school system. The undermining of mother tongue instruction was found to affect the pedagogical practices, as the teachers often took into consideration how their teaching would be viewed by parents and colleagues.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48765579, "asset_id": 9342020, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11784825, "first_name": "Natalia", "last_name": "Ganuza", "domain_name": "uppsala", "page_name": "NataliaGanuza", "display_name": "Natalia Ganuza", "profile_url": "https://uppsala.academia.edu/NataliaGanuza?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11784825/10194529/11376714/s65_natalia.ganuza.jpg"}, {"id": 21608327, "first_name": "Christina", "last_name": "Hedman", "domain_name": "su-se", "page_name": "ChristinaHedman", "display_name": "Christina Hedman", "profile_url": "https://su-se.academia.edu/ChristinaHedman?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21608327/83443243/72062831/s65_christina.hedman.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 858, "name": "Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literacy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5539, "name": "Language and Ideology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Ideology?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 70727, "name": "Structure and Agency", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Structure_and_Agency?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 166886, "name": "Heritage Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_Languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 195374, "name": "Mother Tongue Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 240653, "name": "Teachers Beliefs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teachers_Beliefs?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 6251020, "title": " The Usefulness of Translation in Foreign Language Learning: Students\u2019 Attitudes by Ana B.

Recent studies, however, show that, far from being useless, translation can be a great aid to foreign language learning. The aim of the present paper is twofold: (1) to summarize and assess the arguments that encourage the use of translation in the foreign language classroom, supporting the integration of several forms of translating; and (2) to present the results of a survey that focused on students\u2019 perceptions and responses towards translation tasks and their effectiveness in foreign language acquisition. Results show that students\u2019 attitudes were surprisingly positive for several reasons: translation is one of their preferred language learning tasks, it is motivating, it facilitates a deeper understanding of the form and content of the source language text, it increases learners\u2019 awareness of the differences between both linguistic systems, it allows them to re-express their thoughts faster and easier, and it helps them acquire linguistic and cultural knowledge.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Foreign language learning, Translation,  TILT , Students\u2019 attitudes, Spanish EFL  \r\n                   Learners.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33109756, "asset_id": 6251020, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4443238, "first_name": "International Journal of English Language", "last_name": "and Translation Studies", "domain_name": "eltsjournal", "page_name": "InternationalJournalofEnglishLanguageandTranslationStudies", "display_name": "International Journal of English Language  and Translation Studies", "profile_url": "https://eltsjournal.academia.edu/InternationalJournalofEnglishLanguageandTranslationStudies?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4443238/1814454/9010746/s65_international_journal_of_english_language.and_translation_studies.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 887, "name": "Teaching and Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_and_Learning?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1186, "name": "Translation Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3457, "name": "Learning and Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learning_and_Teaching?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4954, "name": "Translation theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_theory?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9918, "name": "Teaching of Foreign Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_of_Foreign_Languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 12723, "name": "Teaching Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_Translation?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 19868, "name": "Using L1 In The L2 Classroom", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Using_L1_In_The_L2_Classroom?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 24344, "name": "Translation and Interpretation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_and_Interpretation?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 30347, "name": "Translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 33269, "name": "Teaching EFL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_EFL?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 37753, "name": "Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 50024, "name": "Language Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 50804, "name": "Literary translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_translation?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 60843, "name": "Reflective Teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reflective_Teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 148913, "name": "Task-based language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Task-based_language_teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 150730, "name": "Mother-Tongue Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother-Tongue_Literacy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 330018, "name": "Arabic-English translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Arabic-English_translation?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 443302, "name": "Mother Tongue as a Resource for Other Language Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_as_a_Resource_for_Other_Language_Learning?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 788817, "name": "teaching English language and translation studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/teaching_English_language_and_translation_studies?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 43255536, "title": "Mother Tongue-Based Education in Myanmar: A literature review", "created_at": "2020-06-04T06:15:40.898-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43255536/Mother_Tongue_Based_Education_in_Myanmar_A_literature_review?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_43255536", "summary": "This paper provides a literature review of recent studies of Mother Tongue-based (MTB) education in Myanmar.

problematize the proposed use of mother-tongue-based instruction in the Philippines. As a country that has, for almost a century, supported the use of English in schools, this proposal marks a drastic shift in Philippine languages in education policies. We\r\nargue that a century of language policies, which have privileged English over all the local languages of the Philippines, have led to specific attitudes to language that will impact on the success of mother-tongue-based education. To support our arguments, we will draw on the results of a survey on language attitudes conducted in the Philippines. This survey specifically asked respondents about what they perceived to be the role/s of English and other Philippine\r\nlanguages in education. We argue that although mother-tongue initiatives are admirable, they need to be examined in terms of attitudes to language, which may or may not value mother\r\ntongues. In addition, we argue that for mother-tongue-based education to succeed, it is necessary to consider the possibility of changing these attitudes to language via a principles-based\r\napproach to language policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32372216, "asset_id": 5182319, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44164, "first_name": "Ahmar",

to language learning and teaching-translanguaging-has become a popular topic in recent years.

Then, this article turns to the particular case of the Wellington Translanguaging Project in Aotearoa New Zealand, first describing the language context of the country. The Wellington Translanguaging Project's methods of data collection and analysis are then discussed, along with the findings of the project and how they relate both to new speakers (those encountering the target linguistic varieties for the first time in school) and heritage language speakers (those with a family connection to the target linguistic varieties). The findings are then discussed, including the ability of a translanguaging pedagogy to empower students and to encourage them to actually use more of the target linguistic varieties. The article ends by looking to other recent findings in pedagogical translanguaging research, showing both the qualitative and quantitative benefits of such an approach.", "downloadable_attachments":

"summary": "Published in 1979, the novel The Joys of Motherhood by Buchi Emecheta tells the story of Nnu-Ego whose life centres on her children and through them, she gains the respect of her community. In terms of its thematic approach, many have hailed The Joys of Motherhood as a feminist text as it challenges the prevailing definitions and stereotypes of women. A feminist reading of this narrative results in interpreting Nnu Ego as a victim. However, this study argues that Emecheta\u2019s The Joys of Motherhood does not portray the victimisation of women, but rather celebrates womanhood and motherhood. Via the reading and analysis of the novel from an Africana womanism perspective, Nnu is portrayed more as a victor rather than a victim. In light of the tenets of Africana womanism, Nnu is the illustration of strength, male compatibility, wholeness and authenticity, adaptability, self-naming and defining, family-centeredness, mothering and nurturing characteristics that make up an African woman. Emecheta\u2019s The Joys of Motherhood is therefore a celebration of motherhood and womanism.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58441277, "asset_id": 38385183, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 99308550, "first_name": "hazel", "last_name": "Ngorima", "domain_name": "uz-ac", "page_name": "hazelNgorima", "display_name": "hazel Ngorima", "profile_url": "https://uz-ac.academia.edu/hazelNgorima?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/99308550/21649528/20983299/s65_hazel.ngorima.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 25858, "name": "Motherhood and Public Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Motherhood_and_Public_Discourse?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 91273, "name": "Theories of Motherhood", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theories_of_Motherhood?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9151441, "title": "The Authority of the Teachers", "created_at": "2014-11-05T19:50:30.615-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9151441/The_Authority_of_the_Teachers?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_9151441", "summary": "It was a written report about the authority of the teachers now a days.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35438101, "asset_id": 9151441, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20872716, "first_name": "Lorna", "last_name": "Dacillo", "domain_name": "pnu-ph", "page_name": "LornaDacillo", "display_name": "Lorna Dacillo", "profile_url": "https://pnu-ph.academia.edu/LornaDacillo?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20872716/5780387/6569539/s65_lorna.dacillo.jpg_oh_2b71e035f653ef29ecbe3df015f25747_oe_54f08d74___gda___1425323190_f5e2248ed8e3b002008ece7431c1d3df"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 24705011, "title": "L\u2019Introduction des langues nationales dans le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif au Mali : objectifs et cons\u00e9quences", "created_at": "2016-04-24T02:41:59.254-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24705011/L_Introduction_des_langues_nationales_dans_le_syst%C3%A8me_%C3%A9ducatif_au_Mali_objectifs_et_cons%C3%A9quences?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_24705011", "summary": "Ce travail rend compte de l\u2019\u00e9volution de l\u2019enseignement bilingue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole\nfondamentale au Mali, donnant ensuite un aper\u00e7u du r\u00f4le des LN aux niveaux\nsecondaire et sup\u00e9rieur.

Multilingual families are the focus of our research: 50 in Cyprus, 20 in Estonia and 50 in Sweden. Using parental written question\u00acnaires with the focus on general background, socio-economic status and language proficiency, as well as oral semi-structured interviews and ethnographic participant observation, our study attempts to describe how family language policy is managed through translanguaging and literacy activities in multilingual Russian-speaking families in three different cultural and linguistic environments. Our results show both differences and similarities among Russian-speakers in the three countries, not only in their family language practices, but also in their attitudes towards the fluidity of language, language repertoires, translanguaging and Russian-language literacy. Russian-speakers incorporate a wide range of language repertoires in their everyday lives. Sometimes, such language contacts generate power struggles and the language ideological dimension becomes a key terrain to explore how speakers feel about the need to effectively attain a degree of multilingualism. Multilingualism and the maintenance of the Russian language and culture are usually encouraged, and parents often choose the one-parent-one-language approach at home.

An attempt was made to assess the proficiency level of a sample of 200 children in grade 5 at primary school in both Papiamento and Dutch. A distinction was made between language comprehension and tasks dealing with lexicon, syntax and semantics, on the one hand, and word decoding tasks on the other. The results make clear that the children's level of language comprehension is better in Papiamento, while their level of decoding is better in Dutch.

Unlike its neighbours, however, the Philippines is the first nation in the region to legislate and implement Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB MLE) nationally. As such, the Philippines represents a valuable example for other countries as they attempt to develop language-in-education policy and put it into practice. \n\nEmploying grounded theory case study methodology, this dissertation examines Filipino MTB MLE policies and their implementation in Mindanao, one of the most remote and linguistically diverse regions of the country. Through policy analysis and semi-structured interviews with key informants, this study presents findings for three key research questions which evolved through the study. This study has not tested the validity of MTB MLE as an educational alternative, which is well proven in the literature. Instead, the concern of this research was to determine the level of support the current MTB MLE policies have created for MTB MLE in the Philippines, the challenges which have been encountered in the implementation of these policies, as well as the aids which have facilitated implementation. \n\nThe findings suggest that the policy environment present in the Philippines is indeed supportive, and existing policies are approved by key stakeholders involved in MTB MLE implementation. A number of challenges were identified, which risk the successful implementation of MTB MLE in Mindanao. The most common challenges cited by informants and supported by the literature were the lack of teacher training provided and the difficulties in producing appropriate learning materials. Conversely, a number of aids to implementation were found; the most important of these being support from groups outside of the government such as NGOs, HEIs, community members, teachers and principals. Four key recommendations were drawn from these findings, and include developing a supportive political environment for MTB MLE, focusing on training at the local level, extending partnerships and ensuring sufficient start-up funding is available.\n\nThe recommendations presented in this study of the Philippines may inform the design and implementation of new national MTB MLE policies in other countries, as well as in the scale up of the Filipino program.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34572214, "asset_id": 8129530, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7958299, "first_name": "Naomi", "last_name": "Fillmore", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "NaomiFillmore", "display_name": "Naomi Fillmore", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/NaomiFillmore?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7958299/3305944/31026702/s65_naomi.fillmore.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 148265, "name": "Education Reform", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Reform?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 37565191, "title": "The Transformation of Instruction: A Critical Analysis of Trends in English Education in Twenty-first Century Korea", "created_at": "2018-10-10T18:41:25.494-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/37565191/The_Transformation_of_Instruction_A_Critical_Analysis_of_Trends_in_English_Education_in_Twenty_first_Century_Korea?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_37565191", "summary": "This theoretical essay has been written to critically explore the manner in which English is used as a globalizing medium in South Korea\u2019s education sector.

Some decades back, the Philippines prided itself to have mastered the art of bilingualism with its people efficiently speaking both Filipino and English in classrooms and outside.  Prominent economist Solita Collas-Monsod (2003),  in fact, puts the Philippines as the third-largest English-speaking country in the world after the United States and the United Kingdom. However, recent findings caused the Philippine government to rethink of a better policy to contain the fast- deterioration of English-speaking, most importantly, among its people and to ensure the use of English as medium of instruction in schools to make its people \u201cglobally competitive\u201d while, at the same time, complying with the constitutional mandate on the use of Filipino.  \n\nTo fully grasp the country\u2019s current state of bilingualism, this paper looks into the effect of the advent of a \u201cglobalized education system\u201d, where learning is characterized by modern modes and strategies like e-learning, distance education, international joint-degree programs and partnerships, integrated study abroad modules, etc., which critiques consider as \u201cimpediment\u201d to productive learning.  Perhaps the most appropriate question that should be asked is \u201cHow does globalized education system impact on the bilingual communication skills and competencies of Filipinos?\u201d\n\nApparently, the Philippine government is confronted with the dilemma that the dwindling bilingual communication skills and competencies of Filipinos, as a comparative advantage over other Asian countries, will worsen even further and that Filipinos will eventually be left out in the globalized economy.  Center on this debate are issues whether to pursue English as the sole medium of instruction, or strengthen bilingual approach to education or review the policies involved in the proliferation of the \u201cglobalized education system\u201d.  A major policy issue, thus, remains crucial: can a \u201cglobalized education system\u201d indeed contribute to the development agenda of the Philippines and ensure the country in positioning its labor force in a globally competitive market?  The government believes that the Philippines\u2019 own historical experience itself evidenced a symbiotic relationship between enhancing the Filipinos\u2019 bilingual skills and becoming a globally competitive business environment.  Proponents for further strengthening Filipinos\u2019 English skills and competencies often argue on the bases of the Asian Street Journal (October 15, 2002 issue) where it noted of India\u2019s English skills and proficiency that has propelled the country\u2019s hi-tech industry and that which catapulted Singapore to be \u201cone of the world\u2019s most impressive economic success stories\u201d.   \n\nThis paper, however, strongly disagrees with so-called \u201ceducational Taylorism\u201d as suggested by William Tabb. The art of promoting bilingualism under the regime of a \u201cglobalized education system\u201d, unlike education per se, cannot be conducted in similar way that Henry Ford manufactured automobiles where \u201cskilled labor are broken down into a series of lower-skilled tasks, assigning some tasks to machines and imposing strict managerial control over the rest.\u201d  While at some point language learning and/or can be commodified and are sold through various modes and strategies, just like education as a whole, concrete policy standards have to be crafted if indeed such skills-enhancement is geared towards lifelong competencies for the Filipinos.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38232984, "asset_id": 14197806, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11337682, "first_name": "Alan", "last_name": "Villarante", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AlanVillarante", "display_name": "Alan Villarante", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AlanVillarante?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/11337682/3318408/3904914/s65_alan.villarante.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1008, "name": "Second Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 21447, "name": "Bilingual Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 46596, "name": "English language teaching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language_teaching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 119852, "name": "Language education policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_education_policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 690370, "name": "Filipino Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Filipino_Language?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 68910546, "title": "Cognitive and Metacognitive Skills on Elementary School Students: Mixed Methods Study", "created_at": "2022-01-20T19:18:15.045-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68910546/Cognitive_and_Metacognitive_Skills_on_Elementary_School_Students_Mixed_Methods_Study?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_68910546", "summary": "While research on cognitive and metacognitive abilities of bilingual and biliterate students has been advancing, limited studies have examined these influences in the Arabic context.

This is an explanatory sequential mixed method study where quantitative data from Grade 5 students (n = 350), and their Arabic and English teachers (n = 200; and n = 150 respectively) were first collected, followed by in-depth interviews with three students, two English teachers, and two Arabic teachers. Findings showed that students used their cognitive and metacognitive abilities more freely in Arabic lessons as compared to English. However, Arabic teachers reported that students use background knowledge in their first language in a better way but also demonstrated insufficient transfer strategy between the two languages.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79214429, "asset_id": 68910546, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 40302356, "first_name": "Aysha", "last_name": "AlShamsi", "domain_name": "hct", "page_name": "AyshaAlShamsi", "display_name": "Aysha S A E E D AlShamsi", "profile_url": "https://hct.academia.edu/AyshaAlShamsi?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/40302356/30227087/28038228/s65_ahmed.alshamsi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 7259, "name": "Code-Switching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Code-Switching?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11167, "name": "Biliteracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biliteracy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22695, "name": "Bilingual Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Development?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 34831, "name": "Bilingualism and cognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_cognition?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 240278, "name": "Code switching and code mixing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Code_switching_and_code_mixing?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 313907, "name": "Emergent Bilingualism and Biliteracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emergent_Bilingualism_and_Biliteracy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 875933, "name": "Bilingualism and Biliteracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_Biliteracy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 926065, "name": "Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognitive_and_Metacognitive_Strategies?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 973080, "name": "Translanguaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translanguaging?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1036563, "name": "Background Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Background_Knowledge?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 2221008, "name": "Cognititive Strategies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cognititive_Strategies?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 2578984, "name": "Translanguaging, Billingualism and language learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translanguaging_Billingualism_and_language_learning?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 2945572, "name": "Translanguaging in Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translanguaging_in_Education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 53199360, "title": "\u015eeng\u00fcl, K. & K\u00f6seo\u011flu, T.

Participants stated that their participation in Turkish lessons in France has changed negatively during the COVID-19 pandemic; they reported that Turkish and Turkish Culture course hours were insufficient.

However, this area is often ignored in studies of education systems. This study explores issues surrounding linguistic diversity and its implications for education, together with political concerns about language and resultant government language policies. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, such as Mali, are linguistically complex and have low literacy rates. These countries are concerned about the high levels of drop-outs and retakes in their school systems. In order to alleviate this, many have tried the introduction of indigenous languages in a variety of bilingual education programmes. One such programme, P\u00e9dagogie Convergente, combines the use of indigenous languages with an innovative pedagogy. This study contributes to the debate on linguistic diversity and language and education in Mali by researching the P\u00e9dagogie Convergente approach, and contrasting this with the Traditional French approach still being used in most Malian schools. It does this by focussing on the realities of everyday school life in one school complex. Data was collected using a variety of ethnographic research methods, including classroom observations, interviews, questionnaires and various recording techniques. The study concludes that P\u00e9dagogie Convergente appears to deliver a better education for Mali because students pass through the system more quickly, fewer drop out and students receive a better educational experience. But it argues that there are factors other than language and that the new pedagogy needs to be taken into account when evaluating the true benefit of the innovative approach", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 97836931, "asset_id": 13307681, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30144822, "first_name": "maggie", "last_name": "canvin", "domain_name": "sil", "page_name": "maggiecanvin", "display_name": "maggie canvin", "profile_url": "https://sil.academia.edu/maggiecanvin?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30144822/9706841/10811700/s65_maggie.canvin.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52869, "name": "Mali", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mali?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 138932, "name": "Sociolinguistics, Sociology of Languages, Language Policy and Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics_Sociology_of_Languages_Language_Policy_and_Planning?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 195374, "name": "Mother Tongue Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 492839, "name": "Education and language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_and_language?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 29515403, "title": "Building on Children\u2019s Linguistic Resources: A Socio-culturally Responsive Pedagogy for English Language Teaching in Pakistandf", "created_at": "2016-10-28T22:52:10.375-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/29515403/Building_on_Children_s_Linguistic_Resources_A_Socio_culturally_Responsive_Pedagogy_for_English_Language_Teaching_in_Pakistandf?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_29515403", "summary": "The number of private English-medium schools has expanded nearly ten-fold in Pakistan over the last couple of decades. Since public understands the power and value of English language within Pakistan and globally; therefore, such schools are widely spread across the country. This paper focuses on the low-fee private schools, a category of schools which usually appeals to children from middle or lower middle strata of society. The study spans over one year starting from January 2013 to January 2014. Employing a qualitative methodology, the study draws on non-participant observation of the classrooms, and interviews with three pools of stakeholders within the schools: (students, n=30), (teachers, n=8), and (school principals, n=11). Focusing specifically on reading practices, grammar and vocabulary instruction, the study finds that instruction occurs solely through Urdu language while English rarely features in contextualized manner either in formal instruction or in student-teacher interaction. The mother tongues of the students are discouraged; rather they are abandoned. Students are required to memorize rules and definition of grammatical structures without contextualizing their use in real-life situations. Similarly, few vocabulary items are translated in Urdu language in decontextualized manner. Most students find themselves alienated due to an alien language as a medium of instruction which results in poor learning of the language and contents. The study suggests that such teaching methodologies are counterproductive and less effective as they are not founded on the fundamental principal theories of ESL/EFL and content-based instruction. At the end, an alternative pedagogical model of translanguaging and multilinguality has been proposed, which is inclusive and more befitting to the local sociolinguistic and socio-cultural environment. It draws on the optimal utilization and interaction of local languages as resources for construction of new meanings, and for mobilizing different learners\u2019 language resources, local knowledge systems, and cultural practices.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49953088, "asset_id": 29515403, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1623393, "first_name": "SYED", "last_name": "ABDUL MANAN", "domain_name": "nu-kz", "page_name": "SYEDABDULMANAN", "display_name": "SYED ABDUL MANAN", "profile_url": "https://nu-kz.academia.edu/SYEDABDULMANAN?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1623393/566161/18260373/s65_syed.abdul_manan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18193, "name": "Critical sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 973080, "name": "Translanguaging", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translanguaging?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 2558457, "name": "additive multilingual education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/additive_multilingual_education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 10435768, "title": "Kreol at school: a case study of Mauritian Muslims' language and literacy ideologies", "created_at": "2015-02-01T11:24:23.653-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10435768/Kreol_at_school_a_case_study_of_Mauritian_Muslims_language_and_literacy_ideologies?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_10435768", "summary": "Negotiating their double identity as Mauritians and Muslims in multilingual and\nin multiethnic Mauritius, Mauritian Muslims have been socialised into reading\nand writing in Kreol in madrassahs, while they have never been exposed to Kreol\nliteracy in mainstream education.

Interviews and literature studies were used to obtain data. Fi ra wali as a self-concept of the Sentani community has local values that are used to strengthen the existence of socio-culturalism in the face of modernization. This article reveals that in Fi Ra Wali some social norms and rules are built spontaneously to create a culture of obedience, discipline, respect, and social awareness in maintaining their local wisdom. Fi Ra Wali is a manifestation of hidden rationality, as a manifestation of hidden knowledge that shows the strength of a traditional society that is resistant.

The overarching aim of this study was to determine which LDCs these learners are capable of comprehending and producing at the start of Gr 1 and what progress they make in terms of these LDCs during their Gr 1 year. The English and isiXhosa LOLT groups were then compared on how they fared on the LDCs in their respective LOLTs in order to ascertain whether the English language proficiency of the English group is at such a level at the start of Gr 1 that they can, without disadvantage, undergo schooling successfully in English. Data were collected on articles, binding relations, quantifiers and passive constructions by using the informal language assessment instrument, the Receptive and Expressive Activities for Language Therapy (Southwood & Van Dulm 2012a), which makes use of picture selection- and pointing tasks for assessment of comprehension and sentence completion, picture description- and question answering tasks for assessment of production. The results showed that for the Afrikaans and English groups all four LDCs are indeed later developing and are only mastered after the end of Gr 1. For the isiXhosa group, quantifiers and passive production are mastered by the end of Gr 1. In terms of the language-in-education and teaching policy, the results show that the time allocated to listening to and producing language in Gr 1 is sufficient for children whose first language is also their LOLT, whereas it is not sufficient in the case of English additional language learners. The latter group made significant progress in all LDCs assessed, but still performed worse than their isiXhosa-speaking peers, for whom there was a match between first language and LOLT. The implication of the results are that (i) the Foundation Phase school curriculum should be refined so as to consider the needs of all Gr 1 learners, as learners enter Gr 1 with different language skills and different levels of preparation for the tasks which lie before them, (ii) teachers should be assisted to foster the development of language skills in additional language learners, and (iii) the institution of a universal Gr R year, which is free to those who cannot afford school fees, should be considered a necessity. Without ensuring that all children enter Gr 1 with an adequate language foundation on which literacy development can build, historical inequalities still present in South Africa will likely be perpetuated rather than systematically removed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44076700, "asset_id": 23672747, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 409590, "first_name": "Joanine", "last_name": "Nel", "domain_name": "up-za", "page_name": "JoanineNel", "display_name": "Joanine H Nel", "profile_url": "https://up-za.academia.edu/JoanineNel?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/409590/128981/395958/s65_joanine.nel.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1008, "name": "Second Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1417, "name": "Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6223, "name": "English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19011, "name": "First Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/First_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 47435, "name": "Afrikaans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afrikaans?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 74039, "name": "Quantifiers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Quantifiers?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 117497, "name": "Child Language Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_Language_Development?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 128900, "name": "Generative grammar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Generative_grammar?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 150730, "name": "Mother-Tongue Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother-Tongue_Literacy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 153818, "name": "Xhosa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Xhosa?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 196925, "name": "Determiners", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Determiners?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 305306, "name": "Language in Foundation Phase", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_in_Foundation_Phase?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 419600, "name": "Passive voice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Passive_voice?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 546015, "name": "Language and Literacy Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Literacy_Development?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 611548, "name": "Anaphor  Binding Theory  Reflexive", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anaphor_Binding_Theory_Reflexive?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 35582116, "title": "THE INFLUENCE OF BILINGUAL SUBTITLES ON STUDENTS' VOCABULARY MASTERY ENGLISH DEPARTMENT FACULTY OF LANGUAGES AND ARTS", "created_at": "2018-01-04T17:53:47.503-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35582116/THE_INFLUENCE_OF_BILINGUAL_SUBTITLES_ON_STUDENTS_VOCABULARY_MASTERY_ENGLISH_DEPARTMENT_FACULTY_OF_LANGUAGES_AND_ARTS?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_35582116", "summary": "This paper is based on a study of bilingual subtitles for teaching vocabulary to junior high school\nstudents. This research is aimed to find out whether or not bilingual movie subtitles are effective to\nteach vocabulary at the eighth graders of SMP N 1 Borobudur in the Academic Year of 2016/2017.\nThe research design used was experimental. Tests were used as the method to collect the data and\ninformation. Before conducting the experiment, I tried out the test to 32 students of VIII A to make\nsure that the test were valid and reliable. I used class VIII D as the experimental group and VIII C\nas the control group, both classes are in the same level, background, and competence. The result of\nthe pre-test showed the mean of the experimental group was 70.25 and the mean of the control\ngroup was 69.37. After the treatment, the mean of experimental group was 78.38 and the mean of\ncontrol group was 72.18. It could be seen that there was students\u2019 improvement after the\ntreatments dealing with their vocabulary mastery. From the t-test computation of the post-test\nscore, the t-value was higher than t-table that is 2.104 > 1.998 at (Nx + Ny \u2013 2 = 62 and \u03b1 = 5%)\nwhich shows that there is significant difference between the experimental group and the control\ngroup. The results indicate that Bilingual subtitles is effective to teach vocabulary at the eighth\ngraders of SMP N 1 Borobudur the Academic Year of 2016/2017. Therefore, the null hypothesis\nwas rejected and the working hypothesis was accepted. It is suggested that the findings of this\nstudy can be applied regularly and continuously or can be developed by the English teachers to\nhave a better vocabulary teaching.\nKey words : Subtitle,

summary:\n\nMultilingualism is a reality in South African classrooms. The Constitution of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) and the national language policy recognize language rights and aims at supporting, promoting and developing the official languages. However, despite the advantages of mother tongue education, English is often chosen as language of learning and teaching at the cost of the African official languages. This study proposes the accommodation and promotion of multilingualism through blended learning.\n\nBlended learning refers to the blending of traditional instruction methods, such as face-to-face instruction, with other forms of instruction such as online learning and teaching. Through a discussion of asynchronous and synchronous learning tools it was established that wikis would be used for this study. In terms of blended learning and learning theories the main emphasis in this study is on socio-constructivism as well as communal constructivism.\n\nThe empirical research in this study focused on the establishment and testing of a conceptual model for the accommodation and promotion of multilingualism through blended learning in the subject IT. The research took the form of a sequential embedded mixed methods design. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were used. A questionnaire was used with IT teachers to investigate the language and blended learning context. This was followed up with qualitative research in the form of interviews aimed at provincial and national experts in terms of the subject IT and e-learning. Based on the literature and these two investigations, a conceptual model was developed. The conceptual model\u2019s effectiveness was tested through a quasi-experimental study. A questionnaire was also completed by the respondents at the schools after the completion of the study. Through the testing of the effectiveness of the conceptual model it was found that multilingualism could successfully be accommodated and promoted through this conceptual model.\n\n\n\nAfrikaans summary:\n\nMeertaligheid is \u2019n werklikheid in Suid-Afrikaanse klaskamers. Die Grondwet van Suid-Afrika (Wet 108 van 1996) en die nasionale taalbeleid erken taalregte en het die ondersteuning, uitbreiding en ontwikkeling van die amptelike tale ten doel. Hierteenoor, ten spyte van die voordele van moedertaalonderwys, word Engels dikwels as taal van onderrig en leer gekies ten koste van die Afrikatale wat amptelike tale is. Hierdie studie stel die akkommodering en uitbreiding van meertaligheid deur gemengde leer voor.\n\nGemengde leer verwys na die mengsel van tradisionele onderrigmetodes, soos gesig-tot-gesig-onderrig, met ander vorme van onderrig soos aanlynonderrig en -leer. Deur \u2019n bespreking van asinchrone en sinchrone leertegnologie is bepaal dat wiki\u2019s vir hierdie studie gebruik sal word. Met betrekking tot gemengde leer en leerteorie\u00eb was die fokus van hierdie studie op sosio-konstruktivisme sowel as gemeenskapskonstruktivisme.\n\nDie empiriese navorsing van hierdie studie het op die daarstelling en toetsing van \u2019n konseptuele model vir die akkommodering en uitbreiding van meertaligheid deur gemengde leer in die vak IT gefokus. Die navorsing was in die vorm van \u2019n sekwensi\u00eble, insluitende gemengde metode ontwerp. Beide kwantitatiewe en kwalitatiewe benaderings is gevolg. \u2019n Vraelys is aan IT-onderwysers gestuur om die konteks in terme van taal en gemengde leer te bepaal. Dit is opgevolg deur kwalitatiewe navorsing in die vorm van onderhoude met die provinsiale en nasionele kenners van die vak IT en e-leer. Op grond van die literatuur en die twee ondersoeke is \u2019n konseptuele model ontwikkel. Die konseptuele model se effektiwiteit is gemeet deur middel van \u2019n kwasi-eksperimentele studie. \u2019n Vraelys is ook deur die respondente by die skole voltooi nadat die studie voltooi is. Daar is, na aanleiding van die toetsing van die effektiwiteit van die konseptuele model, bevind dat meertaligheid suksesvol deur die konseptuele model geakkommodeer en uitgebrei kan word.\n",

The recent data in the matter of teaching of languages in Europe point out that the number of students who acquire at least one foreign language in the school environment increases. In addition, through this work we intend to know the state of Spanish research on Bilingual Education in the last 20 years, thus, a bibliometric review on Bilingual Education in Spain is carried out. Therefore, it is clear that serious and rigorous educational programs are required, loaded with good practices in the assessment process and allowing decision making. Well-justified and well-researched systematic research on a large scale is needed, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies both in the collection and in the analysis of data, with longitudinal evaluations and as far as possible, with random samples.\nKeywords: bilingual education programs, bilingualism, bilingual education, acquisition of the second language, bibliometrics.\nRESUMEN:\nCon el fin de conocer las posiciones b\u00e1sicas respecto a la adquisici\u00f3n de una segunda lengua en el entorno escolar, se describen las trascendentales revisiones de estudios realizados y los principales resultados obtenidos en los metaan\u00e1lisis de mayor impacto desarrollados alrededor de los programas de educaci\u00f3n biling\u00fce en Estados Unidos y Europa. Los datos m\u00e1s recientes sobre la ense\u00f1anza de idiomas en Europa indican que aumenta el n\u00famero de alumnos que adquieren, al menos, una lengua extranjera en el entorno escolar. Adem\u00e1s, a trav\u00e9s de este trabajo se pretende conocer el estado de la investigaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola sobre la Educaci\u00f3n Biling\u00fce en los \u00faltimos 20 a\u00f1os, para ello, se realiza una revisi\u00f3n bibliom\u00e9trica sobre Educaci\u00f3n Biling\u00fce en Espa\u00f1a. Se concluye con el requerimiento de diagn\u00f3sticos serios y rigurosos de los programas educativos, cargados de buenas pr\u00e1cticas en el proceso de valoraci\u00f3n, y que posibiliten la toma de decisiones. Se precisan investigaciones sistem\u00e1ticas a gran escala, bien justificadas y fundamentadas, que combinen metodolog\u00edas cuantitativas y cualitativas tanto en la recogida, como en el an\u00e1lisis de datos, con evaluaciones longitudinales y en la medida de lo posible, con muestras aleatorias.\nPalabras clave: programas de educaci\u00f3n biling\u00fce, biling\u00fcismo, educaci\u00f3n biling\u00fce, adquisici\u00f3n de la segunda lengua, bibliometr\u00eda.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60214881, "asset_id": 40019777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 39631739, "first_name": "Elsa", "last_name": "Redondo-Diez Redondo-Diez", "domain_name": "ucavila", "page_name": "ElsaRedondoDiezRedondoDiez", "display_name": "Elsa Redondo-Diez Redondo-Diez", "profile_url": "https://ucavila.academia.edu/ElsaRedondoDiezRedondoDiez?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/39631739/40345081/33082984/s65_elsa.redondo-diez_redondo-diez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3355, "name": "Bibliometrics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bibliometrics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6482, "name": "Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Meta-Analysis_and_Systematic_Review?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 21447, "name": "Bilingual Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 51625, "name": "Educaci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educaci%C3%B3n?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 100062, "name": "Europa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Europa?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 120351, "name": "Espa\u00f1a", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Espa%C3%B1a?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 149480, "name": "Estados Unidos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Estados_Unidos?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 243896, "name": "An\u00e1lisis bibliom\u00e9trico", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Analisis_bibliometrico?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 376830, "name": "Universidad de Granada", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Universidad_de_Granada?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 33986307, "title": "Ingamanda parlu.

The paper establishes that the National Policy on Nigerian Education has given official recognition to the use of Nigerian languages as media of instruction at both pre-primary and lower primary stages of education. The paper also establishes that there is a sharp contrast between policy provisions and policy implementation. It examines the factors responsible for the non-implementation of the policy. Issues raised are discussed under the following sub-divisions: meaning of mother tongue, importance of mother tongue education in early childhood, language policy on early childhood education, implementation of the policy, factors militating against policy implementation, conclusion, and recommendations.\n\nKey words: Mother tongue, mother tongue education, early childhood, National Policy on Education.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63529038, "asset_id": 43257622, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 156619542, "first_name": "Kehinde", "last_name": "Ogunyemi", "domain_name": "aauaedu", "page_name": "KehindeOgunyemi", "display_name": "Kehinde Ogunyemi", "profile_url": "https://aauaedu.academia.edu/KehindeOgunyemi?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/156619542/43798510/34687654/s65_kehinde.ogunyemi.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 706285, "name": "The Role of Mother Tongue in Teaching a Foreign Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Role_of_Mother_Tongue_in_Teaching_a_Foreign_Language?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42143428, "title": "A cig\u00e1ny-magyar k\u00e9tnyelv\u0171 gyermekek nyelvi szocializ\u00e1ci\u00f3ja \u00f3vod\u00e1s korban.", "created_at": "2020-03-05T02:32:17.945-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42143428/A_cig%C3%A1ny_magyar_k%C3%A9tnyelv%C5%B1_gyermekek_nyelvi_szocializ%C3%A1ci%C3%B3ja_%C3%B3vod%C3%A1s_korban?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_42143428", "summary": "Az ember kultur\u00e1lis jellemz\u0151i k\u00f6z\u00e9 tartozik a nyelvhaszn\u00e1lat, amely minden emberi kult\u00far\u00e1ban l\u00e9tezik.

These include pedagogic staff in local authority schools, kindergartens and supplementary heritage language schools, and also freelance pedagogues working with children in the field of language development.\nThe project is considered necessary in order to improve the competitiveness of the education sector of Germany and other European Countries and to achieve the goals of the EU on\nlanguage diversity, as well as to overcome the generation gap. We need to support children\u2019s language development and the qualifications of people working with them, irrespective of\nwhether they are natives or migrants. The challenge for the future is to re-organise work programmes in kindergartens with regards to what effect the special communication and\ninteraction needs of bilinguals have on the professional education of staff, and to change organisations\u2019 attitudes to IVT and VET programmes. Therefore, the project will create a\ncompetence programme for the purpose of increasing the willingness for cross-cultural learning.\nThe project seeks to embed the topic of bilingualism and the development of skills and competences in vocational and professional education. Methods and didactic techniques\nwill be extracted from various approaches in order to improve the qualifications and career development of pedagogic staff in their professional duties and to support their employers\nin assisting them by using what has been learned.\nMultilingual ability is becoming increasingly a key skill in terms of personal development opportunities, inter-cultural understanding and the global consciousness of people in Europe and throughout the world. The process of the socialisation of young children is traditionally associated with the system of pre-school education. Developing the child\u2019s individual characteristics should involve preparing him or her for the demands of a dynamic, globalised world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38236218, "asset_id":

ABSTRACT The discussions of multilingualism in education have been continuing for a long time in our country. And as the basis of these discussions, there's the question of how the education and training activities will be carried out in a language other than Turkish. And, Kurdish's, as a sample of education language, starting the activities of education and training with Turkish, have been on the centre of these discussions. During certain periods, Kurdish language courses have been established and in the sequel, with the decision of The Council of Higher Education, the education and training activities in Kurdish language in the fields of bachelor's, master's and doctorate level at Mardin Artuklu, Mu\u015f Alparslan and Bing\u00f6l Universities have started. So, this study has been carried out on the students of Mu\u015f Alparslan University, Department of Kurdish Language and Literature and has taken the relationship between the multilingualism and other variables to the center. As the Department of Kurdish Language and Literature is a new department, the current number of students is 128, and the survey that we have prepared was conducted on 48 females and 80 males with the method of purposive sampling. These surveys that were carried out were analyzed and concluded with SPSS Data Analysis technique. And, in consideration of these statements, the question of, whether the multilingual education will be permanent or not after having the problems solved, have been analyzed comparatively with Chi-Square Test, Frequency and Cross Table, and a general evaluation was made regarding the results of these information.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56224540, "asset_id": 35451207,

"Informed by systemic functional linguistics (SFL), genre and register theory (Martin & Rose, 2008) in particular, this thesis aims to explore the nature of teacher talk in the case of an award winning English review lesson for Year 1 students in Shenzhen, China. Drawing on Rose\u2019s (2014) discourse semantic analytical framework, this thesis reveals the classroom discourse patterns and the use of local language (LL) (i.e. Mandarin) in terms of the pedagogic activities, relations and modalities. Findings showed both effectiveness and challenges that the teacher had when she controlled the linguistic resources (i.e. pedagogic metalanguages) of these three dimensions. The effectiveness is evident in the inclusive patterns of teacher-student interactive roles where both teacher and students take turns to play the initiating (dK1) roles, and the teacher\u2019s use of multimodal resources (visual and verbal modes) for recalling students\u2019 prior knowledge. However, little scaffolding or elaboration was provided in teacher talk around the learning tasks of review. LL was used mainly for regulative purposes rather than instructional ones. Considering that more than half of students\u2019 answers were rejected in this lesson and repeated mistakes are made till the end of the lesson, teacher talk appears to fail in preparing all students towards independent control of language. Findings highlight the importance of raising the teacher\u2019s awareness in planning explicit scaffolding teacher talk in the review lesson genre, and maintaining and expanding the meaning-making potential of LL for more instructional purposes (Mahboob & Lin, 2016, 2018). Further practitioner research is recommended to examine such pedagogical practice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59244950, "asset_id": 39123949, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 44164, "first_name": "Ahmar", "last_name": "Mahboob", "domain_name": "sydney", "page_name": "AhmarMahboob", "display_name": "Ahmar  Mahboob", "profile_url": "https://sydney.academia.edu/AhmarMahboob?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/44164/14123/13204/s65_ahmar.mahboob.png"}, {"id": 38174156, "first_name": "Kary Xunying", "last_name": "Guo", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "KaryGuo", "display_name": "Kary Xunying  Guo", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/KaryGuo?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/38174156/12153816/13536985/s65_kary.guo.jpg_oh_1f9b73ede160f2cb39e49a19176a8718_oe_57774d94"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1007, "name": "Teaching English as a Second Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_English_as_a_Second_Language?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5794, "name": "TESOL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/TESOL?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10611, "name": "Systemic Functional Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Systemic_Functional_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10612, "name": "Genre-based pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Genre-based_pedagogy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 18091, "name": "Educational Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Linguistics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 122894, "name": "Teacher Education in Teaching English to Speakers of Second/Foreign Languages (TESOL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education_in_Teaching_English_to_Speakers_of_Second_Foreign_Languages_TESOL_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1011585, "name": "SFL Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/SFL_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 38868578, "title": "Against Apartheid in Education and in Linguistics: The Case of Haitian Creole in Neo-Colonial Haiti 1 Michel DeGraff Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT-Haiti Initiative Akademi Krey\u00f2l Ayisyen", "created_at": "2019-04-19T13:36:07.122-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38868578/Against_Apartheid_in_Education_and_in_Linguistics_The_Case_of_Haitian_Creole_in_Neo_Colonial_Haiti_1_Michel_DeGraff_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_MIT_Haiti_Initiative_Akademi_Krey%C3%B2l_Ayisyen?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_38868578", "summary": "From 1st paragraph of paper: \"In Donaldo Macedo\u2019s words, this volume on Decolonizing Foreign Language Education instantiates \u201cengaged and militant scholarship\u201d against colonial methods in our classrooms.

During this period, many issues have been raised concerning its overall impact specifically on the learning and acquisition of one of the most challenging content areas, the mathematical skills of each learner. This study explored the experiences of teachers on the development of numeracy skills of primary pupils using MTB-MLE.  Teachers\u2019 experiences on the development of numeracy skills among primary pupils through MTB-MLE were a smooth flow of instruction in Mathematics when MTB-MLE is used as an LOI, enhanced engagement to instruction showing confidence, interest and enjoyment on the lesson, enriched parent-teacher partnership in building numeracy among the learners, difficulties for some pupils to count in Bicol, and difficulties met in localizing, contextualizing and translating teaching materials for mathematics instruction. Strategies teachers use to develop numeracy skills of pupils using MTB-MLE along pedagogy were the use of locally-made materials or objects found in the community, exposing pupils to more drills and exercises, attendance to seminars is helpful, Differentiated Instruction (DI), using the manipulative, real and tangible object as instructional materials, translation, using collaborative approach teaching; along with learning engagement were play-based instruction, simple gifts as rewards and attractive and purposeful instructional materials through ICT; assessment of learning were differentiated assessment activities, and play-based assessment and observation. There were different learning activities implemented to develop numeracy particularly in Contextualization such as experiential learning; Translation such as English nursery rhymes in Bicol; Indigenization such as the use of local materials as instructional materials and Localization such as involving the community in the learning process.

a firm grasp of the theories and practices of teaching language as native/non-native and the balanced development of speech in bilingual children of pre-school age in both (native and non-native) languages (knowledge of the laws, principles, approaches, methods and forms of teaching); and the readiness to develop and implement the training programmes in their groups. \n- ethno-methodological: awareness of the ethnically oriented model of native (native and non-native) language teaching, where several languages are present, and a readiness to use these ideas in practice;\n- ethno-linguistic: knowledge of the systems of both (native and non-native) languages, knowledge of the linguistic fundaments of natural and acquired bilingualism, as well as an understanding of language interference in the child's learning of a language as another native (non-native) language; the readiness to use that knowledge in teaching another native (non-native) language;\n- ethno-psychological: knowledge of the age-related psychological characteristics of a pre-school child\u2019s personality, shaped by his and his ancestors\u2019 ethnic background; the willingness to convey this knowledge to the parents of this particular child as well as other children;\n- ethno-cultural: awareness of the national and cultural traditions, customs, rites of the country of origin (ancestry) of the pupil; the ability to supplement this information through interaction with other pupils\u2019 parents and the diaspora in general, the media and the country of origin, etc., and include it in the content of teaching the language as a non-native (another native) language; knowledge of the culture of interethnic communication;\n- ethno-sociological: an awareness of the ethnic composition of the target language country, of ethno-cultural interactions, inter-ethnic relations and cross-cultural communication; an understanding of the functions of the language learned as native in the country of its native speakers and the national language policy; an awareness of how the target language functions on the world\u2019s cultural scene;\n- qualimetric: proficiency in the principles, methods and forms of test control (reasonable and appropriate for the given age group), and the ability to develop own test papers to test the knowledge, skills and abilities/competencies of pupils (not only linguistic but also extra-linguistic);\n- informational: an awareness of the sources of information search; knowledge of how to find and retrieve information on teaching the given language as a non-native (another native) language in the country concerned and abroad; the ability to select, critically evaluate, analyse, organise and convert information; the ability to present the information to other teachers, parents and society; to use up-to-date information and communication technologies in educational and training processes;\n- self-governing (and managerial) competence: the ability to exercise self-reflection of one\u2019s own professional activities in a pre-school establishment with multi-ethnic students; readiness to organise teamwork to meet the challenges of the educational establishment, taking into account the national educational and language policy of the country of the given language; competence in managing the group and organising the educational process.\nMastering these competencies will enable the teaching staff of a bilingual multicultural pre-school to realise their full potential in a variety of areas: teaching, research, consulting, expertise, cultural, educational, organisational, managerial. At the heart of the structure of the course is the principle of integrity, which demonstrates a comprehensive approach to teaching a language as a second (another native) language to bilingual children.\nThe structure of the concept includes four thematic modules. Their contents represent the most important aspects of pre-school (early elementary school) education and teaching a language as a non-native (another native) language to bilingual children aged 1 to 6 years.

The present paper engages with some facets of this history. It traces the formation and early circulation in its context of origin: Sweden's nascent fields of bilingualism research and minority education. The paper analyzes semilingualism as a 'traveling idea', which has moved through networks of actors over an extended period of time. In Sweden from the late 1950s to the early 1980s, semilingualism was a key theme a range of discursive exchanges. It circulated in scholarly discussions about bilingualism and linguistic competence, and surged as a central theme in political debates on minority education, immigration and language policy. It likewise recurred in the media, and in various articulations of public opinion. In the course these travels, the idea of semilingualism became more and more implicated in the processes of revising Sweden's policies on linguistic minorities. By the 1970s, as the paper argues, the idea had begun to function as a 'policy-driver', which aided the 1977 nationwide introduction of the school subject of mother tongue instruction (MTI) for minority students. While most linguists have come to dismiss semilingualism as a scientifically flawed concept, the idea of semilingualism, as the paper shows, had nevertheless a decisive impact in policy making. This impact is still visible the inclusion of MTI in Sweden's national curriculum. This societal impact of this sociolinguistic idea, as well as the lasting consequences thereof, points to the importance of a reflexive sociolinguistics, which takes interest in the life and afterlife of the ideas it produces. The paper contributes to this endeavor.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57757171, "asset_id": 37761470, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9356477, "first_name": "Working Papers in", "last_name": "Urban Language and Literacies", "domain_name": "kcl", "page_name": "WorkingPapersinUrbanLanguageLiteracies", "display_name": "Working Papers in Urban Language and Literacies", "profile_url": "https://kcl.academia.edu/WorkingPapersinUrbanLanguageLiteracies?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9356477/3012765/3538770/s65_working_papers_in.urban_language_and_literacies.jpg"}, {"id": 1836445, "first_name": "Linus", "last_name": "Sal\u00f6", "domain_name": "su-se", "page_name": "LinusSal\u00f6", "display_name": "Linus Sal\u00f6", "profile_url": "https://su-se.academia.edu/LinusSal%C3%B6?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1836445/1174324/16053810/s65_linus.sal_.jpg"}, {"id": 5304276, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Karlander", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "DavidKarlander", "display_name": "David Karlander", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/DavidKarlander?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5304276/2648495/20015137/s65_david.karlander.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1053, "name": "History of Ideas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Ideas?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 16164, "name": "Minority Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 27247, "name": "Swedish Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Swedish_Language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 38990076, "title": "Open Letter to the Honorable Federal Minister for Education, Pakistan", "created_at": "2019-05-01T00:06:26.000-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38990076/Open_Letter_to_the_Honorable_Federal_Minister_for_Education_Pakistan?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_38990076", "summary": "Pakistan, a country with a tremendous diversity of languages, has continued to systematically erode and undermine local and Indigenous communities by continuing colonial-era policies.

We compared the impacts of the PRIMR mother-tongue treatment group in two languages with those of another group that did not use mother tongue, but utilised the same instructional components. Results showed that assignment to the mother-tongue group had no additional benefits for English or Kiswahili learning outcomes beyond the non-mother-tongue group, and that the mother-tongue group had somewhat lower mathematics outcomes.

This is a four-year research project of the University of Cambridge in collaboration with the University of Reading, Jawaharlal Nehru University, The EFL University, and NIMHANS. It is funded jointly by the Department for International Development and the Economic and Social Research Council, UK, and has British Council, India, as one of its partners. The paper will include the rationale of the project and its methodology and task design.\n\nThe linguistic diversity of India in multilingual instructional settings and its impact on learning is being studied in a longitudinal manner for 24 months. Data is being collected from 1200 primary school children in grade four across three regions: Bihar, Delhi, and Hyderabad. A set of questionnaires are being used to identify \u2013 (i) bilingual classroom teaching and assessment practices and their effect on learning outcomes; (ii) teacher perceptions on role of mother tongue in education; and (iii) learners\u2019 linguistic and socio-economic profiles. \n\nA set of tasks are being used to (a) measure working memory span known to underpin bilingual learning outcomes, and (b) assess bilingual literacy and semantic fluency. Picture strip based bilingual narrative telling and retelling tasks is used to capture effective oral communicative strategies as well as instances of CALP transfer (Cummins 1986). Performance on the language tasks would help us study the development of academic language in the mother tongue for academic success in individual subject areas as maths and science.\n\nTo conclude, the methodology of the project is as an illustration of an innovative approach to support the use of mother tongue in instructional settings, to promote sustainable development in multilingual Indian learners, and to ensure inclusive and quality education under challenging socio-economic conditions.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56194786, "asset_id": 36288912, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88346, "first_name": "Lina", "last_name": "Mukhopadhyay", "domain_name": "efluniversity", "page_name": "LinaMukhopadhyay", "display_name": "Lina Mukhopadhyay", "profile_url": "https://efluniversity.academia.edu/LinaMukhopadhyay?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88346/235684/5594951/s65_lina.mukhopadhyay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1008, "name": "Second Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2313, "name": "Multi- & Bilingualism & Biliteracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multi-_and_Bilingualism_and_Biliteracy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34831, "name": "Bilingualism and cognition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_cognition?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 237346, "name": "Bilingual", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 63972525, "title": "Pedagogical Translanguaging (book - open access)", "created_at": "2021-12-13T08:19:21.073-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/63972525/Pedagogical_Translanguaging_book_open_access_?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_63972525", "summary": "Learning through the medium of a second or additional language is becoming very common in different parts of the world because of the increasing use of English as the language of instruction and the mobility of populations. This situation demands a specific approach that considers multilingualism as its core. Pedagogical translanguaging is a theoretical and instructional approach that aims at improving language and content competences in school contexts by using resources from the learner's whole linguistic repertoire. Pedagogical translanguaging is learner-centred and endorses the support and development of all the languages used by learners. It fosters the development of metalinguistic awareness by softening of boundaries between languages when learning languages and content. This Element looks at the way pedagogical translanguaging can be applied in language and content classes and how it can be valuable for the protection and promotion of minority languages.

minority's language and culture in education. Based on it, the Education Policies are formulated at different times. The school as an agency of standard monolingual ideology model set up by the colonial rules has not yet been able to articulate the spirit of the constitution and the policies of education, and there is a massive gap between the mind of the policy formulators and the teachers who implement it in the classroom. Teachers are limited to their syllabus and textbook transaction to prepare the children for examination offering the student with a load of information through mastering it through rote memory, that too in a language the children may not be familiar. The national goal of the thinkers to make the children national or global, drawing them out from the tribal hut remains in imagination. In the process of disseminating the national goal rarely reach in teacher training institutions, and the 'critical thinking 'remains outside of the teacher's comprehension. When the school is monolingual, and the children are multilingual, it becomes difficult for the system to incorporate the many languages and many cultures in the school curriculum. Another reason is that even the state wishes to implement it how to proceed to a new and untested multilingual approach unknown to the system is a big challenge. The policy provides the freedom to the states to prepare state curriculum in the context of the state-specific language and curriculum to represent the state identity in textbooks. The state authority picks up some cultural symbols from the states like great man, temples, and ecological species and, the heritage of cultural significance appropriate to state identity and inclusion in the curriculum. Briefly, this is also a macro curriculum. It does not include the sub-cultural system, which represents the majority of the population. The language and culture of a state do not mean all the languages and customs integrated into the state curriculum unless it is decentralized to districts and distinct sub-district linguistic areas. The integration also needs clarity of understanding on the national goal to put into the ideas and actions in a village classroom. A national curriculum means the national plan must represent a village curriculum at the school. How does this take place? The scope for inclusion of state specificity in the curriculum is possible at best in social sciences and literature and language. The states of India do have standard mathematics adopted universally. In case of science, the local nomenclature of biology or natural science is not connected with the terminology of science textbooks, and students grapple with the botanical words as if these objects are not in their environment. For instance, Bassia longifolia or basia latifolia is a botanical name for mahua, found in the book which is well known to tribal and rural students in their local terms, but not in the botanical term. When mango in Saora language is called 'uda' is known as 'amba' in Odia or Mangifera Indica in a botany textbook, students find it difficult to grasps the new word for their known objects. Teacher's stereotypes on expertise are limited to textbooks for accountability of student's achievement in the examination.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64348857, "asset_id": 44014158, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1162432, "first_name": "Dr.Mahendra", "last_name": "Mishra", "domain_name": "asgporissa", "page_name": "wwwfolklorefoundationorg", "display_name": "Dr.Mahendra K U M A R Mishra", "profile_url": "https://asgporissa.academia.edu/wwwfolklorefoundationorg?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1162432/411474/1554910/s65_mahendra.mishra.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2636358, "name": "mother-tongue based multilingual education (MTB MLE)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/mother-tongue_based_multilingual_education_MTB_MLE_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 41477291, "title": "GUATEMALAN IXIL COMMUNITY TEACHER PERSPECTIVES OF LANGUAGE REVITALIZATION AND MOTHER TONGUE-BASED INTERCULTURAL BILINGUAL EDUCATION", "created_at": "2019-12-31T20:10:02.115-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/41477291/GUATEMALAN_IXIL_COMMUNITY_TEACHER_PERSPECTIVES_OF_LANGUAGE_REVITALIZATION_AND_MOTHER_TONGUE_BASED_INTERCULTURAL_BILINGUAL_EDUCATION?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_41477291", "summary": "Recent scholarship indicates several benefits of mother tongue education (MTE) in supporting student learning. Within one Mayan community in Guatemala, Ixil is the mother tongue spoken at home and faces extinction due to Indigenous oppression and genocide. This qualitative case study highlights efforts of 13 teachers and administrators at one primary school that took up the dual task of offering MTE and revitalizing the Ixil language. In order to gain a better understanding of Indigenous teachers' perceptions of language, culture, and MTE, this research was guided by the following questions: (1) How do teachers perceive their own understanding of attitudes and beliefs about language and culture? (2) How do they perceive their role in MTE and language revitalization? (3) Are teachers critical in their understanding of the importance of language revitalization and best practices for language pedagogy?

Languages in India have always thrived though at times many races and religions came into conflict and were ousted. Though the states in modern India were reorganised on linguistic basis in 1956 yet in contrast to the European notion of one language one nation, majority of the states have more than one official language. The Linguistic Survey of India (LSI) conducted by Grierson between 1866 and 1927 identified 179 languages and 544 dialects. The first census after India attained its independence (1951) listed 845 languages including dialects, out of which more than 100,000 persons spoke 60 languages/dialects. The 1991 Census identified 216 mother tongues were identified while in 2001 their number was 234. 96.29% of the total population of India has one of the Schedule VIII languages as their \"mother tongue\" and the rest (3.71%) speak the languages not listed in the Schedule VIII of the Constitution of India. Eighty five mother tongues are grouped under the Schedule VIII languages and 131 mother tongues are grouped under the other 96 non-scheduled languages. As per the Third All India Education Survey, 58 languages find a place in the school curricula and 47 are used in public administration at one level or another. Newspapers are published in 87 languages and there are radio broadcasts in 91 languages. The Indian education system is truly multilingual in its character as it does not ignore the importance of mother tongue in teaching and learning at the primary and secondary level. The three-language formula widely accepted in the country aims at developing and strengthening the multilingual character of the nation. Various public agencies run schools in bilingual and multilingual schools to cater to the needs of various linguistic communities. However, higher education system in India impedes multilingualism. Though most of the Indian universities have English and local languages as media of instruction yet the quality of graduates opting for an Indian language as the medium of instruction has always been a matter of concern as there has been a dearth of sufficient number of high quality textbooks and reference materials keeping pace with times in Indian languages. In professional courses like medical and engineering English as the medium of instruction has been enjoying a predominant position because of our colonial past and non-availability of not only the teaching/research materials but also the experts/teachers ready to deliver in Indian languages. Therefore, a large amount of exchequer goes into importing books in higher education from the English speaking world. According the Constitution it is imperative on the \" Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India \u2026 by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages. \" However, the books translated into Hindi mainly from English have found favour with neither the students nor the teachers.

The present paper engages with some facets of this history. It traces the formation and early circulation in its context of origin: Sweden's nascent fields of bilingualism research and minority education. The paper analyzes semilingualism as a 'traveling idea', which has moved through networks of actors over an extended period of time. In Sweden from the late 1950s to the early 1980s, semilingualism was a key theme a range of discursive exchanges. It circulated in scholarly discussions about bilingualism and linguistic competence, and surged as a central theme in political debates on minority education, immigration and language policy. It likewise recurred in the media, and in various articulations of public opinion. In the course these travels, the idea of semilingualism became more and more implicated in the processes of revising Sweden's policies on linguistic minorities. By the 1970s, as the paper argues, the idea had begun to function as a 'policy-driver', which aided the 1977 nationwide introduction of the school subject of mother tongue instruction (MTI) for minority students. While most linguists have come to dismiss semilingualism as a scientifically flawed concept, the idea of semilingualism, as the paper shows, had nevertheless a decisive impact in policy making. This impact is still visible the inclusion of MTI in Sweden's national curriculum. This societal impact of this sociolinguistic idea, as well as the lasting consequences thereof, points to the importance of a reflexive sociolinguistics, which takes interest in the life and afterlife of the ideas it produces. The paper contributes to this endeavor.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1836445, "first_name": "Linus", "last_name": "Sal\u00f6", "domain_name": "su-se", "page_name": "LinusSal\u00f6", "display_name": "Linus Sal\u00f6", "profile_url": "https://su-se.academia.edu/LinusSal%C3%B6?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1836445/1174324/16053810/s65_linus.sal_.jpg"}, {"id": 5304276, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Karlander", "domain_name": "hku-hk", "page_name": "DavidKarlander", "display_name": "David Karlander", "profile_url": "https://hku-hk.academia.edu/DavidKarlander?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5304276/2648495/20015137/s65_david.karlander.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1008, "name": "Second Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Second_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1053, "name": "History of Ideas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Ideas?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1237, "name": "Social Sciences", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Sciences?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 3723, "name": "History of Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Science?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 20073, "name": "Bruno Latour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bruno_Latour?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 21447, "name": "Bilingual Language Acquisition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Language_Acquisition?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 32566, "name": "Historical sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Historical_sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 46948, "name": "Bilingualism and Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_Multilingualism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 47268, "name": "Bilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 64633, "name": "Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Society?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 69068, "name": "Language politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_politics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 578214, "name": "Impact of Social Sciences and Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1744493, "name": "Science and Technology Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Science_and_Technology_Studies?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 10087576, "title": "(2010) Bilingual Education in Flanders: Policy and Press Debate (1999-2006)", "created_at": "2015-01-09T06:49:04.339-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10087576/_2010_Bilingual_Education_in_Flanders_Policy_and_Press_Debate_1999_2006_?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_10087576", "summary": "Although Belgium is officially trilingual (Dutch, French, and German), its legislation does not allow for bilingual education (BE).

Considering Belgium's linguistic and educational policies, the authors analyze the media coverage of BE in Flanders by looking at the region's major newspapers for the pivotal period 1999\u20132006. Their content-analytical approach reveals a fairly positive bias toward BE. Yet, Flemish newspapers also reflect a tendency described by Brisk (2005): the tension between the promotion of BE for the majority (i.e., native speakers of Dutch and French) and its rejection for minorities (i.e., immigrants). Nevertheless, the fear of \u201cfrenchification\u201d remains prominent in articles on majority-language BE.

An overview of the multilingual context, within which the research was done, is provided through a brief historical background of language accommodation and recognition in South Africa in general, and then specifically in schools. Attention is paid to the role of English in contrast to that of the other official languages as well as code switching as a method of accommodating multilingualism. Details are also provided on the language requirements of the subject Information Technology. Through questionnaires completed by Information Technology teachers and an interview with the provincial subject specialist the language profiles of teachers and learners are explored and current multilingual practice is described. It is determined that Information Technology classes are multilingual by  nature and that some accommodation of multilingualism is done by teachers through code switching, but that not all the teachers are able to do this. Finally, based on the response of the provincial subject specialist, it is clear that increased multilingual accommodation is necessary in Information Technology as adequate knowledge of English is required in addition to mother tongue instruction.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 6858397, "asset_id": 997389, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 319563, "first_name": "Jako", "last_name": "Olivier", "domain_name": "col", "page_name": "JakoOlivier", "display_name": "Jako Olivier", "profile_url": "https://col.academia.edu/JakoOlivier?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/319563/78817/14416994/s65_jako.olivier.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 491, "name": "Information Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Technology?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6575, "name": "Teaching and Learning Programming", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_and_Learning_Programming?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7259, "name": "Code-Switching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Code-Switching?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 7454, "name": "Information Communication Technology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Information_Communication_Technology?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 7820, "name": "Teacher Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Research?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 9823, "name": "Multicultural Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multicultural_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 18091, "name": "Educational Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Linguistics?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 38881, "name": "Language Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 55515, "name": "Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 97125, "name": "South African multilingual education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_African_multilingual_education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 130650, "name": "Multilingual education in minority contexts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingual_education_in_minority_contexts?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 131779, "name": "Code Switching", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Code_Switching?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 40147587, "title": "Handbook of Educational Linguistics", "created_at": "2019-08-22T07:59:45.139-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40147587/Handbook_of_Educational_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_40147587", "summary": " The Handbook of Educational Linguistics is a dynamic, scientifically grounded overview revealing the complexity of this growing field while remaining accessible for students, researchers, language educators, curriculum developers, and educational policy makers.\n\n-A single volume overview of educational linguistics, written by leading specialists in its many relevant fields\n\n-Takes into account the diverse theoretical foundations, core themes, major findings, and practical applications of educational linguistics\n\n-Highlights the multidisciplinary reach of educational linguistics\n\n-Reflects the complexity of this growing field, whilst remaining accessible to a wide audience\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 60365213, "asset_id": 40147587, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83247182, "first_name": "Francis M.", "last_name": "Hult", "domain_name": "umbc", "page_name": "FrancisMHult", "display_name": "Francis M.

Cada dia mais fam\u00edlias, escolas e comunidades bil\u00edngues surgem, e este cen\u00e1rio prop\u00f5e uma nova abordagem para as fam\u00edlias, educadores e sociedade como um todo, e exige da sociedade cient\u00edfica o desenvolvimento de mais estudos no campo. Nesse sentido, este trabalho tem como objetivo analisar a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o da linguagem na educa\u00e7\u00e3o bil\u00edngue na primeira inf\u00e2ncia. Nosso objetivo geral \u00e9 analisar se a n\u00e3o-separa\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00f3digos lingu\u00edsticos no ambiente de uma crian\u00e7a afetaria negativamente suas habilidades produtivas em uma ou ambas as l\u00ednguas; um problema j\u00e1 discutido por outros pesquisadores, tais como Huerta-Macias (1983). Para tal fim, nos basearemos os estudos no campo do bilinguismo de e desenvolvimento da linguagem de Vygostky (1962,1978). Entendendo que \u00e9 invi\u00e1vel analisar uma grande quantidade de crian\u00e7as bil\u00edngues, o corpus desta pesquisa \u00e9 baseado em g\u00eameos que est\u00e3o sendo criados de forma bil\u00edngue desde a idade de 3 meses pela m\u00e3e, que \u00e9 professora de ingl\u00eas. Todavia, n\u00e3o houve o uso regrado do princ\u00edpio \"One Person-One Language\", pois a m\u00e3e iria variar entre o ingl\u00eas e Portugu\u00eas com as crian\u00e7as em diferentes contextos e situa\u00e7\u00f5es. Vamos nos concentrar no processo de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de linguagem no per\u00edodo entre 1 a 3 anos de idade. Os dados foram coletados por meio de grava\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00eddeo. Conclu\u00edmos que as crian\u00e7as podem ser consideradas bil\u00edngues precoces e n\u00e3o-balanceados, de acordo com a classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de Butler e Hakuta (2004) e que o desenvolvimento do padr\u00e3o de discurso veio de sua pr\u00f3pria e crescente consci\u00eancia sociolingu\u00edstica.

Without suggesting that language\r\nrepresents some sort of silver bullet solution to this complex conflict, I argue\r\nthat anyone pursuing peaceful, political resolutions to Thailand\u2019s southern\r\nimpasse must be more informed about language policy, linguistic justice, and how\r\nlinguistic repertoires are linked to inequality. My interests in this paper are\r\ntheoretical (rather than empirical). The first of this paper\u2019s two substantive\r\nsections describes the nature of Thailand's (diverse) linguistic landscape and\r\nhow the language policies pursued by Bangkok resemble those of other states\r\nbetween South and Southeast Asia. In light of Bangkok\u2019s policies towards\r\nsouthern Malays resemble those that impacted Lao and Khmer-speaking\r\nBuddhists in the northeast provinces, I suggest that some dynamics in South\r\nThailand need to be de-exceptionalized. In the section the follows, I interact\r\nwith theoretical treatments of language and religion in ethno-nationalism,\r\nand linguistic injustice. My argument is that anyone seeking peaceful political\r\nresolutions in South Thailand \u2013 where a nation linguistic minority is connected to\r\nthe Malay cosmopolis \u2013 must address the politically sensitive issue of Thailand\u2019s\r\ndiscriminatory language policy that has led to widespread language loss.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56797406, "asset_id": 36845091,

More specifically, it investigates the linguistic impact of migration and the phenomena of language maintenance and shift based on the example of Albanian immigrant, primary school students in Greece. The data collected was based on interviews through which the participants\u2019 linguistic biographies were elicited and from recordings of informal communication among them. The aim of the present study is to identify the participants\u2019 patterns of communication in the home and school environment, investigate the incentives, the rationales and the conditions these patterns of communication stem from, as well as the participants\u2019 attitude towards Albanian. Results revealed that L1 transmission is problematic for the Late Bilinguals\u2019 group, while the possibility of non-acquisition of Albanian remains a reality for the participants who were born in Greece or came to Greece in infancy.

This\npaper explores this phenomenon, using reading assessment data for 2,000 Kenyan\nchildren in two or three languages: English, Kiswahili and one of two mother\ntongues, Dholuo or Gikuyu. The assessment data allowed us to compare reading\nand comprehension rates across languages. The data indicated that many children\ncould read English words more easily than words in Kiswahili or their mother\ntongue; nevertheless, their reading comprehension was significantly lower in\nEnglish than in Kiswahili, Dholuo or Gikuyu. The paper concludes that\nemphasising English reading fluency is an inefficient route to gaining reading\ncomprehension skills because pupils are actually attaining minimal oral reading\nfluency in English and only modest comprehension skills in their own languages.\nThe evidence also demonstrates that Kenya\u2019s national language policy of mother\ntongue as a medium of instruction in the early primary grades is consistently\nignored in practice.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37397679, "asset_id": 12075506, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Hence, this study aims to address this gap by examining how exposure to a second language (L2) impacts proficiency on the first (L1) among 100 Tagalog-English bilingual children aged 4 to 7 years in the Philippines. A language exposure assessment adapted from DeAnda et al.\u2019s (2016) Language Exposure Assessment Tool (LEAT) was used to measure cumulative L2 exposure (English), while grammar, vocabulary, and spelling proficiency tests in Tagalog were used to measure L1 proficiency. Multiple and linear regression analyses showed that (a) overall L2 exposure does not impact overall L1 proficiency [F(1, 98) = 3.89; p = 0.051]; although (b) L2 exposure negatively influenced L1 vocabulary [F(1, 98) = 5.04; p = 0.027; \u03b2 = -0.22] and grammar [F(1, 98) = 7.40; p = 0.007; \u03b2 = -0.27], but not spelling [F(1, 98) = 0.09; p = 0.766; \u03b2 = -0.03]. Thus, on the query regarding the influence of L2 exposure on L1 proficiency, evidence from Tagalog-English bilingual children showed that exposure to L2 English translated in negative outcomes on two measures of L1 skills, i.e., Tagalog vocabulary and Tagalog grammar.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67841478, "asset_id": 49504310, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3475787, "first_name": "Edward Jay", "last_name": "Quinto", "domain_name": "mapua", "page_name": "EdwardJayQuinto", "display_name": "Edward Jay M Quinto", "profile_url": "https://mapua.academia.edu/EdwardJayQuinto?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3475787/1180282/28932571/s65_edward_jay.quinto.jpg"}, {"id": 198684929, "first_name": "Paula Enxi", "last_name": "Pacheco", "domain_name": "dlsu", "page_name": "PaulaEnxiDVPacheco", "display_name": "Paula Enxi D V .

However, the implementation of SHRP is marked by the fact that it is a donor-led reform that is perceived by teachers as an external intervention not well suited for Ugandan classroom realities. Our research is a multi-layered analysis of how teachers perceive the reform as its grassroots implementers. We ask how SHRP's pedagogical emphasis on child-centred pedagogy is linked to it being donor-funded, and how teachers translate this perceived link into their classroom practices. We trace the links between the policy, classroom, and community levels to make concrete suggestions on how the SHRP program can benefit from teachers' resources and creativity, while highlighting which aspects of mother tongue education the Ugandan Government needs to prioritize on a national level, and which aspects need to be better adjusted on a regional basis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65475313, "asset_id": 44945942, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4477618, "first_name": "Ruth", "last_name": "Wenske", "domain_name": "huji", "page_name": "RuthWenske", "display_name": "Ruth S Wenske", "profile_url": "https://huji.academia.edu/RuthWenske?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4477618/1837021/43478292/s65_ruth.wenske.jpg"}, {"id": 6603961, "first_name": "Medadi", "last_name": "Ssentanda", "domain_name": "mak", "page_name": "MSsentanda", "display_name": "Medadi  Ssentanda", "profile_url": "https://mak.academia.edu/MSsentanda?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6603961/3989251/81874561/s65_medadi.ssentanda.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 4878, "name": "Learner Centered Approach", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Learner_Centered_Approach?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8828, "name": "Uganda", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uganda?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 154993, "name": "International Aid and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Aid_and_Development?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 188281, "name": "Education in Sub Saharan Africa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_in_Sub_Saharan_Africa?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 39019790, "title": "In the name of Punjabiyyat", "created_at": "2019-05-05T06:13:49.895-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/39019790/In_the_name_of_Punjabiyyat?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_39019790", "summary": "Every year\u2019s Mother Language Day reminds us of the linguistic brutality and suppression of the state against Punjabi", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59130211, "asset_id": 39019790, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15372682, "first_name": "Mahmood", "last_name": "Awan", "domain_name": "uet", "page_name": "MahmoodAwan", "display_name": "Mahmood Awan", "profile_url": "https://uet.academia.edu/MahmoodAwan?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/15372682/4147167/28796698/s65_mahmood.awan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 807, "name": "Philosophy Of Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Language?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134234, "name": "Punjabi Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi_Literature?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 150730, "name": "Mother-Tongue Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother-Tongue_Literacy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 259466, "name": "Punjabi literature &language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi_literature_and_language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 290624, "name": "Mother Tongue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 417504, "name": "Language Movement of Bangladesh", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Movement_of_Bangladesh?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 611781, "name": "Punjabi", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Punjabi?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 35341182, "title": "Susheel Kumar Sharma, \u201cMother Tongue, Multilingualism and Language Planning in India\u201d.

Moreover, while the policies of both states devalue skills in mother tongues other than the legitimate language of each society , this position is more pronounced in the Danish context. The article explores the two state's position on MTI, as expressed in policy as well as in discourse produced in the political and academic field of each state. It subscribes to Pierre Bourdieu's framework, within which state policy is conceived as the product of historical struggle and cross-field effects.

South East Asian neighbours, the Philippines is characterised by individual and collective multilingualism, being home to over 180 individual languages (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2013, p. 25). Unlike its neighbours, however, the Philippines is the first nation in the region to legislate and implement Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB MLE) nationally. As such, the Philippines represents a valuable example for other countries as they attempt to develop language-in-education policy and put it into practice. Employing grounded theory case study methodology, this dissertation examines Filipino MTB MLE policies and their implementation in Mindanao, one of the most remote and linguistically diverse regions of the country. Through policy analysis and semi-structured interviews with key informants, this study presents findings for three key research questions which evolved through the study. This study has not tested the validity of MTB MLE as an educational alt...", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76305549, "asset_id": 64129137, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7958299, "first_name": "Naomi", "last_name": "Fillmore", "domain_name": "uq", "page_name": "NaomiFillmore", "display_name": "Naomi Fillmore", "profile_url": "https://uq.academia.edu/NaomiFillmore?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7958299/3305944/31026702/s65_naomi.fillmore.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1200, "name": "Languages and Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_and_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 9822, "name": "Education Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Policy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 148265, "name": "Education Reform", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_Reform?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 62601342, "title": "Desarrollo de la competencia sociopragm\u00e1tica en la ense\u00f1anza de espa\u00f1ol como Lengua Materna en Suecia", "created_at": "2021-11-28T01:44:41.895-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62601342/Desarrollo_de_la_competencia_sociopragm%C3%A1tica_en_la_ense%C3%B1anza_de_espa%C3%B1ol_como_Lengua_Materna_en_Suecia?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_62601342", "summary": "The use of sociopragmatics in the teaching of Spanish as a mother tongue in Sweden.\nStudies on the incidence of socio-pragmatic competence in the teaching of mother tongues are very scarce. The aims of this qualitative study are two folded: First, we want to describe teachers\u2019 use of socio-pragmatics in the subject of Spanish as a mother tongue. In addition, we want to determine the degree of use of socio-pragmatics in this specific subject. In order to carry out this study, a mixed method was applied. The results were obtained by means of a survey; classroom\u2019s observations and semi structured interviews. It was assumed that there would be a socio-pragmatic approach in the teaching of mother languages but it was found to be different in each class and it depended on the teachers\u2019 academic training and on the teaching materials, which do not always met the requirements of the subject\u2019s curriculum.\nThe present study assumes that there is a big difference between what appears in the curricular plan and what happens inside the classroom. Socio-pragmatic aspects are not sufficiently reflected in the pedagogical practice due to two main reasons: on the one hand, internal and external factors that affect teaching negatively; and, on the other, the fact that teachers are not sufficiently acquainted with socio-pragmatic views. The results show that in all classes the teaching of socio-pragmatic aspects works although mostly intuitively. The degree of employment of socio-pragmatics is different depending on the knowledge that the teacher has about socio-pragmatic competence. Finally, yet importantly, it was found that various internal and external factors affect mother tongue teachers. These factors have a big impact on the properly development of the subject and, specifically, on the teaching of socio-pragmatic competence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75309234, "asset_id": 62601342, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 102413658, "first_name": "Milagros", "last_name": "Castro - Simono", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MilagrosCastroSimono", "display_name": "Milagros Castro - Simono", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MilagrosCastroSimono?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/102413658/28367835/26543112/s65_milagros.castro_-_simono.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2238, "name": "Pragmatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pragmatics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 37471, "name": "Intercultural Pragmatics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Pragmatics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 234228, "name": "Pragm\u00e1tica", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Pragm%C3%A1tica?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 290624, "name": "Mother Tongue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1838276, "name": "\"one Mother Tongue Plus Two Foreign Languages\" Principle", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/_one_Mother_Tongue_Plus_Two_Foreign_Languages_Principle?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 59518960, "title": "Voice of Bakur / Preparations for Pre-school Education Inclusive of Children\u2019s Oral Literature", "created_at": "2021-10-22T08:07:39.896-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/59518960/Voice_of_Bakur_Preparations_for_Pre_school_Education_Inclusive_of_Children_s_Oral_Literature?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_59518960", "summary": "This study is based on fieldwork.

This research, conducted between late June and mid-September 2014, also aimed at recording and archiving Kurdish folklore in Northern Kurdistan. The overall objective of this broad study is to adopt collected folkloric products for the use in pre-school education.\n\nWe aimed to revise and present every story preserving features peculiar to its place of origin. Along with the stories, riddles, epigrams, nursery rhymes, games and other literary products are to be parts of the same educational set. Once materials for pre-school education are ready it will be time to develop program for older children.19 Furthermore, an anthology comprising of all the collected works is to be prepared. By doing so, works will be preserved in two forms: in the dialect of the recording and in written form in Zaza and Kurmanji Kurdish. At the later stage such publication will be presented to educational institutions and children.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 73400072, "asset_id": 59518960, "asset_type": "Work",

chacune des situations d\u00e9crites, \u00e0 interroger les conditions d'un tel enseignement concernant les langue dites r\u00e9gionale en France au 21 e si\u00e8cle. Les diff\u00e9rents chapitres explorent ces conditions, principalement \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole primaire, pour le basque, le breton, le catalan, le corse, l'occitan, et pour les langues d'Alsace (allemand standard et alsacien). Un chapitre est \u00e9galement consacr\u00e9 au flamand de l'arrondissement de Dunkerque, bien qu'aucun enseignement bilingue n'y soit dispens\u00e9. Le gallo, dans la m\u00eame configuration, est \u00e9voqu\u00e9 dans le chapitre sur le breton. Chacun de ces textes pose le contexte et les probl\u00e9matiques locales et nationales dans lesquelles le bilinguisme scolaire est pens\u00e9, apportant un \u00e9clairage actuel sur ce type d'enseignement en France. Au-del\u00e0 des conditions de possibilit\u00e9 de ces enseignements, c'est aussi le sens d'un investissement personnel et institutionnel, mat\u00e9riel et symbolique, dans ce type d'enseignement que ces textes nous permettent de questionner. Chaque texte parle pour lui-m\u00eame et nous ne proposons pas de les r\u00e9sumer ici. Cette introduction sera l'occasion de saisir les enjeux communs aux enseignements bilingues en langue r\u00e9gionale, ainsi que, dans un second temps, de questionner et de discuter les divers enjeux auxquels les praticiens font face. En conclusion, nous chercherons \u00e0 poser les bases de questionnements critiques futurs \u00e0 partir des th\u00e9matiques que les chapitres qui suivent nous invitent \u00e0 explorer, \u00e0 interroger et par dessus tout, \u00e0 probl\u00e9matiser.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58732700, "asset_id": 38653749, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Furthermore, we will discuss formal, semantic and pragmatic aspects of phraseologies and use the theoretical framework to classify the results of phraseological and terminographical studies from the Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia (UFU) Scientific Initiation and the Federal University of Jata\u00ed (UFJ) Pr\u00e1tica como Componente Curricular. The English-Portuguese phraseologies were extracted from corpora of TV series subtitles, such as Bones, Game of Thrones and Star Trek, 30 being selected for this paper discussion. The methodology adopted was Corpus Linguistics (CL) and WordSmith Tools 6.0 was the lexical analysis program used. We started by selecting the TV series, then Portuguese and English subtitles were compiled from the internet. Afterwards, word lists were made; we chose terms and verbs that allowed the selection and analysis of phraseologies from TV series by using the Concord tool and most of the analyzed terms were registered on VoTec (FROMM, 2007), an online platform for terminological and terminographical research open to public access. The students that carried out these researches are English Language and Literature undergraduates, and the target audience are translators, language specialists, teachers, students and TV series fans. Some advantages of these researches were: (1) analysis of the real use of English language by native speakers in authentic communicative contexts; (2) access of undergraduates to CL and phraseological/terminographical studies; and (3) training to develop English language teaching material.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59494342, "asset_id": 39352913, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 88350420, "first_name": "Joel Victor Reis", "last_name": "Lisboa", "domain_name": "ufu", "page_name": "JoelLisboa", "display_name": "Joel Victor Reis Lisboa", "profile_url": "https://ufu.academia.edu/JoelLisboa?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/88350420/25016066/46569114/s65_joel_victor_reis.lisboa.jpg"}, {"id": 262121, "first_name": "M\u00e1rcio Issamu", "last_name": "Yamamoto", "domain_name": "ufg", "page_name": "M\u00e1rcioIssamuYamamoto", "display_name": "M\u00e1rcio Issamu Yamamoto", "profile_url": "https://ufg.academia.edu/M%C3%A1rcioIssamuYamamoto?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/262121/486800/612872/s65_m_rcio_issamu.yamamoto.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5832, "name": "Terminology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Terminology?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15674, "name": "Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 136990, "name": "Phraseologie", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phraseologie?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 606251, "name": "Phraseology, Idiomaticity, Formulaic Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phraseology_Idiomaticity_Formulaic_Language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 680442, "name": "Phraseology, Lexical Semantics , Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phraseology_Lexical_Semantics_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1108343, "name": "Translation of Phraseological Units", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_of_Phraseological_Units?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1307686, "name": "Semantics and Phraseology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Semantics_and_Phraseology?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 3266195, "name": "Phraseology Portuguese-English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Phraseology_Portuguese-English?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 28963238, "title": "Countering the 'Two-Solitude' Instructional Mode in ESL Writing", "created_at": "2016-10-06T08:19:01.117-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/28963238/Countering_the_Two_Solitude_Instructional_Mode_in_ESL_Writing?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_28963238", "summary": "Bilingual programmes in India make space for teaching two or more languages, but instruction of each language is mostly done in that specific language.

Fewer people are speaking traditional Indigenous languages as their first language, while more are speaking new Indigenous languages as their first languages. At the same time, the diaspora of speakers of Indigenous languages in cities such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Adelaide is growing, as people seek better access to services. is means that the chances for communities to maintain their traditional Indigenous languages are rapidly diminishing.\nLanguage is used both to communicate ideas (communicative rights) and to express associations (identity rights).  Communication rights include the right to access information in a language one understands. People cannot make the most of self-determination if they do not have access to the best information to make the best decisions for themselves and their family, because it is only presented in a language they do not understand.  \nSince the beginning of the self-determination policy, identity rights have been strengthened. Governments and communities are investing in Indigenous language revival, and in emblematic gestures such as naming places with Indigenous names and using Indigenous languages at public events. However, with respect to communication rights, the picture is patchier.  Major polices, such as the Intervention, were implemented without proper consideration of communication needs. Subsequently, interpreter services in Indigenous languages have expanded, and governments have made more effort to put information in Indigenous languages. But children still have only limited access to education in their mother-tongue along with proper explicit teaching of English. e move to monolingual English immersion education has been accompanied by the reduction of opportunities for remote Indigenous communities to obtain tertiary training (whether as teachers, interpreters or health workers) in their home communities. These two factors have greatly reduced the opportunities for people living in remote Indigenous communities to access information in order to make the best decisions for themselves and their families. At the same time, the aims of giving children good access to English, and to the content of education, have not so far been achieved. \n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64386619, "asset_id": 44045776, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47124871, "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Simpson", "domain_name": "anu-au", "page_name": "JaneSimpson", "display_name": "Jane Simpson", "profile_url": "https://anu-au.academia.edu/JaneSimpson?f_ri=28221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16164, "name": "Minority Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_Languages?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38923, "name": "Language Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Policy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 52579, "name": "Language rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_rights?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 52580, "name": "Minority language rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_language_rights?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 59995, "name": "Translation and Interpreting", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Translation_and_Interpreting?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 139542, "name": "Communication Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication_Rights?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 187034, "name": "Australian Aboriginal History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_History?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 226456, "name": "Indigenous Self-Determination", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Self-Determination?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 279173, "name": "Australian Aboriginal Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_Aboriginal_Languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1033739, "name": "Minority and Language Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Minority_and_Language_Rights?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 35815522, "title": "Margarito's Forest / El bosque de don Margarito by Andy Carter, Allison Havens (Illustrator).

It follows Don Margarito\u2019s lifelong work of planting and nurturing trees after his village in Guatemala is chased from their ancestral land by a right wing military. The Maya carry their love for the forest with them, creating a beautiful forest in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe lovely illustrations show Maya children learning to plant trees and to nurture them until the trees are tall and sturdy. The book can provide opportunities for a conversation with children about their own community and the impact of the heavy carbon footprint that is threatening ecosystems everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere are helpful study questions for teachers, librarians and parents about Don Margarito and his village. The book also includes a brief explanation of the Maya numbering system, which is likely the first civilization to introduce the use of zero in counting. Children will learn how to count in K\u2019iche\u2019 and to compare their number system with our own Arabic system.\r\n\r\nhttp://hardballpress.com/margarito.html\r\n\r\nAdditional free teaching resources available: https://www.margaritosforest.com", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63546233, "asset_id": 35815522, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 190877, "first_name": "Garry", "last_name": "Sparks", "domain_name": "gmu", "page_name": "GarrySparks", "display_name": "Garry  Sparks", "profile_url": "https://gmu.academia.edu/GarrySparks?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/190877/46167/15016991/s65_garry.sparks.jpg"}, {"id": 49249, "first_name": "Andy", "last_name": "Carter", "domain_name": "roosevelt", "page_name": "AndyCarter", "display_name": "Andy Carter", "profile_url": "https://roosevelt.academia.edu/AndyCarter?f_ri=28221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2313, "name": "Multi- & Bilingualism & Biliteracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multi-_and_Bilingualism_and_Biliteracy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11597, "name": "Children's Media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Childrens_Media?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11879, "name": "Native American Literature (Literature)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Native_American_Literature_Literature_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 33624, "name": "K'iche'an Mayan Languages and Cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kichean_Mayan_Languages_and_Cultures?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 46948, "name": "Bilingualism and Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_Multilingualism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 2437197, "name": "Maya Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maya_Literature?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 14206064, "title": "Russian as Native, Non-native, one of Natives and Foreign Languages: Questions of Terminology and Measurement of Levels of Proficiency", "created_at": "2015-07-20T04:53:50.509-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/14206064/Russian_as_Native_Non_native_one_of_Natives_and_Foreign_Languages_Questions_of_Terminology_and_Measurement_of_Levels_of_Proficiency?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_14206064", "summary": "The 21st century has brought globalization of people\u2019s lives and education.

However, the Netherlands\u2019 evaluation of the harmonization process with a one-sided policy led to the abolition of mother tongue lessons. It is a very simple human right for Turks living in the Netherlands to want to improve their Turkish language skills in order to protect their national identity, as well as their Dutch language proficiency. The Turks living in the Netherlands want to provide their children with a cultural identity that is both compatible with the society they live in and strong ties with the homeland in today\u2019s and future world. Part of an appropriate cultural identity is the mother tongue. In this study, the Turkish learning status of bilingual Turkish children living in the Netherlands was examined according to the views of their parents. The data of the study, which was prepared with the qualitative research method and content analysis technique, were collected in a structured interview form. The data obtained from the participants reached via e-mail were analyzed in the Maxqda program. The research showed that the majority of parents living in the Netherlands want their children to learn Turkish both because it is their mother tongue and not to stay away from Turkish culture. The participants stated that they think that their children\u2019s development in their mother tongue will also contribute to their second language development, that they attach importance to reading Turkish books, that they make an effort to speak Turkish at home, but that their children have problems due to their lack of Turkish vocabulary and the difference in Turkish-Dutch alphabet, and that their children have problems in learning Dutch. they have done.

Accordingly, an increasing number of universities offer multiple educational opportunities to their students and distribute formal courses both in a traditional on campus mode as well as through a non-traditional delivery system at a distance. In order for distance education (DE) to be a viable alternative to traditional method of teaching and learning, it must be in line with the major trends and evolving practices of modern digital society. On the one hand, the labor market's demand for highly qualified specialists with numerous skills and competences revives interest in university courses, expands the number of students and makes education a really massive phenomenon. On the other hand, the required specific job skills and competencies can only be achieved and developed based on the quickly updated knowledge and technologies, which inevitably cause a total paradigm shift in education towards open and experiential modes of training of future specialists. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and identify best strategies and models of distance education applicable to Russian universities in terms of effective massive, open and experiential teaching and learning. Other critical factors for the success of university education, such as access, equity, quality standards, student's engagement and involvement, teacher's training and readiness to non-traditional delivery modes, evaluation at all levels (including recognition and validation) and content design have also been considered. The emphasis was placed on growth and innovations instead of fixed traditions. The methodological framework of this research rests on comparative analysis of the best practices of distance education offered by top universities worldwide. A comprehensive study of technical, pedagogical and managerial issues of distance education has also been provided. Based on empirical approach, testing, evaluation and control of usability, accessibility, availability and safety of some related techniques, tools and resources have been performed. An experimental study has also been conducted aiming to obtain, compare and employ certain relevant data concerning attitudes, priorities and learning outcomes of students in a traditional versus distance learning environment. The main result of the study is the design of a massive, open and experiential distance teaching and learning model that enhances the quality of university education in general and foreign language training in particular.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68659855, "asset_id": 50793354, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 54173049, "first_name": "Aida", "last_name": "Rustamovna", "domain_name": "kpfu", "page_name": "AidaRustamovna", "display_name": "Aida N U R U T D I N O V A Rustamovna", "profile_url": "https://kpfu.academia.edu/AidaRustamovna?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/54173049/14288835/101518766/s65_aida.rustamovna.jpg"}, {"id": 4765022, "first_name": "Aida", "last_name": "Nurutdinova", "domain_name": "kpfu", "page_name": "AidaNurutdinova", "display_name": "Aida Nurutdinova", "profile_url": "https://kpfu.academia.edu/AidaNurutdinova?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4765022/2023649/2385962/s65_aida.nurutdinova.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1695, "name": "Distance Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distance_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3023, "name": "Training and Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Training_and_Development?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48089, "name": "Technology in distance education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Technology_in_distance_education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 367707, "name": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Massive_Open_Online_Courses_MOOCs_?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 48925900, "title": "Migrating while Multilingual and Black: Beyond the \u2018Bidialectal\u2019 Burden [In E.

We argue that racialized speakers be allowed to enjoy the privilege afforded to bilingualism, multilingualism, trilingualism as natural language categories, all of which are associated with, and ascribed privilege when deployed by the supposedly adept white subject. To make this argument, we draw from positioning theory, translanguaging and transraciolinguistics, illustrating how an Afro-Caribbean English-speaking immigrant youth described his own use of English dialects as languages. We then explain how ascribing the label \u201cdialectal\u201d to the Englishes leveraged by this youth reifies raciolinguistic ideologies at both individual and global levels. We invite the field to instead use the label,  bi-/multilingual user of Englishes (B/MUE) as a term that specifies how bilingualism functions for speakers of multiple Englishes, and that reflects the agency embedded in the language practices of youth who speak these Englishes.

In the passive construction, the NP with the semantic function of patient plays the role of grammatical subject, while the agent, or logical subject, when syntactically ex- pressed, occur as an adjunct (KHUMALO 2009). Therefore, the passive alters the syntactic mapping of the arguments, since the subject roles are shared by two noun phrases: grammatical subject, which is the NP that controls the verbal agreement, which may be agent or patient; and the logical subject, the one which does not control verbal agreement, regardless of its location in the sentence.\u2002\nIn the Bantu languages, passive construction is obtained by the attaching a verbal extension morpheme (*-ib(\u01b1) -) which, because of its effect on the sen- tence structure, is called passive (Guthrie 1967, Meeussen 1967; Doke 1943; Schadeberg 2003, Mchombo 2004; Hyman 2007; Dembetembe 1987; Fortune\n1967), since it turns the patient of the active sentence into a grammatical sub- ject. In most Mozambican languages, the passive extension is reconstructed in several ways including the following: idw-/-edw-, -igw-/-egw, -w-.\n\u2002\u2002\u2002Some authors (Doke 1943; Lodhi 2002) refer that in the Bantu languages, the passive construction should not be treated as Voice in mere opposition to the active construction, although it often has this function, since there are pas- sive forms of applicatives, contactives, reversives and causatives. That is, the passive in Bantu is so complex that its treatment defies some known theoretical assumptions such as the principle of non-co-occurrence of morphemes that negatively affect the valence of the verb, as in Zulu, for example, where recip- rocal construction can be passivated (Khumalo 2009).\n\u2002\u2002\u2002The present study aims at describing and analyzing the morpho- phonological contexts in which passive extension morphemes occur in Nyungwe (N43, according to the Guthrie\u2019s 1967\u201371 classification) and Yaawo (P21, according to the Guthrie\u2019s 1967\u201371 classification), two Bantu languages spoken in Mozambique and some neighboring countries. This descriptions and analysis is looking for answers to some questions such as the following: What are the morphemes of the passive extension in these two languages? How are they realized in different morphophonological contexts? What is the relation between these different realizations in each of these two languages? What syn- tactic mapping results from the attachment of the passive extension into the verb radical?\nKey-words: verbal extensions, passive extension, allomorphs, radical, argument structure.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63867903, "asset_id": 43560136, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 121048373, "first_name": "Crisofia", "last_name": "Langa da Camara", "domain_name": "eduardo-mondlane", "page_name": "crisofialangadacamara", "display_name": "Crisofia Langa da Camara", "profile_url": "https://eduardo-mondlane.academia.edu/crisofialangadacamara?f_ri=28221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 334062, "name": "Studies in African Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Studies_in_African_Languages?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 42101880, "title": "Chapter 1 THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING Background of the Study", "created_at": "2020-02-29T06:22:15.283-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42101880/Chapter_1_THE_PROBLEM_AND_ITS_SETTING_Background_of_the_Study?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_42101880", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62233616, "asset_id": 42101880, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 51790573, "first_name": "Jojo", "last_name": "Tahimic", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "JojoSebastianNathan", "display_name": "Jojo Tahimic", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/JojoSebastianNathan?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/51790573/13709527/33205500/s65_jojo.sebastian_nathan.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 35181655, "title": "Early Child Development and Care Views of parents preferring to raise a bilingual child", "created_at": "2017-11-18T07:14:38.801-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35181655/Early_Child_Development_and_Care_Views_of_parents_preferring_to_raise_a_bilingual_child?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_35181655", "summary": "Thisstudyaimstocomparetheviewsofparentslivingintheirowncountry or abroad on raising bilingual children.

This paper explores this phenomenon, using reading assessment data for 2,000 Kenyan children in two or three languages: English, Kiswahili and one of two mother tongues, Dholuo or Gikuyu. The assessment data allowed us to compare reading and comprehension rates across languages. The data indicated that many children could read English words more easily than words in Kiswahili or their mother tongue; nevertheless, their reading comprehension was significantly lower in English than in Kiswahili, Dholuo or Gikuyu. The paper concludes that emphasising English reading fluency is an inefficient route to gaining reading comprehension skills because pupils are actually attaining minimal oral reading fluency in English and only modest comprehension skills in their own languages. The evidence also demonstrates that Kenya&amp;#39;s national language policy of mother tongue as a medium of instruction in the early primary grades is consistently ignored in practice.",

If not, then at least remember your brother in your supplications.\n\nIn The Name of Allah, The Most Compassionate, The Most Merciful\n\n1. Choose an appropriate gift for each occasion and present it in a happy way to oblige her to accept it.\n2. Open a bank account in which all of her children share paying a lump sum in order to cover her needs.\n3. Understand the different stages of life that your mother is going through, and treat her accordingly.\n4. Carefully select the appropriate words to use when talking to her to prevent her from feeling hurt; and, do not utter even one word or expression of disrespect.\n5.

Using parental written question- naires with the focus on general background, socio-economic status and language proficiency, as well as oral semi-structured interviews and ethnographic participant observation, our study attempts to describe how family language policy is managed through translanguaging and literacy activities in multilingual Russian-speaking families in three different cultural and linguistic environments. Our results show both differences and similarities among Russian-speakers in the three countries, not only in their family language practices, but also in their attitudes towards the fluidity of language, language repertoires, translanguaging and Russian-language literacy.

To answer this question, we carried out an experiment in which beginning, intermediate, and adult Basque readers (n\u00a0=\u00a032 each, average age\u00a0=\u00a07, 11, and 22\u00a0years, respectively) needed to read correctly versus incorrectly inflected words embedded in sentences. Half of the targets contained high-frequency stems, and the other half contained low-frequency stems. To each stem, four inflections of different lengths were attached (-a, -ari, -aren, and -arentzat, i.e., inflectional sequences). To test whether the process of word recognition was modulated by the knowledge of word structure in the language, half of the participants\u2019 native language was Basque and the other half\u2019s native language was Spanish. Children showed robust effects of frequency and length of inflection that diminished with age. In addition, the effect of length of inflection was modulated by the frequency of the stem and by the native language. Taken together, these results suggest that word recognition develops from a decoding strategy to a direct lexical access strategy and that this process is modulated by children\u2019s knowledge of the inflectional structure of words from the beginning of their reading experience.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50388303, "asset_id": 3254488, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Nevertheless, working in an ethnographic perspective, this change can be read in a different way, by observing an opposite process that the official discourse disowns, which is the \u201cincorporation\u201d of the school in the indigenous societies. This article, which arises from a long experience of field research in the Huave indigenous community of San Mateo del Mar in southern Mexico, aims to reflect on the role of school in authorizing the identity discourse. Through the analysis of a grammar lesson of indigenous language (ombeayi\u00fcts /our mouth/), I want to show how a background discourse of identity take root in the classroom, in the interference between use of the native language and the Spanish language; it is the same discourse that has supported, since the early 90\u2019s, the assumption of pronoun  ikoots (\u201cwe\u201d in inclusive form) as a new endo-ethnonym and, in a parallel way, the definition of a political role for indigenous teachers in the community.

Although language learning is a complex process and an outcome of the interaction between the cognitive processes and the social contexts attached to them, most of the research, especially in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), concentrated on linguistic construction and simply overlooked the strong relationship between one's social identity and language learning.

It also examines the economic and material realities of the people who live in and through their \u2018languacultures\u2019, or who aspire to do as much. The book will be useful for educators and all those interested in Indigenous and minority language issues, as well as for a wide range of undergraduate, graduate and research contexts where topics of language education and minority rights are the focus.\n\nReview:\nSet against a background of social justice and linguistic human rights, the case studies in this book richly illustrate the educational and community efforts being made towards language sustainability and revitalization in places around the world where languages are regarded as of marginalized status. The chapters explore old and new strategies for reclaiming languages, the challenges that are encountered, and the resilience of those who choose to engage in such work.- Keren Rice, University of Toronto, Canada\n\nThis book showcases innovative and inspiring, community-based revitalization efforts, illustrating how the strengthening of language and culture goes hand-in-hand with individual and community self-empowerment. Precisely this combination, the authors convincingly show, paves the road to success, even against seemingly overwhelming odds.- Leena Huss, Uppsala University, Sweden\n\nThis book is a breath of fresh air in the endangered language and revitalization literature.

One of the major stumbling\nblocks, however, for young scholars in graduate programs today is mastering the techniques of this\nskill, especially when they are writing for a targeted and informed audience. The conventions that\nare traditionally adopted by experienced academic writers have been debated for many years\nconfusing young scholars even more. On the other side of the pendulum, there are some young\nscholars who come into the scene with hordes of experience in the area having penned many papers\nover the years. Others have logged in quite a few papers during their studies, while a good number\nhave not made much progress beyond exams and weekly assignments. The situation becomes even\nmore daunting when one is summoned to fine-hone their academic writing skills in a foreign\nlanguage while pursuing graduate work in a distance learning environment, predominantly due to\ninsufficient vocabulary knowledge and the absence of frequent face-to-face cooperation. Though\nthere is a plethora of research on academic writing in the greater vicinity of the academic world\n(predominantly in brick and mortar institutions), very little research has been carried out to date in\nthe context of foreign language pedagogy and distance learning, particularly with respect to Greek\nTESOL distance learning environments. This special issue seeks to fulfill this void by featuring\nresearch which blends academic writing with distance learning education.\nThe first two articles, namely, Greek students\u2019 views on academic writing in distance learning within\nthe TESOL context and Academic writing in distance learning programs: The tutors\u2019 perspective,\nprobe into the attitudes and perspectives of both students and tutors toward academic writing in\nManoli, Zafiri & Zorbas / Research Papers in Language Teaching and Learning 10/1 (2018) 7-8\n8\ndistance education offering many suggestions on how to best tackle the problem. More specifically,\nthe first article explores the views and challenges of Greek adult learners pursuing a postgraduate\ndegree in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) through a distance learning\nprogram at the Hellenic Open University (henceforth, HOU). While the participants delineate the\nmajor problems they normally face when structuring an academic assignment (e.g., in-text citations\nand bibliographic referencing, plagiarism, language problems, lack of explicit guidelines on behalf of\ntutors or conflicting feedback from different faculty members), they, also, point to specific practices\nthey believe would help them improve as writers (e.g., tutor assignment feedback and explanation, a\nguide or even a training course in academic writing skills, extensive practice in assignment writing,\npersonal involvement in research on academic writing). The second article focuses on the multiple\nbenefits and problems of academic assignment writing as perceived by the tutors of the Course\nDesign and Evaluation module offered through the MA in TESOL program at the HOU and concludes\nwith suggestions for effective student preparation and training in academic writing.\nThe third article, A preliminary genre-based analysis of M.A. dissertation abstracts written in a Greek\nTESOL distance learning environment, delves into researching a specific genre which plagues the\nwriting of many young scholars; namely, the MA dissertation abstract. Using Swales\u2019 (1990/2004)\nCARS (Create a Research Space) model for the analysis of introductions of research articles, the\nauthor analyzes fifty MA dissertation abstracts from former HOU graduates in order to examine how\nMA students structure their texts and project their stance.\nThe fourth article, Academic writing: Conformity and beyond -A brief note, centers on offering\n\u201cwords of wisdom\u201d to novice writers adopting a more esoteric stance.

Indiana\u2019s English learner (EL) population between 1999 and 2018 has grown by 550% from 9,114 to 59,255 students. Of the current 59,255 ELs in K\u201312 schools, 24% are immigrants. Employing a collective case study, this article examines how Indiana university faculty prepare pre- and inservice teachers to address the needs of emergent bilingual immigrant (EBI) youth. While there are institutional constraints that impact how EBI youth needs are met, faculty in EL licensure programs are addressing these needs by explicitly facilitating activities that promote respect and develop empathy through perspective sharing. Despite underdeveloped social infrastructures for EBI youth and EBI teachers in Indiana schools, implications suggest that a methodical inclusion of immigration history, perspective-taking, and critical self reflection can facilitate teacher identity development, and foster their stances of advocacy for EBIs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56885678, "asset_id": 36935488, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6823353, "first_name": "Trish", "last_name": "Morita-Mullaney", "domain_name": "purdue", "page_name": "TrishMoritaMullaney", "display_name": "Trish Morita-Mullaney", "profile_url": "https://purdue.academia.edu/TrishMoritaMullaney?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6823353/2642732/3073590/s65_trish.morita-mullaney.jpg"}, {"id": 71936000, "first_name": "Lynne", "last_name": "Stallings", "domain_name": "ballstate", "page_name": "LynneStallings", "display_name": "Lynne Stallings", "profile_url": "https://ballstate.academia.edu/LynneStallings?f_ri=28221", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1601, "name": "Teacher Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3488, "name": "Social Studies Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Studies_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 27208, "name": "Social Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Studies?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 47587, "name": "Critical Consciousness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Consciousness?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 32246993, "title": "RE-CONCEPTUALIZING MOTHER TONGUE TUITION OF ESTONIAN ABROAD AS A TRANSNATIONAL PHENOMENON", "created_at": "2017-04-04T06:23:02.682-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32246993/RE_CONCEPTUALIZING_MOTHER_TONGUE_TUITION_OF_ESTONIAN_ABROAD_AS_A_TRANSNATIONAL_PHENOMENON?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_32246993", "summary": "The governmental initiative called the Compatriots Programme , which supports language tuition in Estonian schools and societies abroad, reveals an increased interest in developing intergen-erational language transmission in the growing Estonian diaspora.

The evaluation of the program furthermore reveals that organizing such schools requires a willingness to take language political agency, typically conducted by well-educated and well-integrated resourceful transnational multilingual parents. The present article outlines the results of an ethnographic study of the process of establishing the Esto-nian School in Copenhagen. This step has demanded a change in the mindset still prevailing in Estonia that language political activities, such as planning language acquisition, are solely the responsibility of the state.

All the content in E-Validiv is accessible in the language of instruction and one of six other languages. For LMi students, the other language is set to their home language. Multilevel hierarchical regression analyses show that especially LMi students who assess themselves as highly proficient in their home language use the content more in the other language than language majority students. However, even LMi students focus mainly on content in the language of instruction, which indicates that they particularly apply their home language to support their learning process in the language of instruction.

Yet, we all share the ability to sing and engage in the language of music. Melody, pitch and rhythm are the foundational components of music and each language of the world is likewise comprised of neurolinguistic processes that must also \u2018manipulate\u2019 the coded information embedded within the sounds of melody, pitch and rhythm of each language. In the same manner in which a musical conductor attempts to harmoniously synchronise several musicians as they read from a score, is this synonymous with the neurolinguistic processes within each person\u2019s brain as they, as a personal conductor, engage with a written page of \u2018coded\u2019 script? As we read a page of script do we not engage with the following seven items: music of the language, culture, emotion, time-tense, information, relationship and images. Yet are all people able to access these seven layers? Has life on earth psychologically switched some off, detuned our ears, can we \u2018hear\u2019 the nuances of emotion and human relationships as we should? By distilling this research within these conceptual quandaries, various theoretical approaches will be utilised to structure the qualitative approach to neurolinguistic discoveries of the past generation. To facilitate a progressive approach with clarity and potential application, these seven strands or layers of language and mu-sic, (music of the language, culture, emotion, time-tense, information, relationship and images) will form the foundational analytical framework in this dissertation. This theoretical model, ex-plained in due process, is from henceforth entitled The Musical - Language Score. (Appendix 1)\n\nResearch Overview\nPer say, what is the benefit to society or classical philosophical notion endorsed and supplemented by applying analysis to how the human brain processes music and language. May neurolinguistic applications and enlightenment assist with coding and decoding for the global community of languages, which are common to the disciplines of psychiatry, education, inter-cultural communication and our 21st century world of business.  Will this \u201cMusical Language Score\u201d possibly pervade deeply established systems of analyses and supplement accepted paradigms for human communication? By decompressing the language strand, in light of the neurolinguistic research across the academic world, thenceforth comparing it to the \u2018international language\u2019 of music, the desire is to further comprehend the neurolinguistic subtleties of the learning process, through the literature review; enhance the global intercultural communication pro-cess and on a smaller scale consider appropriate application of these strands in reverse form, or healing mode, in psychological and inter-personal situations. \n\nIn order to divulge and scrutinise the four main linguistic processes within the musician\u2019s brain, through the traditional macro-skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking, this research will take the form of a multi-modal method of predominately qualitative research in analysis of English (See Appendices 2,3,4,5). This data collected will be supplemented by a base line of quantitative research into musical aptitude via the implementation of the Bentley Test / Solfege Test.  (Bentley, 2013) The research will not take the form of electro encephalograms, the literature review will be the conduit to supply insight and understanding into the most recent and appropriate neurolinguistic data. From this review, the intention is to create a non-invasive, non electronic form of linguistic measurement through a careful \u2018external\u2019 analysis of cross-linked phenomena that may or may not present through the testing of the four macro-skills in English, in light of the seven strands of language put forward in this dissertation as a tool of analysis. The hidden curriculum being, to disseminate this mode of analysis, to assist within other disciplines such as business and the education industry, to mention but two. \n", "downloadable_attachments":

To gather more data, an individual interview was also conducted with the teachers.  Findings revealed that there is no significant difference between the academic performances of pupils whose L1 is English or Cebuano/English and those pupils whose L1 is other than English.  Findings also exposed that several factors such as prepared environment, focus and independence, and age, play a significant role in the academic achievement of pre-schoolers.  Furthermore, the prepared environment affects the academic performances of the pre-school students even more than the language of instruction.  While socialization with teachers and peers affects the child\u2019s mastery of their second language, the child can interact independently with the materials when the pupils can greatly process and internalize their learning at their own pace.

Such decisions play a crucial role in the issue of giving all children equal opportunities to become literate. It is now widely acknowledged that children learn best when they can fully engage with the learning activities taking place, and that to develop strong language and literacy skills children must first learn in a language they know well or speak at home. However, in many cases postcolonial countries continue to find it hard to identify adequate language education policies. The Gambia, where English is the official language, is an illustrative example of a post-colonial low resource educational context which has struggled with its language education policy. Until recently, most its state schools were EMI schools with no space for its seven indigenous languages. Although since 2015 The Gambia has officially moved towards a multilingual education system, its imperial language remains the focal language in education with literacy classes in the indigenous languages being introduced only as a means to facilitate literacy acquisition in English. While acknowledging that language plays an important role in children\u2019s acquisition of literacy skills and learning in general, I also contend that integrating indigenous languages in education in The Gambia raises a wealth of issues (e.g. local language ideologies showing evidence of linguistic self-hatred, parental attitudes towards language education).

The \u201ceveryday\u201d activity of cooking is examined using field notes gathered through participant observations, diary entries, and semistructured inter- views with child and adult participants. The fieldwork sample included 18 participants age 9 to 11 years and two adult participants. The sociocultural nature of the children\u2019s learning during cooking practices was tracked over a 14-week period. Observed incidences of situated learning, legitimate peripheral participation, and guided participation were tracked throughout the fieldwork period. The analysis identifies the processes through which participants are able to contribute to and distribute shared knowledge. Through tracking the collaborative learning processes and the contrasting pedagogical practices, the research identified the learning trajectory of the \u201cnewbies\u201d via legitimate peripheral participation (as observers and silent contributors), and explored how, through fractionally increasing participa- tion, the newbies become main members (masters) of this community of practice. The findings confirm children\u2019s collaborative cooking practices as a lens through which social interaction and collaboration can be examined, while also highlighting the complexity of opposing pedagogical practices.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56453470, "asset_id": 36534121, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 81179119, "first_name": "Caroline", "last_name": "Bligh", "domain_name": "leedsbeckett", "page_name": "CarolineBligh", "display_name": "Caroline Bligh", "profile_url": "https://leedsbeckett.academia.edu/CarolineBligh?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/81179119/27689793/25996073/s65_caroline.bligh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3429, "name": "Educational Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Educational_Research?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7915, "name": "Silence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Silence?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11834, "name": "Language and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Culture?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18093, "name": "Language Learning and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Learning_and_Identity?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 107846, "name": "Selective Mutism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Selective_Mutism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 941914, "name": "English As An Additional Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_As_An_Additional_Language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1007166, "name": "Sociocultural Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociocultural_Analysis?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 34427157, "title": "Outline proposal for a phone app to gauge language use and sociolinguistic vitality", "created_at": "2017-08-31T09:13:51.848-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/34427157/Outline_proposal_for_a_phone_app_to_gauge_language_use_and_sociolinguistic_vitality?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_34427157", "summary": "The proposed app would enable multilingual users to see how much time they spend speaking their different languages Users could compare their own language use to that of others.

As European thinking has been transformed by the adoption of the metaphor of \u201clife as a journey,\u201d and other metaphors arising from long and deep exposure to the Christian Scriptures, the best thing we can do to encourage sustainable socioeconomic development in Africa is to promote faith in the same Scriptures in their languages in their communities. Since all thought is metaphorical, then there is no universal/objective/standard alternative standing in the way of encouraging societies to follow God\u2019s Word and adopt its metaphors as their own. Instead of objectivity, cognitive science finds that humans are subjectively malleable in their ways of understanding. This means people and societies are open to and need guidance from the Creator God himself.

will problematize the proposed use of mother-tongue-based instruction in the Philippines. As a country that has, for almost a century, supported the use of English in schools, this proposal marks a drastic shift in Philippine languages in education policies. We argue that a century of language policies, which have privileged English over all the local languages of the Philippines, have led to specific attitudes to language that will impact on the success of mother-tongue-based education. To support our arguments, we will draw on the results of a survey on language attitudes conducted in the Philippines. This survey specifically asked respondents about what they perceived to be the role/s of English and other Philippine languages in education. We argue that although mother-tongue initiatives are admirable, they need to be examined in terms of attitudes to language, which may or may not value mother tongues. In addition, we argue that for mother-tongue-based education to succeed, it is necessary to consider the possibility of changing these attitudes to language via a principles-based approach to language policy.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2034836, "first_name": "Priscilla Angela", "last_name": "Cruz", "domain_name": "ateneo", "page_name": "PriscillaAngelaCruz",

A case study of Master Degree (M A) students in the female section of Najran University English Department discovers a number of results that show that writing is still a great difficulty for them even at a relatively higher level of education. They show weakness in logical thought and organizational pattern.

Introduction of Tatar language and literature in curriculum for pupils of all ethnic groups in 1992 plays one of the main positive roles in this process. As a result today young Russian people are able better or worse to use Tatar language. But it does not mean their active practical use of Tatar in everyday life. In 2012 the Institute of Philology and the Arts, Kazan Federal University organized and held Tatar language courses. It showed a high demand of such courses and was highly appreciated by the students.

The phonetic similarity of two languages helps EFL learners to grasp the lexical accent with the accurate articulation of the words from the second language. However, the difference in sound patterns in various languages prompts the learners to mispronounce the words more frequently. This critical study endeavors to evaluate the influential aspects of the mother tongue on the EFL learners' second language (L2) discourse. This research is carried out through a qualitative method for critical discourse analysis to answer the main question; what significant errors students make that reflect their mother tongue influence? For a comparative study, the participants are the Saudi undergraduates from multidimensional sections of female colleges in King Khalid University and the non-native English-speaking teachers from five different nations, who also manifest the influence of their mother tongue on English language speaking. Their recorded presentations and conversations were analyzed to identify the interference of their mother tongue on their English language performance. The language patterns of both students and the teachers eventually affect their English language efficiency. The significant outcome of this study reveals the possibility of the pros and cons of the mother tongue on L2 learning. The data also revealed that the inability of faculty members to produce the flawless accent of the English language has a significant effect on Saudi learners' oral performance.",

For the needs of this research an experimental and a control group were targeted. The teaching materials which were used in the research process were differentiated according to the principles of Differentiated Instruction and learners were assigned to write different writing genres.Findings revealed that differentiated instruction had an impact on the learners\u2019 writings. However, there were limitations regarding the time that had to be allotted in the designing of the lessons and the instruction itself. Also, the instruction was limited to a small group of learners.

So, a nutritional intervention program for those infants who deprived of outdoor facilities is a subject of interest. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of nutritional intervention on the growth of infants accompanying their mothers in prison. A quasi-experimental design was used (Pre and post-test). The study was conducted in Qanater Women's Prison in Egypt. A convenience sample of 30 mothers accompanying their infants in the above-mentioned setting was included. Three instruments were used: a structured interview questionnaire, an observational checklist, and anthropometric measurements. The findings of this study revealed that infant growth improved after the implementation of the nutritional intervention. In addition,, there were statistically significant differences regarding mother's knowledge and practices observed on posttest than on pretest. As well as, there were a positive correlation between mother's knowledge, practices, and infant growth. The study concluded that mothers gained more knowledge and had better practices on posttest following the adherence to nutritional intervention. In addition, their infants had better growth after the implementation of nutritional intervention. Therefore, it was recommended that nurse\u201fs officers should provide mothers in prison with periodical nutritional intervention to sustain their infants' growth. Special provisions must be in place to ensure that the child\u201fs rights are promoted and protected whilst in prison, Child welfare, rather than prison authorities, should have primary responsibility for making decisions regarding children in prison, and specialists in social work and child development should supervise their care.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80179072, "asset_id": 70417054, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 83272155, "first_name": "Pacific", "last_name": "International Journal", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PacificInternationalJournal", "display_name": "Pacific International Journal", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PacificInternationalJournal?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/83272155/67058071/55419333/s65_pacific.international_journal.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 472226, "name": "Nutritional intervention studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nutritional_intervention_studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 823203, "name": "Assessing the Knowledge and Attitude Regarding Immunization of Children Among Mothers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Assessing_the_Knowledge_and_Attitude_Regarding_Immunization_of_Children_Among_Mothers?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 67210294, "title": "The importance of Mother Tongue and English language in the building of a nation: shall the twain meet?", "created_at": "2022-01-05T02:56:13.164-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/67210294/The_importance_of_Mother_Tongue_and_English_language_in_the_building_of_a_nation_shall_the_twain_meet?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_67210294", "summary": "The purpose of this paper is to bring to the fore the essential roles of Mother Tongue and English language as a medium of communication in this globalised world.

Apart from a lone bilingual program that ended over twenty years ago (Meehan 2017), Kriol has rarely featured in formal education (Angelo 2021: 296, Dickson 2021). In 2018, a community survey in one of the largest Kriol-speaking communities, Ngukurr, found strong support for bilingual education and Kriol literacy instruction (Yugul Mangi Development Aboriginal Corporation 2019: 12). \n\nIn the face of the hegemony of English instruction in schools, Yugul Mangi Development Aboriginal Corporation decided to fund a Kriol resourcing and education program in 2019 called Meigim Kriol Strongbala (https://meigimkriolstrongbala.org.au/en_au/). Within a year, this non-government program had become enmeshed in the local school, delivering programs in all classes. The rapid acceptance highlighted the local need and desires for vernacular education and how the funding and policy vacuum can be quickly filled at the local level when opportunities arise. \n\nIn terms of program delivery, the past two years of work by Meigim Kriol Strongbala, in collaboration with Ngukurr School and other agencies, has seen numerous innovations and developments in resourcing and pedagogy for the Kriol language. This includes: commercial book publications, development of units in primary education in various subject areas and explorations in methods of Kriol literacy instruction. Examples of success (as well as failures) across these areas will be shared in this presentation, with evidence for success provided by: improved capacity in Kriol literacy; positive formal independent evaluation (Ninti One 2021); and increased engagement and acceptance of Kriol-medium education programs. While some teachers and schools in other Kriol speaking communities are also expanding their use of Kriol in classrooms, this presentation aims to further develop a grassroots movement towards the expanded use of Kriol in formal education. \n\nReferences \n\nAngelo, Denise. 2021.

In particular, authoritarian practices aimed at creating a common national identity and a single national language began to meet with significant objections. Groups that had been at odds with the prevailing majority on ethnic, linguistic, and religious grounds and that had up to that time been kept at a distance from the administrative centre began to demand the preservation and protection of their identities and cultures. \n\nThese demands were also reflected in Turkey. The concept of citizenship developed by the Republican regime and the imposition of a common identity and lifestyle for people of varying languages, religions, and ethnic origins met with significant objection from the late 1980s onwards. After the partial easing of the oppression arising from the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat of 1980 especially, ethnic and religious groups thought of as damaging to national identity established by the capital, Ankara became more visible within society and began to participate more actively in politics. Groups that had not considered themselves part of acceptable society began to put forth demands for their unique character to be socially accepted and preserved. Women re- belled against the dominant male culture and adopt a variety of methods to fight sexist discrimination. Homosexuals drew attention to their oppression; they began to fight to gain equality as citizens with a different sexual orientation both in the private and the public sphere. Islamic circles also became involved, with their demands that women not be deprived of their rights because of their headscarves and that children be brought up in line with their faith. The Alawis challenged the Sunni character of the regime and put pressure on both political and legal mechanisms for the abolishment of obligatory religious lessons in schools. Non-Muslims expressed the necessity of coming to terms with the discrimination they have been subjected to in the past and present and to solve current issues deriving from this discrimination. \n\nThe demand for the recognition of Kurdish ethnic and cultural identity is of distinctive importance among these demands, which over the years have increased in type and variety. In this context, the most-emphasized demand and the one that forms the predominant part of the cultural rights claim consists of the use of the mother tongue \u2013 Kurdish \u2013 in education. Kurds base their demands in this area on three main principles. \n\n\u201cScar of Tongue\u201d aims to contribute to deepening the current debates on mother tongue-based education and to the development of an understanding of multilingual education \u2013 involving the use of Kurdish in education \u2013 in Turkey.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 71273311, "asset_id": 55376353, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 204753185, "first_name": "DISA / Diyarbakir Institute for Political and Social Research /", "last_name": "D\u0130SA / Diyarbak\u0131r Siyasal ve Sosyal Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "disadiyarbakirsiyasalvesosyalarastirmalarenstitusu", "display_name": "DISA / Diyarbakir Institute for Political and Social Research / D\u0130SA / Diyarbak\u0131r Siyasal ve Sosyal Ara\u015ft\u0131rmalar Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/disadiyarbakirsiyasalvesosyalarastirmalarenstitusu?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/204753185/65461813/54013800/s65_diyarbakir_institute_for_political_and_social_research_.diyarbak_r_siyasal_ve_sosyal_ara_t_rmalar_enstit_s_.png"}, {"id": 56107008, "first_name": "Vahap", "last_name": "Co\u015fkun", "domain_name": "dicle", "page_name": "VahapCoskun", "display_name": "Vahap Co\u015fkun", "profile_url": "https://dicle.academia.edu/VahapCoskun?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/56107008/14767969/56805562/s65_vahap.co_kun.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5548, "name": "Kurdish Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15899, "name": "Kurdish Question in Turkey", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Question_in_Turkey?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 30614, "name": "Kurdish Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Nationalism?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 38235, "name": "Kurdish Question", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Question?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 44343, "name": "Kurdish Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_Language?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 117970, "name": "Kurdish history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kurdish_history?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 150730, "name": "Mother-Tongue Literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother-Tongue_Literacy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 290624, "name": "Mother Tongue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 952657, "name": "Modern Kurdish History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Kurdish_History?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 49972291, "title": "\u00bfEs inclusiva la ense\u00f1anza biling\u00fce?

Un planteamiento inclusivo de la educaci\u00f3n y el fomento de los programas biling\u00fces constituyen, en la actualidad, dos retos importantes para nuestro sistema educativo. Las investigaciones existentes en Espa\u00f1a sobre la inclusi\u00f3n del alumnado con necesidades espec\u00edficas de apoyo educativo (NEAE) abordan el tema de manera tangencial, como uno de los aspectos a analizar en el marco de estudios m\u00e1s amplios. Este trabajo se dedica \u00edntegramente a analizar, desde un dise\u00f1o metodol\u00f3gico mixto con predominancia cuantitativa, el funcionamiento de los programas biling\u00fces desde un enfoque inclusivo a partir de un an\u00e1lisis tanto de la presencia de alumnado con NEAE en los programas biling\u00fces como de los apoyos proporcionados o los motivos de su exclusi\u00f3n en los mismos. M\u00c9TODO. Partiendo de la poblaci\u00f3n de centros educativos de educaci\u00f3n primaria y secundaria con programa biling\u00fce se recoge informaci\u00f3n de naturaleza tanto cualitativa como cuantitativa a trav\u00e9s de una encuesta aplicada a equipos directivos, obteniendo una muestra de 48 centros. Las categor\u00edas resultantes a partir de los resultados cualitativos se han obtenido mediante un proceso inductivo. RESULTADOS.

Two examples from very different parts of the world illustrate how the process of orthography design must be localized: Barayin (Chad, Africa) and Kodi (Sumba, Indonesia). \n\nOne challenge in the Barayin orthography is that it must find a way to represent contrastive tone. In Kodi, most words can drop a syllable in many contexts. The Kodi orthography rules must decide if the language should be written the way it is pronounced, or if syllables that are not pronounced should still be written. \n\nGovernment involvement in Chad is primarily through a set of guidelines. For example, they recommend the letter <n\u0330> for the palatal nasal sound /\u0272/. The Kodi literacy program has received support from the Indonesian government through a grant from the INOVASI project, and by allowing government teachers to use Kodi books to teach mother tongue literacy in local schools. \n\nThe Barayin literacy project is organized by a community-based organization, ADPLB. ADPLB raises grassroots support, recruits volunteers, trains teachers, and makes decisions about how to write the language and what books to publish. In Sumba, there are no local organizations dedicated to literacy. \n\nOrthography design benefits from several kinds of partners. Governments, researchers, non-profit organizations (yayasan), and community-based organizations. Each type of organization has its own role to play in order to successfully develop orthographies for mother tongue literacy in previously unwritten languages.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61325385, "asset_id": 41053280, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 24090726, "first_name": "Joseph", "last_name": "Lovestrand", "domain_name": "soas", "page_name": "JosephLovestrand", "display_name": "Joseph Lovestrand", "profile_url": "https://soas.academia.edu/JosephLovestrand?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/24090726/6512908/93018425/s65_joseph.lovestrand.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5603, "name": "Endangered Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Endangered_Languages?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8783, "name": "Indonesia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesia?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28958, "name": "Orthography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orthography?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 99776, "name": "Chadic", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chadic?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 229155, "name": "Mother Tongue Based Multilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mother_Tongue_Based_Multilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 40054404, "title": "IDENTITY AND PLURILINGUISM IN AFRICA - THE CASE OF MOZAMBIQUE IDENTIDADE E PLURILINGUISMO NA \u00c1FRICA: O CASO DE MO\u00c7AMBIQUE", "created_at": "2019-08-10T08:58:36.608-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40054404/IDENTITY_AND_PLURILINGUISM_IN_AFRICA_THE_CASE_OF_MOZAMBIQUE_IDENTIDADE_E_PLURILINGUISMO_NA_%C3%81FRICA_O_CASO_DE_MO%C3%87AMBIQUE?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_40054404", "summary": "The African continent is a true ethnic-linguistic and cultural mosaic, composed of 55 countries and characterised by the existence of approximately 2.000 languages and a large number of ethnic groups.

This book provides a revealing update on dialect speakers' attitudes towards the campaign by including discussions and other related issues such as the recent call for the revitalisation of Chinese dialects by younger dialect speakers, Chinese students' attitude towards learning Mandarin in schools, the encroachment of English in the home environment, the spread and dominance of English in the local linguistic landscape, and the challenges of maintaining Mandarin as a language of use and preference.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52209700, "asset_id": 31528473, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4217969, "first_name": "Patrick", "last_name": "NG: EdD (Applied Linguistics and TESOL) University of Leicester, UK", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "PatrickNGEdDAppliedLinguisticsandTESOLUniversityofLeicesterUK", "display_name": "Patrick NG: EdD (Applied Linguistics and TESOL) University of Leicester, UK", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/PatrickNGEdDAppliedLinguisticsandTESOLUniversityofLeicesterUK?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4217969/1661305/60406649/s65_patrick.ng_edd_applied_linguistics_and_tesol_university_of_leicester_uk.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5034, "name": "Language Planning and Policy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Planning_and_Policy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50974, "name": "Singapore Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Singapore_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 82774, "name": "Chinese Dialects", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Dialects?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 118144, "name": "Mandarin", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mandarin?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 180300, "name": "Beliefs and attitudes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Beliefs_and_attitudes?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 20691952, "title": "Establishing language portfolios in primary education: The importance of practical experiences of pupils and teachers", "created_at": "2016-01-24T05:23:12.374-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/20691952/Establishing_language_portfolios_in_primary_education_The_importance_of_practical_experiences_of_pupils_and_teachers?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_20691952", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 41508380, "asset_id": 20691952, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9355412, "first_name": "Peter", "last_name": "Broeder", "domain_name": "tilburguniversity", "page_name": "PeterBroeder", "display_name": "Peter Broeder", "profile_url": "https://tilburguniversity.academia.edu/PeterBroeder?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9355412/15085365/15800710/s65_peter.broeder.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 88382, "name": "Primary Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primary_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 11558562, "title": "Min\u00e1sbate Equivalents of Mathematical Concepts: Their Socio-Cultural Undertones", "created_at": "2015-03-20T15:46:15.673-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11558562/Min%C3%A1sbate_Equivalents_of_Mathematical_Concepts_Their_Socio_Cultural_Undertones?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_11558562", "summary": "This paper presents the collection and analysis of Min\u00e1sbate equivalents of some concepts used in the study of arithmetic, counting, and geometry as provided by the elderly residents of the province of Masbate.

The MTBMLE policy mandates basic education institutions to use the child\u2019s home language as medium of instruction in all subject areas, notwithstanding the fact that the Philippines is among the most linguistically diverse country in the world. \nMTBMLE was never mentioned in the original Philippine EFA Plans but EFA\u2019s requirement to periodically report all EFA-related gains opened a window of opportunity. Who were the actors involved and how did they facilitate the institutionalization of MTBMLE the Philippines? What social structures they had to contend with? What would it take to make it succeed? \nThis study offers a theoretical frame to explain the structural and actor-oriented processes in advocacy for education reform. It utilized interviews with the MTBMLE champions in the Philippines, along with the auto-narratives of the author as one of the facilitators in the formulation of MTBMLE policy and training and advocacy programs. Other sources of data include Department of Education and Congressional committee reports and minutes of meetings and online forums of MTBMLE advocacy groups. Data show that actors came from oppositional ideological persuasions, yet given the fleeting window of opportunity provided by the EFA mandate, they entered into a negotiated but fragile collaboration. The concerted advocacy campaign moved so swiftly, with deliberate efforts to bracket old political debates on language and identity, bringing to the fore the promise of quality and more inclusive education through MTBMLE.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36690431, "asset_id": 10919956, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2612086, "first_name": "Maria Mercedes \"Ched\"", "last_name": "Arzadon", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "chedarzadon", "display_name": "Maria Mercedes \"Ched\" E .

Since the tower of Babel fell many centuries ago, we have scattered all over the earth to make new discoveries in different languages. With over 6000 world languages and 3000 nearly extinct the duty of resurrecting the dead and resuscitation the dying languages is big. It is like a grass falling off a house - it may not leak instantly but one day it will certainly leak. Who knows whether the answer to HIV/AIDS, cancer and war is in the dead and dying languages? It seems to me that the more we agglutinate under one or a few languages the more troubles we create for the globalism world. The need to decentralise and respect the verdict of the Almighty creator of languages is more important now than it was during our great ancestors in Babylon.

Papua New Guinea, Mexico, the mainland United States, South Africa, Panama, and Scandinavia) is a welcome addition to the field of teaching writing, which, as several of the book\u2019s authors mention, is dominated by research into first language writing in the dominant national languages of wealthy countries, and where very little attention is paid to the specific issues facing teachers of indigenous languages. The book begins with an introduction by the editors and ends with concluding remarks by Kendall King, who discusses the roles of orthography, appropriate pedagogy, and the ecology of literacy outside of school in the teaching of writing. In between are 13 chapters, each examining a different educational environment, all of which are situated in nations in which the indigenous language in question is spoken by a minority of its citizens. Three of these are in Papua New Guinea, whose over-representation is justified by the editors on the basis of the great number of its languages. In some of the linguistic ecologies that are featured, the indigenous language is the main language of the community. In others, it is spoken by few children at home and is being revived through a school program. All the discussions are based on classroom observations as well as relevant descriptions of the use (or non-use) of official curricula. Most, but not all, of the studies focus on the writing of younger children who are just learning how to write.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67352119, "asset_id": 48956176, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 48386175, "first_name": "Craig Alan", "last_name": "Volker", "domain_name": "jamescook", "page_name": "CraigAlanVolker", "display_name": "Craig Alan Volker", "profile_url": "https://jamescook.academia.edu/CraigAlanVolker?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/48386175/13167611/14467845/s65_craig.volker.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 926, "name": "Indigenous Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2743, "name": "Indigenous Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Languages?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 17645, "name": "South American indigenous languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_American_indigenous_languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 29497, "name": "African languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 59543, "name": "S\u00e1mi Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sami_Studies?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 71127, "name": "Bilingual/Bicultural Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Bicultural_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 146775, "name": "Bilingual Education; Dual Language Programs,  Early and Late Immersion,  and the role of the L1", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education_Dual_Language_Programs_Early_and_Late_Immersion_and_the_role_of_the_L1?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 148271, "name": "Sami Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sami_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 215503, "name": "Teaching, learning and revitalising Indigenous languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teaching_learning_and_revitalising_Indigenous_languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 296863, "name": "Indigenous literacy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_literacy?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1032366, "name": "Indigenous and Minority Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_and_Minority_Languages?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1221808, "name": "Languages of Papua New Guinea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_of_Papua_New_Guinea?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 1718123, "name": "Indigenous literacy education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_literacy_education?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 48052169, "title": "Examining the secondary effects of mother-tongue literacy instruction in Kenya: Impacts on student learning in English, Kiswahili, and mathematics", "created_at": "2021-05-03T23:58:28.590-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/48052169/Examining_the_secondary_effects_of_mother_tongue_literacy_instruction_in_Kenya_Impacts_on_student_learning_in_English_Kiswahili_and_mathematics?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_48052169", "summary": "Limited rigorous evidence is available from sub-Saharan Africa regarding whether children who learn to read in their mother tongue will have higher learning outcomes in other subjects.

We compared the impacts of the PRIMR mother-tongue treatment group in two languages with those of another group that did not use mother tongue, but utilised the same instructional components. Results showed that assignment to the mother-tongue group had no additional benefits for English or Kiswahili learning outcomes beyond the non-mother-tongue group, and that the mother-tongue group had somewhat lower mathematics outcomes. Classroom observational analysis showed that assignment to the mother tongue group had only small impacts on the usage of mother tongue in other subjects.

The aim of the present study is to identify the participants' patterns of communication in the home and school environment, investigate the incentives, the rationales and the conditions these patterns of communication stem from, as well as the participants' attitude towards Albanian. Results revealed that L1 transmission is problematic for the Late Bilinguals' group, while the possibility of non-acquisition of Albanian remains a reality for the participants who were born in Greece or came to Greece in infancy. The home context is normally the only domain where Albanian is used in fragmented patterns of communication.

The evaluation of the program furthermore reveals that organizing such schools requires a willingness to take language political agency, typically conducted by well-educated and well-integrated resourceful transnational multilingual parents. The present article outlines the results of an ethnographic study of the process of establishing the Esto-nian School in Copenhagen. This step has demanded a change in the mindset still prevailing in Estonia that language political activities, such as planning language acquisition, are solely the responsibility of the state.

Focusing on data excerpts relating to language use in the home, the paper discusses the complex and sometime ambivalent nature of parental investment in heritage language transmission, showing how even when the importance of speaking the HL in the home is well acknowledged by the parents, their choice of language is still fundamentally associated with elements of their own personal identities, making a sustained commitment to this form of investment very difficult for some.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35554583, "asset_id": 8999926, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2790735, "first_name": "Arianna", "last_name": "Berardi-Wiltshire", "domain_name": "massey", "page_name": "AriannaBerardiWiltshire", "display_name": "Arianna Berardi-Wiltshire", "profile_url": "https://massey.academia.edu/AriannaBerardiWiltshire?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2790735/1022962/1278564/s65_arianna.berardi-wiltshire.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2524, "name": "Sociolinguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociolinguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7709, "name": "Applied Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Applied_Linguistics?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33372, "name": "Heritage language studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Heritage_language_studies?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 116108, "name": "New Zealand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Zealand?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 444375, "name": "Community Languages", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Languages?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 6737644, "title": "Language Policy, Politics and Ideology in Mewat: Comparative Case Studies of Mewati in Two School Types", "created_at": "2014-04-12T14:50:15.582-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/6737644/Language_Policy_Politics_and_Ideology_in_Mewat_Comparative_Case_Studies_of_Mewati_in_Two_School_Types?f_ri=28221", "dom_id": "work_6737644", "summary": "Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in multilingualism, language maintenance and managing language diversity both inside and outside the educational context. However, much of this work, especially in the educational context, has focused on (minority) languages and relatively little attention has been paid to \u2018dialects\u2019.\r\n\r\nThis study explores the status and role of Mewati, a dialect generally subsumed under Hindi (Government of India, 2001) in schools. While Mewati is spoken by most Meos as their first language (Srivastava, 2011, p. 250), there are currently no studies that examine the use and role of Mewati in education in Mewat. This thesis addresses an important gap in understanding what roles are assigned (or not) to local dialects in education. \r\n\r\nThis project was guided by two research questions: What language-in-education policies (LiEPs) were in place in the two types of schools (rural and urban) chosen for this study; and what role did Mewati play in the overall language policy framework in these schools. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project was to develop an understanding about how teachers comprehended, negotiated and implemented LiEPs within classrooms. It also aimed at uncovering and critically analysing the underlying ideologies, policies and political processes that informed and influenced these LiEPs in the two schools studied and how these policies, affected the position of Mewati in these schools. \r\n\r\nThe schools studied differed across multiple dimensions including medium of instruction, board of affiliation, textbooks and curricula, location, infrastructure and the socio-economic background of the students. However, they were similar in that most students in both schools spoke Mewati as their home language. The case study was based on data collected in interviews, informal conversations, artifacts, documents and field notes. The data was gathered from both Meo and non-Meo teachers, who differed across linguistic, ethnic and religious lines, in order to obtain a richer and holistic perspective on teachers\u2019 views and practices. \r\n\r\nThis project took an interdisciplinary approach and drew insights from sociolinguistics, applied linguistics, education and sociology. The study draws significantly on Spolsky\u2019s (2004) model of language policy which was used both as an analytical framework as well as a tool for organizing data. \r\n\r\nThe study revealed that the LiEP of the rural schools was largely Hindi monolingual and the urban school mostly Hindi-English bilingual. Both types of schools failed to make space for Mewati, the mother tongue of the majority of students. In both school types, Hindi was taught as the first language. The majority of teachers also held negative attitudes towards Mewati. The teachers perceived Mewati as a hindrance for the learning and overall development of students. There was a significant communication gap between teachers and students particularly in the early years of education. There was also a severe shortage of local Meo teachers. Most teachers in both schools were non-Meos who could not speak Mewati. A complex mix of inter-ethnic relations between these groups and the socio-historical and political structures greatly influenced language choice patterns and policy decisions. \r\n\r\nThis study has

a growing interest in content and language integrated learning (CLIL) around the world, including in Colombia. Nevertheless there often remains a great deal of confusion about what it really is, especially in relation to other educational approaches that involve the use of additional languages (perhaps particularly bilingual immersion and English for special/academic purposes). All of such approaches can be valuable approaches to learning in the right context, but all have distinct focuses and objectives. The right approach for one kind of context\u2014or learner\u2014may not be the right approach for another kind of context\u2014or learner\u2014and the different approaches require different mind-sets and preparations on the parts of both learners and teachers. As educational institutions and policy makers take an ever greater interest in CLIL, there is a corresponding demand in terms of professional development to help teachers (and students, and parents) better understand how content and language work together.\r\n\r\nThis talk places the CLIL approach within the broader context of teaching for, with, and through additional languages. Similarities and differences between CLIL and related forms of content and/or language teaching will be explored and clarified. The objective is to help participants understand how to make better choices for their contexts\u2014to plan, prepare, and teach appropriately for the needs of their learners\u2014making sound decisions about the place of CLIL in all their futures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32175719, "asset_id": 4912401, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 59150, "first_name": "Carl Edlund", "last_name": "Anderson", "domain_name": "mythgard", "page_name": "CarlEdlundAnderson", "display_name": "Carl Edlund Anderson", "profile_url": "https://mythgard.academia.edu/CarlEdlundAnderson?f_ri=28221", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/59150/17178/33819766/s65_carl_edlund.anderson.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1005, "name": "English for Specific Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Specific_Purposes?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1006, "name": "English for Academic Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Academic_Purposes?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9205, "name": "Content and Language Integrated Learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content_and_Language_Integrated_Learning?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11658, "name": "Bilingual Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Education?f_ri=28221", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20491, "name": "Bilingual education (Education)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_Education_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 20934, "name": "English/Language for Academic Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Language_for_Academic_Purposes?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 28221, "name": "Bilingual education (mother tongue-based)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_education_mother_tongue-based_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 37430, "name": "CLIL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/CLIL?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 43271, "name": "Languages for Specific Purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Languages_for_Specific_Purposes?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 71127, "name": "Bilingual/Bicultural Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingual_Bicultural_Education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 96106, "name": "Teacher education for CLIL", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Teacher_education_for_CLIL?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 104664, "name": "Language Teaching Strategies Such as Content-Based Instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Teaching_Strategies_Such_as_Content-Based_Instruction?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 119849, "name": "Bilingualism and bilingual education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bilingualism_and_bilingual_education?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 119960, "name": "English for Specific Purposes or Academic English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Specific_Purposes_or_Academic_English?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 164919, "name": "Content-based instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content-based_instruction?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 177699, "name": "English for Specific/academic purposes", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_for_Specific_academic_purposes?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 184139, "name": "Content Based Instruction", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content_Based_Instruction?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 210798, "name": "Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content_and_Language_Integrated_Learning_CLIL_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 450730, "name": "Content Based Instruction (CBI)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content_Based_Instruction_CBI_?f_ri=28221"}, {"id": 724961, "name": "Content based language learning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Content_based_language_learning?f_ri=28221"}]}, {"id": 3849252, "title": "Hindi -
