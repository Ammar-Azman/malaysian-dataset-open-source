One such group is the Eurasian \u201cIndo\u201d community that has its roots in the former Dutch East Indies, today\u2019s Indonesia. This article focuses on Tjalie Robinson, the intellectual leader of this community from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The son of a Dutch father and a British-Javanese mother, Robinson became the leading voice of the diasporic Indo community in the Netherlands and later also in the United States. His engagement resulted in the foundation of the Indo magazine Tong Tong and the annual Pasar Malam Besar, what was to become the world\u2019s biggest Eurasian festival. Robinson played an essential role in the cultural awareness and self-pride of the eventually global Indo community through his elaboration of a hybrid and transnational identity concept. By placing his focus \u201ctussen twee werelden\u201d (in-between two worlds) and identifying \u201cmixties-schap\u201d (mestizaje) as the essential characteristic of Indo identity, Robinson anticipated debates on hybridity, transnationalism, and creolism that only much later would draw attention from scholars in the field of postcolonial studies. This article highlights Robinson\u2019s pioneering role in framing a deterritorialized hybrid alternative to nationalist essentialism in the postcolonial era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

It is largely based on my text edition and translation of British Library MS 12330 (Babad Bedhah ing Ngayogyakarta - The Chronicle of the Fall of Yogyakarta) which was written by a senior Yogyakarta prince (great-uncle of Prince Diponegoro), Pangeran Ario Panular (circa1760-1825), describing the period from the British attack on the Yogyakarta court on 20 June 1812 to the marriage of the fourth sultan (HB IV, reigned 1814-1822) to the daughter of the murdered Yogya prime minister, Danurejo II (1799-1811), in May 1816. This whole Javanese text was later published under the same title by Oxford University Press in 1992 and it has recently been translated into Indonesian (Bahasa) and will be published by Penerbit Buku Kompas (PBK) on 24 May 2017 in the British Embassy, Jakarta, to mark the 200th anniversary of he publication of Raffles's History of Java in May 1817. For those interested in more detail on the specifically Javanese view of the events of the British occupation of Java in 1811-1816, these last publications may prove more useful for English and Indonesian speakers.

Drawing on recent studies undertaken by both locally based scholars and senior researchers from outside the state, the book explores the underlying strengths, characteristics, and uniqueness of Malay Islamic Monarchy in Brunei Darussalam in a historical context and examines these in an increasingly challenging regional and global environment. It considers events in Brunei's recent history and current socio-cultural transformations, which give expression to the traumatic years of decolonisation in Southeast Asia. A wide range of issues focus on foreign, non-Bruneian narratives of Brunei as against insider or domestic accounts of the sultanate, the status of minority ethnic groups in Brunei and the concept of 'Brunei society', as well as changes in the character and composition of the famous 'water village', Kampong Ayer, as the cultural heartland of Brunei Malay culture and the socio-cultural and economic effects of the resettlement of substantial segments of the population from a 'life on water' to a 'life on land'. A timely and very important study on Brunei Darussalam, the book will be of interest to anthropologists, sociologists, historians, geographers, and area studies specialists in Southeast Asian Studies and Asian Studies.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65745862, "asset_id": 45165407, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 380, "name": "Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 48574, "name": "Brunei Darussalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Darussalam?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 179193, "name": "Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 436441, "name": "Southeast Asian Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Anthropology?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1657007, "name": "Brunei Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Studies?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1931806, "name": "Southeast Asian Ethnic Groups", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Ethnic_Groups?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 2518878, "name": "Southeast Asian politics and society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_politics_and_society?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 19573915, "title": "A Critique of G\u00e9mino Abad\u2019s \u201cMapping Our Poetic Terrain: Filipino Poetry in English from 1905 to the Present\u201d", "created_at": "2015-12-09T02:35:31.821-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19573915/A_Critique_of_G%C3%A9mino_Abad_s_Mapping_Our_Poetic_Terrain_Filipino_Poetry_in_English_from_1905_to_the_Present_?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_19573915", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40706127, "asset_id": 19573915, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37216929, "first_name": "Seneca", "last_name": "Nu\u00f1eza Pellano", "domain_name": "philippines", "page_name": "snpellano", "display_name": "Seneca Nu\u00f1eza Pellano", "profile_url": "https://philippines.academia.edu/snpellano?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37216929/10879784/12141691/s65_seneca.nu_eza_pellano.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48789, "name": "Philippine Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 49055, "name": "Commentary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commentary?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2241039, "name": "Gemino Abad", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gemino_Abad?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 19491810, "title": "Staniukovich M.

"work_25544145", "summary": "The appropriation of place and language is a key strategy by which post-colonial writers represent the identity of the individual. These two tasks go hand-in-hand because, in order to establish one\u2019s bond with the land and re-write it from one\u2019s perspective, language must also be stripped of its British connotations and adapted to the individual\u2019s consciousness. Because of Singapore\u2019s unique experience of post-colonialism and nation-building, various other presences besides the British coloniser also influence the way that language and place are conceived. These include the homelands of China and India and the government of Singapore, among others. Examining the works of poets from three different periods of the nation's history, I discuss how each practices appropriation through different means and to different ends as they respond to their specific historical circumstances. The three poets I will focus on are Wang Gungwu (pre-independence), Edwin Thumboo (early independence) and Alfian Sa\u2019at (late independence). Each articulates an identity that is a hybrid of its various influences and unique to its moment of utterance.

Contributors draw on the seminal work of Donald E. Brown whose major monograph on the sultanate was published in 1970 and marked the beginnings of advanced sociological, anthropological and historical research on Brunei. Among the key issues addressed are status systems, titles and social stratification, Chinese sources for the study of Brunei, Malay oral and written histories and traditions, the symbolism, meanings and origins of coronation rituals, previously unknown sources for the study of Brunei history and the processes of incorporation of minority populations into the sultanate. Contributions by leading scholars of Brunei, Borneo and the wider Indonesian-Malay world, both from within Brunei Darussalam and beyond, address some central preoccupations which Brown raised and which have been the subject of continued debate in Austronesian and Southeast Asian studies. A novel contribution to the study of the history of Brunei Darussalam, this book will be of interest to scholars of Southeast Asian history, Asian history, Colonial and Imperial history and anthropology. Victor T. King is Professor of Borneo Studies at the Institute of Asian Studies , Universiti Brunei Darussalam, and Emeritus Professor of South East Asian Studies, University of Leeds, UK.

'paradise island', 'island of thousand temples' and many other images to support the growth of tourism industry. In fact, the industry has been developed massively  after a mass massacre of the leftists and radical populists associated with PKI (Communist Party of Indonesia) taking place in 1965-1966 led by General Soeharto. The images have been a strategy for romanticizing Balinese culture while simultaneously forgetting the traumatic tragedy of 1965.  Although the history has been distorted by the regime and most Balinese are reluctant to talk about tragedy, a few Balinese youth has established a community called Taman 65 (1965 Park) as a learning circle to study and challenge the state history. This book is a collection of their thoughts on history, Balinese social dynamics, and contemporary issues in Bali that arguably cannot be separated from the 1965 event.

In this chapter, however, I discuss major novels, short stories, a poem and two plays written in Southeast Asia during the global Cold War era (1950-90) in order to understand the ways in which these texts comment upon the Cold War and its impact on the region.

In Phnom Penh, he suffers countless hardships and injustices as a cyclo driver. Sam\u2019s humanity is denied him at every turn in the city\u2019s capitalist society, leading to devastation for him and his wife, Soy.\n\nAs Cambodia develops and Sam\u2019s fortunes change, he realises that while life as a farmer is far from easy, it has the potential to bring fulfilment and happiness.\n\nFirst published in 1961, eight years after Cambodia gained independence from French colonial rule, Suon Sorin\u2019s novel is an iconic work of modern Khmer literature. A singularly illuminating historical document of the new nation, the novel offers a fresh view into a period of profound transformation in Cambodia.\n\nThis is one of the first English translations of a modern Khmer novel, and is accompanied by an extended introduction which situates Suon Sorin\u2019s work in its historical and artistic context.\n\n\"Many survivors of Norodom Sihanouk\u2019s time in power in Cambodia (1955\u20131970) refer to the era as a golden age \u2013 as it certainly was when it\u2019s compared with what came next. A New Sun Rises Over the Old Land has been deftly translated and introduced by Roger Nelson. Reading this passionate, absorbing novel, it\u2019s poignant to re-enter a period that was filled for many Cambodians with optimism, autonomy and self-respect.\"\n-- David Chandler, Emeritus Professor, Monash University\n\n\"Of value to researchers and diasporic Khmers alike, this is tragedy as Khmer tragedy comes, entangled in class violence, national pride, and hope.\"\n-- Prumsodun Ok, author, dancer and choreographer\n\nSuon Sorin was born in Battambang, Cambodia in 1930. \"A New Sun Rises Over the Old Land\" is his only known work of fiction, and was the best-selling novel of the 1960s. It remains widely read in Cambodia today.\n\n168pp / 229 x 152mm, 2 images\nPaperback\nISBN: 978-981-3250-77-2\n\nhttps://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/a-new-sun-rises-over-the-old-land-a-novel-of-sihanouk-s-cambodia", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61372731, "asset_id": 41118197, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2721218, "first_name": "Roger", "last_name": "Nelson", "domain_name": "nanyang", "page_name": "RogerNelson", "display_name": "Roger Nelson", "profile_url": "https://nanyang.academia.edu/RogerNelson?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2721218/876732/1094557/s65_roger.nelson.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4081, "name": "Khmer Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6814, "name": "Cambodia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodia?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 26274, "name": "Cambodian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cambodian_History?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 50804, "name": "Literary translation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literary_translation?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 68573, "name": "Southeast Asian Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Art?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 529261, "name": "Khmer Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Khmer_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1240986, "name": "Southeast Asian Modern and Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Modern_and_Contemporary_Art?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 11769998, "title": "A Malaysian Existentialist Story: Lee Kok Liang\u2019s  London Does Not Belong to Me", "created_at": "2015-04-02T08:35:20.667-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11769998/A_Malaysian_Existentialist_Story_Lee_Kok_Liang_s_London_Does_Not_Belong_to_Me?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_11769998", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37191904, "asset_id": 11769998, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

Among the key issues addressed are status systems, titles and social stratification, Chinese sources for the study of Brunei, Malay oral and written histories and traditions, the symbolism, meanings and origins of coronation rituals, previously unknown sources for the study of Brunei history and the processes of incorporation of minority populations into the sultanate.

A grotesque reading of the two works was done\nbased on several reasons: the misfit characters, the grotesque elements present in the stories and ultimately, the grotesque manipulation of power towards the Other in society. This article aims to analyse elements of grotesque in the two stories via its\nthematisation of notions of alterity and manipulation of power. I also argue that the grotesque elements serve as a critique of the social malaise portrayed in the stories. Lisa Ho\u201fs misfit is the effeminate Endi, an illegitimate child of mixed parentage with\nmottephobia whose status as the other leads to a grotesque death. The misfit in Lee's work is portrayed via the nameless blind girl facing a bleak future as a result of her blindness and her father's abuse of paternal authority. While both protagonists are polar opposites, they both face grotesque consequences because of who they are. By relating to this, this paper argues that the grotesque elements expose readers to the unexpected,\ndark side of society.

Through insidious reproduction, such myths cast a discursive spell that dispossesses women of their subjectivity and agency. To break this curse and regain their voice, feminist authors have undertaken the task of rewriting old myths in ways that speak to current local probl\u00e9matiques. Intan Paramaditha's collection of stories, Apple and Knife (2018), is exemplary of this mission: in her speculative quill, fairy tales become reports of female body policing, vampires are symbolic of non-normative roles and a menstruation-eating monster is a counter-metaphor to misogynist scatological taboos. With a framework informed by feminist and postmodernist studies, this article explores the stylistic modes of corporeal writing in revisionist mythmaking. How are female bodies recast in revised myths in the interest of subverting standards of femininity? How does speculative fiction serve as an effective instrument in celebrating bodies symptomatically silenced in \"original\" texts? By fostering a dialogue between corporeal writing and revisionist speculative fiction, this paper examines how the female body may be reimagined outside what is deemed singular, natural, or authentic, both in terms of genre and gender.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64371490, "asset_id": 44032920, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28661007, "first_name": "Gema Charmaine", "last_name": "Gonzales", "domain_name": "univ-paris3", "page_name": "GemaCharmaineGonzales", "display_name": "Gema Charmaine Gonzales", "profile_url": "https://univ-paris3.academia.edu/GemaCharmaineGonzales?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28661007/38867204/36113066/s65_gema_charmaine.gonzales.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 788, "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mythology?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34860, "name": "Indonesian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 69865, "name": "Revisionist Fairy Tales", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Revisionist_Fairy_Tales?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 82062, "name": "\u00c9criture F\u00e9minine", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/%C3%89criture_F%C3%A9minine?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 26609305, "title": "Review: The Many Ways of Being Muslim: Fiction by Muslim Filipinos, edited by Coeli Barry", "created_at": "2016-06-29T13:16:48.423-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/26609305/Review_The_Many_Ways_of_Being_Muslim_Fiction_by_Muslim_Filipinos_edited_by_Coeli_Barry?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_26609305", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46895378, "asset_id": 26609305, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1964555, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Kloos", "domain_name": "kitlv", "page_name": "DavidKloos", "display_name": "David  Kloos", "profile_url": "https://kitlv.academia.edu/DavidKloos?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1964555/3166898/13056347/s65_david.kloos.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48789, "name": "Philippine Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 31499122, "title": "Antologia della Poesia Birmana Contributo ad una bibliografia sulla Birmania", "created_at": "2017-02-18T02:32:51.191-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/31499122/Antologia_della_Poesia_Birmana_Contributo_ad_una_bibliografia_sulla_Birmania?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_31499122", "summary": "Probabilmente perch\u00e9 in Italia mancano scuole a livello universitario idonee a stimolare \u2013 come avviene per l'India, il Tibet, la Cina, il Giappone, per non citare che i paesi che pi\u00f9 richiamano l'attenzione dei nostri orientalisti \u2013 l'interesse e lo studio della Birmania, delle sue genti, della sua civilt\u00e0, \u00e8 gi\u00e0 arduo attendersi di reperire, anche nelle migliori biblioteche, un minimo di opere fondamentali per iniziare una ricerca seria nel campo della birmanologia.

(Chinese-Malaysian) writer Ng Kim Chew (Huang Jinshu, 1967\u2013 ) has questioned Mahua literature\u2019s filiation to mainland Chinese literature through parodic depictions of look-alikes and resemblances involving the canonical May Fourth writer Yu Dafu and his sojourn in colonial Malaya. What critics view as Ng\u2019s self-invention through negativity can be used to explore his strategic alliance with another mainland Chinese genealogy, that of the late-Qing philologist-rebel Zhang Taiyan and the \u201cfather\u201d of modern Chinese literature, Lu Xun. Ng provocatively claims that the late-Qing and postwar (or Cold War) Mahua intellectual and literary contexts are structurally resonant. His filiation with these two historically unrelated contexts in his essays, as well as his short fiction, over two decades is what I call his imaginative materialism of Chinese writing (wen). Using Ng\u2019s recently published master\u2019s thesis on Zhang Taiyan (2012), I focus on how Zhang\u2019s role in the longer history of Chinese reflection on writing and semiotics shapes Ng\u2019s fictional works on Malayan communism and his critique of Mahua literary history. Besides Zhang\u2019s proposal for literary reform, I examine Ng\u2019s allegorical reading of Zhang\u2019s skepticism about oracle bone inscription, and what the \u201cunearthing\u201d of this ancient form of writing around the fall of empire means for Mahua people\u2019s history and experience of the Asian Cold War. Ng refashions cultural essentialist Zhang\u2019s Old Text Confucianism and \u201cNational Studies\u201d toward new ends. Paradoxically, it is Ng\u2019s deep engagement with the legibility of the classical Chinese past and the recurring theme of revolution and writing that defines his aesthetic modernity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59063333, "asset_id": 38960179, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 29201325, "first_name": "Nicholas Y.

Epic chanting, known collectively as sugidanon, is one marker of ethnolinguistic distinction that separates them from lowland populations due in part to use of an \u201carchaic Kinaray-a\u201d or binukidnon lexicon and the perception that chanting is a timeless ethnic tradition. Since the 1960s, several Filipino anthropologists have demonstrated a keen interest in the narratives, collecting and publishing them for academic and public consumption. Additionally, chants are currently taught to Panay Bukidnon children in an ethnopedagogy program known variously as the Balay Turun-an, School of Living Tradition (SLT), or GAMABA Training Center. My discussion of sugidanon will primarily refer to the ongoing University of the Philippines publication series chanted by members of the Caballero family, comprised of fourteen volumes total, presented in archaic and contemporary Kinaray-a, Tagalog, and English.\n\nThis paper argues that sugidanon chants act as invented tradition by asserting continuities with the precolonial past and also preserving in memory maritime lifeways and socioeconomic practices no longer extant among Panay Bukidnon people living in the uplands of Panay. The frame of invented tradition allows for analysis of sugidanon narratives as being situated in and informed by specific temporal, geographic, and cultural contexts rather than viewing them as timeless, obsolete, or exotic. To illustrate the applicability of invented tradition literature to the SLT program as my primary case study, I will first discuss other examples of invented tradition such as ethnic dress, language, and dance with a special focus on Southeast Asia. Furthermore, I suggest that sugidanon and the SLT program specifically are exemplars of one indigenous response to modernity that is contingent on Panay Bukidnon relationships with other non-indigenous Filipinos and the world at large.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59751643, "asset_id": 39596803, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5506731, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Gowey", "domain_name": "phoenixcollege", "page_name": "DavidGowey", "display_name": "David Gowey", "profile_url": "https://phoenixcollege.academia.edu/DavidGowey?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5506731/2969783/17107585/s65_david.gowey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8785, "name": "Philippines", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippines?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22559, "name": "Philippine Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 42199, "name": "Invented Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Invented_Traditions?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 48789, "name": "Philippine Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 62430, "name": "Oral literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 219015, "name": "Visayan Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visayan_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 273324, "name": "Iloilo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Iloilo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 572374, "name": "Sulodnon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sulodnon?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1367656, "name": "Western Visayan History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Western_Visayan_History?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1471395, "name": "preservation of culture and history in Calinog", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/preservation_of_culture_and_history_in_Calinog?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1935247, "name": "Kinaray-a", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kinaray-a?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 2697660, "name": "sugidanon", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/sugidanon?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 11769574, "title": "Malaysian Literature in English:  Challenges and Prospects in the New Millennium", "created_at": "2015-04-02T08:07:15.472-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/11769574/Malaysian_Literature_in_English_Challenges_and_Prospects_in_the_New_Millennium?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_11769574", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37191592, "asset_id": 11769574, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

This analysis demonstrates that during a significant period of cultural borrowing, from the 1780s until the 1820s, central Burmese (Burman) literati inserted western Burmese (Arakanese) myths and

which occurred in Cambodia in the aftermath of the Vietnam War cannot be easily dismissed or ignored. The ongoing (though not progressive) Khmer Rouge tribunal and the active campaigning of war remembrance by diasporic Cambodian writers and artists have demanded a re-assessment of the Khmer Rouge period of Cambodia from 1975-1979. In addition, the intentional publication of testimonies and historical fiction on anniversaries that mark the genocide in Cambodia also ensure that the nation\u2019s tragic past continues to remain in the public\u2019s consciousness. Moreover, the emphasis on the concept of responsibility and truth-telling by many Cambodian scholars clearly indicates a privileging of an uncontested accuracy over artistic and creative representations in testimonies concerned with war and genocide. This tension between immediate truth telling and artistic retelling is thus the main concern in this paper.  For, as the discussion will show, Vaddey Ratner\u2019s In the Shadow of the Banyan (2012) posits that the aesthetics of the written testimony need not be sacrificed for accurate truth-telling, but that the use of a Khmer Buddhist aesthetics enables her readers and her to actively resist a fetishized memory of the genocide, and seek reconciliation with their traumatic experiences.

The book explores the works of not just the established writers of the tradition but also those who have received little critical attention to date but who are equally gifted, such as Adibah Amin, Edward Dorall, Rehaman Rashid, and Huzir Suleiman. The chapters collectively address the challenges and achievements of writers in the English language in a country where English is widely used in daily life and yet marginalised in the creative domain to elevate the status of writings in the national language, i.e., Bahasa Malaysia. The book will demonstrate that in spite of such recurrent neglect of the medium, Malaysia has produced a number of outstanding writers in the language, who are comparable in creativity and craftsmanship to writers of other Anglophone traditions.

From that perspective, the dangers Burma faced during the Cold War faded from view and old allies in the 1950s, such as Ne Win, were now long-entrenched enemies. In this chapter, I seek to understand the ways in which the Nu government reacted to the Cold War in the 1950s, independently of the post-1962 Cold War context, under the shadow of the eventual military takeover.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55271877, "asset_id": 320071, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 136151, "first_name":

Writers in general are subjected to the political injunctions of censorship, but for Chinese women writers, there is the added complication of culture, which produces its own set of gendered prohibitions and barriers. However, I perceive that women writers do not necessarily respond to the discourse of censorship through resistance; instead, I argue that they are ambivalent and conflicted subjects whose notion of \u201cindividual expression\u201d has been shaped by the specific historical, socio-political and cultural conditions that have evolved in postcolonial Malaysia and Singapore. Hence the varying \u201cexpressions of self-censorship,\u201d which capture the ambivalence and tension experienced by Malaysian and Singaporean Chinese women writers, who are themselves caught between the contesting forces of nation and culture, Asia and the West.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32827969, "asset_id": 5816823, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1669386, "first_name": "Grace V.

The main issues to counter are representation of relation and negotiation among the four main characters who come from different ethnic, race, faith and national backgrounds. The applied theory is Will Kymlicka\u2019s multiculturalism perspective. The applied method is close-reading technique. The result of the study shows that (1) multicultural relation represented in the novel encompasses broad and complex diversity with various differences, (2) issues concerning cultural and religious background are still negotiated in daily practices, specifically in friendship, and (3) for marrital aspects, they are hardly free from standard norms and customs that are still strongly being upheld. The conclusion of the study is that multiculturalism in Indonesia tends to be limited to social practices in the surface sphere. Therefore, it has not completely blended because of a rigid and monolithic cultural traditions. \n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54054269, "asset_id": 34125952, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6925874, "first_name": "Alberta Natasia", "last_name": "Adji", "domain_name": "edithcowan", "page_name": "AlbertaNatasiaAdji", "display_name": "Alberta Natasia Adji", "profile_url": "https://edithcowan.academia.edu/AlbertaNatasiaAdji?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6925874/7961044/58991433/s65_alberta_natasia.adji.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 661270, "name": "Women and Latin American Art; Gender Studies and Feminism; the Modern Woman, Abstract Expressionism and Postwar Material Culture In US", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Women_and_Latin_American_Art_Gender_Studies_and_Feminism_the_Modern_Woman_Abstract_Expressionism_?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1824062, "name": "English Literature and Film Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_Literature_and_Film_Studies?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 62352357, "title": "In a Bunga Raya Park: The State of Malaysian Anglophone Literature", "created_at": "2021-11-25T05:08:32.806-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/62352357/In_a_Bunga_Raya_Park_The_State_of_Malaysian_Anglophone_Literature?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_62352357", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75147674, "asset_id": 62352357, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

"work_45138433", "summary": "In several papers published in the 1970s, Donald Brown explored the relationship between rank, ethnic homogeneity and indigenous historiography in Brunei. His main argument is that the hereditarily closed ranking system of Brunei\u2019s dominant ethnic group produced, or at least perpetuated, ethnic diversity and the development of an invented historiography in relation to ethnic origins to support the position of the dominant group. Similar relationships between rank, or status, and origins are found throughout much of the Austronesian-speaking world. In most of these societies origins are of fundamental social and political importance, often expressed through complex traditions that through recourse to origins function to establish social difference between individuals, social or ethnic groups in order to justify claims of precedence: a priority, seniority or superiority that can relate to rights over resources, political offices or the political or ritual ascendancy of one group over another. Drawing on data from the wider Austronesian world, particularly ideas of \u2018origin and precedence\u2019, this chapter presents a comparative analysis of various Brunei origin traditions, supplemented by historical, archaeological and linguistic data. While not uncritical of Brown\u2019s earlier studies, the chapter aims to both build and expand upon his work in understanding the relationship between social structures and history in Brunei.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 65763431, "asset_id": 45138433, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7540, "name": "Oral Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Traditions?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13850, "name": "Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_World?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 19267, "name": "Oral Tradition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Tradition?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 48574, "name": "Brunei Darussalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Darussalam?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 247641, "name": "Peoples and Cultures of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peoples_and_Cultures_of_Borneo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 278481, "name": "history of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Borneo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 645527, "name": "Sejarah Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Brunei?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 741137, "name": "History of Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Brunei?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1657007, "name": "Brunei Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Studies?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 43173660, "title": "Preface for the Indonesian Translation of Merle Ricklefs-Fiery Prince (2020)", "created_at": "2020-05-26T20:39:23.712-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/43173660/Preface_for_the_Indonesian_Translation_of_Merle_Ricklefs_Fiery_Prince_2020_?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_43173660", "summary": "This is the preface which I wrote for the Indonesian edition of the renowned historian of pre-colonial Java and Modern Indonesia, Merle Calvin Ricklefs' (1943-2019) last book, Soul Catcher; Java's Fiery Prince Mangkunagara I, 1726-95 (Singapore: NUS Press, 2018), which has been wonderfully translated by Dr Yuanda Zara of Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (UNY) and will soon be published by Penerbit Buku Kompas (PBK, Jakarta) under the title, 'Samber Nyawa; Kisah Perjuangan Seorang Pahlawan Nasional Indonesia; Pangeran Mangkunagara I (1726-1795)'.

To pursue this objective, the theory of humour formulated by John Morreall, a renowned contemporary figure in humour studies, has been used to frame the discussion. However, since Morreall focuses mostly on spoken\nhumour, the paper also makes references to Dominic Cheetam\u2019s work on written humour. The analysis shows that some elements fundamental to humour that can be found in Adibah Amin\u2019s writing are the presence of cognitive shifts that involve expectations and violation thereof, the play mode that induces practical disengagement, and the sense of enjoyment\nthat is exhilarating and liberating. Furthermore, Adibah Amin uses humour to promote intellectual and moral values. Besides making use of incongruities in things, Adibah Amin also includes some incongruities in presentation in her writing, which deal with her comical adaptations of linguistic patterns, further proving her astute use of humour.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57468729, "asset_id": 37497634, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

The first is a novel, People We Trust, and the second is a critical study of two representative novels belonging to a genre that the critic Gerald T. Burns has called \u201cMartial Law Literature\u201d, or literature that creatively engages with the Marcos dictatorship.\n\nI begin my critical study by discussing the tradition of resistance literature in the Philippines, tracing this back to Jose Rizal\u2019s Spanish-language novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. I then discuss how the Filipino historical novel developed out of this tradition of resistance writing, and how most, if not all, Filipino novels depict moments in Philippine history in which Filipinos have risen against those who threatened their sovereignty as a people. After the Philippine nation gained its independence, Filipino novelists utilised the genre to take charge of the nation\u2019s narrative, and to continuously engage with the question of national identity. The Martial Law novel occupies a particularly interesting place within this tradition, in that it grapples with the nation\u2019s inability to liberate itself from a legacy of oppression left behind by its colonial rulers as shown in its selection of a repressive, totalitarian ruler from within the national community.\nMy discussion draws on two novels: Ninotchka Rosca\u2019s State of War, and Gina Apostol\u2019s Gun Dealer\u2019s Daughter. They belong to opposite ends of an era in which Martial Law writing grew and developed: State of War having been published in 1988, two years after the Marcoses fled the Philippines, and Gun Dealer\u2019s\n\nDaughter having been published in 2012. Taken together, they chart what Gerald T. Burns, in his essay \u201cPhilippine Martial Law Fiction: Phases in the Early Evolution of the Genre\u201d, calls an \u201cevolution\u201d in Martial Law fiction and its increasing ambivalence towards social commitment and nationalism. Both novels explore the fissures associated with the emergence of the oppressor from within. My analyses correspond with my own novel\u2019s examination of how certain individuals, or societies, are more than willing to relinquish their individual freedoms in favour of what Erich Fromm would call an \u201cescape from freedom\u201d.\n\nThe critical component of my thesis engages with postcolonial theory in addition to studies on Martial Law writing, the Philippine historical novel, and Philippine postcoloniality.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7216039, "first_name": "Monica S", "last_name": "Macansantos", "domain_name": "utexas", "page_name": "MonicaSMacansantos", "display_name": "Monica S Macansantos", "profile_url": "https://utexas.academia.edu/MonicaSMacansantos?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7216039/9875174/11008303/s65_monica_s.macansantos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6741, "name": "Asian History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asian_History?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22559, "name": "Philippine Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 215532, "name": "Jose Rizal", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jose_Rizal?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 571329, "name": "Ninotchka Rosca", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ninotchka_Rosca?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1127878, "name": "Philippine Literature In English", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Literature_In_English?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1299799, "name": "Ferdinand Marcos", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ferdinand_Marcos?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 3996085, "name": "Philippine Historical Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Historical_Novel?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 3996086, "name": "Gina Apostol", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gina_Apostol?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 36560667, "title": "Can One Speak of the September 30th Movement (abstract).pdf", "created_at": "2018-05-03T20:15:55.451-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36560667/Can_One_Speak_of_the_September_30th_Movement_abstract_pdf?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_36560667", "summary": "The onset of the Cold War in Europe had its repercussions in Southeast Asia as newly independent Southeast-Asian nations found themselves having to \u201cchoose a side\u201d as they re-evaluated their relationships with both communists and their Western alliances. In Indonesia, the Cold War manifested as an extremely violent persecution of communists following a failed coup in 1965. With his assumption of power in 1966, Suharto\u2019s regime actively oppressed and eliminated artists and intellectuals deemed sympathetic to the Left, or who had trespassed any acceptable censorship markers. As such, most of the political fiction that reassessed the nation\u2019s violent past was overlooked until the early 2000s despite the seriousness and urgency inherent in its subject matter.\r\n\r\nDespite tight control of the press, historical fiction that critically assessed the socio-political situation in 1965\u20136 Indonesia was plentiful. The coup in 1965 (or the September 30th Movement) and the bloody nationwide mass murders that followed were common subject matters for authors such as Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Putu Wijaya, Umar Kayam, and Y. B. Mangunwijaya. Most of these authors employ the use of the Wayang and a Javanised Mahabharata as they seek to represent the events of 1965\u20136 in their attempts to destabilize Suharto\u2019s master narrative of the coup. However, what is particularly interesting and pressing is that which has been intentionally omitted from these works; for these stories and testimonies do not explicitly discuss the 1965 coup, even while they attempt to creatively represent the politicide which followed it. Through a reading of Y. B. Mangunwijaya\u2019s Durga/Umayi and Umar Kayam\u2019s Sri Sumarah and Other Stories, we can begin to understand how Indonesian authors engage with an Indonesian magical realism and, possibly, gain insight into the remembrance of the 1965 coup in Indonesian literature.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56486194, "asset_id": 36560667, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1892464, "first_name": "Kit Ying", "last_name": "Lye", "domain_name": "suss-sg", "page_name": "KitYingLye", "display_name": "Kit Ying Lye", "profile_url": "https://suss-sg.academia.edu/KitYingLye?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1892464/640809/47943838/s65_kit_ying.lye.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3651, "name": "Cold War and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cold_War_and_Culture?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10444, "name": "Postmodernism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postmodernism?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34860, "name": "Indonesian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indonesian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1284561, "name": "Politicide", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politicide?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 2947875, "name": "history and its remembrance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_and_its_remembrance?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 513073, "title": "Imagining\" Bangsa Malaysia\": Race, Religion, and Gender in Lloyd Fernando's Green is the Colour", "created_at": "2011-04-06T01:09:44.178-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/513073/Imagining_Bangsa_Malaysia_Race_Religion_and_Gender_in_Lloyd_Fernandos_Green_is_the_Colour?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_513073", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51377083, "asset_id": 513073, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

Through intertextual citation, Xiao Hei\u2019s novella not only constitutes a collaborative historical record of Ma Hua (Malaysian Chinese/Sinophone Malaysian) literature, but also a polyvocal interrogation of its own ethnolinguistic literary taxonomy. Xiao Hei\u2019s strategic representation of Malaysia as historical experience, contested polity, claimed nation, and rejected state apparatus exposes how the ethnolinguistic taxonomy reinforces national estrangement. Drawing from Kuan-hsing Chen\u2019s proposal of \u201cAsia as method,\u201d this chapter argues that Malaysia in Xiao Hei\u2019s novella alternatively functions as a mediating site for the decolonization of Malaysian national literature\u2019s ethnolinguistic basis as well as the deimperialization of an overseas Chinese literary framework prioritizing ethnicity/language over locality.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 78626, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Bernards", "domain_name": "usc", "page_name": "BrianBernards", "display_name": "Brian Bernards", "profile_url": "https://usc.academia.edu/BrianBernards?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/78626/1020412/27496418/s65_brian.bernards.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 33641, "name": "Modern Chinese Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Chinese_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 34132, "name": "Chinese Modern Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chinese_Modern_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 39064, "name": "Sinophone Malaysian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone_Malaysian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 39262, "name": "Sinophone Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 200609, "name": "East/Southeast Asian Chinese literatures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/East_Southeast_Asian_Chinese_literatures?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 960783, "name": "Modern Chinese Literary and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modern_Chinese_Literary_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1294729, "name": "Sinophone Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sinophone_Studies?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1469863, "name": "Malaysian literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malaysian_literature?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 26910339, "title": "\"On Some Themes in Budi Darma's Rafilus.\" In Membaca Sastra Jawa Timur: Revitalisasi, Representasi, dan Regenerasi, ed.

I wish to argue that the author's primary objective in the novel is to demonstrate how to \"detribalize\" Malaysia and create a holistic national identity by bringing the various races together, overcoming their historical rivalries and simmering tensions, augmented by the British colonial rule and Japanese Occupation. I wish to further argue that the national identity that Adibah Amin envisions for Malaysia is both inward-looking and outward-looking-taking care of itself as a mutually cooperative society while maintaining friendly relations with other countries, even those who were once the sources of oppression. Finally, I wish to contend that although the novel is set in the pre-independence period and probes the political circumstances of the time, it also indirectly comments on the current fragmented state of Malaysia, as the novel was written and published only in the new millennium.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 75300228, "asset_id": 62588554, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

"summary": "This volume looks at the life and works of Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain (1880\u20131932), arguably Bengal\u2019s earliest and boldest feminist, revered as a crusader for the emancipation and advancement of women, in particular Bengali Muslim women. Through her spirited writings and her activism, Rokeya challenged the two pillars of patriarchy \u2013 hierarchical family structures and religious dogma. She demanded that the \u2018family\u2019 be restructured on the basis of gender equality. A devout Muslim, she asked that women be recognised as human beings in their own right within practices of Islam. Born into an orthodox Muslim family, for Rokeya, the most vital way in which women could empower themselves was through education. The Sakhawat Memorial Girls\u2019 School in Kolkata, started by Rokeya in 1911, still stands as an enduring testament to that belief. This collection of biographical and critical essays places Rokeya within the socio-cultural and historical context of her times to better appreciate her literary and social contributions in the face of the formidable challenges she faced as a Bengali Muslim woman. The essays also aim to understand why the extraordinary vision she had, not just for women but for an ideal, more gender-just society, continues to be as radical, powerful and relevant today, almost a century after her death. This volume will be a valuable asset to students and scholars of women\u2019s and gender studies, as also of South Asian literature and culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 58832763, "first_name": "Mallarika", "last_name": "Sinha Roy", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MallarikaSinhaRoy", "display_name": "Mallarika Sinha Roy", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MallarikaSinhaRoy?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/58832763/22585706/21774920/s65_mallarika.sinha_roy.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 696, "name": "Gender Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1236, "name": "Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Art?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3558, "name": "South Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 93755, "name": "History and archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_archaeology?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 177125, "name": "Language Culture and Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Culture_and_Communication?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 22579617, "title": "Myanmar erz\u00e4hlt - 25 zeitgen\u00f6ssische Kurzgeschichten", "created_at": "2016-02-29T00:25:43.497-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/22579617/Myanmar_erz%C3%A4hlt_25_zeitgen%C3%B6ssische_Kurzgeschichten?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_22579617", "summary": "Collection of contemporary myanmar Short Stories translated into German", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43186575, "asset_id": 22579617, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6852297, "first_name": "Georg", "last_name": "Noack", "domain_name": "lindenmuseum", "page_name": "GNoack", "display_name": "Georg Noack", "profile_url": "https://lindenmuseum.academia.edu/GNoack?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6852297/2694453/46339745/s65_georg.noack.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2121, "name": "Burmese Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burmese_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 53953, "name": "Myanmar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Myanmar?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 463481, "name": "Burmese literature, Burmese language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Burmese_literature_Burmese_language?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 1156105, "title": "Cos\u00admopoli\u00adtan White\u00adness: Prac\u00adtices of Priv\u00adi\u00adlege and Technology in Post\u00adcolo\u00adnial Literature", "created_at": "2011-12-14T02:35:43.323-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1156105/Cos_mopoli_tan_White_ness_Prac_tices_of_Priv_i_lege_and_Technology_in_Post_colo_nial_Literature?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_1156105", "summary": "This book explores the phe\u00adnom\u00ade\u00adnon of \u201ccos\u00admopoli\u00adtan white\u00adness\u201d: the employ\u00adment of metaphor\u00adi\u00adcal and mate\u00adr\u00adial white ele\u00adments in post\u00adcolo\u00adnial lit\u00ader\u00ada\u00adture from South\u00adeast Asia, West and South\u00adern Africa, and the Caribbean. \u201cCos\u00admopoli\u00adtan white\u00adness\u201d denotes the use of white\u00adness as a type of cul\u00adtural prop\u00aderty, and a locus of invis\u00adi\u00adble priv\u00adi\u00adlege.

By focusing on the foreclosure of subject-formation through Suwen\u2019s failure of voice and agency, the text stresses the debilitating effects of state and cultural authority on the gendered subjectivity through her internalized condition of un-freedom. At the same time, trauma in the form of sexual molestation also contributes to reinforcing the inner mechanisms of self-censorship. The recurring textual silences and voids, projected by the corporeal body\u2019s daily rituals of avoidance and self-censorship, not only reaffirm the psychical wounds and dislocations working in the interiority, but also point to places where creative expressions of the censored self are enabled. This double-edged paradox deconstructs the narrow interpretation of censorship as a form of foreclosure, while attaching different connotations to the discourse of censorship as a means to locating different spaces of expression and agency.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38018956, "asset_id": 5816884, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1669386, "first_name": "Grace V.

It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia with an estimated 3 million tourists visiting Bali annually. However, the rapid development of the tourism industry raises concerns about environmental sustainability, social vulnerability and even the commodification of culture. \r\n\r\nWith regard to environmental sustainability, the Provincial Government of Bali has issued a provincial regulation (perda) on spatial planning, the 2009 Provincial Regulation on Spatial Planning for Bali Province. Since space plays an important role in maintaining culture and social relationship among Balinese, it is clear that the regulation would determine the picture of Bali in the next twenty years. In fact, the regulation is still the subject of ongoing debate among a wide range of interests, from conservation to commodification paradigm, or from sacred and profane viewpoints. However, it seems that both arguments are for the sake of tourism development since the arguments put maintaining the paradise image of Bali (for tourists) as the main objective.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the paper will examine how law plays a role in conducting debates between conservation and commodification viewpoints with regard to the provincial spatial plan of Bali and the extent to which justice is being accommodated in the regulation.

"dom_id": "work_79280157", "summary": "In several papers published in the 1970s, Donald Brown explored the relationship between rank, ethnic homogeneity and indigenous historiography in Brunei. His main argument is that the hereditarily closed ranking system of Brunei\u2019s dominant ethnic group produced, or at least perpetuated, ethnic diversity and the development of an invented historiography in relation to ethnic origins to support the position of the dominant group. Similar relationships between rank, or status, and origins are found throughout much of the Austronesian-speaking world. In most of these societies origins are of fundamental social and political importance, often expressed through complex traditions that through recourse to origins function to establish social difference between individuals, social or ethnic groups in order to justify claims of precedence: a priority, seniority or superiority that can relate to rights over resources, political offices or the political or ritual ascendancy of one group over another. Drawing on data from the wider Austronesian world, particularly ideas of \u2018origin and precedence\u2019, this chapter presents a comparative analysis of various Brunei origin traditions, supplemented by historical, archaeological and linguistic data. While not uncritical of Brown\u2019s earlier studies, the chapter aims to both build and expand upon his work in understanding the relationship between social structures and history in Brunei.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 826780, "first_name": "Stephen", "last_name": "Druce", "domain_name": "ubd", "page_name": "StephenDruce", "display_name": "Stephen C Druce", "profile_url": "https://ubd.academia.edu/StephenDruce?f_ri=23322", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/826780/591031/56818941/s65_stephen.druce.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1031, "name": "Southeast Asian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Studies?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6746, "name": "Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asia?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7540, "name": "Oral Traditions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Traditions?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13299, "name": "Southeast Asian Archaeology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Archaeology?f_ri=23322", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19267, "name": "Oral Tradition", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Oral_Tradition?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 23322, "name": "Southeast Asian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_Literature?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 29245, "name": "Southeast Asian history", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Southeast_Asian_history?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 39071, "name": "Austronesian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian_Studies?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 41617, "name": "Anthropology of Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 48574, "name": "Brunei Darussalam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Darussalam?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 55429, "name": "Austronesian", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Austronesian?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 198474, "name": "Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Borneo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 230727, "name": "Brunei History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_History?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 247641, "name": "Peoples and Cultures of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peoples_and_Cultures_of_Borneo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 278481, "name": "history of Borneo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/history_of_Borneo?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 645527, "name": "Sejarah Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sejarah_Brunei?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 741137, "name": "History of Brunei", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Brunei?f_ri=23322"}, {"id": 1657007, "name": "Brunei Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Brunei_Studies?f_ri=23322"}]}, {"id": 49087331, "title": "Lloyd Fernando", "created_at": "2021-06-01T08:01:52.080-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/49087331/Lloyd_Fernando?f_ri=23322", "dom_id": "work_49087331", "summary": "Biographical essay on the Malaysian writer Lloyd Fernando (1926-2008).", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 67483099, "asset_id": 49087331, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 49315, "first_name": "Mohammad A.", "last_name": "Quayum", "domain_name": "flinders", "page_name": "MohammadAQuayum", "display_name": "Mohammad A.

Sin embargo, el impacto y alcance de la literatura hispanofilipina se ha visto alterado en paralelo a las transformaciones culturales acaecidas en el Archipi\u00e9lago Filipino a lo largo de la historia. De forma similar a la primera literatura hispanoamericana, en Filipinas se desarrollaron los estadios est\u00e9ticos introducidos por la tradici\u00f3n occidental del Humanismo europeo. En su amalgama con elementos aut\u00f3ctonos y asi\u00e1ticos, el Barroco filipino no s\u00f3lo produjo un universo creativo sui generis, sino adem\u00e1s una tradici\u00f3n literaria que eclosion\u00f3 en el siglo XIX con la filipinizaci\u00f3n del romancero y el teatro hisp\u00e1nicos. Con la entrada en la modernidad y el desarrollo burgu\u00e9s de una sociedad ilustrada, la prosa \u2014el ensayo y la novela\u2014 fueron las piezas capitales para que la lengua espa\u00f1ola expresara los deseos de la naci\u00f3n filipina. Tras la independencia abortada de 1898 se produjo la imposici\u00f3n de un sistema educativo exclusivo en lengua inglesa. El espa\u00f1ol fue sistem\u00e1ticamente desarraigado, primero del \u00e1mbito p\u00fablico y, tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial en 1945, tambi\u00e9n del \u00e1mbito privado, manteniendo parad\u00f3jicamente su valor como instrumento de expresi\u00f3n del mayor nacionalismo filipino. Despu\u00e9s de la Constituci\u00f3n de 1987, el espa\u00f1ol dej\u00f3 de ser lengua oficial del Archipi\u00e9lago Filipino tras cuatro siglos.
