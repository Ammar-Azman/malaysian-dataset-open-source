After descendants of Chinese immigrants, widely regarded as Thailand\u2019s largest and most successfully assimilated ethnic minority, Malays residing south of Satun and Songkhla are over three times more numerous that the Northern Khmer of southern Isaan, its next most populous ethnic minority. Practically all Thai citizens self-identifying as Melayu are Muslims, and Islam is Thailand\u2019s largest religious minority. Nevertheless, not all Muslims self-identify as Malays, and Islam has long been acknowledged as being anything but a monolith. In addition to being an ethnically diverse ecumene, its sectarian divisions mirror those present throughout Southeast Asia. Some surmise Thailand\u2019s Muslims being divided between \u201cMalay-Muslims\u201d, and \u201cThai-Muslims\u201d who are either traditionalist or reformist in orientation. This paper proposes perspectives on Thailand\u2019s Muslim mosaic based multi-sited fieldwork among Sufi orders (Ar. turuq, tariqa [sg.]) with visible and viable followings from among the Central Thai-speaking, Southern Thai-speaking, and Malay-speaking Muslim communities. This paper seeks to articulate alternatives to the double-barreled binaries that have provided the theoretical ballast in previous explorations of Muslim ethnic and religious diversity. Whilst relevant details of these hereunto unstudied Sufi orders are provided, this paper\u2019s considers the significance of their presence in three cultural milieu between Ayutthaya and Narathiwat over the details of the spiritual lineages (Ar. silsilah) or litanies (Ar. wird) of individual orders. Rather than where these orders have come from, I concentrate on both their adoption by Central Thai, Southern Thailand, and Malay-speaking Muslims, and the manner in which they have been adapted in ways that reflect these regional identities. Most tariqa might remain within the cultural milieu where they have been localized, but boundaries between these are far from fixed.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36208298, "asset_id":

It has been suggested that the trilogy, which consists of the novels Time for a Tiger (1956), The Enemy in the Blanket (1958) and Beds in the East (1959), depicts the Islamic practices through its Muslim Malay characters, displaying their hypocrisy and their wayward Islamic practices as stated by Zawiyah Yahya (2003). In contrast, the trilogy has rarely been studied based on elements of the paradigm of Malayness in literature, consisting of six elements, namely the Malay language, Islam, the Malay rulers, adat/culture, ethnicity, and identity. Therefore, we aim to analyse one of the novels in the trilogy, The Enemy in the Blanket, in light of Islam as one of the elements under the paradigm of Malayness in literature as stated by Ida as our primary conceptual framework in this study. To achieve these objectives, we employ a close textual reading on the novel by analysing the Muslim Malay characters in The Enemy in the Blanket. The findings show that the Muslim Malay characters in The Enemy in the Blanket could be considered as wayward Muslims in their practices and beliefs. Therefore, we would like to reconfirm that the paradigm of Malayness in in fact, an everyday- defined social reality, as experienced by the people in the course of their everyday life as opposed to it as an authority-defined social reality, as defined by people of the dominant power structure. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the on-going discourse on Islam as the paradigm of Malayness as well as English literature on the Malay World.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 78930471, "asset_id": 68465122, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 7907144, "first_name": "Nurhanis", "last_name": "Sahiddan", "domain_name": "uniten", "page_name": "NurhanisSahiddan", "display_name": "Nurhanis Sahiddan", "profile_url": "https://uniten.academia.edu/NurhanisSahiddan?f_ri=1383602", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/7907144/2786648/60045884/s65_nurhanis.sahiddan.png"}, {"id": 252341, "first_name": "Mastura", "last_name": "Johar", "domain_name": "putrabusinessschool", "page_name": "MasJohar", "display_name": "Mastura  Johar", "profile_url": "https://putrabusinessschool.academia.edu/MasJohar?f_ri=1383602", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 74382, "name": "Novels", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Novels?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 981355, "name": "Malay Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Identity?f_ri=1383602"}, {"id": 1383602, "name": "Malayness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayness?f_ri=1383602"}]}, {"id": 44355722, "title": "Manufacturing Malayness: British debates on the Malay nation, civilisation, race and language in the early nineteenth century", "created_at": "2020-10-23T04:54:54.640-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44355722/Manufacturing_Malayness_British_debates_on_the_Malay_nation_civilisation_race_and_language_in_the_early_nineteenth_century?f_ri=1383602", "dom_id": "work_44355722", "summary": "This article examines the ways in which the notion of Malayness was conceptualised, articulated, and debated in a set of foundational British discourses on this topic during the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Using T.R. Trautmann's concept of locational techniques and D. Rowly-Conwy's idea of competing referential frameworks, the article argues that these conceptualisations have to be assessed within their contemporary colonial and epistemic contexts. The differences in the ascribed importance of language, nation, race, and civilisation in the definition of Malayness thus depended upon whether it was inscribed into a framework composed of orientalist philology, Scottish Enlightenment theories of stadial progress or a genealogically infused ethnology. Applying evidence procured from the fields of textual philology, comparative philology, racial classification, antiquarianism, and conjectural history, the scholar-administrators William Marsden, John Leyden, Stamford Raffles, and John Crawfurd offered their discrepant versions of Malay origin, history, and essence. These versions each embodied their own particular historical vision that not merely prefigured the authoritative mode of approaching and assessing the notion of Malayness, but it also prescribed the scope within which the imperial politics could be framed and the colonial projects unrolled.\n\nKeywords: Colonial discourses, British ideas on Malayness, science, history, and ideology, early nineteenth century, colonial Southeast Asia", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 64750266, "asset_id": 44355722, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20400995, "first_name": "Martin", "last_name": "M\u00fcller", "domain_name": "ku-dk", "page_name": "MartinM\u00fcller", "display_name": "Martin M\u00fcller", "profile_url": "https://ku-dk.academia.edu/MartinM%C3%BCller?f_ri=1383602", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20400995/48709368/36893085/s65_martin.m_ller.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 95, "name": "History of Linguistics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Linguistics?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4996, "name": "History of Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Anthropology?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 - )", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_Imperial_and_Colonial_History_1600_-_?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16175, "name": "History of Linguistic Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Linguistic_Thought?f_ri=1383602"}, {"id": 18727, "name": "History of Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Imperialism?f_ri=1383602"}, {"id": 662820, "name": "History of Islam In the Southeast Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Islam_In_the_Southeast_Asia?f_ri=1383602"}, {"id": 1383602, "name": "Malayness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayness?f_ri=1383602"}]}, {"id": 65210807, "title": "Malay Cultural Identities: A Review", "created_at": "2021-12-20T10:52:53.031-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/65210807/Malay_Cultural_Identities_A_Review?f_ri=1383602", "dom_id": "work_65210807", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 76910320, "asset_id": 65210807, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 210930849, "first_name": "MD SAIFUL", "last_name": "ISLAM", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "MDSAIFULISLAM407", "display_name": "MD SAIFUL ISLAM", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/MDSAIFULISLAM407?f_ri=1383602", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 9631639, "first_name": "ruzy", "last_name": "hashim", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ruzyhashim", "display_name": "ruzy hashim", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ruzyhashim?f_ri=1383602", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/9631639/10540702/11763731/s65_ruzy.hashim.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 578214, "name": "Impact of Social Sciences and Humanities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Impact_of_Social_Sciences_and_Humanities?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1383602, "name": "Malayness", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malayness?f_ri=1383602", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 68510137, "title": "Malayan Muslims as a Reflection of Malayness in Anthony Burgess's Time for a Tiger", "created_at": "2022-01-17T03:13:53.026-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68510137/Malayan_Muslims_as_a_Reflection_of_Malayness_in_Anthony_Burgesss_Time_for_a_Tiger?f_ri=1383602", "dom_id": "work_68510137", "summary": "In one of the most overlooked English literary text on the Malay\nWorld, namely Anthony Burgess\u2019 novel Time for a Tiger (1956), the\ndepictions of Islamic practices through the Malay characters show their\nhypocrisy and that they are wayward Muslims (Zawiah Yahya, 2003).\nThis paper then seeks to explore the role of Islam as a paradigm of\nMalayness in literature portrayed through characters understood to be\nMalay.
