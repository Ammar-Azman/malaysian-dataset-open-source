One such group is the Eurasian \u201cIndo\u201d community that has its roots in the former Dutch East Indies, today\u2019s Indonesia. This article focuses on Tjalie Robinson, the intellectual leader of this community from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The son of a Dutch father and a British-Javanese mother, Robinson became the leading voice of the diasporic Indo community in the Netherlands and later also in the United States. His engagement resulted in the foundation of the Indo magazine Tong Tong and the annual Pasar Malam Besar, what was to become the world\u2019s biggest Eurasian festival. Robinson played an essential role in the cultural awareness and self-pride of the eventually global Indo community through his elaboration of a hybrid and transnational identity concept. By placing his focus \u201ctussen twee werelden\u201d (in-between two worlds) and identifying \u201cmixties-schap\u201d (mestizaje) as the essential characteristic of Indo identity, Robinson anticipated debates on hybridity, transnationalism, and creolism that only much later would draw attention from scholars in the field of postcolonial studies. This article highlights Robinson\u2019s pioneering role in framing a deterritorialized hybrid alternative to nationalist essentialism in the postcolonial era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

examines the relationship between the media and cosmopolitanism in an increasingly fragmented and globalizing world. This relationship is presented from multiple perspectives and the essays cover, amongst other themes, cosmopolitanization in everyday life, the mediation of suffering, trauma studies, and researching cosmopolitanism from a non-Western perspective. \nSome of the essays explore existing research and theory about cosmopolitanism and apply it to specific case studies; others attempt to extend this theoretical framework and engage in a dialogue with the broader disciplines of media and cultural studies. Overall, this variety of approaches generates valuable insights into the central issue of the book: the role played by the media, in its various forms, in either encouraging or discouraging cosmopolitanist identifications among its audiences.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62182648, "asset_id": 42056618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42955, "first_name": "Aris", "last_name": "Mousoutzanis", "domain_name": "brighton", "page_name": "ArisMousoutzanis", "display_name": "Aris  Mousoutzanis", "profile_url": "https://brighton.academia.edu/ArisMousoutzanis?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42955/13878/14160381/s65_aris.mousoutzanis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 134694, "name": "Media and Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Communications?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1196959, "name": "Globalisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 8752220, "title": "Sustaining Cultures in the Face of Globalization", "created_at": "2014-10-13T03:41:49.011-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8752220/Sustaining_Cultures_in_the_Face_of_Globalization?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_8752220", "summary": "Arguments for the preservation of culture are based on an extremely problematic essentialist conception of culture as a fixed entity. The inadequacy of the essentialist conception has received increasing recognition, but an adequate positive conception has yet to take its place. This essay reframes the debate about cultural preservation by proposing a new conception of culture as conversation.  The new conception acknowledges the fluidity and internal contestation that occurs within actual cultures, and the agency of a culture\u2019s members in creating, transmitting and revising that culture. We make this new conception our basis for proposing that a proper concern for the value of a culture should be realized in enabling its members to sustain it, not to preserve some pre-existing essence. Adopting this more viable notion of culture also changes our conception of what needs to be done to sustain it, and allows us to acknowledge and better deal with the complex arguments for and against sustaining culture.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35106670, "asset_id": 8752220, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 489331, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Wong", "domain_name": "duke", "page_name": "DavidWong", "display_name": "David Wong", "profile_url": "https://duke.academia.edu/DavidWong?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/489331/2251489/20845235/s65_david.wong.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 11961833, "title": "\"Identidad y cosmopolitismo.

Edited by Seena Fazel and John Danesh. Los Angeles: Kalimat\u00a0Press, 2004. Pp. 94\u2013158.\n\nAfrican American philosopher Alain Locke is arguably the most profound and important Western Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed philosopher to date. Except for one 1979 article in a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed periodical, scholarship on Locke has neither seriously taken into account his Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed identity nor the Faith\u2019s influence on his work. The present study, based largely on archival sources, contributes to research on this \u201cmissing\u201d dimension of Locke\u2019s complex life and thought. It examines Locke\u2019s worldview as a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, his secular perspective as a philosopher, and the synergy between his confessional and professional essays. This study also argues that Locke had a fluid hierarchy of values\u2014of loyalty, tolerance, reciprocity, cultural relativism and pluralism (the philosophical equivalent of \u201cunity in diversity\u201d)\u2014and that this hierarchy represents a progression and application of quintessentially Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed ideals. Locke\u2019s distinction as a \u201cBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed philosopher\u201d may therefore be justified on ideological as well as historical grounds. Locke \u201ctranslated\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed ideals \u201cinto more secular terms\u201d so that \u201ca greater practical range will be opened up for the application and final vindication of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed principles\u201d in order to achieve \u201ca positive multiplication of spiritual power.\u201d", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56547014, "asset_id": 4332734, "asset_type":

an old phenomenon. The last decade alone has marked the highest number of migrations in recorded history. Constrained by environmental, economic, and political instability, scores of people are on the move. But other sorts of changes\u2014from global tourism to undocumented labor\u2014have led to the fact that to some extent, we are all becoming migrants. The migrant has become the political figure of our time.\r\n\r\nRather than viewing migration as the exception to the rule of political fixity and citizenship, Thomas Nail reinterprets the history of political power from the perspective of the movement that defines the migrant in the first place. Applying his \"kinopolitics\" to several major historical conditions (territorial, political, juridical, and economic) and figures of migration (the nomad, the barbarian, the vagabond, and the proletariat), he provides fresh tools for the analysis of contemporary migration.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38817088, "asset_id": 15329910, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

Gordon Melton, \nDistinguished Professor of American Religious History, Baylor University \n\nFar from being an interesting additional topic for the religious dilettante, the discussion around the theological reality that is America, periodically bursts forth as an important item on the nation's agenda, from the place of prayer services in the White House, to the issuance of an annual government report on religious persecution, to the rise of contemporary terrorism. As one traces radical Islam, for example, one arrives at the writings of one Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian who spent some of his younger years in America, and came away with his own vision of a country mired in sin and decadence. He would posit America as the image of everything he hoped to escape in promoting the agenda of the Muslim Brotherhood. \n\nNow, in all honesty, I must admit that over the years as I encountered all of the intriguing, even fascinating, ideas about America in the great cosmic scheme of things, I never got around to systematically gathering the different visions and trying to make sense of them in any detailed fashion. Thus, I have been more than happy to receive, and now with this modest introduction, pass along to my scholarly colleagues and the reading public the work of Christopher Buck. \n\nDuring his years of observation and research, Buck has surveyed the spectrum of visions of America that have energized and motivated the America's religious community, and has selected from among them a sample that both (1) represents the spectrum of opinion about America and its importance, and (2) highlights the more important visions of America that have shaped and are continuing to shape the way we understand this country we call home. His work calls us to become self-conscious about the assumptions we use in our day-to-day movements that massage the ways we approach our neighbors, our colleagues at work, and the politicians for whom we vote. \n\nBuck begins with the visions of America present at the founding of the nation, aspects of which still strongly permeate the culture today, and have found a new home among conservative Protestants in their innovative idea of Christian America. Amid the Protestant context, we often forget the role of the Roman Catholic Church, which became the largest religious body in America in the 1840s and is now three times larger than its nearest competitor. At the end of the nineteenth century, a controversy on Americanism would erupt around Catholic visions of their place in a changing world that would drive it from participation in the nation's public square for a half-century, and molded its reentrance after World War II.\n\nAnd then there are all the other-than-Christian religions, from Ahmadiyya Muslims to Zoroastrians, all of which possess their its own vision of America that shapes their appropriation of life in the United States and guides their development as their place in the nation was challenged, then accepted, and most recently affirmed and even celebrated by the nation as a whole. We have watched as Buddhists have carved out a place as cultural peacemakers, Muslims have struggled with separation of religion and government, and Baha'is have tried to understand the communication of their founder, Baha'u'llah, with the presidents of the Americas collectively, and with 'Abdu'l-Baha's statements about the destiny of America in particular. All of this occurs in the ebb and flow of religious life. One day we envision the possible unity of America's religions only to be thrown up against the many harsh divisions, which motivates us once more to seek realms of agreement, which again highlights the array of issues that can drive wedges between those who accept the label \"American\" as part of their self-identity. \n\nIn conclusion, I can, as a scholar, reflect on the contribution that this book, Religious Myths and Visions of America: God and Apple Pie, is making to our understanding of the American mosaic and how various segments of the religious community have found their way to being American. As an informed citizen I welcome its information that allows me to empathize with and make informed decisions relative to those with whom I might align (or oppose) as I sally forth in the public square. And on a personal level, I welcome the author's invitation for me to meet anew the residents of my neighborhood, those who shop in the same stores I do, send their children to the same schools my grandchildren attend, and diligently work toward their own appropriation of the American dream.\n\nJ.

Was it forced upon these people by the oppression they suffered in the diaspora, or was it deliberate (and idealistic/utopian)?\nThe second and third parts study several manners of constructing cosmopolitan characters and collective cosmopolitan identities in literary fiction, first with the figure of Casanova, then through a detailed analysis of Salman Rushdie\u2019s novel\u00a0The Enchantress of Florence.\nSome close readings lead us back to European Jews from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, with the legend of the\u00a0Jewess of Toledo\u00a0and its many rewritings.\nAmitav Ghosh\u2019s oeuvre and particularly his\u00a0Ibis Trilogy\u00a0introduce us to the represented fullness of a cosmopolitan world in the guise of a historical fiction situated grossly in the mid-19th century. But can this elaborate geographical, linguistic and symbolic construction, full of extraordinary personalities and unusual encounters, constitute a paradigm for a viable cosmopolitanism today?\nThe answer partly depends on what we mean by \u201cnarrative identity,\u201d self-othering and the relational nature of selves in formation.

M\u012brz\u0101 \u1e24usayn-\u2018Al\u012b (1817\u20131892), known as Bah\u0101\u2019-All\u0101h (more commonly, Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, \u2018Splendor of God\u2019), prophet\u2013founder of the Bah\u0101\u2019\u012b Faith. \r\n\r\nIn the Kit\u0101b-i \u2018Ahd\u012b (\u2018Book of My Covenant\u2019), Baha\u2019u\u2019llah designated his eldest son, \u2018Abb\u0101s Effend\u012b, known as \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u0101 (1844\u20131921), as successor. Baha\u2019u\u2019llah died on 29 May 1892 (at 3:00 a.m.) in Bahj\u012b (near \u2018Akk\u0101), Palestine (now modern-day Israel), and the Kit\u0101b-i \u2018Ahd\u012b was read aloud nine days later. \r\n\r\nIn 1893, Russian orientalist, Aleksandr Grigor\u2019evich Tumanski (1861\u20131920) published this document, in the original Persian, with Russian translation, together with a eulogy composed by the celebrated Bah\u0101\u2019\u012b poet, M\u012brz\u0101 \u2018Al\u012b-Ashraf-i L\u0101h\u012bj\u0101n\u012b, known by his sobriquet, \u2018Andal\u012bb (\u2018Nightingale\u2019; d. 1920). Since \u2018Andal\u012bb was an eyewitness to the events he describes, his eulogy may be treated as a historical source. \r\n\r\nTumanski\u2019s scholarly publication of the Kit\u0101b-i \u2018Ahd\u012b is discussed in the context of Russian scholarly and diplomatic interests.

(Published in 2008.): \u201dChristopher Buck\u2019s recent book, Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy, is a welcome addition to the literature on early twentieth-century American and African American culture. But, perhaps more important, Buck\u2019s study is a significant contribution to scholarship on the history of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in the United States. \u2026 Any future study of Locke must necessarily make its way through Christopher Buck\u2019s Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy. The scholar forcefully proves his thesis that, in Locke\u2019s thinking, philosophy and religious belief operated as synergistic terms. He has shown that the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith was integral to Locke\u2019s life and ideology. \u2026  Yet, after reading Buck\u2019s work, it is difficult to imagine Locke the philosopher rapt in prayer. Of course, this is not a shortcoming of the book. Rather it is an indication that, while he may have wanted to portray a more pious figure, Buck maintains the vow he made in his introduction to Alain Locke: Faith and Philosophy \u201cto constrain any grandiose claims on Locke as a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed.\u201d \r\n\r\n\u2022 \tM.

The book\u2019s concept is premised on a sense of belonging in a community of strangers; this comes from the firm conviction that theatre, by nature, prepares its audience to engage in a community which are both local and global. The vibrant Manila theatre scene is used as takeoff point in articulating this argument. The first part of the book provides a general picture of how cosmopolitanism is \u201cperformed\u201d by Filipinos. It investigates the specificity of Manila theatre as the site of the cosmopolitan experience. The second part is a series of analyses of plays that are about social issues while being realistic in their approach, but are, at the same time topicalized and editorialized\u2014much like television shows\u2014as social problems within the Philippine context against the massive backdrops of late capitalism and globalization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63804885, "asset_id": 42268585, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 228298, "first_name": "Sir Anril Pineda", "last_name": "TIATCO", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "SirAnrilPinedaTiatco", "display_name": "Sir Anril Pineda TIATCO", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/SirAnrilPinedaTiatco?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/228298/221369/4539877/s65_sir_anril_pineda.tiatco.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11354, "name": "Globalization And Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73676, "name": "Cultural Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Globalization?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 488456, "name": "Contemporary Philippine Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Philippine_Theatre?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 516375, "name": "Contemporary Performance Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Performance_Practice?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1239582, "name": "Philippine Society and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Society_and_Culture?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2199773, "name": "Philippine Contemporary Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Contemporary_Arts?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 2388987, "title": "Leone l'Africano e l'immaginazione narrativa", "created_at": "2013-01-11T02:22:08.926-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2388987/Leone_lAfricano_e_limmaginazione_narrativa?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_2388987", "summary": "\"Cultural studies\", looking for a possible political alternative to multiculturalism, has recently put the classic notion of cosmopolitanism under revision. Philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah has underlined how a cosmopolitan attitude - as an ethical commitment - relies on narrative imagination and evaluative language. Conversations and exercises of evaluation of stories can provide a base for a critique both of absolute universalism and of positivist relativism. This approach invites us to question the contradictory versions, together with their ideological and political stakes, regarding the identity of Leo Africanus. Leo, a Muslim traveller captured by the Christians in 1518 and donated as a slave to the Pope, wrote a broad and rich \"Descrittione dell'Africa\" in Italian, which, through the publication by Giovanni Battista Ramusio (1550), became a reference in Europe for the geographical knowledge of continental Africa. The ambiguities of his works and life have always been a matter of dispute: Leo, in fact, has become from time to time a symbol of European Renaissance humanism, the bearer of a whole Arab and Islamic tradition, a suspect, if not treacherous crosser, of religious and geographical borders, a national Moroccan hero, a pedagogic example of cultural mediation between East and West, North and South, and finally a perfect historical source of inspiration for contemporary cosmopolitanism. This long and complex history is briefly exposed here with particular attention to the recent new fortune of Leo, marked by the enduring success of Amin Maalouf's novel \"L\u00e9on l'Africain\" (1986) and by the publication of \"Trickster Travels\" (2006) by historian Natalie Zemon Davis.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 49623543, "asset_id": 2388987, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3089458, "first_name": "Toni", "last_name": "Veneri", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "ToniVeneri", "display_name": "Toni Veneri", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/ToniVeneri?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3089458/1015066/1269046/s65_toni.veneri.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2987, "name": "Renaissance Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Renaissance_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 694722, "name": "Leo Africanus", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Leo_Africanus?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 694723, "name": "Amin Maalouf", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Amin_Maalouf?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 32616086, "title": "Sovyetik Ulus ve Devlet Yarat\u0131m S\u00fcrecinde Tarihyaz\u0131m\u0131 Historiography During the Soviet Nation and State Building Process", "created_at": "2017-04-24T04:08:53.471-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/32616086/Sovyetik_Ulus_ve_Devlet_Yarat%C4%B1m_S%C3%BCrecinde_Tarihyaz%C4%B1m%C4%B1_Historiography_During_the_Soviet_Nation_and_State_Building_Process?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_32616086", "summary": "Historiography During the Soviet Nation and State Building Process\nThe concepts of nation and state embody in themselves both normality and artificiality. It is firmly established by historical experience that the human, as the subject of the former as well as the object of the latter, frequently interferes with the content of these concepts. If this intervention stems from ideological reasons, the implication is that the mechanism for providing legitimacy is involved with its focus on historiography. At this stage, the engine of historiography becomes an office for the approval of political power.\nWithin that context, the fictionalization of history transforms the knowledge of the past to a reproducible product. This understanding means a neglect of the motive to attain the reality of the past; instead, the aim is to become the social engineering required for the continuity of the ideology. In this concise text, alongside the ongoing philosophical debates as to what history is and how it should be laid out, the instrumentality of history in practical terms will be examined with a special focus on the Soviet Union paradigm.\nKeywords: Soviet historiography, Soviet nation-state, Territorial historiography, Soviet nationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52788753, "asset_id":

we conceive the cosmopolitan ideal of travelling and experiencing exotic difference, so much embraced by 'countercultural' practices, once it is aestheticized into phantasmagorical dream-worlds? How can we think of people getting wasted due to drug-fuelled, long-lasting dancing without resorting to idealisms of 'alter-nate experiences' and romanticisms about ideal ways of belonging? This article explores psytrance festivals-a cultural product of the Electronic Dance Music (EDM) carnivalesque celebrations, drug consumption (for the most part LSD and MDMA) and euphoric travelling of the 1960s-with an emphasis on cosmopoli-tanism, aesthetic intimacy and the care of the self. By examining the mobility of Greek aficionados in EDM festivals in Europe, which have gained great popularity since the first decade of the twenty-first century, I discuss the enactment of the chemical celebration in accordance with the sensorial formations, desiring-images and narratives that weave the imagination of psytrance music culture.

Linking the backgrounds of these chefs with their recipes examines the impact of global cultural flows on the production of cosmopolitan cuisine. A number of \"cosmopolitanizing strategies\" are interrogated that position HRC concurrently within multiple registers: global, regional, and local. Examples of these crosscutting strategies include disruption, performance, and hybridization. The hybridity present in\r\nHRC, as a central cosmopolitanizing strategy, both incorporates but also reaches beyond the local. HRC is discussed as a contact zone where waves of commodity, culture, and tradition collide to form an engineered regional\r\ncuisine to wash up along global shores.

I examine two singers who enjoy popularity both within Xinjiang and more broadly across China/the East Asia region. Arken, the Uyghur \u2018Guitar King\u2019, represents a style of pop fusion known as \u2018New Flamenco\u2019, originally inspired by the Gypsy Kings; Dao Lang, a Sichuanese (Han) immigrant to \u00dcr\u00fcmchi describes himself as a Xin Xinjiangren (\u2018new Xinjiangese\u2019) and draws on traditional Uyghur musical instruments to infuse his rock adaptations of regional folk songs and Chinese revolutionary classics. I analyse how the production, transmission and consumption of oral, musical and visual texts are manipulated by artists and audience and come to represent two distinct identities: Xinjiang (the territory) as a \u2018bounded\u2019, inalienable part of the New China vs. Xinjiang (the indigenous peoples) as part of a \u2018boundless\u2019, global community that is open to and influenced by Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Western cultural flows. In doing so, I emphasise how Chinese - the language of the \u2018coloniser\u2019 - is increasingly the vehicle through which the Uyghur youth transmits this new identity of \u2018world citizen\u2019, and suggest that the Uyghur language may yet turn out to be less \u2018fixed\u2019 a cultural symbol than previously thought.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50138990, "asset_id": 29562642, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33088694, "first_name": "Jo (Joanne)", "last_name": "Smith Finley", "domain_name": "newcastle", "page_name": "JoSmithFinley", "display_name": "Jo (Joanne) Smith Finley", "profile_url": "https://newcastle.academia.edu/JoSmithFinley?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/33088694/13997599/18078777/s65_jo.smith_finley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1631, "name": "Popular Music", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Music?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12017, "name": "Xinjiang", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Xinjiang?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 17616, "name": "Globalization and Youth Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_and_Youth_Culture?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 52385, "name": "Uyghurs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Uyghurs?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 36292119, "title": "The cosmopolitanization of tourism: An afterthought", "created_at": "2018-03-30T08:52:23.270-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/36292119/The_cosmopolitanization_of_tourism_An_afterthought?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_36292119", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56198281, "asset_id": 36292119, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2278, "first_name": "Noel B.", "last_name": "Salazar", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "NoelBSalazar", "display_name": "Noel B.

postmodern literature. The questions in its wake are explored through an analysis of Merrily Weisbord\u2019s The Love Queen of Malabar: Memoir of a Friendship with Kamala Das (2011). This work which can be called an eponymous glocal entity, destabilizes the notion of a homogenous literary genre by defying the boundaries of memoir, biography, autobiography and travelogue. To tackle the ambivalence evident here, the theoretical inroads opened up by the discourse of cosmopolitanism is taken up to negotiate the \u2018glocal\u2019.  By occupying a liminal generic space this work opens up many questions pertaining to the nuances of displacement, transnational transactions and generic interactions and how it ultimately contributes to the mythography surrounding Kamala Das/ Surraiyya/ Madhavikutty.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54124335, "asset_id": 34207698, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 516996, "first_name": "swetha", "last_name": "antony", "domain_name": "du-in", "page_name": "swethaantony", "display_name": "swetha antony", "profile_url": "https://du-in.academia.edu/swethaantony?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/516996/1014605/88459572/s65_swetha.antony.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6185, "name": "Women's Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Womens_Literature?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20985, "name": "Memoir and Autobiography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Memoir_and_Autobiography?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26112, "name": "Autobiographical Self-Representation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Autobiographical_Self-Representation?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 72708, "name": "Biography and Life-Writing", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biography_and_Life-Writing?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 380034, "name": "KAMALA DAS", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/KAMALA_DAS?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2766137, "name": "madhavikutty ", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/madhavikutty?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2766140, "name": "Merrily Weisbord", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Merrily_Weisbord?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2766141, "name": "The Love Queen of Malabar", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Love_Queen_of_Malabar?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2766142, "name": "Lifewritings", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lifewritings?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 1655493, "title": "Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism by Barie Fez-Barringten", "created_at": "2009-03-19T01:17:36.987-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1655493/Culture_of_Cosmopolitan_Urbanism_by_Barie_Fez_Barringten?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_1655493", "summary": "\u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d\nMy Urban Legacy 15,482 words on 46 pages\nby Barie Fez-Barringten \nwww.bariefez-barringten.com\nIntroduction\n\nThesis and premises:\nHow many of you ever thought about urbanism (populate) as a culture (condition) or that urbanism could be cosmopolitan (universal)?\nThe title of these lectures is the \u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d because it aptly describes who we are and what we face. The sooner we understand our culture and its peculiar characteristics the sooner we can manage our lives and improve our living conditions. Increases in population and density culture our personal, family and business lives. We are cosmopolitan and urban as we agree, disagree, peruse common goals, tolerate stress and congestion, discern between community and privacy and distribute precious resources. For example, an urbanized person negotiates traffic, crowds, street signs, home mail delivery, and crowded places of public gatherings, ambulating, few stars due to bright skies, pollution, live entertainment, public transportation, and close proximity to neighbors. \nThe culture of cosmopolitan urbanism is both about those affected by population\u2019s dynamics and the way they are able to utilize these affects to facilitate further population growth. Like any culture it can be inherited and once experienced, it can be conveyed and inherited by others. It is the responsibility of persons that have been cultured by urbanism to convey that experience to others to preserve the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism.\n \nHow many have ever thought of themselves as being affected by their environment and that an urban background can affect the way you think and behave? \nCulture is the development of the intellect through training or education and the totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns including arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought. Dense population, crowds and opportunities breed specific kinds of social behavior and unique metaphors, which affect individual persons, families and institutions. These in tern conversely contribute to develop the social, cultural and built environment. It is a conversation between an increasing collective as they add and reject persons and institutions and the environment they form to support their individual and collective interests enabling us to mature, authenticate and develop our identity. We are one with our surroundings and expect them to perform. \n \nIn our time, we wonder what can be done to make the urbs feasible, livable, and desirable, what are the problems, and how can they be mitigated? \nSometime the problem looms before us. \n \nWhat can we do to make the urb everyone\u2019s identity, metaphor and home? \nI believe if we fit the city to the metaphors of the population and its diversity then more people will care and when more care, the city will greatly improve. After all, form should follow function, and the population will only care if the city is their metaphor. \n \nSo, who will do this and what can we do to foster urban quality?\nIs there one size fits all or are we already doing what\u2019s right by acclimating and adjusting to the variables of our demographics, geography, climate, and socio-political necessities?\n \nI believe when the A.I.A. asks, \u201cWhat can be done to make cities livable\u201d that the A.I.A. is taking responsibility for what they and others have neglected for several generations. I would put the question \u201cwhat can be done to make cities livable and worthy to be called home\u201d. \nThe Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d wants \u201clivability\u201d to be home.\n \nBut we don\u2019t always perceive our surroundings as home. Some would agree and others disagree that American rural, suburban and urban cities find themselves needing to mitigate the bad choices, carelessness and narrow vision of their past. Since I gave my fist lecture on metaphors and architecture at Yale University and established the Laboratories for Metaphoric Environments in New York City in 1970, I have watched as the rift widened between architects and planners and therefore cities further deteriorated. \nCan you identify any thing you do as having a particularly urban identity?\n\nThankfully, there are a few that simply love cities the way they are and accept the city with all there pros and cons, as a matter of fact the more the apparent contradictions, complexities and anomalies the better. \nIn these people are the seeds of hope but they are not usually the ones who take responsibility for shaping public policy, planning and design. \n \nHowever, without pride, a personal sense of ownership and overwhelming moral and ethical mind I have found that states and cities become corrupt, permissive and pedantic frustrating those that love and invest their identity in the city\u2019s metaphor and who believe their identity is authenticated and synonymous with the identity of the city and will accept most of any of its conditions. \n \nWhat is the one thing that we all want in our home?\nHowever romantic and interesting are war zones and circuses, man\u2019s interests cannot be nurtured and developed in such areas. We all agree that law and order by civilized behavior is desired and necessary. On the other hand, life is more than the maintaining law of order. \n \nFrom the farmhouse in Iowa to the penthouse in Manhattan, we all call our country, state, city, neighborhood, and community and house our home. It is the repository of all our metaphors, hopes and dreams. It is very precious, valuable and worthy of our attention despite the many who merely make a business and career out of profiting and policing agreements by consensus. \n \nI have learned that without passionate and urban educated professionals the choices presented is less often the better of two evils. And neither one of them engenders civic pride and ownership. In Florida, the problem is how to shift the pride away from a snowbirds city of origin to a persons\u2019 Florida home. For those in Florida where Florida is their home state, the problem is restoring and building their pride and interest in a quality city. As without a vision, a nation perishes so without a personal identity and affiliation of one\u2019s home we lose our initiative, creativity and authenticity. Already the implications have manifest themselves in avoidances and overwhelming acceptance of banality and boredom. Since form follows function, we all know we work harder for less and with limited choices. Our new gained affluence has provided us ways of maneuvering around in a very prescriptive and formulary life style. I believe, the more we have a point of view about this culture of cosmopolitan urbanism the more we can improve the way we live. \n\nSo, who\u2019s to blame?\nDespite the warnings, I find few that really care for the future and generations that will follow, I have seen many who believe that planning is really un-American, and look to destroy our past with little care for the future. Therefore, I believe it is the job of our institutions to educate and be the custodians of the urban metaphors, which will help us, choose and manage urban contexts. For years, learned journals have published my monographs on this subject and still universities and governments do not have a way of knowing the metaphors of their constituents save the markets of commercial developers and the public\u2019s reactions to infringements on their privacy. \n \nWhat can the individual do?\nI know that most are not in a position to choose large, medium or small urban contexts but rather to choose between rural and urban where these days\u2019 most non-agricultural families choose sub-urban or urban clusters. On the other hand, if one chooses an urban context we may find ourselves managing its renovation, expansion or reaping its benefits and failures. Weather and climate aside, I believe an urban person\u2019s first responsibility begins in choosing a city where he can find agreement and observe the qualities contributing to a better way of living. However, I observe that our society has come to rely on remedies and cures for everything hoping anything can be mitigated. \n \nDoes the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism make a difference?\nTake the extreme example of how New Orleanians persists in settling in below flood elevation areas as do homesteaders insist upon building in coastal flood areas. Such strong and determined will overcomes many natural obstacles and I have observed that in urban settings such people are a force for the right decisions. We can see the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism at work in the will that strives to overcome the inertia of the physical. The urban person strives to maintain the status quo. \n \nWhat is one of the ideals in any urban environment?\nAside from options and choices, our culture intuitively recognizes minimum standards that whatever the size, urban context is best balanced by a rural and undeveloped surround, which is often farming, mountains, forest, wetlands, or waterways. \n\nI believe it wrong when these lands are sub-urbanized reducing escape options and quality of life. It makes this new area subordinate to the urb and without its own identity. In this frustration and without a national policy I observe people continue to migrate to places where these choices are possible. I believe New Orleanians, as most urban places will be faced with arresting and reversing this very basic practice. As they do, urban densities will naturally increase and our culture will evolve a cosmopolitan set of values. \nWhat is the one word that means populating our surrounding land? \n \nAnd how does sprawl it affect us?\nSprawl dilutes personal identity\nWe already know that the sprawl of the city\u2019s structure and population damages urban lifestyle by adding time and expense to travel from the urb. For others, the only financially feasible option is the suburb because reasonable options are not locally available. So they surrender their urban for the sub-urban rather than downsize to a smaller urban. Such decisions are economically driven as mobile Americans find new employment, recreation, and business opportunities. I believe this is a disaster and while I am not in favor of birth control as a means of solving overpopulation, I am a believer in providing populations with quality urban contexts. \n \nThe problem has many vectors but because of population growth, immigration and migration urban mangers choose between permitting growth by new development on already platted urban and suburban land to accommodate that growth to consume undeveloped land. \n231\nWho are the parties that can correct the problem?\nIt is citizens, educators and elected officials who are both interested in our context that understand urbanism who make better choices. In the late eighties construction permitting came to a screeching halt when Lee county introduced concurrency legislation which required all developers to first develop supporting and affected infrastructure prior to adding faculties which would burden the existing areas. The results did not slow or curtail growth because developers were able to meet the requirements and pass the costs onto potential buyers. \n Has any one ever heard of concurrency legislation?\n\nBut concurrency only highlights how urban sprawl adds infrastructure instead of using existing. It also shows how, even with this condition many developers still prefer to exercise their business in rural counties than to build in urban centers. The important exceptions are New York City, Singapore, and Shanghai, which expedited developers in the building process. All of these cities were desperate to recover their lost income and contributing populations. While their decisions tapped into the existing city skyscraper and dense population, metaphors it brought people back into the city and away from the suburbs. \n\nMany of our \u201curbs\u201d that have sprawled now try to prevent growth by local town fathers following many European models, which keep the distance from the urb to the rural to a minimum. It is called \u201cno growth\u201d.\n \nI believe that this alone can stop sprawl and increase the quality of urban life. Many communities in New England practice this while others have lat the sprawl ooze out to connect many cities and form metropolitan areas; as a result, the urban clusters have deteriorated. \n217\nWhat is it that prevents leaders to change?\nWe do not convey our culture of cosmopolitan urbanism. \nHighly mobile and transient communities have lost their ability to manage urban cities, buildings, and neighborhoods within metropolitan urban areas so that no one values their social, iconic and economic contribution to the balance and opportunity that citizens needs to thrive and grow. All because we do not have a vision and will for our urbs and continue to allow our lands to be absorbed by aggressive private real estate interest. I am all in favor of real estate as a business as I my self was once a Texas real estate brokers. But in our highly transient society, it is up to individuals and their institutions to be the surrogate and agent for society\u2019s social ethos. Functional neighborhoods can be either victim or hero to combat the social and economic deterioration that contributes to the use of illegal drugs, crime, family separations and a much lower quality of life. \n\n\n\n\nExisting urban cities, buildings, and neighborhoods within metropolitan urban areas should be valued for there social, iconic and economic contribution to the balance and opportunity citizens needs to thrive and grow, all because we do not have a vision and will for our urbs and continue to allow our lands to be absorbed by aggressive private real estate interest. \n \nWhat are some of the pros and cons to increasing density?\nUrban sociology\nIn the urbs the social benefit to all income and socio-economic levels occurs when necessities dictates increasing densities and adding new buildings and communities. This benefits existing populations in poorer neighborhoods because it allow for entry-level citizens to make their neighborhoods relevant and personally metaphoric. As older occupants relocate to newer dwellings, others move and renovate. \nOften the neighborhoods become a mixture of people on differing socio-economic scales and diverse cultures. \n \nIt could even result in vest-pocket zone variances allowing for non-residential use where mixing both uses and economic social status often produces the best of both worlds for all citizens. But such a combination means mixing metaphors and aesthetics as well, which demands understanding the urban context. It is here where community verses privacy issues are identified, negotiated and sometimes reconciled. When they are not, the results are often disputes that result in violence and chaos as differing interest and tastes vie for their turf. \nIn 1967, to research for my thesis Precinct Police Station to earn my masters of architecture at Yale the patrol car I was in drove into an urban block in Brooklyn to face a heated gun battle with shots being fired from several buildings on either side of the street. While both officers left the vehicle they put the microphone in my hand and told me to lay on the floor in the back and tell headquarters what was happening, this was a dramatic repeat of the squabbles I experienced growing up in tenements in the Bronx. \n \nLater the officers told me that this was a daily occurrence and that it was caused by these neighbors inability to reconcile their claim to the neighborhood and their difference in life style and culture. \n\nI learned that to avoid such gun battles the metaphor of the urban city must be brought to the consumer to affect the way residents choose and influence public policy. They must either own, believe they own and be treated with the dignity and respect of a righteous citizen. \nFor new cities, and in light of the dependence on foreign oil in dangerous places, our dependence on foreign oil would be greatly reduced by simply accommodating population increases in urban rather than sub-urban settings because urban contexts can be made economic and metaphorically attractive. \nI believe an economic urban design is the antidote to sprawl, expensive highways, power generation, grids, bridges, automobiles and fuel. I believe that one of the reasons the Europeans are not very sympathetic to the plight of American cities is because Europeans have practiced conservation while observing Americans squander its land, productivity, and natural resources. \n \nWhat is being done now improve the urban experience?\nRecently I have observed an increasing number of responsible institutions initiating programs that encourage spatial beauty, complexity, contradictions, vulgarity, opportunity, and mixed uses and formed such initiatives as \u201cNew Urbanism\u201d, \u201cSmart Growth\u201d, \u201cBlueprint for America\u201d, \u201cPrinciples of Intelligent Urbanism (PIU) and in New York City in 1970 we formed the Laboratories for Metaphoric Environments. \n \nAmerica is as much a place as it is an idea and our cities are one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse demographic populations, which insist cities, is workable, fun and beautiful. Cities are often both recreational and exciting to even announce something like \u201cNew York is a Summer Festival\u201d! In America when a city or place in city does not work, it is abandoned and destroyed and the American culture moves on to create a better place.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCan we decide between right and wrong, provide options and still manage our environment?\nHope and Vision \nIt is for this reason I am optimistic and writing and lecturing on urbanism because I believe we can have the will if only we had the vision, and it is up to persons like myself to present this vision, a vision based on empirical models and workable ideals. I believe it is up to design professional\u2019s not disinterested bureaucrats, lawyers and accountants to create works of art, metaphors, and lifetime contexts while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the general public. Right now communities have grown up with the benefit of the talent and committed professional s needed to create livable cities. \nHowever nice is Tamiami Trail, it will never match the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and why shouldn\u2019t it? \nAmerican architects have come to accept the \u201cstrip\u201d as a given in modern cities. \n \nWhat are the creative opportunities to foster a culture of cosmopolitan urbanism? \nRecently non-rural city-constituents insist on a government, which has an urban mind, and culture, with people who are passionately urban and have a cosmopolitan point of view. A point of view unencumbered with provincialism but filled with compassion, education, and professionalism. \nThe mass media and Internet condition populations to the extent that they are emerging to desire the things that only an urb can provide. \n \nHowever while there are many commonalties between one and another urb there are also remarkable differences. Obviously, since not all cities can be the same, makers of the urban metaphor makes the strange familiar and likens one urban-type in terms of another. \n \nThe urban creators must be more than a technical architect or planner but a profession that includes the commonalities and differences on many levels of issues and complexities; it needs a \u201cculture of cosmopolitan urbanism\u201d. \n \n\n\n\nIt is both a science and an art!\nSuch a culture knows the history of urbanism that deals with the increases in population and understands the urban mindset, providing intelligent choices so that citizens may choose and manage urban contexts in representative governments, their elected officials, bureaucrats and professional consultants. \n \nCommunities must ask whether their town-fathers, government leaders, elected officials, systems of government and laws are suitable for creating ideal cities, or, is it best left to the private sector which historically have been dictators, czars, pharaohs, feudal lords, and passionate industrialist who created most of the beautiful cities in the world by power and single-minded initiative. \nThey also created the most despotic unhealthy and unsafe cites the world has ever known. Few, if any city, when first began have a good beginning. \nIt is good that today, modern governments involve citizens to monitor decisions so that there can there be a city with the driving force of a people and their representative government, businessmen, corporations with a confluence of great and influential leaders. They debate whether to urbanize or not, to ruralize or not, to sub-urbanize or not, which is more appropriate and when, to extend or to renovate the existing, to build vertically rather than horizontally. \n \nWhat should be the mix of rental verses owned properties and should these be built in higher or low density? \nOften, the unspoken is about people\u2019s life-style metaphors and the diversity of populations, vocations, and backgrounds. \n \nSome ask about the very rich, while others debate the pros and cons to encourage, discourage, control or limit growth, zone or not to zone and plan or not to plan, other communities argue in favor of leaving such developments totally to chance and without anyone\u2019s intervention, for example, Houston does not have zoning. These are all valid debates and contribute to the increase of quality in the built environment, which is best for the majority of the affected population. \n \n \n \n\nSo, why aren\u2019t the leaders doing their job?\nFirst of all, we are not conveying the culture of urbanism to them, by its very nature culture lives when it is received and conveyed. \nAside from the checks and balances afforded by our democratic form of government, two party system and cultural diversity the plight of Southwest Florida is exacerbated by demeaning the primary professional whose education and calling it is to create and develop the built environment. Instead, the authority rests with planners who focus on infrastructure, politicians who focus on politics, and developers who are interested in profits, while one of the solutions would be a school of architecture, which educates and advocates. Yet another dilemma looms and that is a culture of pragmatism and precedence law, even with a version of statute of limitations it still is used to win variances to change approved plans. Everybody knows we are what we eat as we benefit when we choose the right foods we must build the right environments, both affect our being. \n \nWhat are the two different ways urbanism occurs?\nTo reify and convert the abstract concept of urbanism into a reality and identify some of the choices I have divided these two lectures on urbanism into two, one and a half hour (1 \u00bd) plus 1/2 hour of questions and discussions to include Natural and evolving and corporately created, synthetic and mass- produced urban forms. \n \nNatural cities include such cities as New York, Paris, Charleston, Leipzig, Florence, Madrid, Rome, Johannesburg, St, Petersburg, and hundreds of others. Cities which foster builders, general contractors and individual business to design and custom build on a small scale where individuals invest in apartment buildings, rental or condominium ownership. \n \nThis form of living is the metaphor of natural cities and their culture of cosmopolitan urbanism because people in natural cities gather together to: \n1. Extract and manufacture products form natural resources\n2. Exchange goods and services, \n3. Attack others to acquire resources\n4. Defend themselves from attack by a common enemy\n5. Enjoy entertainment, recreation, and quality of life, \n6. Farm and fish,\n7. Import and export goods and services.\n8. Pursue careers and work \nOn the other hand, synthetic city-types and clusters are corporately created and include New Towns, Planned Unit Developments, Commercial and Industrial Developments such as English Mountain, Sugar Tree, Al-Khobar, Reston, and industrial cities in China and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran, Abquiq, Jubail and Yanbu). Where land is developed, buildings designed and systematically mass-produced, manufactured on site or in factories as products according to pre-designed stock plans and specifications by large real estate development corporations. \n \nCan we plan for urbanization?\nPlanning for urbanization\nOrganic new town or the garden city is a type of planned urbanization based on an advance plan of the type prepared for military, aesthetic, economic or urban design reasons. Planned urbanization on a mega scale is the construction of new towns by the Housing Development Board of Singapore.\n \nUnplanned (organic) cities are the oldest form of urbanization. Examples can be seen in many ancient cities; although with exploration came the collision of nations, which meant that many invaded, cities took on the desired planned characteristics of their occupiers. \nMany ancient organic cities experienced redevelopment for military and economic purposes, new roads carved through the cities, and new parcels of land were cordoned off serving various planned purposes giving cities distinctive geometries. I believe that either can be workable depending on the scale and quality of the government and the professionals managing the urbanization process, of course, without a good board of directors setting good policy the mangers usually falter. \nI have an original study of the city of Baghdad which aptly describes the way the city was built by attaching one dwelling after another to each to form a gigantic honeycomb cluster. The west and the east both have different ways of forming their urbs. \n \n \n \n\n99\nUN agencies prefer to see an urban infrastructure installed before urbanization occurs. I recall studying a village in Peru where my best friends served in the Pease Corps, after a community effort planning a community the built the sewer, water and electric systems as well as the roads. They also started a system of making local building materials to build and trained laborers. Landscape planners are responsible for landscape infrastructure (public parks, sustainable urban drainage systems and greenways) which can be planned before urbanization takes place, or afterward to revitalize an area and create greater livability within a region.\n \nMy curiosity about \u201cwhy my environment is the way it is\u201d gave birth to a passion for urbanity, cities, architecture, and design long before I even knew my own identity. \nWhen I was a little boy, that curiosity was coupled with my building covered shelters out of a combination of blankets and wooden orange crates in our Hunts Point two-family house. \n \nI therefore became the student and creator of the very places, which I was later to call my world, and when I became a member of the American Institute of Architects, I also became an authority on urbanism.\nAs a young person, I did reconnaissance to find out where I was in this world and to make everything recognizable, familiar and gain control of my opportunities. \n \nFor me the city was a metaphor for my identity and I authenticated my self by these explorations and constructions. \nIn much, the same way as did primitive man builds his first shelter and soon combined them together to form villages and agreements to develop them into civilized societies. Early Baghdad, and our New England towns and villages are examples where populations settled because of natural resources, waterways ands trade crossings. \n \nHaving said all of this about urbanity, I have always been metaphorically romantic about rural and small town life. I even enjoyed living in two venues for the twenty years we lived and worked in Saudi Arabia. So I am familiar with the plight of the so-called \u201csnowbird\u201d. \n\nMy cosmopolitan involvement with urbanity is personal and peculiar to me. I am not trying to teach anyone here the basics of city planning but rather to encourage a love and passion for the built and created man- made environment and to hopefully provide a roadmap so that citizens may choose and manage urban contexts, we are in need of a culture of cosmopolitan urbanism. \n \nIn brief, to share the passion, I found myself involved in one of those basics that affect everyone but few give much thought, the culture of cities and urbanism. Armed with this passion it is possible for citizens to choose and manage urban contexts. Yes, the key is education. \nMuch the way we are managing our health care I believe we must also learn to manage our contexts. I believe my mission in this CLL program is to impart that passion, the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism.\n732 words\nWhat is the difference between cities and urban areas how is this distinction helpful to mange the control of cities?\nWhile urban is about city dwellers and being civilized to do so Urban is also the very \"characteristic of city life\u201d while urbane became restricted to manners and styles of expression. Urban renewal, euphemistic for \"slum clearance\u201d, is recorded from 1955. While a city is the result of the accord, agreements of citizens it may remain unurbanized. A part of cites may be urbanized while others remain undeveloped. There are many cites which have whole districts that remain under the control of one city or county municipality who choose to urbanize that land, for example, Fort Myers\u2019 relationship to Lee County. Also, some say they visit a city and do not get the sense that they are in an urban environment. The form of civilization may be different from theirs. As an example, my houseboy from Thailand chastised the Saudi Arabia custom of closing shops for prayers as in Thailand commercial time is so precious that most stores time shares a particular location to earn a living, when one proprietor leaves another sets up to sell his goods. \n \nThere are cities, which have a complete infrastructure but are not urban because its institutions, public facilities and limitations on public movement are limited and restricted. Before the iron curtain fell many cites under the Soviet Union were such cities, certain cites in Saudi Arabia are other such examples, they are apparently \u201cdead\u201d cities. \nIn this way urban is the life within the city while the city is the place and the urban is life or the structure, and things within the city.\nThe city is the agreements of accord and \u201crightness\u201d of the place and all those within are \u201cright\u201d while the urbs are what they build to supply their needs and necessities. For example with public funds, they may build highways, roads, rail and bus to encourage private developers to build places for commerce, industry and habitation. They also build sidewalks, parks and playgrounds for children. \n\nHow does an urban culture shape a city?\nTypically, culture is inherited and passed on from one to another generation to authenticate and both the new and last generation while enriching each person and the collective society. \n \nUrban culture is the culture of cities. Cities all over the world, past and present, have behaviors and cultural elements that separate them from otherwise comparable rural areas. Urban culture is any of the behavioral patterns of the various types of cities and urban areas, both past and present. \"Culture is the learned set of beliefs, values, norms and material goods shared by group members... Culture consists of everything we learn in groups during the life course-from infancy to old age.\u201d In terms of the behavioral psychologist and urban sociologist, it is the result of a person being conditioned by their surrounding context and its multiple specific experiences with the facilities in the context. Cities such as New Orleans, Galveston, Los Angeles, Butte, and Detroit come to mind. The epistemology of urbanism explains knowledge how do we know something is urban and not just a city and is they\u2019re any absolutes about what distinguishes a good from bad city. Scores of philosophers and urban scholars have tried to sort through these issues while civilizations settle and develop homesteads and build villages. \nI began my formal journey under the greatest epistemologist of our time, now deceased after 91 years, my friend and mentor, Dr. Paul Weiss. \nLike me, Dr. Weiss, a distinguished professor at Yale and then Catholic University, was born and raised in New York and he spoke with a distinct accent. I set out to prove that, as art was a metaphor so was architecture and therefore architecture was an art because it too makes metaphors. \n \nTo do this I had to first find an absolute definition of \u201cmetaphor\u201d and then demonstrate how elements of architecture performed this way. \nAfter years of research and many published monographs, I concluded that even culture is a metaphor. It is what people value and use to authenticate sustain and identify them. Their culture and the context of their culture are their \u201cbridge \u201c, address, and home root. It is their highpoint in a crowded world, which acts as beacon to guide them home and be their terminal to any journey. \n \nWhat kind of urban people make a difference?\nUrban people are enamored with the \u201ccity\u201d and although they disagree about many things, they do think about it but in their own empirical way. They can be introverted, petty, sophisticated or vulgar and share a vision of cooperating in a common vocabulary reaching for the sky and demonstrating their ability to be powerful and \u201cgod-like\u201d. Heroism in a heroic city is an expectation amongst its inhabitants. \nUrbanites welcome heroes where many great cities have urbanized under the horsepower of its home- grown heroes. Urbanites are the center of one place and \u201cevery-where \u2013else\u201d uses them as a model. \nThey, the city and the collective persons with the urban fabric are, not only right, but also possess a power of place and collective wisdom and resources. They seem to have a super-natural authority and collective self-righteousness. They know and can decide about the trends, fashion, arts, finance, products and consumer\u2019s needs and desires. These tycoons and entrepreneurs include Trumps, Vanderbilt, Morgan, Drake, Gates, Rockefellers, Astor\u2019s, Waldorf, Howard Hughes (Las Vegas), Henry Ford, Carnegie, Whitney, Ford, Mellon (Pittsburgh), and the Arabian Gulf King, Emirs and sheiks are some such people. \n\nIn fact, none of the above may bear it out, but the allusion to being god-like (trend setters) permeates and fans the flame of the fantasy. The urbanite envisions the world with them at its center, emanating rays of light, products, words, songs, sounds, ideas, force, design, engineering, science, technology, religion, medical cures, and healing. \nFor example, in 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan and the members of the Vanderbilt family. These people received and conveyed the culture of cosmopolitan culture.\n \n \n\n\n \n192\nIn cities like New York, Paris, Rome, Mumbai, Beijing, Los Angeles and then a year or even later things spring up in other smaller and secondary markets. \nCommerce plays an important part in giving a city its identity and vitality. It\u2019s not all about profit but more the opportunity to peruse dreams, careers, family and relationships. It is the seed of a universal view and globalization. Most cities start with commerce exploiting resources and geographical assets before being a magnet to large populations. One can control unwanted influx of populations by curtailing employment.\n\nAs citizens, we can choose to live in such a city made by others or ourselves be part of the driving force. Often this translates into electing officials who will carry out this job. In other cases, it is simply voting on legislation, which allows private developers to do this job in the private sector. For these very factors, many have abided in cities while others have deserted cities for want of calmer and more benign context. Some cities prosper under a strong and guiding mayor while other cities simply grow with a mayor who encourages others to lead. \n103\nDo urban persons affect the quality of the built environment?\nThe urban person is a believer in the world and its potential to keep and hold mankind. Art flourishes in the urban environment because it is where creative like- minded artisans and craftsman are born, raised and hone their craft on the challenges and demands of the market. \nAs Renaissance-kings and Queens hired and fostered artisans, so do the cities and urban populations provide fertile ground for invention, innovation, design, thought and ideas. Along with artisans, there are poets and writers who provide a libretto and describe the scenario of the urban context. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat do urban minded persons build?\nPedestrian appurtenances such as sidewalks, plazas, walkways, ambulatories, parks and playgrounds, street furniture, covered bus stops, train and airplane terminals, lookouts, and monuments are but some of the distinctive of both the natural and the synthetic urban city, whereas rural and sub-urban developments are predominantly accessed by horse and buggies or automobiles while, the pedestrian ways have much less of a priority and few people ever use these. Authors and planners such as Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch and Louis Munford wrote extensively about these urban features. It seems our quest is to bring rural pedestrian\u2019s freedom into the city. \n \nSpace is another way of forming and perceiving cities where some cities are built as architectonic voids and solids, and others a series of free standing three dimensions solids perceived from the exteriors as shapes and forms as sculpture. \n \nMost of the cities in Europe and the mid east and big cities such as New York, Paris, Cambridge, Barcelona, Florence, Rome, Venice, and Chicago are cities of a series and hierarchy of enclosed and bounded spaces. Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Houston, Dallas, and Seattle are the largest examples of such of the sculptural cities. \n \nWhat does overpopulation mean and how is this mitigated? \nThe very idea of over population is a man made invention and its opposite in under population. It is only over when economists believe human, physical and financial resources cannot sustain a stable government. This is measured by a proportion of resources to the population and physically measured in scale. When a government is under populated, it usually means it has less people than it needs to meets its budget and maintains its programs. \n \nScale of cities can either attract or deter but in any case it is the scale of city\u2019s utilities, support services, energy supply, vertical and horizontal transportation, commerce, industry, institutions, communications, and residential variety that motivates societies to urbanize in as dense and compact way as possible. \n \n \nScale is a proportion of one thing in relation ship to another and the larger and more dense the city the greater is the proportion of all facilities city per person where each person has access to the greatest number, sizes and quality of resources. Even the poorest is \u201ccity-rich\u201d.\n \nWhat are the advantages of higher densities?\nOn the other hand, the more the density the more people share in the collective facilities and the more efficient is each support facility. \nFor example, high-rises increase the numbers of people using one square foot of land, one foot or road, pipe, sewer line, power plant, elevator, train, or bus. The efficiencies translate into lower taxes and potentially higher standard of living if standards are based on access to the city\u2019s amenities made possible and necessitated by scale such as hospitals, museums, parks, schools, universities, commerce, entertainment, rail and air transport and banking. It is on the matter of scale that Renaissance cities were designed and Mediterranean villages built. For example, my grandparents city of Rhodes, the city of Dubrovnik and the many shopping malls which have been designed to make the shopper at home. \nThe other side of scale is its disproportionate relationship to the single human individual. And, this is what characterizes the urban from the rural where the urban is naturally more general, cosmopolitan, individualistic, and not co-dependent having lived with so many to not be familiar with all but adjusted to being a stranger amongst many strangers, not familiar but a learned friendliness as civil to make the enormous scale work. \nUrbanites are at peace with not knowing their neighbor as not knowing the workings, contents and interests of the whole city. Accustomed to being a cog a great wheel minds their own business while politicians and government officials keep the city going. Just get on a crowded elevator in a New York City skyscraper and try saying hello.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n618\nWhat are the basic components of the urbs?\nArchitect\u2019s Urbs\nFrom an architectural point of view urban consists of structure, infrastructure, government, laws, agreements, ordinances, civilized society and civil behavior, consensus and concessions for public and private use, resources, and the provision of basic services, air, water, light, concerns for health and health services, tradesman and the ability to import and export as well as trade and exchange. \nUrban allow persons to ambulate and move about without infringing on the privacy, sanctity and sovereignty of persons, families and business interest. \nUrbs also harbor institutions created from the concerns for collective and ongoing remedies, and the development of the culture\u2019s ideals in education, science, and art, as well as government, justice and communications. \nAn institution in any city is an organization, establishment, foundation, society, or the like, devoted to the promotion of a particular cause or program, esp. one of a public, educational, or charitable character. While they have the form of a corporation, they are, importantly, not-for \u2013profit and their board is a cross section of the peers of that institution. \nUrban centers often have institutions, which not only serve their own nation, but other cities and causes throughout the world. They are the early-globalized models for the globalization of the world. \nOn the other hand, they are subject and scrutinized by the context in which they operate. \nIt is conditioned by its history, settlement patterns, heroes, battles and treatise, and because all of real (royal) estate is never really owned but for beneficial use taken by hostile actions. Urbs are limited and bound by agreements by adjacent and continuous domains and their resultant configurations are a result of negotiations or victories. \nJust look at maps and you will see that there are many states with jagged and messy boundaries while others are absolutely straight and angular. The later are those created by mandate of law while the former evolved and settled naturally. Even the way we buy and sell real estate today is by offer and acceptance to rights and privileges. \n\n \n\nWhat are the impacts of the government on urbanity?\nIn a democracy, urban is a city that function, works and changes by the will and effort of its collective inhabitants, as example the way in which the cities of Naples, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs and Cape Coral have incorporated their communal interest. It is inherently communal, social to tolerate, adjust and accommodate both the private and collective rights of its citizens. The citizens of an urban city know their place and how it works .In what ever form of government the city is quite self-sufficient and run by individual, business, corporate and governmental self interest perusing their self interest and exchanging goods and services. The best urban city is disproportionably self-run with the least government intervention. It is a kind of benevolent anarchy. \n \nHong Kong is a prime example of a centrally ruled government leaving its hands off the working of its urban city, Jeddah and other Arab, Indian, and Pakistani cities do likewise. \nFor an architect, as it was in Egypt, Greece and Rome the goal is to design and build a city which is the sum and substance of its citizens where constituents can achieve their hopes and dreams for both today and into the future. \nTo achieve these goals the architect must know not only the culture of the people but the systems and resources to limit and bound the spaces, programs and resources they will utilize. In urban cities, these include many cultures combined into one and multiple systems of transportation, communication and education. \nThe urban architect is a responsible, concerned professional doing serious and important work for the community he serves. \n119\nUrbanites use facilities as elevators, building lobbies, sidewalks, busses, trains, stores and shops, parks, and schools to culture, develop and mature. Urbanites are consumed and influenced by their environment the mass transit, massive buildings and vast complex of institutions.\n\nModern cities are a matrix of vehicle and people conveyance of goods and services, utility lines, sewage, water, electrify, and emergency vehicle access. Cities are a complex machine inhabited by people defying the proverb that form follows function. \n\n\n\nIt is more that people adopting to form while interior design mitigates the difference by adapting the form to fit the person. Education, Careers, Commerce, and Entertainment also mitigate the scale and visuals that mask the technology and scale of the city\u2019s structure.\n \nWhat is the crisis of urbanism in our culture?\n66\nThe culture of cosmopolitan urbanism is not being conveyed nor inherited from one to another generation. What was a legacy of from past generations coming from Europe or developing from within the USA is not being conveyed. In some societies the value of the urban experience is being eclipsed by other social structures. In other societies it is being exacerbated by mismanagement and rapid population growth. \n \nHistory of Urbanism\nUrbanism is a social, political, environmental, economic and geopolitical study affecting public policy, commerce and industry so that more colleges and universities are offering degrees in this important area of study and because of that I am pleased that many of Florida\u2019s county planning staff is increasing qualified. However, without a college of architecture in South West Florida their well-intended efforts are often over looked by the courts. A local college of architecture would be politically and socially entrenched in the context and more persuasive. \n \nJudges might think twice before overturning county staff\u2019s recommendations if the staff were indigenous and educated in the venue of the court. Such a school would also educate and influence public policy affecting town fathers and developers. \nWith such a school, the developers might even be the architects and local planners. And judges may even be former students and architects. \nEveryone but the real estate development industry and the farmer who may want to sell his land believe that urbanizing on undeveloped land is profitable. To both it is profitable but eventually it is profit at the expense of others. \n \n \n \n \n\nWhat is pragmatic side of urbanism?\nOn the other hand, taxpayers, consumers and hard-pressed governments know that existing cities and urban centers make it expensive, unwieldy and un-profitable to practice real estate development as developers can do on undeveloped land. \n \nAs a result in the forties residents seeking more square footage, and better quality living space at a lower cost in big cities across America relocated to subdivisions in what became known as the city\u2019s suburbs. In this way, federal and state policies governing agricultural property influences sub-urban sprawl. On the other hand, inner city urbanites left because of price and quality, developers, counties and manufactures found it profitable, and the start of a national industry. Highways got built, with low cost oil, oil companies built more refineries, automobile manufactures convinced every one to have a romance with his vehicle, mortgages and credit companies proliferated, and the corporations eclipsed many small businesses. On the other hand, there are millions of people now moving into urbs and even more that refuse to leave and endure some of hardships because they prefer the advantages. \n209\nDale Johnson in \u201cLost in the Suburb\u2019s described a cultural and political gap that occurred in New Jersey and Ontario in the early 1990s when suburban voters began to outnumber urban or rural voters, and began to perceive that they were paying taxes to provide urban areas with services that were not duplicated in their community. Meanwhile, suburban communities would export problems to the cities, typically in the form of drug addicts, homelessness, smog, prostitution and other crimes serving suburban residents, and the need to accommodate a large number of commuters and their sewage and parking requirements. \n \nAs downtown residents and suburban voters became estranged, each perceived themselves subsidizing the other, and accordingly a common solution, called in both New Jersey and Ontario the Common Sense Revolution, transferred funds from urban needs to suburban sprawl, triggering a decline in urban quality of life in both places, as population further spread out and downtowns became more hostile to suburban visitors, the city of Johannesburg in South Africa is such an example.\n\n \nTo reverse this trend major cites have provided developers and builders with tax incentives, free land on deteriorated and abandoned property, expedited zoning and permitting, financing instruments and special mortgages, and the means to market the units before construction.\n526\nIn other communities, cities, and towns have adopted no-growth policies and prohibited such development; either urban or other wise to occur while others have openly embraced the onslaught of developers to their undeveloped land. While I am in favor of representative government, I believe that without a steady stream of voices from continuants that urban blight is inevitable. We don\u2019t much discuss urban blight in Southwest Florida but it is the bane of every densely populated municipality particularly caused by disenfranchised residents who lack a culture of cosmopolitan urbanism. \n\nHowever, much of Florida is suffering under a good policy called \u201csmart growth\u201d which after all its town hall meetings municipal development plans encounter the courts which continue to permit the absorption of wetland, watershed and fragile eco-systems, not to mention the increased demand to build more power plants, roads, and water supply. It seems that precedence law, free enterprise and rights of corporations often prevail. \n\nOver recent years, not a few private groups, universities, professional associations have come out against these practices including my very own American Institute of Architects, while even more are still finding ways to rationalize and convince the federal, state and local governments that further development of raw land is good. All of this while thousand of cites, towns and suburbs are deteriorating and failing economically, socially and ecologically. I believe America is squandering its wealth. \n\nBecause urbanism is apparently hemorrhaging, coalitions are having an impact and public officials as they exert pressure to manage population growth, housing demands, immigration, transportation and affordability.\n\n\n\nStill the quality of the built environment is increasingly finding its ways to smaller elite who are over worked, over taxed and compelled to meet the cost of maintaining the metaphor of the cost of quality living units in existing urban centers, suburbs and emerging new towns and PUD (planned unit developments). \n\nLarge developers have adopted the means and ways of large corporations focusing on profits by standardizing plans, policies, procedures and franchise and subsidiary operations. \nThey are increasingly staffed with graduates of business management schools concerned with efficient ways of achieving customer satisfaction while maximizing profits. \nThey do all of this while the middle class is compelled to have at least two sources of income to pay for two cars, mortgage and high taxes to pay for highways, power grids, utilities and water and support the overhead of these large corporate developers. The voices of the small architectural practice, craftsman and builder are made obsolete and unfeasible. More of them turn to the large corporation while town fathers yield to the lure of cash flow into their communities. Even in cities without zoning regulations, the results of litigation often grant variances to the Comprehensive Development Plans and favorable zoning. What seemed like a more affordable solution has now become even more costly in taxes, transportation, schooling, and the house itself. \nThe question is would everyone live in high quality affordable and cost-effective big urban centers? Promoters exploit the house as castle myth to justify single-family house construction while others simply build tall buildings leaving lots of open space where the house as castle myth becomes a condominium. \n392\nWhat are some the ongoing things that are being done to deal with the crises?\nAll this having been said, throughout the formation of cities, there has always been a group of people that were favored to live inside the wall and others who lived outside, and the ones living outside had to build their own habitats in any way they could. \n \nIt is only recently that governments took an interest in the way the city and its outside city walls accommodated the citizenry. \n\nIn our time, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a good case in point where the government gives every subject an interest \u2013free loan toward the construction of a home. I harkens back to when the U.S. Federal government gave settlers free land. It depends on the objectives so that the ends justify the means. \nUnder various urban development acts and private initiatives, many big cities\u2019 urb and squalor is being converted to livable communities reflective of its local residents. \nOnce a person becomes a citizen he is entitled to the rights, privileges and protection afforded to citizens. Cities built inside the wall were fortresses and instruments of defense of the royal family and its treasures. \nGated communities, new towns and other forms of private developments with deed restrictions are ways of providing residents choice, ownership and management rights, which maintain the quality of that context. However, urban clusters in urban cities are managed by neighborhood development agencies, both have evolved as good ways to urbanize. The people are being protected. Security and defense is American, and the goal of every urban settlement, from country, to state, to city. Whether urban or rural we incorporate to first and foremost to pay for fire and police protection. \n However, cities still today repeat the same things as before where buildings outside the wall are influenced in styles, vocabulary and symbols by those inside the wall. Additionally, city layouts, building types and designs symbolically represent national and corporate beliefs in the forms of rooftops, finishes and models. Interior design, furniture, communication devices, media and the automobile have been great unifying factors. Houses are overbuilt with exaggerated multiple pitched roofs and exterior finishes likening them to castles, office buildings and hoses of worship. Just look at the advent of the boom in the computer designed pre-engineered truss industry in our SWFL counties. \n274\nHas current events had an impact on urbanization?\nBecause most civilized societies think of their city as a fortress and collective power the terrible human tragedy of 9/11 and the many global terrorist assaults impact the urban psyche. Cities are now seeking a new metaphor of their densely populated urbs and sprawling cities. \n\nNot to say that terrorist couldn\u2019t strike anywhere or at any remote place but suddenly dispersion of the population with bulky, uniform and inefficient vehicles have become very fashionable. People moving out of dense areas now believe they need bulky vehicles. \nIn fact, the advent of the airplanes and bombs made all cities vulnerable. Still, commerce and individuals have rethought their personal settlement based on these new realities. However, no matter neither where we settle nor how many computers we own, economy, access to resources, socialization, identity and life support remains the advantage of what the city provides, and the urban city provides this to even rural communities. \nEven our choices to have a private single family house as a sign of citizenry, or a corporation to have its own building identity all harkens back to our most primitive metaphorical instincts. \nThe anonymity of the urban multifamily dwelling for some is preferred over the ostentation of the merchant whose building roofline and form must rise above the others. Real Estate Developers and emerging political entities in urban\u2019s adjacent counties tap into these logos, mores and folkways to overwhelm town fathers and government officials with rightness and worthiness of the metaphors they say they provide. Even post 9/11 automobiles are designed to be anonymous by being similar regardless of brand and cost. \n \nIf over population of the earth means that the earth has more people than resources or that we cannot redistribute the wealth and the resources what affect does over population have to do with increasing populations to an one city? \n \nBecause development of civilization results in urbanization, does it necessarily mean the removal of the rural character of a town or area? \n \nAre we, as a members of the world\u2019s family liable and able to mange the increases in population? \nIs urbanity the only answer and how do we mitigate the inevitable?\n \nIt seems only rational that while many of us may value agricultural and rural communities, as products of the city and the urban process we choose and wish to continue to improve our urbs. \n\n \nDemographically, the term urbanize, denotes redistribution of populations from rural to urban settlements and these developments, which may or may not become cities. Rural to urban migration is the moving of people from rural areas into cities. When cities grow rapidly, as in Chicago in the late 19th century or Shanghai a century later, the movement of people from rural communities into cities is considered to be the main cause, the cause of the world\u2019s overpopulation. Many argue that it is cities that are causing the worlds over population and that urbanization is therefore inherently wrong. Because this kind of growth is especially commonplace in developing countries, they further argue that in order to reduce the growth of the world\u2019s over-population urbanization should be discouraged and made difficult. \n \nYet, rural migrants continue to be attracted by the possibilities that cities can offer, but often settle in shantytowns and experience extreme poverty. In Saudi Arabia, planners are diverting such increases to smaller towns building up their infrastructure and relocating business and industry, however, in their case, they still wish to increase their native population, however huge their unemployment of young Saudis. Since they are one of world\u2019s largest welfare states and able to financially support populations these population increases continue at a rapid rate as do the construction of urban centers. But there are many other countries whose urban developments do not keep pace or by political conflict displace millions into tent cities out side the confines of the urban support centers. Indeed, the culture of cosmopolitan urbanity is a very weighty matter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne Hour Take a five-minute break: When we came back, we will examine Natural Cities. Break is only for 90 minute lecture.\n\nNatural Cities: \n5,070 words on 21 pages\nHow do natural cities form?\nNatural Cities are incorporated government entities formed by resident citizens with a confluence of circumstantial and haphazard events over a period of time; it is a city that has evolved over time. They can be tiny and small or mammoth and overpopulated. Yes, it once was created in a much smaller, rural, and primitive form and over time is renovated and adjusted to accommodate new policies, technologies and demographics. The city reflects the nature of its creators and subsequent inhabitants. \n \nTo live in such a place you have to be a pragmatist who constantly negotiates changing realities and expects challenges to the very basics of existence. You are on the cutting edge of growth, deterioration and the inspiration of man-made achievements.\n244\nYes, Lee County\u2019s City of Fort Myers and the City of Bonita Springs are such places. Whereas cities of Naples, Cape Coral and emerging Lehigh Acers are good examples of local synthetic man-made cities, not to be confused with local urban developments and enclaves. In today\u2019s planning terminology they are considered urban really wide spread sprawl with very costly infrastructure relative to their population, industry and tax base. Whereas a Natural city is real or genuine when it reflects the character, interest, personality and pecuniary, social and political interest of its authors. It is economical and efficient.\n\nWhat the privileges are enjoyed in cites?\nA Natural city is driven by inhabitants wanting refuge, righteousness and sanctuary from chaos and confusion so as to grow family, business and prosper, to have a civil life with not only law and order but also infrastructure, potential and power. They are alive and vibrant with their own self-interest, backed by their determination to profit, and have a happy and successful population for themselves and their supporters. \n\nThey create such cities as a monument to their greatness, which is often material, industrial, and commercial accomplishments, and are a legacy of their fortunes and fame. It is a variation of the way traditional cities were formed. \nAnd it is from this drive and vision that its inhabitants prosper and enjoy their life. The city turns them on. They are heirs of these creators and enjoy the legacy of their work. \n \nTo me a city is a toy and form of recreation and creativity to which I attribute many of life\u2019s joys and great moments of happiness. Having lived and visited hundreds of cities and many countries of both the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave-nots\u201d I am very grateful to have a blue passport, a great county and the blessings of cities. \n239\nFor example, a city is a metaphor when I say, \u201cI am a New Yorker\u201d. \nI mean, \u201cWere I a city I would be New York\u201d. \nSilly isn\u2019t it, but in the realm of ideas and matters of the heart, it is real.\nNatural cities lend themselves to metaphors that arise out convention because of the city\u2019s long history and deep-rooted ancestry. Because a metaphor makes the strange familiar and \u201ctalks about one thing in terms of another\u201d, one immediately characterizes a native New Yorker with the many images and values of the city, its\u2019 crime, delinquent garbage collection, gangs, traffic, crowds, vulgarities, and other mean things. Not the arts, high fashion, financial district, millions of office workers, universities, museums, great hospitals, publishers and intellects, entertainers, performers and artist, etc. in general, a conglomeration of hyper-over-achievers. \n\nNew York City is one America\u2019s and the world\u2019s great natural cities where over 200 years ago was the place of battles that won America\u2019s freedom and the city, which was the nation\u2019s first capital. \nTo a New Yorker, New York is a metaphor because the city is currency that makes us authentic and part of a New York reality. And, this can be said for many other cities. The city authenticates our labors, strivings and ambitions into a homogeneous context of brilliance and success. It is no wonder why many New Yorkers are architects, planners and urbanist, especially native New Yorkers. \n \nHow do cities maintain their grip on our imagination?\nIn a natural city, the reality may be all myth, hype and imagination but it is the very thing that theatre, baseball and football teams thrive as they identify their city and teams with their loyalty and pride. \nThe culture of the city is that which changes, nurtures and grows us out of our own to the city\u2019s nature. \nWhen I was a young man, I couldn\u2019t stop going from one theater, museum, zoo, building, and street to another acclimatizing and adopting the streets character and moods. One of the most read articles in every Daily News paper showed a corner of the city before and after in recognition of the city\u2019s ever-changing face. I was always attentive to see what the place looked like before. \nHowever, New York has not cornered the market on design professionals. Since every populated town is a kind of urban context many much smaller urban models have grown their version of architects and design professionals.\nWhen I first visited 72 natural European cities, I discovered that each city owned a separate and unique metaphor, description and uniqueness. In their own way, they were urban with many commonalities and distinctive differences. They were all sizes, locations and climate. Since then I have visited countless others to observe them evolve and adapt. \nNatural Cities manifest themselves in movies, books, poems, radio, stage shows, plays, songs, play, and games. In movies such as Casablanca, The East- Side Kids, Easter Parade, Detective stories such as the Mickey Spilane and the Mike Hammer series, Batman, Super Man and the Daily Planet, West Side Story, Rhapsody in Blue, and thousands of others. \nThose that love cities endure the rain, sleet and snow. They endure crime, dirt and filth. They endure interruptions of garbage collection, power failures, outrageous crime, and poverty. \n251\nWhat are the cities real support systems?\nUrbanization process\nWhether urbanity occurs in rural agricultural or urban industrial areas man\u2019s infrastructure prevails as the underlying base or foundation especially for an organization or system. Man\u2019s infrastructure is the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the functioning of a community or society, such as transportation and communications systems, water and power lines, and public institutions including schools, post offices, and prisons. It is these that prevail, not the nature, and the amenities as they do in rural and suburban communities. \n \nIn rural communities, nature prevails. However, it is the urban infrastructure that has sewn me into the mind of urbanity and enclosed my vision of the whole of life. \nIt is the canvas upon which the city\u2019s form is woven and designed. Because of this city-type as an art form, one\u2019s life and world-context differs noticeably and is distinguished one from another. Yet when either is populated by a variety of families and diverse interests they must face the same issues but on different scales. \nIn rural settings, man\u2019s intervention is made by his personal relationships, dependence and handwork. In urban settings, such intervention is made by the overwhelming context and sheer volume of some trend, fashion, vocation, and opportunity. It\u2019s a matter of the proportion of the relationship of the manmade infrastructure to the nature. \nPeople from the old urban cities go to newly developing urban cities bringing experience. Warnings, passions and visions were what I brought to Saudi Arabia. \n \nWhat are the cities natural geographical derivatives? \n\u2022 River town\n\u2022 Trade route intersection\n\u2022 Terminal city; Shipping ports, Railroads and airports\n\u2022 Farming cities; Agricultural and cattle\n\u2022 Company town based on mining, manufacturing and industry.\n\u2022 Ocean cities and waterfront\nCan you name any others?\n\u2022 Resort cities\n\u2022 Results of victory of a war\n\u2022 Oil, coal and other mineral mining and exploration Cities\n\u2022 Tax-free districts in the Caribbean\n\u2022 Or there geographical location has been made redundant by another technology or geo-political event as the many river towns of the Mississippi and New England and resort cities on the Jersey Shore.\n \nWhat are the human elements that often cause the formation and development of a city? \nCities are heroic and made by heroes, entrepreneurs, and usually those whose interest lie in the place or circumstances surrounding, interesting and used by the place as trains, rails, ports, shipping, manufacturing, business, boat building, communications, telephone, telegraph, radio (Sarnoff), etc. \nCan you name some our area\u2019s heroes?\nEdison, Collier, Mann, Carter; all the names on streets (McGregor, Heitmann, Hendry, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\n329\nCities can be large, medium or small and have dominant specialty in commerce, oil, coal, steel, manufacturing, agriculture and depending on the population and geographic area can be disproportionately overwhelming making it out of scale so enormous that makes it impressive and powerful. \n \nNew York is an outstanding example of this enormous scale. Many people feel dwarfed, lonely and oppressed because of the scale of such a city. It is this scales that design professionals are trained to create and mitigate to relate to individuals. It is the very thing that Michelangelo did when he designed buildings in Italy. While planners and politicians organize, two-dimensional plans and diagrams. \nA natural city is urban for many reasons including its infrastructure but more importantly because of its confluence of institutions, artistic, scientific, spiritual and commercial culture. A city is by definition a people in agreement and both reflects and serves its citizens while an urban city favors its buildings, infrastructure and facilities over its pastoral connection to the land and its citizens favor residing in close quarters without separate buildings and so called single family homes, they share building living in separate dwellings. \n \nWhat are the pros and cons of a cosmopolitan city?\nA Cosmopolite has a universal, adoptable and diverse urban mind. But not all urban people are cosmopolitan and urban people can be very provincial. \n \nCosmopolitan persons are free from local, provincial, or national ideas, prejudices, or attachments, at home all over the world. Belonging to the entire world and not limited to just one part of the world, they are citizens of the world.\n \nI have been a cosmopolitan person in an urban context that later learned to live in any context with my cosmopolitan point of view. \nThink of science fiction stories where the context and characters are dealing with non-domestic technical issues away for the mundane politics of our own time and place. We like the cosmopolitan in our clergy, educators, government officials (bureaucrats), etc. \nWho implements the Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism?\nThe correct answer is everyone! \nBut, urbanist are a specialist in the study and planning of cities and New Urbanism is an urban design movement that burst onto the scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s and tries to bring urban values into new and existing building contexts, but Urbanist are different from a rural and sub-urban mind. \n \nNew Urbanism implements the \u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d\nby shifting design focus from the car-centric development of suburbia and the business park; to concentrate pedestrian and transit-centric, walk able, mixed-use communities. New Urbanism is an amalgamation of old-world design patterns, merged with present day demands. \n50\nIt is a backlash to the age of suburban sprawl, which splintered communities, and isolated people from each other, as well as had severe environmental impacts. Concepts for New Urbanism include people and destinations into dense, vibrant communities, and decreasing dependency on vehicular transportation as the primary mode of transit.\n \nNew Urbanist aim to reform all aspects of real estate development and their work affects regional and local plans. They are involved in new development, urban retrofits, and suburban infill. In all case, New Urbanist neighborhoods are walk able, and contain a diverse range of housing and jobs, they support regional planning to achieve open space, appropriate architecture and planning, and the balanced development of jobs and housing. \nThey believe these strategies are the best way to reduce how long people spend in traffic, to increase the supply of affordable housing, and to rein-in urban sprawl. Many other issues, such as historic restoration, safe streets, and green building are also covered in the Charter of the New Urbanism, the movement's seminal document.\n \nSo how does Natural Cities expand?\nThe answer depends on the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism as whether it will go vertical, horizontal, reconfiguration, co-habitation or sub dividing. There are many cultures where several families share one dwelling or apartments and dwellings are minimal sleeping rooms. \nIn America, traditional urbanization exhibits a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area. When the residential area shifts outward, this is called suburbanization. \n136\nA number of researchers and writers suggest that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown. Some considers this networked, polycentric form of concentration an emerging pattern of urbanization. \n\nThey are simply reflecting how large natural urban centers evolved as they connected many population centers around industry, trade, transport, and ands commerce. Chicago, New York\u2019s boroughs, and Detroit are famous for their ethnic and commercial neighborhoods and districts. We saw Leipzig\u2019s new urbanist cluster neighborhoods shortly after the wall fell. A consortium of Saxon architect\u2019s landscape architects and planners planned these. Each cluster had its own design team and theme. It is called variously exurbia, edge city (Garreau, 1991), network city (Batten, 1995), or postmodern city (Dear, 2000). Los Angeles is the best-known example of this type of urbanization. \n \nSo who\u2019s minding the store? \nProfessional Urbanist\nWhile conveying the culture is really everyone\u2019s responsibility architects limit and bound space and make metaphors; they design and control overall concepts and all the details of the built environment inhabited by people. \n \nArchitects observe, program, plan, design, schedule, specify and supervise the construction process. An architect\u2019s education prepares him for managing being the arbiter between the occupant and those with the skills to construct. \nBecause an architect is skilled in making building metaphors for people an architect is inherently urban and an advocate for all that best benefits the individual and collective society. \nThe architect professes urbanity and is able to manage a variety of urban functions including being the mayor, city manager, councilman, commissioners, and real estate development. \n \n\nFor example, I not only planned cites and designed buildings in Saudi Arabia I also drew up business plans for billion dollar financial interest for members of the Royal Family and Saudi Arabia sheiks; I organized specific new ventures for Operations and Maintenance business, pipe manufacturing, fire suppression equipment, and medical and pharmaceutical facilities. \n \nWhat are the different professionals that design build and manage an urban entity? \nWhen I was teaching in Saudi Arabia, many of my graduated architectural students have become mayors and city managers in Lebanon, Syria, Dubai and Iran. My monographs on \u201carchitecture as the making of metaphors\u201d have been published in Saudi Arabia, England, U. S. of A., Lebanon, Turkey, and Finland. You can immediately tell the difference between cities designed by an architect by its spaces and three-dimensional solutions. Planners tend to think in two dimensions, linearly and abstractly. \n490\nProgrammer: The first job I had when I graduated Pratt was to develop the program of requirements for several New York City Multi \u2013million dollar interior design projects for New York City\u2019s skyscrapers in mid-town Manhattan. \n\nUrban Landscape Architects plan the location of buildings, roads, and walkways, and the arrangement of flowers, shrubs, and trees and this title was first used by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1863 who is famous for designing many well-known urban parks, including Central Park and Prospect Park in New York City. Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant was a French-born American architect and urban planner who designed the first street plan for the Federal City in the United States, now known as Washington, D.C.\nLandscape architects work for many types of organizations\u2014from real estate development firms starting new projects to municipalities constructing airports or parks. \nWorking with architects, surveyors, and engineers, landscape architects help determine the best arrangement of roads and buildings. Urban design includes town and city squares, waterfronts, pedestrian schemes, and parking lots.\n\nCity Planning is a department in many colleges and universities and is the activity of determining the: \n\u2022 Future physical arrangement and condition of a community involving an appraisal of the present condition, \n\u2022 A forecast of future requirements, \n\u2022 A plan for the fulfillment of these requirements, and \n\u2022 Proposals for constructional, legal, and financial programs to implement the plan.\n\nInterior Designers and Space Planners\nLater in the year, I will be teaching course in Interior Design. Urban interior designers are concerned about adopting spaces within residences, skyscrapers, malls, shopping centers and shops to the specifics of their occupants and really take up where most commercial architects leave off. Before I was an architect, I was an interior architect and designed buildings from the inside out. \nThat is an architect who designs most commercial buildings without knowing who will be the specific occupant. Most such work is referred to as \u201ctenant change\u201d -work and is the job of first a space planner who determines the feasibility of the space to its potential tenant and then the layout. \n\nOnce completed the interior designer begins the design work. Stores, malls, hospitals, banks, airports, railroad terminals and many other building types are the job of the interior architect otherwise known as the interior designer. You could think of much of their work as adopting the architectural standard building shell to the specific and peculiar requirements of the proposed occupant. \nInterior design is the process of shaping the experience of interior space and traffic flow through the manipulation of spatial volume as well as surface treatment. Not to be confused with interior decoration, interior design draws on aspects of environmental psychology, architecture, and product design in addition to traditional decoration. The distinction between interior design and 'interior decoration' is one relevant in the United States but not common elsewhere. In cities, residential interior design and decoration comprise a small but important field of work.\n\\\n\n\n\nWhat other professions form a city?\nAside from programmers, city planners, landscape architects and interior designers, Constitutional, corporate and governmental Attorneys and law assist people who are in one accord to agree and formulate agreements, ordinances, statues and the very governments and institutions by which to incorporate their municipalities and behave in civil and orderly manner within their societies. It is in this way that a collection of people are able to become countries, states, counties, villages, hamlets, townships, boroughs, cities, and metropolitan areas. It is they who can make laws, which can help government and the people, be both pragmatic and ideal. It is this combination that allows great ideas to flourish while fighting crime and garbage collection. \n \nHow did I become an urbanist?\nIn New York, I was a child explorer:\nFrom childhood, I have been curious as to why cities, building and streets are the way they are. I still ask how did they get that way, what is their make up and why were they formed. \nIn urban South Bronx, I lived in densely pullulated tenements, two family houses in a sparsely populated Industrial Hunts Point and medium dense Pelham Parkway and apartments in Manhattan, Tennessee, Austria, Puerto Rico, and Saudi Arabia, a loft in Manhattan and single family homes in Florida, Tennessee, Saudi Arabia, College Station, a town house in Houston and manufactured home in North Fort Myers. \nAnd now we live in a country club with a small town communal atmosphere and many facilities. Many gated communities are a resource for recreation, entertainment, food, and even home health care. \n \nAs urbanites work, they become embroiled in aspect of the city\u2019s support services. I practiced vocations, which bonded me to the city and its building types, commerce and industry. Because I hung drapes over a period of ten years, I worked in thousands of homes, for every ethnic and national background, on thousands of streets in hundreds of neighborhoods in every borough and nearby counties. I was a limousine driver for weddings and special events and delivered newspapers into many tenement buildings and neighborhoods. Likewise, I was a Good Humor Man in the streets of Brooklyn and conducted many Job searches in Manhattan and New Haven. \nI was a radio broadcaster, founded a New York Not for Profit community organization and founded two earth days with one on Union Square at Fourteenth Street and another in Central park. \nI designed and built large and small offices, lofts, lobbies, skyscrapers in Manhattan, and in Houston, Midland, Odessa, and Victoria Texas as well in Tennessee in Jackson, Severe and Walker counties, built all over Saudi Arabia; and, in Puerto Rico made an Island-wide plan for Public Libraries for all the municipalities as well as designing the Ron Rico Bottling Plant in Arecibo, El Mundo towers and other building in San Juan.\n \nI poured my best into every project believing that it would contribute to the betterment of the lives of their occupants. I remember one nursing home I designed for renovation I stared at the windows of the 15 stories building and knowing that the view from the window would probably be the last the occupants saw of the world and therefore assured for beautiful landscaping. This was based on the recollection I had of my grandfather\u2019s last moments waving to me from his Brooklyn Hospital\u2019s window before he died when I was six years old. \n 991\nAbout American cities, the architect Robert Venturi once proclaimed that, \u201cplazas are un-American\u201d and one of my mentors, Gerald Popiel, often noted how the highest building in medieval cities was the church and worship centers whereas the highest buildings in modern cities are the banks and commercial office buildings. \nAmerica cities, as many other of the world\u2019s well known cities have replaced and supplemented plazas with great boulevards and other expressions of consensus and agreement. Plazas and public meeting places are beginning to become a part of atrium malls, office buildings and office plazas. Even neighborhood commercial enters are focused around plazas as new urbanist make places for people to congregate. I was pleasantly surprised to see Washington\u2019s huge plaza in Georgetown on the river and of course Boston\u2019s Quincy market and its huge food plaza. These are all good urban features and attract people looking for the means to socialize. Of course in Manhattan, the Seagram building\u2019s plaza on Park Avenue designed by my former professor, Phillip Johnson. Yet all of these in world-class cities are often reminiscent of the village green, Town Square, and county fair ground in smaller urban models. \n\nWhat it takes to prepare an urban professional?\nUsing my self and my hometown as an example, I would like to explain what it takes to prepare an urban professional\n\nMy teachers and mentors:\nI have been very fortunate to have great teachers and mentors, who loved cities and urbanism such as:\n1. Paul Weiss, philosopher\n2. Buckminster Fuller, theorist and visionary\n3. Louis Kahn, architect\n4. Mies Van Der Rohe, architect and founder of the Bau-House\n5. King Louis Wu, Yale teacher and architect\n6. Christopher Tunnard (who taught me about modern planned cities), \n7. Paul Rudolf who was originally from Sarasota and \n8. Henry Pfisterer (Engineer for the Empire State Building),\n9. Vincent Scully was born in New Haven, was my faculty advisor\nwhen I studied at Yale where he taught History of Architecture and was one of my thesis jurors, he spent a lot of time with me because I was a native New Yorker from the streets he loved and he wrote many books which deal with urbanity, cities and New York such as:\nArchitecture; the Natural and the Manmade and\nAmerican Architecture and Urbanism,\n\nAnd I worked for such architects as:\n\u2022Kahn and Jacobs designing high-rise office buildings\n\u2022Edward Durrell Stone, designing the State University in Albany.\n\u2022Morris Lapidus assigned me to design and detail high-rise apartment buildings and hotels and finally used my drawing as examples of his offices work in his book. Morris Lapidus was born in 1902 and brought the ambience of Odessa Russia to create the curvy, flamboyant Neo-baroque modern hotels that defined the 1950s 'Miami Beach' resort hotel style. He died at the age of 98 in Miami Beach, Florida. As a young man, Lapidus toyed with theatrical set design and studied architecture at Columbia University where I met my wife Christina. \nTruly, an urban thinker Lapidus worked for 20 years as a retail designer before moving to Miami Beach in the 1940s and designing his first buildings. \n\n\n\nHe was a product and espoused urbanism in all his work. \nAfter a career in innovative retail interior design, his first large commission was the Miami Beach Sans Souci Hotel, followed closely by the Nautilus, the Di Lido, the Biltmore Terrace, and the Algiers, all along Collins Avenue, and amounting to the single-handed redesign of an entire district now known as South Beach. The hotels were an immediate popular success. Then in 1952 he landed the job of the largest luxury hotel in Miami Beach, the property he is most associated with, the Fontainebleau Hotel, which was followed the next year by the equally successful Eden Roc and the Americana (now the Sheraton Bal Harbor) in 1956. His son Alan who practices architecture in Fort Lauderdale survives him. \n\u2022Designs for Business and Gerald Luss assigned me to design very expensive huge interior spaces for banks, factoring companies and manufactures. \n\u2022Frederick Kiesler for whom I built the model for the Dome for the Dead Scrolls Museum in Israel.\n\u2022Serge Chermayeff for whom I did the graphics for his report using his theory of complementarities to the US bureau of Standards of Cites, campus and town planning. \n\u2022I was invited to teach Real Estate Development to Architectural students at the University of Houston and where ever I taught architecture in America I always urged students to get out of their suburbs and rural communities and learn \u201cNew York 101\u201d. They could not really be architects unless they learned the lesson New York had to teach, lessons, which I learned in the first 21 years of my life. \n\nWhat are the Events and Projects that shaped New York?\n1. Settlers after the Revolution\n2. Port for trade and shipbuilding\n3. Clearing up the squalor\n4. Fire codes\n5. Building codes\n6. Establishing the architectural profession and American Institute of \n Architects General Conditions between builders and Owners\n7. Subways: Irish and great engineering; tunnels\n8. Grand Central Station and Park Ave Railroad project\n9. Stock Exchange\n10. Air travel and airports\n11. Robert Moses: parks and recreation\n12. Quantity of wealthy merchants that settled and made their business \nin New York City such as Rockefeller, Astor, Mellon, Vanderbilt, Tiffany, etc. \n13. Landmarks Legislation and preservation\n14. Broadway, vaudeville, theatre, opera, ballet, museums, planetarium, parks,\n15. Central Park\n16. Consolidating the boroughs in to one city government\n17. Use of iron, steel and fireproofing. \n18. Invention of the Elevator brought the invention of the skyscrapers \nto Chicago and New York as well as the Eiffel tower to Paris. Indians learned to walk in the sky and the construction industry was unionized. \n19. Postal system delivering letters to every ones mailbox in every apartment, rain, sleet or snow. \n20. The attack on the World Trade Center\n Are there events and that caused a city you know to loose its\u2019 population or quality of life? \n\nHere are the Projects that negatively affected New York City.\n\u2022 Robert Moses and his highways, which destroyed/divided neighborhoods and reduced the values of building and occupancy\n\u2022 A combination of affluence by tenants increased demand for improvements to rental properties, which could not be met by landlords due to increased property taxes and cost of construction. Building owners, contractors and real-estate business found low priced and unrestricted properties in adjacent unincorporated counties on which to build low cost and attractive housing. This along with Government backed home mortgages and veteran\u2019s low-cost loans prompted the creation of what we call suburbs and later sub divisions, Planned Unit Developments, and New towns. The exodus out of the big cities devastated inner city neighborhoods and brought in drug dealers and crime. \n\u2022 The exodus nurtured itself as the more people left the worse things got. I remember how people would seek to go to Long Island and Westchester County to get bigger and more affordable housing.\n\u2022 \u201cProject\u201d buildings replaced \u201ctenements\u201d which destroyed neighborhoods and housed families within floors of large-scale buildings; the resulting anonymity became a perfect cover for the illegal sale of drugs.\n\u2022 Crime and narcotics moved into slums as Fort Apache #14 Precinct in the Bronx my old neighborhood in the Morrisania area of the South Bronx.\n\u2022 Low-cost new houses in the emerging suburbs were built off of unpaved roads in Long Island where you could buy a house with no-to-low interest VA loan for houses costing between $2,500 up to $6,000 made access possible by the construction of Triborough Bridge, Whitestone Bridge, the Long Island Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway. \n \nWhat are the inherent negatives about a big old city and the Urban State of Mind?\nDespite all the wonderful things in a city its scale, size and complexity brings, rats, roaches, gangs, crime, murder, rape, theft, security and problems meaning that everyone has to be cautious about the time of day and the streets and neighborhoods visited. \nThe city is not elegant but bawdy, vulgar and always on the cutting of edge of changing, de-construction, rebuilding as it adopts to new demands by commerce, demographics, economics and commercial opportunity. The city thrives on commerce and the labor of its inhabitants. It also is a self-redesigning, rebuilding and healing engine of humanity. \nAll of these provide anecdotal justifications for corporate developers to market to fleeing residents. \n \nWhat are the causes of renewed interest in urbanization?\n\u2022 Suburbs cost is becoming too high and unaffordable\n\u2022 Improved facilities for education and jobs in the city.\n\u2022 Quality of Life\n\u2022 Environmental, ecology and health \n\u2022 Education\n\u2022 Recreation, entertainment, and access\n\u2022 Commercial development and socialization \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there an ideal urban natural city?\nMost ideal urban settings are broken down into communities and neighborhoods. In my neighborhoods we had immediate access to fresh produce markets, entertainment, recreation, socialization, schools in walking distance, public transportation including busses and subways, commercial development shops and shopping street, Cops on the beat, playgrounds, and a ethnically diverse neighborhood of friends and neighbors.\n \nThe key features of the apartment in the tenement in which we lived \nThese features originated with the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism, building codes and available technologies. \n\u2022Outside stoop\n\u2022Set back adjacent to the sidewalk\n\u2022Auto parking on the street\n\u2022The metal stairs down to the cellar in front of the building\n\u2022Place for coal deliveries and ash pick-up\n\u2022Cellar had a giant coal burning furnace and place for the pile of coal\n\u2022The vertical black painted iron grille\n\u2022The fire escapes on the front and rear of the building in front of most of the out facing windows.\n\u2022 The cornices on top of each building which form a frame to the line of the buildings, accentuate the line and evenness of the buildings, cap between the canyon formed by the buildings and the sky\n\u2022The mailbox area in back of the ground floor (We never changed it keep the rent control in place)\n\u2022The inner lobby with large glass doors and white marble steps and landing\n\u2022 The front door to our apartment, which was notably: \"A\u201d, being the first one on the ground floor directly facing the street but separated by an eight foot access way with steel stair leading to the basement and surrounded by black steel vertical guard rail.\n\u2022The gas stove in the kitchen\n\u2022The ice box and the first refrigerator with its leaking ammonia\n\u2022Window box pantry in the kitchen\n\u2022Cloths line into the alley from our kitchen window\n\u2022The alley\n\u2022Window with their stained glass clerestory windows. \n\u2022 Painted-over windows, which got stuck and were very difficult to open because of broken chains, weights and paint.\n\u2022Linoleum floors described elsewhere\n\u2022Parquet floors\n\u2022 French doors between living room and my bedroom\n\u2022 Radiators and steam heat with radiator covers to add humidity\n\u2022The cocker roaches and mice\n\u2022Garbage pails and sanitation trucks and collection\n\u2022 Police car and fire engine horns, bells and sirens\n\u2022 Painting the apartment every two years because the led paint would peal, fall on the floor and get dirty\n\u2022 Molding and baseboards on the walls\n\u2022 Bathtub with legs\n\u2022 Roof tops, entrances, tarpaper, and games and play areas.\n\u2022 Fire hydrants in the summer\n\u2022 Parking cars; alternate side of the street; snow; cleaning the car\n\u2022 Street games: tag, rig-a-leev-eo, hopscotch, stick- ball, skating, foot scooter, race box with skate wheels below\n\u2022 Fie-escapes\n\u2022 Loews Movie Theatres: All lived together in tight quarters and went to the Loews movie theaters, which were furnished and designed to look like palaces. \nIf you were to visit your favorite city what would be the places you would want to see? \n\nIf I were to visit New York today, I would want to be a pedestrian because being a pedestrian is what I miss most about not being in an urban context to go:\n\u2022 window-shopping on Fifth Avenue\n\u2022 Visit Henri Bendels, Tiffany\u2019s, Sacks, Bloomingdale\u2019s, etc.\n\u2022 Ambulate on the boulevards and side streets\n\u2022 Explore the subways \n\u2022 Climb the stairs of the train\u2019s elevated structures\n\u2022 Visit lobbies; see my old residences and streets\n\u2022 Snack pizzas and hot dogs as we walk \n\u2022 Visit Radio city Music Hall and Radio City underground\n\u2022 See the Rockefeller Center and Central Park ice skating rinks\n\u2022 Ride on the Staten Island Ferry\n\u2022 Visit the little mini-new town off of City Island\n\u2022 See my old schools\n\u2022 Walk down Southern Boulevard, Broadway and 42-nd streets\n\u2022 Visit central park\n\u2022 Visit the Bronx Zoo \n\u2022 Visit the new Hayden Planetarium\n\u2022 Visit Coney Island and get an Original Nathan\u2019s Frankfurter\n\u2022 Walk down some back alleys and side streets\n\nOne and a Half Hour has elapsed. Now there may be time (20 minutes) for questions and comments. \n\nConclusion:\nMy thesis that a \u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d assumes that increases in population and density culture our personal, family and business. We are cosmopolitan and urban as we agree, disagree, peruse common goals, tolerate stress and congestion, discern between community and privacy and distribute precious resources. I hope I have shown \u201cwhat can be done to make cities livable and worthy to be called home\u201d. The Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d wants \u201clivability\u201d to be home. I believe the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism is life\u2019s experience and a legacy worth cherishing and conveying.\n \nAt the beginning, I asked if there was an urban issue you would like to discuss or question you\u2019d like to ask. Does anyone have an urban concern or solution? \nAs time may permit:\n\u2022 Are you now better prepared to understand, perceive and choose your urban context?\n\u2022 Do you have a vision for your home, block, neighborhood, community, county and city? \n\u2022Can you name some large, medium and small cities? \n\u2022Which is your favorite city and why?\n\u2022Can you identify cities with closed and bounded space?\n\u2022Can you identify cities with open and sculptural spaces?\n\u2022What makes you curious? Is it medicine, law, cities, politics, what?\n\u2022Do you see a role for yourself in the creation, reinvention and improvement of your city?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 25894013,

In this new world order, great empires had to leave their autonomy to the nation-states, which arose within those empires. This conversion taking place at the beginning of the century was only a rebellion for Russian nations, which is limited to a change of regime. As a matter of fact the empires were destroyed, but the expected nation states did not emerge, or more precisely the Bolsheviks did not allow them to do so. These nations could only gain their independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the century. In order to consolidate the legitimacy of their delayed independence, the Turkish speaking nations among the Soviet communities redesigned the concepts of land, flag, language, history and similar elements that refer to the uniqueness of the nation and the state, on the basis of nationalism. In this respect, Azerbaijan, which made its political choice in favor of being a nation-state, started to redesign its history and identity with a national perspective. However, since this process developed in line with political upheaval, the national historiography of Azerbaijan could not adopt a permanent shape.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44121070,

transnational networks, learn about the world and meet people from other cultures. In other words, media may allow one to cultivate cosmopolitan capital, defined here as a distinct form of embodied cultural capital. However, far from everyone is identifying this potential. Analyses of a national survey and in-depth interviews, conducted in Sweden, disclose a tendency among those in possession of cultural capital to recognise and exploit cosmopolitan capital in their media practices. Those who are dispossessed of cultural capital are significantly less liable to approach media in this way. Relying on various media practices in order to reshape one\u2019s cultural capital exemplifies what Bourdieu called a reconversion strategy.

First, it will review the core presumption of the field of IIE, that being the demand for an inter- mission in the pursuit of a founding philosophy for IE in order to first address the philosophical biases of IE by western philosophy. Second, a history of the various philosophical streams of IIE will be outlined, including its literature and pioneering contributors. Lastly, a new synthesis of comparative philosophies in IIE will be offered, looking towards a future evolution of the field. Examining the interchange between contemporary information ethicists regarding the discipline of IIE, the review first outlines the previously established presumptions of the field of IIE that posit the need for an IE as grounded in western sensibilities. The author then addresses the implications of the foregoing presumption from several non-western viewpoints, arguing that IIE does in fact find roots in non-western philosophies as established in the concluding synthesis of western and eastern philosophical traditions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52314076, "asset_id": 9961776, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Theories and Practices of Cultural Cosmopolitanism_ (co-edited by Didier Coste, Christina Kkona, and Nicoletta Pireddu; winner of the 2023 American Comparative Literature Association 'Ren\u00e9 Wellek Prize for the Best Edited Collection\") is a collection of innovative interdisciplinary essays on cosmopolitanism, written by leading scholars from different continents who engage with paramount aesthetic, ethical, political, historical, and pedagogical issues.\r\nAs the title implies, the volume discusses cosmopolitanism as an attitude and a thought process, but also as an object of fictional, documentary, and social representations, trying to move away from the divisive premise of radical difference, and implying, instead, that all communities are traversed by differentiations, oppositions and contradictions. Authors propose a solidarity of reason, able to craft interpretive norms and teaching methods that transcend exclusive localisms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74466047, "asset_id": 43962467, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 196955, "first_name": "Didier", "last_name": "COSTE", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "DidierCOSTE", "display_name": "Didier COSTE", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/DidierCOSTE?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/196955/90989/98965/s65_didier.coste.jpg"}, {"id": 2160367, "first_name": "Nicoletta", "last_name": "Pireddu", "domain_name": "georgetown", "page_name": "NicolettaPireddu", "display_name": "Nicoletta  Pireddu", "profile_url": "https://georgetown.academia.edu/NicolettaPireddu?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2160367/6994837/7886846/s65_nicoletta.pireddu.jpg"}, {"id": 4184626, "first_name": "Christina", "last_name": "Kkona", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "ChristinaKkona", "display_name": "Christina Kkona", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/ChristinaKkona?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4184626/1638891/12857263/s65_christina.kkona.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6694, "name": "Global Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 298157, "name": "Cosmopolitanism and Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism_and_Globalization?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 540217, "name": "Cosmopolitanism and Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism_and_Nationalism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 986275, "name": "Cosmopolitan Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Citizenship?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1302691, "name": "Cosmpolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmpolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 36168039, "title": "Transversal practices between bourgeois cosmopolitanism and fervent german nationalism: the Schillerverein in Trieste as an example of the in-between in the alps-adriatic region.

This paper examines the processes of sociolinguistic relocation of \" lifestylers \" in the polylingual city of Barcelona through the lens of their embracing or rejection of Catalan, the non-state, local co-official language. It aims to decipher to what extent these individuals see Catalan as relevant to their transnational life experiences, and how this relevance is embedded in their relational-emotional experiences and evolving sense of self. This paper, which examines two life stories gathered through ethnographic interviewing, is framed within biographical-experiential approaches to the multilingual repertoire (Busch 2012; 2015). The analysis shows that by assembling different narrative bits and by examining in detail the small stories informants tell to ground their accounts, a complex picture of language (dis)appropriation emerges. It argues that national identity rhetoric is a discursive strategy deployed by narrators to partly make sense and partly rationalize what is a complex bundle of identity (re)constitution reasons, emotional stances and interpersonal power dynamics. The paper concludes by arguing that presences or absences in people's repertoire are embodied struggles for personal coherence.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56044608, "asset_id": 32055138, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1276692, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Cod\u00f3", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "EvaCod\u00f3", "display_name": "Eva Cod\u00f3", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/EvaCod%C3%B3?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1276692/1134921/38447108/s65_eva.cod_.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1391, "name": "Catalan Language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Catalan_Language?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2409, "name": "Mobility/Mobilities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mobility_Mobilities?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 275662, "name": "Lifestyle Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lifestyle_Migration?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1125474, "name": "New minority language speakers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_minority_language_speakers?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 30174313, "title": "The Cosmopolitan Performers: Chinese-Indonesian migrants in Perth, Australia", "created_at": "2016-11-30T03:13:17.475-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30174313/The_Cosmopolitan_Performers_Chinese_Indonesian_migrants_in_Perth_Australia?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_30174313", "summary": "Dance performances embody both the potentialities of multicultural and cosmopolitan identity and their contradictions. Through an ethnography of Chinese-Indonesian female migrants in Perth, Western Australia and their dances, this paper provides a window into understanding an intertwining of 'glocal' affiliations and cosmopolitan self-representations. Representing the largest visible group of Indonesian migrants in Australia, the Chinese 'descend-ants' (keturunan) perform as Indonesian traditional dancers on the Australian multicultural stage, to 'celebrate the institutions of the state(s) in which [they] live' (Appiah 1997, 633). Nevertheless and perhaps inevitably, this cosmopatriot identity was often tinted with uncertainty due to the ambiguity surrounding their positioning as a legally and culturally accepted ethnic group in Indonesia. When viewed as 'ethnic' dancers from Jakarta, these women were seen as 'legitimate' cultural representatives; the Indonesian migrant community accepted the discourse of Chinese historical settlement in Jakarta, creating a cultural syncretic influence. However, their own internal sense of belonging was disrupted, particularly due to the lingering memory of the violent 'May Riots' of 1998, which targeted Chinese-Indonesians. For many, the uncertainty generated by this violent episode became the reason for migration and settlement in Perth. Migration, the Australian multicultural stage, and a cosmopolitan worldview thus provide the spaces for Chinese Indonesians to express a cosmopatriotic affiliation with Indonesia despite the traumas of the riots and the realities of being in a neighbouring country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50632073, "asset_id": 30174313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 686807, "first_name": "Monika", "last_name": "Winarnita", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "MonikaWinarnita", "display_name": "Monika S Winarnita", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/MonikaWinarnita?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/686807/355117/29226196/s65_monika.winarnita.png"}, {"id": 12397674, "first_name": "Natalie", "last_name": "Araujo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "NatalieAraujo", "display_name": "Natalie Araujo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/NatalieAraujo?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12397674/3548453/14454423/s65_natalie.araujo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 19922518, "title": "Questions of Identity", "created_at": "2015-12-31T01:51:57.927-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/19922518/Questions_of_Identity?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_19922518", "summary": "Recently I described myself as:\nAn English language writer of Australian citizenship, immigrant background, transnational culture, cosmopolitan temperament.\nIt occurred to me that this condensed self-description might provide a way to reflect on Australia, and so to contribute to the conversation about the study of Australia", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 40917730, "asset_id": 19922518, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 4195107, "first_name": "Inez", "last_name": "Baranay", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "InezBaranay", "display_name": "Inez Baranay", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/InezBaranay?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4195107/4492103/5203214/s65_inez.baranay.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3979, "name": "English language", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/English_language?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19370, "name": "Transnationalism and multiple identities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism_and_multiple_identities?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 20004, "name": "Immigrant children", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigrant_children?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73661, "name": "Transculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transculturalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 12162105, "title": "To Know the World is to Advocate for it", "created_at": "2015-04-30T01:23:48.072-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12162105/To_Know_the_World_is_to_Advocate_for_it?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_12162105", "summary": "This paper is a response to the graduate seminar on Cosmopolitan Anthropology\u00a0convened by Kristin Kuutma at the University of Tartu, Estonia on the 14th and 15th of\u00a0January 2015. The three presenters at the seminar were Nigel Rapport (University of St\u00a0Andrews), Huon Wardle (University of St Andrews) and Andrew Irving (University of\u00a0Manchester).\n\nThe goal behind this review is to outline some of the core ideas associated with \"Cosmopolitan Anthropology\", its case for ethnography, and its political contribution. \n\nThe paper concludes the following: \n\nWe, as researchers, author the world. We do not pretend that our ethnographies are a re-presentation, a one-to-one translation of reality. Our ethnographies are mediated through a long list of conditions, which question any direct line of authorship. Perhaps a more productive way would be to address our ethnographies not as mirror images of the world, bare descriptions, analyses of the world, or the products of our society, but to see them as constitutive elements of the world. That what we offer to our readers is not an exegesis of the world but an appropriation of it, the proposal of a context rather than an illustration of a pre-existing one. If there is a lesson that I get from cosmopolitanism is the possibility that the world is made of itself and we are constitutive parts of it. As such, to know the world is to acknowledge it and advocate for it.\u00a0", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37464878, "asset_id": 12162105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

"Although cosmopolitan ideas are crucial for interpreting sociopolitical events, they should be considered from a critical perspective. In this article, I will draw on a bio-political reading of Gramsci's writings in order to circumscribe the notions of 'regressive' and 'progressive' cosmopolitanism. I will show how the transition between the former, relying on humanistic connotations, and the latter is facilitated in the Prison Notebooks by the phenomenon of Americanism. American industrialism operates in ways that recall Italian 'Umanesimo', thus anticipating the rise of a new Renaissance. In view of the escalating growth of the economy and the consequent crisis of national sovereignties, Gramsci grounds cosmopolitan 'man' on innovative forms of territorialization and a negative notion of identity, allowing political subjects to transform themselves and accomplish social change.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 66212273, "asset_id": 46016097, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20815602, "first_name": "Roberto", "last_name": "Mosciatti", "domain_name": "umich", "page_name": "RobertoMosciatti", "display_name": "Roberto Mosciatti", "profile_url": "https://umich.academia.edu/RobertoMosciatti?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20815602/24401782/23317043/s65_roberto.mosciatti.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1698, "name": "Marxism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Marxism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3115, "name": "Posthumanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Posthumanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9705, "name": "Capitalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Capitalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 16323, "name": "Biopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Biopolitics?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 48911, "name": "Italian Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italian_Philosophy?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 7868242, "title": "'Afri thing is not what it seems' (Afropolitanism) (2008)", "created_at": "2014-08-04T05:16:27.512-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7868242/Afri_thing_is_not_what_it_seems_Afropolitanism_2008_?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_7868242", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34359214, "asset_id": 7868242, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 10591280, "first_name": "Ruth", "last_name": "Simbao", "domain_name": "rhodes-za", "page_name": "RuthSimbao", "display_name": "Ruth Simbao", "profile_url": "https://rhodes-za.academia.edu/RuthSimbao?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/10591280/3998260/76197322/s65_ruth.simbao.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3051, "name": "Contemporary Art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11469, "name": "Curating", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 86120, "name": "Exhibitions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exhibitions?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 156075, "name": "Contemporary African art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_African_art?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 184321, "name": "Contemporary Art from African and the Diaspora", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Art_from_African_and_the_Diaspora?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 445622, "name": "Curating contemporary art", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Curating_contemporary_art?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1458042, "name": "Afropolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Afropolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2459140, "name": "Cosmolocalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmolocalism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 5478262, "title": "Global Cholas: Reworking Tradition and Modernity in Bolivian Lucha Libre", "created_at": "2013-12-19T00:56:14.055-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/5478262/Global_Cholas_Reworking_Tradition_and_Modernity_in_Bolivian_Lucha_Libre?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_5478262", "summary": "This article examines indigenous women wrestlers (luchadoras) in La Paz, Bolivia, and the ways in which they creatively use tourists\u2019 assumptions that they are \u201ctraditional\u201d peoples performing in \u201cexotic\u201d events. Since 2001, indigenous women have participated in lucha libre\u2014a form of wrestling that draws its lineage from wrestling in Mexico and the United States.

"Dilemmas around how to deal with asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat have been a key driver of political and public discourse for over a decade. In 2012, an \u2018Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers\u2019 was established to provide advice to the Australian government about how to deal with the increasingly embar- rassing issue of asylum seekers drowning at sea and a parliamentary stalemate on the matter. Using frame analysis to understand how national and post- national identities are being recruited in this debate, this paper analyses submissions to the Panel. We demonstrate how arguments for and against asylum seekers are constructed around nationalism, regionalism and globalism (cosmopolitan). Australia was variously framed as having an alternative national character from that promoted by politicians, as having a key regional role, and hence identity, and as a global citizen (both in reality and in appearance). Contrary to expectations, we found that each frame served as a vehicle through which progressive arguments were articulated, indicating the utility of each in arguing for more humane treatment of \u2018Others\u2019.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 54262808, "asset_id": 34374691, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20553502, "first_name": "Catherine", "last_name": "Austin", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "CatherineAustin", "display_name": "Catherine Austin", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/CatherineAustin?f_ri=120708", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}, {"id": 3810989, "first_name": "Farida", "last_name": "Fozdar", "domain_name": "uwa", "page_name": "FaridaFozdar", "display_name": "Farida Fozdar", "profile_url": "https://uwa.academia.edu/FaridaFozdar?f_ri=120708", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 22455, "name": "Asylum seekers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Asylum_seekers?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 139657, "name": "Frame Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Frame_Analysis?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 13073107, "title": "Cosmopolitan savages: The challenging art of selling African culture to tourists", "created_at": "2015-06-18T06:17:44.107-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13073107/Cosmopolitan_savages_The_challenging_art_of_selling_African_culture_to_tourists?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_13073107", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37937370, "asset_id": 13073107, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3343092, "first_name": "Vanessa", "last_name": "Wijngaarden", "domain_name": "johannesburg", "page_name": "VanessaWijngaarden", "display_name": "Vanessa Wijngaarden", "profile_url": "https://johannesburg.academia.edu/VanessaWijngaarden?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3343092/9674211/10774774/s65_vanessa.wijngaarden.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7860, "name": "Cultural Tourism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Tourism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 19495, "name": "Indigenous Peoples", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indigenous_Peoples?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 45911, "name": "Maasai", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maasai?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 931864, "name": "Nomadic/Indigenous People", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nomadic_Indigenous_People?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1302691, "name": "Cosmpolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmpolitanism?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 2983174, "title": "Boundaries of the Nation in the Space of the Urban: Memory and Landscape in Istanbul", "created_at": "2013-03-14T00:41:27.162-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2983174/Boundaries_of_the_Nation_in_the_Space_of_the_Urban_Memory_and_Landscape_in_Istanbul?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_2983174", "summary": "Kuzguncuk, Istanbul, is known for its small-scale neighbourhood landscape and its close social ties, as well as its multiethnic history.

Every year, salsa festivals in the world\u2019s major cities attract a significant number of international salsa practitioners, including a Taiwanese contingent. Scholars have attempted to locate an origin for salsa and to associate salsa with pan-Latin identity; in contrast, I examine the formation of the emerging cosmopolitan salsa scene centered on class-based affiliation in Taiwan. While many nations construct their identity through reference toan authentic heritage, Taiwan\u2014as East Asian studies scholar Shu-Mei Shih argues\u2014 cultivates national identity by embracing foreign cultural products. The popularity of salsa is a particularly compelling example of this celebration of the foreign in Taiwanese society.\n\nBy investigating salsa travel by Taiwanese practitioners and performances in salsa congresses, I argue that these dancers imagine a future characterized by global citizenship. In the face of Taiwan\u2019s precarious nation-state position, the practitioners welcome a form of cosmopolitan dance to construct their national identity as a soft resistance, and differentiate themselves from a Chinese identification. This study strives to clarify salsa practices by non-Westerners, which is rarely discussed in dance scholarship; it examines the non-theatrical foreign dance form in Taiwan, a subject neglected in the growing scholarship on Taiwanese cultural criticism. Last but not least, this study illustrates how Taiwanese salsa dancers embrace cosmopolitanism to complete their national identity, whereas people from the rest of the world embrace cosmopolitanism in addition to their national identity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62298855, "asset_id": 42158179, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 8141599, "first_name": "I-Wen", "last_name": "Chang", "domain_name": "tnua-tw", "page_name": "IWenChang", "display_name": "I-Wen Chang", "profile_url": "https://tnua-tw.academia.edu/IWenChang?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/8141599/4258412/21503657/s65_i-wen.chang.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 5676, "name": "Choreography", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choreography?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8225, "name": "Taiwan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Taiwan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1824623, "name": "Salsa Dance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Salsa_Dance?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 30081592, "title": "Voices of Dissent from the Japanese Youth (Draft)", "created_at": "2016-11-24T23:08:34.672-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30081592/Voices_of_Dissent_from_the_Japanese_Youth_Draft_?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_30081592", "summary": "Japan  has often been considered  by the rest of the world as an orderly country without much civil unrest. As evidence of that, Prime Minister Abe speech promoting Tokyo for the 2020 Olympic Games emphasized the  fact that the city was one of the safest in the world. However, dissatisfaction amongst Japans youth has frequently appeared in my  ethnography.  How  can  this  dissatisfaction  coexist  with  the  image  of  cohesion  and obedience that Japan sustains? In order to elaborate on this topic, this paper  introduces narratives from the dissatisfied youth in Japan that, due to seeing no prospect of change in  the  country,  have  opted  out  of  Japan  altogether,  preferring  to  live  their  lives  in countries  they  see  as  fitting  their  lifestyle  best.  More  than  discussing  this  phenomena through  the  lenses  of  class  privileges,  this  paper  also  sees  the  issues  surrounding  the choices   made   by   the   dissatisfied   young   Japanese   not   so   much   as   a   source   of cosmopolitan  subjectivity,  but  instead  as  a  condition  made possible  by  a  neoliberal ideology.  Such  ideology  commodifies  identities  and  notions  of  belonging,  shaping  the way the Japanese youth deal with dissent into more consumer oriented logics than those of  collective  politics  and  mobilization.  It  is  this  shift  from  the  citizen  to  the  consumer that, this paper argues, is behind the choice for escape rather than change.

Sahota\u2019s writings emerge from a young but remarkably dynamic literary subgenre of British Asian literary fiction which surged onto the literary scene in the wake of Salman Rushdie\u2019s Midnight\u2019s Children (1981).  Sahota\u2019s work is set in Sheffield; his debut novel, Ours are the Streets (2011), which clinched him a place on the Granta Best of Young British Novelists list, was inspired by the 7/7 bombings and narrated the disaffection of Imtiaz Raina, a would-be suicide British bomber of Pakistani ancestry; his second novel, The Year of the Runaways, was shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker Prize. Sahota\u2019s novels stand as a critique of cosmopolitanism, portraying a \u2018crisis of conviviality\u2019 (Georgiou 2017) within the metropolis. In ways that will be detailed through close reading of Ours are the Streets, Sahota\u2019s 2011 novel mediates and explores the opacities and inconsistencies of present cosmopolitan experiences, anachronistically highlighted by the United States presidential election of Donald Trump in 2016 and the current post-Brexit cultural shock. This failed cosmopolitan conviviality is deeply tied up with issues around political literacy and class, as well as intolerance and Islamophobia, which have given rise to new-old forms of right-wing extremisms invested in combating neoliberal globalism (visible, for example, in the manifesto of the Traditionalist Worker Party in the US). The Trump election and Brexit, which came after the publication of Ours Are the Streets, should be situated in the same cultural-political milieu that brought in the \u2018crisis of conviviality\u2019 that Sahota details in the novel. In effect, these events can be interpreted as mainly an angry, white and downwardly social mobile response not only to the perceived hypocrisy of neoliberal politics (anti-establishment politics combined with the argument that transnational corporate free trade has not served anyone but corporations and their shareholders), but also the failure of cosmopolitan conviviality (the alleged \u2018flatness\u2019 of ostensible cosmopolitanism and political correctness, the protectorate and corrosive product of the liberal left).

Selma bears witness to key turning points in a troubled period, namely the fall of empires, rise of nationalism, and world wars. Her life story provides insight to cataclysmic events, and its retelling in an errant narrative which weaves in female experiences that have been silenced. There is a link between the shifts in places and those her inner self undergoes. Moreover, the presence of dance as a means of self-expression makes an apt point in discussing the development of Selma's identity. This paper traces the ways in which the novel represents exilic spaces and their female experiencing through focus on displacement and practices of dance. By juxtaposing the themes of exile, movement and dance this paper highlights the complexity of the narrative and the circuitous forms of displacement. \nS\u00fcrg\u00fcnde Vals: Keniz\u00e9 Mourad'\u0131n Saraydan S\u00fcrg\u00fcne adl\u0131 roman\u0131nda s\u00fcrg\u00fcn ve kad\u0131n \u00d6z Keniz\u00e9 Mourad'\u0131n Saraydan S\u00fcrg\u00fcne (1987) adl\u0131 roman\u0131 Selma ad\u0131ndaki Osmanl\u0131 prensesinin iki d\u00fcnya sava\u015f\u0131 aras\u0131nda k\u0131talar, k\u00fclt\u00fcrler ve ba\u015fkentleri kat eden (\u0130stanbul, Beyrut, Badalpour ve Paris) hikayesini konu al\u0131r.

research documents the educational strategies of international migrants to Shanghai who are attempting to raise their children as cosmopolitans through immersion in local Chinese schools. We distinguish this localizing educational strategy from the established network of international schools designed to serve the families of corporate expatriates. Instead, our research subjects consist of self-initiated expatriates, or \u2018middling transnationals\u2019, who have chosen to prioritize immersion in the language and culture of China by sending their children to local schools. This localized, or Sinocentric, model exposes non-Chinese children to a challenging and nationalistic Chinese curriculum. Our analysis of these practices as a form of cosmopolitan education challenges both the goal of teaching a universal and placeless ethical cosmopolitanism and the assumption that a meaningful cosmopolitan education must take place in the idealized setting of a liberal cosmopolitan school system. We also highlight the difficulties families face in this approach, describing this as an \u2018entangled cosmopolitanism\u2019, an enriching but uncomfortable engagement with both local and home-country educational cultures.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35432951, "asset_id": 9145354, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37716, "first_name": "James", "last_name": "Farrer", "domain_name": "sophia", "page_name": "JamesFarrer", "display_name": "James Farrer", "profile_url": "https://sophia.academia.edu/JamesFarrer?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37716/139011/104714857/s65_james.farrer.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 767, "name": "Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 974, "name": "Sociology of Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Education?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 5035, "name": "Comparative & International Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_and_International_Education?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 9578, "name": "Cosmopolitan Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Urbanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 12108, "name": "China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/China?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 45472, "name": "Expatriates", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Expatriates?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 62336, "name": "Kwame Anthony Appiah", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kwame_Anthony_Appiah?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 105797, "name": "Third Culture Kids", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Third_Culture_Kids?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 204571, "name": "Shanghai Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shanghai_Urban_Studies?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 391206, "name": "Education in China", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_in_China?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 952760, "name": "Actually Existing Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Actually_Existing_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 986275, "name": "Cosmopolitan Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Citizenship?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 8837870, "title": "Call for Papers - International Review of Information Ethics, Vol. 23 06 2015:  (Digital) Global Citizenship", "created_at": "2014-10-18T00:10:25.685-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/8837870/Call_for_Papers_International_Review_of_Information_Ethics_Vol_23_06_2015_Digital_Global_Citizenship?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_8837870", "summary": "Globalization via the digital age is upon us, demanding a new ethics and an intercultural awareness while the dialectics of globalism and cyberspace mandate a committed reflection on what the synthesis between the digital realm and global citizenship entails. In many ways, the borders that previously separated us as citizens physically and culturally have begun to dissipate, replaced by a call for an intercultural accountability and a form of global citizenship that, on one hand, surpasses borders, patriotism, and nationalism alike, but while on the other, demands an understanding and respect for the cultural idiosyncrasies among us, acknowledging the unique existential paradox of universal citizenship that posits each of us as both stranger and citizen on a commonly shared globe.\r\n\r\nWhat is cosmopolitan in the digital age? Is a global digital citizen the same as merely a digital citizen? While talk of digital citizenship has increased in recent years, usually centered on a capitalist drive, encouraging a full electronic participation in society and a responsibility to digital commerce, many questions remain unanswered.  Is the netizen the citizen of a democratic state, and of digital democracy? As a citizen of the world interacting online, how will one\u2019s \u201crights\u201d and \u201cduties\u201d be determined? And are these \u201crights\u201d universal, and in such a case, what does \u201cuniversal\u201d mean? What are the legal parameters of netizenship, and what will they be as globalization further takes hold? Is democracy critical to citizenship, or is it not? What are the political landscapes of global citizenship in the digital age? And last of all, is the concept of digital citizenship even tangible? Is it real?\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35178471, "asset_id": 8837870, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1776652, "first_name": "Jared",

This feeling is based on the shared history and mutual purpose for the future, which stand on solidarity and feeling of unity in a certain group. However, nationalism can often be used as justification for national fanaticism that sacrifice the interests of other groups or other nations. A new interpretation of nationalism in the cosmopolitan era is needed, where interdependence between nations and groups become a concrete and factual reality, and at the same time, the consciousness that human as an integral part of universal order is increasing. This article is an effort to place nationalism in the cosmopolitan framework, which puts highest importance on struggle to create tolerance, solidarity and social equality. Abstrak Nasionalisme menyediakan dasar bagi rasa cinta dan bakti kepada tanah air. Dasarnya adalah kesamaan sejarah dan visi ke masa depan yang berpijak pada solidaritas dan perasaan kesatuan di sebuah kelompok. Namun, nasionalisme bisa dengan mudah menjadi fanatisme terhadap sebuah bangsa, dan dijadikan pembenaran untuk merugikan bangsa lain. Paham ini tentu perlu mendapatkan tafsiran ulang di masa kosmopolitan, seperti sekarang ini, dimana keterkaitan antar bangsa menjadi semakin nyata, dan pemahaman baru tentang kewargaan semesta terus berkembang. Tulisan ini merupakan sebuah upaya untuk menempatkan nasionalisme dalam bingkai kosmopolitanisme, dimana toleransi, solidaritas dan kesetaraan sosial menjadi semakin penting untuk diperjuangkan. A nationalist is a person who loves his or her country. The development of national values and the realization of national objectives are seen as something fundamentally important in life. This love of nation is based on a sense of solidarity and unity, which are created through shared history and mutual vision of the future. It can also help during the challenging times, such as wars, conflicts and other forms of crises. However, the world in 21 st century cannot be understood merely as a collection of independent nations.

Accounts provided by historians done with dissecting the dynamics of religious change note the presence of multi-lingual and mobile mediators, who have been described as \"inbetweeners\", who were adept at importing new ideas\u23afincluding ways of dealing with the divine. Commerce across the Indian Ocean both before and after the rise in European presence centred on ports where being different was normal. Pre-colonial port-cities produced ethnolinguistical \u201ccreole\u201d or \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d communities whose comfort with ethnoreligious diversity is lamentable scarce in present-day South and Southeast Asia. This paper considers the role of \u201cmobile mediators\u201d and \u201cinbetweeners\u201d in the importation of a range of Islamic movements in Thailand. I make suggestions about the personalities and processes through which ideas espoused by Imam Al-Ghazali (1058\u20131111), Sheikh Ahmad Ibn Idris (1760-1837), and Muhammad \u2018Abduh (1849-1905) become known in Thai/Malay Peninsula. I describe the contributions and discuss the identity of local luminaries including Shaykh Ahmad al-Fatani, Ishmael Lutfi Japakiya, Direk Kulsriswasd, and Conrad Laurens Coolen to the spread of mystical, modernist, reformist, and revivalist Christian and Muslim movements.

Drawing on authentic discursive data from a highly mobile individual, I nuance the claims often made in the literature about the transformative potential of new cosmopolitan subjectivities. I use the lens of language, and in particular, of discourses about multilingualism and heteroglossia, to examine the extent to which old categories and fixities co-exist and articulate with more fluid conceptions of language and linguistic diversity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52280198, "asset_id": 32013986, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1276692, "first_name": "Eva", "last_name": "Cod\u00f3", "domain_name": "uab", "page_name": "EvaCod\u00f3", "display_name": "Eva Cod\u00f3", "profile_url": "https://uab.academia.edu/EvaCod%C3%B3?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/1276692/1134921/38447108/s65_eva.cod_.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 25886394, "title": "Liberal Multiculturalism and the Principle of Partiality", "created_at": "2016-06-05T08:59:31.390-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/25886394/Liberal_Multiculturalism_and_the_Principle_of_Partiality?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_25886394", "summary": "The aims of this thesis are the normative insights we gain from combining the two separate discussions in political philosophy - on liberal multiculturalism and on the partialities towards relevant political targets (co-nationals, co-citizens, non-citizens). This merge provides a refinement of the notion of partiality, which I believe to be raw in the treatment of many authors, and it opens up significant issues about the scope of justice defended by liberal multiculturalism. \n\tThe latter provision opens up two central issues of the thesis: 1.) Do the public institutions that follow principles of liberal multiculturalism manifest illegitimate attitudes of co-national partiality?; 2.) Do the public institutions that follow principles of liberal multiculturalism manifest illegitimate attitudes of co-citizen partiality, while ignoring members of disadvantaged societal cultures outside state borders? To the first questions I answer in the negative, while I offer a conditional \u2018yes\u2019 for to the second one.\n\tThe thesis is divided in four parts. The first two sections deal with laying out the terrain and preparing the merging of the relevant concepts. In section 1, I refine the principle of partiality to differentiate between co-nationals and co-citizens, as well as individual and institutional partiality. In section 2, I describe the characteristics of liberal multiculturalism and existing attempts to balance it with models of global justice. Section 3 deals with the first central issue, showing that the institutions of liberal multiculturalism are impartial towards ethnocultural groups by applying group-differentiated rights. Section 4 deals with the second central issue by showing that the scope of justice needs to be extended to societal cultures outside state borders, but also that we should justify prioritizing inner societal cultures on instrumentalist grounds.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46251877, "asset_id": 25886394, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2790193, "first_name": "Viktor", "last_name": "Ivankovi\u0107", "domain_name": "ifzg", "page_name": "ViktorIvankovi\u0107", "display_name": "Viktor Ivankovi\u0107", "profile_url": "https://ifzg.academia.edu/ViktorIvankovi%C4%87?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2790193/912962/57779905/s65_viktor.ivankovi_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 809, "name": "Analytic Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Analytic_Philosophy?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 813, "name": "Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Philosophy?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 814, "name": "Ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethics?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 4568, "name": "Liberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberalism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 7125, "name": "Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Culture?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 9676, "name": "Political Institutions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Institutions?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 9870, "name": "Distributive Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Distributive_Justice?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 11721, "name": "Equality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Equality?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 18373, "name": "Moral Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Moral_Philosophy?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 23534, "name": "Individualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Individualism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 66045, "name": "Will Kymlicka", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Will_Kymlicka?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 101303, "name": "Political Liberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Liberalism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 158368, "name": "Cosmopolitanism and Communitarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism_and_Communitarianism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 976476, "name": "Liberal Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberal_Multiculturalism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1119590, "name": "Partiality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Partiality?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 45407754, "title": "\"From Indigeneity to Spirit Murder\" V (2016/7) 2021", "created_at": "2021-03-07T04:37:31.794-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/45407754/_From_Indigeneity_to_Spirit_Murder_V_2016_7_2021?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_45407754", "summary": "Fifth in a series of seven extensive scans of indigeneity and related issues:\n\"From Indigeneity to Spirit Murder\"\n \nCompiled and annotated By Peter Emanuel Franks  (2016/7) 2021\n\nThis series of scans together form a somewhat holistic montage of the phenomena concerned with and surrounding Indigeneity, cosmopolitanism, nationalism, internationalism, and everything in between. \n\nRather than pushing a particular view, the montage attempts to cut off all avenues that attempt to simplify  the complexity of the phenomena under discussion by ignoring certain realities and exaggerating others. Rather the aim is to extend the comprehension of the possibilities and prevent premature totalisation. In short we are deliberately blocking a diversion into ideological simplification by providing disturbance, actual  evidence and sometimes even truth, expanding our views. The aim is to foster inclusive dialogue and conversation concerning the phenomena, rather than to distort our analysis in order to persuade people to our comfortable position, whatever that is. The aim is to unnerve the complacency in whatever form.\n \nThe entire series is a work in progress\n \nProf. Peter E.

"summary": "Based on thematic content analysis of textbooks, curricula, and an overview of educational legislation after the 1989 change of political regime in Romania, this paper presents empirical evidence to argue that that post-socialist citizenship education displays surprising similarities with converging post-war changes in the concept of the \u2018good citizen\u2019. The findings suggest a complex picture of change combining liberal, communitarian and cosmopolitan renditions of the new citizen, all having a common thread: the shift towards a post-national ethos de-linking the citizen from the exclusive purchase of national belonging and decoupling citizen action from the absolute duty to the patria. Such significant changes are often overlooked due to the dominant focus on the failures to comply with an idealized Western liberal model. However, they invite us to reconsider current understandings of both the pitfalls and the opportunities of post-socialist citizenship education by considering them from a different angle: that of wider socio-cultural change that is gradually being institutionalised at the world level.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 32838111, "asset_id": 5831826, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 47926, "first_name": "Simona", "last_name": "Szak\u00e1cs-Behling", "domain_name": "gei", "page_name": "SimonaSzak\u00e1csBehling", "display_name": "Simona Szak\u00e1cs-Behling", "profile_url": "https://gei.academia.edu/SimonaSzak%C3%A1csBehling?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/47926/14874/13886/s65_simona.szak_cs_behling_.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4992, "name": "Global Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Citizenship?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9490, "name": "Education for Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_for_Citizenship?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 22665, "name": "Post-Socialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Socialism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 82379, "name": "Citizenship Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship_Education?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 99297, "name": "Active Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Active_Citizenship?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 298157, "name": "Cosmopolitanism and Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism_and_Globalization?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 986275, "name": "Cosmopolitan Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Citizenship?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 81639968, "title": "Richard Rorty, Liberalism and Cosmopolitanism", "created_at": "2022-06-16T11:13:14.404-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/81639968/Richard_Rorty_Liberalism_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_81639968", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87614753, "asset_id": 81639968, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9646095, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "McClean", "domain_name": "newark-rutgers", "page_name": "DavidMcClean", "display_name": "David E .

Most contemporary commentators have concurred that cosmopolitanism as a form of ethical practice is associated with a conscious openness to the world and the potential for a relational dialogue with people and things that are culturally different (Delanty, 2009; Hannerz, 1990; Thompson and Tambyah, 1999). The cosmopolitanism question is essentially whether or not people develop feelings of solidarity and responsibility for widening circles of strangers, seek to understand and be changed by incorporating others\u2019 viewpoints and practices which are apparently unlike their own, and feel responsible for environments far away from them (Appiah, 2007; Cheah, 2006; Stevenson, 2002). \n\nWhile researchers currently grapple with the abstract philosophical dimensions of the concept, they also seek to understand how everyday, vernacular forms of cosmopolitanism work, and how people acquire and learn cosmopolitan competencies and habits (Woodward and Skrbis, 2013). In this context, it is not an exaggeration to observe that consumption opportunities and practices constitute a large part of people\u2019s engagements with diversity and cultural difference (Germann Molz, 2011). But, in what ways does this consumption matter to diffusing cosmopolitan cultures, and in what ways might it complicate them, or even deform them? And, in what ways can scholarship from diverse disciplinary perspectives work with each other to shed light on these questions? \n\nThe purpose of this book is to examine the consequences of cosmopolitan ideals and cosmopolitanisation processes for consumption and market practices on a global scale. By discussing not only the positive side of cosmopolitanism but also the problems and challenges related to it, this book takes an informed, critical look at issues and practices of cosmopolitan consumption and markets. The goals of the book are to: \n\u2022\tproduce a collected work of high scholarly quality that has an enduring impact on the way researchers understand and conceptualise the cosmopolitan possibilities of consumption \n\u2022\tbe the first major collection to frame and directly address controversies and questions around the relationship between consumption and cosmopolitan ethics\n\u2022\tdevelop a cross-disciplinary research conversation for understanding how consumption practices and processes relate to cosmopolitanism, in what ways they might or might not contribute to cosmopolitan processes and through what symbolic, cultural and economic processes this occurs", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38943846, "asset_id": 16324997, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 35474322, "first_name": "Julie", "last_name": "Emontspool", "domain_name": "southerndenmark", "page_name": "JulieEmontspool", "display_name": "Julie Emontspool", "profile_url": "https://southerndenmark.academia.edu/JulieEmontspool?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/35474322/10303823/11498155/s65_julie.emontspool.jpg"}, {"id": 103798, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Woodward", "domain_name": "southerndenmark", "page_name": "IanWoodward", "display_name": "Ian  Woodward", "profile_url": "https://southerndenmark.academia.edu/IanWoodward?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/103798/28575/811426/s65_ian.woodward.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 211, "name": "Sociology of Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_Culture?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 957, "name": "Cultural Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Sociology?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 9578, "name": "Cosmopolitan Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Urbanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 13666, "name": "Consumer Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Culture?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 17597, "name": "Consumer Culture Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Culture_Theory?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 24536, "name": "Consumer Research", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Research?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 25552, "name": "Consumption and Material Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumption_and_Material_Culture?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 31221, "name": "InterCultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/InterCultural_Studies?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 114661, "name": "Cultural Omnivore Thesis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Omnivore_Thesis?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 952760, "name": "Actually Existing Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Actually_Existing_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 1122591, "name": "Consumer Behaviour", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Behaviour?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 82276687, "title": "The Whiteness of Internationalization in Japanese Higher Education: Examining the Contradictions", "created_at": "2022-06-27T17:34:19.232-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/82276687/The_Whiteness_of_Internationalization_in_Japanese_Higher_Education_Examining_the_Contradictions?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_82276687", "summary": "The ongoing project of internationalization (kokusaika) in Japan's higher education sector has been examined from numerous different perspectives and agendas over recent years.

In 2012, an \u2018Expert Panel on Asylum Seekers\u2019 was established to provide advice to the Australian government about how to deal with the increasingly embarrassing issue of asylum seekers drowning at sea and a parliamentary stalemate on the matter. Using frame analysis to understand how national and post-national identities are being recruited in this debate, this paper analyses submissions to the Panel. We demonstrate how arguments for and against asylum seekers are constructed around nationalism, regionalism and globalism (cosmopolitan). Australia was variously framed as having an alternative national character from that promoted by politicians, as having a key regional role, and hence identity, and as a global citizen (both in reality and in appearance).

An important precondition for citizens to become critically involved in the public debate about an IO is that they are aware of the politics of that IO. This article sheds light on this largely unexplored issue, asking why some citizens are more aware of IOs than others. This question is examined in the context of a powerful international organization, the United Nations Security Council. A multilevel analysis of citizens in seventeen Asian and European countries suggests that citizen knowledge about the Council is shaped by citizens\u2019 individual income, cosmopolitan identity, and income inequality. Higher levels of knowledge are found among the wealthier, and there is some evidence that income inequality depresses knowledge among poorer citizens. Furthermore, citizens identifying with groups or individuals across nation-state borders are more likely to be aware of the Council. The article sketches broader implications for the study of the politicization of IOs and citizen representation in the public contestation of IOs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44042619, "asset_id": 23630592, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 30666221, "first_name": "Lisa", "last_name": "Dellmuth", "domain_name": "su-se", "page_name": "LisaMDellmuth", "display_name": "Lisa Dellmuth", "profile_url": "https://su-se.academia.edu/LisaMDellmuth?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/30666221/12111070/60855583/s65_lisa_m..dellmuth.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3345, "name": "International organizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_organizations?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10344, "name": "International Politics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Politics?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 85197, "name": "International Political Economy, Knowledge Economy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Political_Economy_Knowledge_Economy?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 153660, "name": "Political Knowledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Knowledge?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 198937, "name": "Politicization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Politicization?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 461635, "name": "United Nations Security Council", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/United_Nations_Security_Council?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 2430359, "name": "Public opinion toward international organizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_opinion_toward_international_organizations?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 12624446, "title": "Muslim Cosmopolitanism", "created_at": "2015-05-27T02:48:24.523-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12624446/Muslim_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_12624446", "summary": "Critical Muslim is a great forum for airing critical, contested issues within the orb of Islamic studies.

We employ a cosmopolitan encounters framework to explore the reflexive openness people perform and the ethical reasoning they draw on to get along with each other. In particular, we look beyond pleasurable cosmopolitan pursuits to consider encounters that cause frictions or require notable efforts to bridge differences as an occasion for cosmopolitan conviviality. Based on qualitative interviews conducted in Australia, we aim to sharpen the demarcation between cosmopolitan encounters and those in which diversity is strategically negotiated by enacting practices of civility. We argue that cosmopolitanism emerges from interactions in encounters between individuals when they reflect on their positionality within unequal power relationships and their actions are guided by a cosmopolitan ethics. The ethical framework we propose is grounded in reflexive acts of sharing going beyond notions of giving and performing hospitality within a host/guest dyad.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 103798, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Woodward", "domain_name": "southerndenmark", "page_name": "IanWoodward", "display_name": "Ian  Woodward", "profile_url": "https://southerndenmark.academia.edu/IanWoodward?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/103798/28575/811426/s65_ian.woodward.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 8400, "name": "Cultural Encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Encounters?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 9578, "name": "Cosmopolitan Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Urbanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 14787, "name": "Reflexivity  (Sociology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reflexivity_Sociology_?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 16069, "name": "Critical Race Theory and Whiteness theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory_and_Whiteness_theory?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 28235, "name": "Multidisciplinary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multidisciplinary?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 33323, "name": "Intercultural Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Competence?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 33562, "name": "Intercultural dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_dialogue?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 188521, "name": "Cosmopolitan ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_ethics?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708"}, {"id": 953669, "name": "Routledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Routledge?f_ri=120708"}]}, {"id": 75326561, "title": "Our City, Your Crisis: The Baloch of Karachi and the Partition of British India", "created_at": "2022-04-03T09:04:27.443-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/75326561/Our_City_Your_Crisis_The_Baloch_of_Karachi_and_the_Partition_of_British_India?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_75326561", "summary": "ABSTRACT This essay approaches the Partition of British India through the perspective of the Baloch inhabitants of Karachi, who locate the city at the centre of diverse political geographies and cultural lineages.

Their narratives demonstrate how Partition spelled the end of certain forms of socio-political life in the city, while reaffirming others.

Developing intercultural communication skills demands more than living in a multicultural international environment; explicit intercultural education is needed. This paper describes a project that defined intercultural competence and translated it into intended learning outcomes for &amp;#39;Language and Culture&amp;#39; courses at our liberal arts college. One of the intended learning outcomes is stated as: &amp;#39;A student has the tools needed for the ongoing reflection on intercultural contact and the further development of intercultural skills in general&amp;#39;. The biggest challenge was to integrate explicit intercultural education in courses at the introductory level, where students are absolute beginners in the target language. Relevant questions were whether to use the target language exclusively or to make use of the class language (in our case English), and language proficiency would be affected if we dedicated less time to language acquisition. The model discussed was developed for the course Introduction to Italian Studies, which aimed to combine language instruction with intercultural reflection.

The educational training and socialization of the informants has taught them to be 'global citizens' of the world as most of them will serve in key bureaucratic and administrative positions in Pakistan and abroad. By virtue of their training in an elite university, these young men were participating in a cosmopolitan version of Pakistani culture. The spectrum of meanings that international food chains, brands outlets and technological gadgets may have for young Pakistanis provides insights into the meaning and significance of the process of cosmopolitanism. Understandings of such things as McDonalds, for example, may change considerably depending on the socioeconomic class of the individual and the particulars of cultural context. Whereas McDonalds currently carries working class connotations in most western settings, in Pakistan McDonalds has somehow obtaineda status symbol and is mostly consumed by upper or upper-middle class people who are located on the 'westernized'/ 'modernized' end of Pakistan's social spectrum. In this paper, we elucidate what 'being cosmopolitan' entails in Pakistani cultural context by distinguishing between consuming cosmopolitanism, living like a global citizen and understanding cosmopolitanism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68634137, "asset_id": 50765671, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20928741, "first_name": "Tayyaba", "last_name": "Tahir", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "TayyabaTahir1", "display_name": "Tayyaba Tahir", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/TayyabaTahir1?f_ri=120708", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20928741/25540691/24259550/s65_tayyaba.tahir.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 277793, "name": "Elite cultures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Elite_cultures?f_ri=120708", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 40999155, "title": "Becoming Bridge Figures: Reimagining the valued citizens on the United Korean Peninsula through young North Korean migrants' narratives", "created_at": "2019-11-20T08:56:08.540-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40999155/Becoming_Bridge_Figures_Reimagining_the_valued_citizens_on_the_United_Korean_Peninsula_through_young_North_Korean_migrants_narratives?f_ri=120708", "dom_id": "work_40999155", "summary": "In South Korea, the number of North Korean migrants has rapidly been growing since the mid-1990s.

In practice, however, most policies are based on assimilation and focus on aggressive nationalism. Also, there are issues of cultural violence such as collective beliefs and attitudes that serve to legitimize enmity. As a result, young North Korean migrants have faced challenges of adapting and settling into the Korean society. The focus of this study is to reimagine citizenship education for building sustainable peace in the future unified Korean peninsula through accomplishing social integration and looking at citizenship education as a tool for nurturing young North Korean migrants to become the valued citizens, namely, bridge figures.

While cities such as Cairo, Fez, and Istanbul have been researched extensively as urban centres of modernity in the Middle East and North Africa, marked by the colonial conditions that characterized their modernity, very little has been said about Tehran and its development as a metropolis in the early twentieth century. This paper aims to explore urban modernity and processes of urbanization in Tehran in the first three decades of the twentieth century, through an investigation of the space of cinema and films featured on cinema screens.\nBy the early twentieth century, Tehran had become a commercial, artistic, and political hub for residents from diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic persuasions who shaped a cosmopolitan urban culture. Cinemas, owned and operated by cosmopolitan merchants became sites of sociability for the urban public. Housed in the most prestigious streets of Tehran, movie houses configured the urban fabric of the city, giving rise to some districts that became centres of socialisation, critical thinking, and entertainment for many decades to come. Within such diverse social and cultural conditions, Persian-language film productions came to envision this rapidly-changing city onscreen. Drawing on everyday city experiences, films such as, Mr. Haji: The Cinema Actor, became a public medium through which criticisms were made against societal and urban transformations. Thus, while mediating public sentiments associated with the urban, cinema became engaged in processes of urban modernity.

Literary expressions, as aestheticized acts of verbal communication, involve self-gratification through the required participation of other actual or virtual subjects and thus include a rhetorical persuasive component. They are the result of a certain amount of labor, both anterior and present, and necessarily seek some return of a material and/or psychological nature. Public readers, especially those of the professional kind (teachers, critics, translators, editors and publishers), practice forms of literary expressions that are marked by an apparent secondariness and the greater visibility of labor, capital acquisition and expenditure, all of which requires special compensation, often in the form, deviant or not, of socioeconomic power, peer recognition, honors and authority over the learners. My concern is with the space-time frames in which the public literary reading function can be institutionally performed in the contemporary world and the years to come \u2014insofar as there is still any place for it. Such space-time frames are in part given and coercive, but they can also be chosen, recognized or denied, accepted or rejected, manipulated and reinvented: here lie the responsibility and, more generally, the answerability of the comparatist mind's workings, of its limitations and the opposition or reticence it meets from within and without. In the cultural, economic and political space that we crudely call \" the West, \" a brutal but productive simplification would allow us to record some kind of continuity of the comparative mind between ancient, medieval, pre-modern and modern times, between traditional or semi-traditional cultural configurations and their innovation-driven successors, insofar as sense and value were not supposed to be absolutes but determined by the relation established with a separate intertext; but modernity, in its principle, shifts the emphasis from temporal to spatial parameters, from filiation to vicinity or the lack of it. This spatialization, also observed in \" modern literature, \" is concomitant with a double territorialization process of assertion of national sovereignty, on the one hand, and the deleting of borders by globalization, on the other. Defensive ideologies of exclusion, not unfrequently combined with expansive suprematist ideologies, fall back on the often forged continuities, autonomy and purity of a single language and culture. Comparative Literature, in this case, negates the other within the self, places it exclusively outside and uses the supposed difference of the other as a means to make the national difference, its autonomy, more salient and dignified. This binary attitude is now better known in the guise of \" Orientalism, \" but it was and remains also pervasive in the explicit or implicit comparison of \" national \" European literatures between them and in endeavors to draft continental literary histories (along geographic or linguistic lines). Assimilative universalism is but another form of appropriative, not appropriate cognition of \" the other \" that negates its raison d'\u00eatre for itself. In all these cases, comparison, if it is practiced at all, is performed from a single location, be it that of the comparatist or that of his/her (other) object of study at the moment; or yet an overarching position exalts a place of origin instead of transcending it.

Post-nationalism is mobilising conceptions of global governance and an increased interest in transnational and cosmopolitan constructions of the self and of imagined global communities (appadurai 1996; velayutham 2007:6). Having evolved in several countries, cultures and nations, Third Culture Kids (TCKs) and other serial migrants relate to the post-national discourse, and to the idea of feeling \u2018international\u2019. Yet, as Ossman (2013) argues, state borders still play a central role in identity construction processes. The border-crossing imperatives of TCKs mobile lifestyle mean that distinct nations come to compose the different chapters of one\u2019s life history. \n\nTCK identity construction is marked by mobility. In this chapter, different aspects of this mobility, namely affect, liminality, and networks, will be used to explore 1) how the accumulation of the diverse versions of themselves constructed in each homeland defines participants\u2019 identity as \u2018globals\u2019, 2) how this process of identity construction affects their position as migrant and their sense of home and belonging. The data presented here emerges from 18 months of multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork in and around the communities of two International Baccalaureate (IB) schools in Melbourne, Australia and in Singapore. I will demonstrate that identity construction and conception of home and culture are inherently intertwined, and participants\u2019 sense of belonging is mostly felt towards others with whom they share a similar life trajectory. In the field of mobility, the maintenance of select transnational social networks \u2013 through digital technologies and frequent travel \u2013 exposes the struggle over the capacity to access and maintain \u2018network capital\u2019 amongst people aspiring to be part of the global elite.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 11658037, "first_name": "Gabrielle",

In Frankfurt, the original epicentre of this particular school of thought, this has however come to an end. Contemporary Frankfurt theorists essentially have abandoned the sociological and descriptive dimension and re-casted what is left of the Frankfurt School into a subdivision of Anglo-American analytical political philosophy. As apparent from the book under review and his entire oeuvre, Hauke Brunkhorst, the last of the Mohicans of real Frankfurt style critical theory, have always resented this development. He has therefore found himself in internal exile at the University of Flensburg, the intellectual equivalent of Siberia in the German academic context, for the last decades. The exceptionally brilliance of the book under review thereby confirms the old insight, which has been illustrated again and again throughout history, that the best books tend to be written in exile. Written by authors who did not correspond with the prevailing Zeitgeist but who nonetheless choose to stick to their guns.\r\nThe book literally begins by the dawn of man and ends with an analysis of the pressing problems and challenges characterizing contemporary society. As such the book also reads as a history of the world in its entirety at the same time as the its main focus is on four revolutionary processes: The Papal Revolution of the 11th and 12th centuries, the Protestant revolution of the 16th century; The Atlantic Revolution of the late 18th century and the Euro-Asian (in particular but not only the Chinese and Russian revolutions) of the early 20th century. Finally, as a fifth wave, the global transformations which came about through decolonisation and the transitions from authoritarianism and totalitarianism to democracy and human rights in the latter half of the 20th century are analysed.

The novel is based on the story of transformation of an expat Pakistani living in New York from a true cosmopolitan to a nationalist. The article will explore the crisis of identity suffered by the protagonist in a new land where he reached as an immigrant student and worker. However, he experienced a resurgence of nationalist and patriotic sentiments within him as 9/ 11 happened in 2001. The force of American nationalism that was imperial in nature, resulting in the invasion of Afghanistan and Iran, triggered resentment in the protagonist who decided to leave America and went back to the country of his origin, Pakistan. During his stay in America, the protagonist\r\nredefined fundamentalism as an imperial tendency in the American system while rejecting the accusations hurled towards him of an Islamic fundamentalist. The article will explain that there is a loss of cosmopolitan virtue in the post 9/11 era and the dream of universal peace and harmony is shattered due to unbridled state ambitions to invade foreign territories. The article will conclude with the assertion that the loss of cosmopolitanism and reassertion of national identities give way to confrontation and intolerance destroying the prospects of peace and harmony in a globalized world.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36368811, "asset_id": 10290444, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3042463,

"dom_id": "work_75907599", "summary": "Current literature tends to see cosmopolitan identity formation as an individual endeavour of developing a stance of openness, and transcending discourses of national and other cultural identities. This article challenges the essentialism inherent in this model by proposing a different framing of cosmopolitan identity formation that shifts the focus to how people collectively mobilize cosmopolitanism as a resource for cultural identity construction. The article is based on an anthropological study of transnational professionals who are part of a diverse expatriate community in Amsterdam. The analysis shows how these professionals draw on cosmopolitanism to define themselves as \u2018non-nationals\u2019.

I pay special attention to the human (im)mobilities mediating these processes. This critical thinking exercise confirms that the relationship between place, collective identity and socio-cultural processes of identification is a contested aspect of social theory.

"One of the main institutional goals at a European international liberal arts college is to create graduates who are world citizens. In that context, there has been a shift towards explicit intercultural education through language and culture courses, with a foreign language requirement serving as 'a window on a different culture'. Developing intercultural communication skills demands more than living in a multicultural international environment; explicit intercultural education is needed. This paper describes a project that defined intercultural competence and translated it into intended learning outcomes for 'Language and Culture' courses at our liberal arts college. One of the intended learning outcomes is stated as: 'A student has the tools needed for the ongoing reflection on intercultural contact and the further development of intercultural skills in general'. The biggest challenge was to integrate explicit intercultural education in courses at the introductory level, where students are absolute beginners in the target language. Relevant questions were whether to use the target language exclusively or to make use of the class language (in our case English), and language proficiency would be affected if we dedicated less time to language acquisition. The model discussed was developed for the course Introduction to Italian Studies, which aimed to combine language instruction with intercultural reflection.

philosophers of the late twentieth century. Known primarily for his attacks on truth and the idea that knowledge is a \u2018mirror of nature\u2019, his contribution as a humanist and a great moralist has been overlooked by recent scholarship. McClean re-evaluates Rorty\u2019s work in the light of his liberal cosmopolitan outlook, showing how it can be applied to a range of social and political issues, including international terrorism, religious fundamentalism, neo-liberalism, sexual politics and business culture. \n\nhttp://www.pickeringchatto.com/titles/1773-9781848934894-richard-rorty-liberalism-and-cosmopolitanism ", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35322616, "asset_id": 9012287, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 9646095, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "McClean", "domain_name": "newark-rutgers", "page_name": "DavidMcClean", "display_name": "David E .
