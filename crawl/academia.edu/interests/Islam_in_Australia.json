In Australia, now a multi-cultural and multi faith society, a range of organisations exist to facilitate this dialogue, most coming in to existence after the 1960\u2019s This paper will review the early dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims as portrayed in the public record. It covers pre and post-Colonial Australia, up until the 1950\u2019s. As inter-faith dialogue becomes more important in an increasingly global society, it will examine the effect that micro and meso level dialogue has influenced social harmony at some levels. By examining the public record and the narratives surrounding the Macassans, Afghans and other early Muslims, this paper will firstly argue that micro and meso dialogue prior to the 1950s\u2019 between Muslims immigrants and non-Muslims made a contribution to the social harmony in Australia.

Interestingly, extremist Muslim groups in the West make similar claims about the relationship between Islam and the West. In recent years, however, Western-born \u201cmoderate\u201d Muslim intellectuals and moderates have emerged into the public sphere to challenge essentialist depictions of Islam and the Islamist textual interpretations. They claim an important social space for the Western practice of Islam. Whilst a burgeoning level of academic scrutiny is being focused upon moderate Muslims, this article notes the absence of academic literature about a large part of the Muslim population whose public life is not necessarily guided by their religion but more by their culture and ethnicity, i.e. the \u201ccultural Muslims\u201d. This group is unrepresented in the public debate on Islam and often ignored yet could constitute the majority of Western Muslims.

The ubiquitous Aly is a veritable Renaissance man--he is a television\npresenter, radio host, academic and rock musician. He is also a former lawyer, and served on the executive committee of the Islamic Council of Victoria. In short, he is the 'go-to 'Muslim for\ncommentary on a wide range of political and civic affairs. This article argues that Aly's media profile and celebrity status have as much to do with an Australian cultural imaginary that posits\n'whiteness ' as an uncontestable normative value as it does with Aly's undoubted skills as a journalist, academic and cultural commentator. It examines Aly's career with reference to Ghassan\nHage's concept of 'whiteness ' as a form of aspirational cultural capital and various theories of persona and performativity. For Hage, 'whiteness' is not a literal skin colour; rather, it consists of\nelements that can be adopted by individuals and groups (such as nationally valued looks, accents, tastes, cultural preferences and modes of behaviour). While entry to what Hage calls Australia's\n'national aristocracy ' is generally predicated on possessing the correct skin tone, it is theoretically possible for dark-skinned people such as Waleed Aly to enter the field of national belonging and\npartake in public discourse about a range of topical issues. More specifically, the article substantiates its claims about Aly's status as a member of Australia's cultural aristocracy through a\ncomparative discourse and performance analysis of his presentation of 'self' in four distinctive media contexts: Channel 10's The Project, the ABC RN Drive program, ABC TV's Q&A and the SBS\ncomedy-talk show Salaam Cafe, which looked at the 'funny side of life as an Australian Muslim ' and showcased other multi-talented Muslim professionals of both genders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39511054, "asset_id": 16806849, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2928268, "first_name": "Glenn", "last_name": "D'Cruz", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "GlennDCruz", "display_name": "Glenn D'Cruz", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/GlennDCruz?f_ri=12979", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2928268/1188397/10818343/s65_glenn.d_cruz.jpg"}, {"id": 36335701, "first_name": "Niranjala", "last_name": "Weerakkody", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "NiranjalaWeerakkody", "display_name": "Niranjala Weerakkody", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/NiranjalaWeerakkody?f_ri=12979", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 6527, "name": "Celebrity Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Celebrity_Culture?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12979, "name": "Islam in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Australia?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 64041, "name": "Public Intellectuals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_Intellectuals?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 124826, "name": "Journalism And Mass communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Journalism_And_Mass_communication?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 134694, "name": "Media and Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Communications?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 143565, "name": "Australian media", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_media?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 395704, "name": "Communication and media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communication_and_media_Studies?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 1223711, "name": "Contemporary Muslim society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Muslim_society?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 1563984, "name": "Persona Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Persona_Studies?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 2180203, "name": "Waleed Aly", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Waleed_Aly?f_ri=12979"}]}, {"id": 1630415, "title": "Young Muslims of Australia: Anatomy of a Multicultural Success Story", "created_at": "2012-06-07T12:26:41.759-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/1630415/Young_Muslims_of_Australia_Anatomy_of_a_Multicultural_Success_Story?f_ri=12979", "dom_id": "work_1630415", "summary": "Across Europe, multiculturalism has been said to have \u2018failed\u2019 because it creates \u2018ghettoes\u2019 of Muslims that are actively undermining democratic principles. Hostility to state policies of multiculturalism and Muslim settlement are increasing rapidly. Australia too, has seen Muslims viewed with suspicion and subjected to severe forms of surveillance and social pressure to show loyalty to the nation and Australian \u2018values\u2019. In the same period Australian multiculturalism has faced sustained attacks, being challenged on its ability to foster integration and loyalty from citizens, especially Muslims. In recent times, the political tide has started to turn. Australian Muslims are increasingly making their voices heard and politicians from all of the major parties are committing to multicultural policies as a core tenet of Australian nation building (despite continuing attacks from the far right). This is due in no small part to the work of creative and innovative grassroots community groups, a vast body of academic research examining these groups and issues of social inclusion and exclusion. However despite this extensive research, one major contributor of pivotal significance has slipped under the radar. Young Muslims of Australia (YMA) based out of a small Northern suburban Melbourne Mosque has not sought any public recognition for its work, yet has contributed to the development of an entire generation of Australian Muslim political and cultural leaders playing an active role in shaping the development of Australian multiculturalism and Islam. The group has even had an impact internationally.

In particular, we seek to learn how existing Muslim organisations address the collective needs of Muslim migrants in Adelaide. We include interviews with service providers, representatives and religious leaders, as well as field notes during visits to organisations and the public events that these groups hosted around Adelaide in 2008. \n\nOur report considers different forms of social capital in relation to Muslim community development and service provision. This concept is used to examine the power dynamics in negotiations of social and economic exchange among different Muslim organisations and other groups, including mainstream service providers and government officials. Our study finds that many newly arrived Muslim migrants do not understand the breadth of government-sponsored services available to them, and so they largely rely on a couple of the smaller and widely trusted Muslim community organisations for all of their needs, rather than approaching mainstream organisations for specialised services. \n\nWe suggest that an asset-based community development (ABCD) approach would strengthen the social network ties and resources both within and external to the Muslim organisations studied. The ABCD framework is an evaluation methodology which first identifies the social and material capacities that presently exist within particular organisations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 27128688, "asset_id": 1903748, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 921983, "first_name": "Zuleyka", "last_name": "Zevallos", "domain_name": "swinburne", "page_name": "ZuleykaZevallos", "display_name": "Zuleyka Zevallos", "profile_url": "https://swinburne.academia.edu/ZuleykaZevallos?f_ri=12979", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/921983/8220080/9196817/s65_zuleyka.zevallos.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3474, "name": "Community Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Community_Development?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5745, "name": "Social Capital", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Capital?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6697, "name": "Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australia?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6699, "name": "Australian society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Australian_society?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 12978, "name": "Muslim Minorities", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslim_Minorities?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 12979, "name": "Islam in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Australia?f_ri=12979"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=12979"}]}, {"id": 9337994, "title": "Role of Islamic study circles in shaping the identity of Australian Muslim  youth ", "created_at": "2014-11-16T09:15:42.523-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9337994/Role_of_Islamic_study_circles_in_shaping_the_identity_of_Australian_Muslim_youth?f_ri=12979", "dom_id": "work_9337994", "summary": "2014 CILIS Islamic Studies Postgraduate Conference\n\nRole of Islamic study circles in shaping the identity of Australian Muslim youth.

Against this backdrop, this article explores the ways in which religiosity informs the everyday acts of citizenship through which young Muslims challenge dominant narratives of citizenship. Drawing on an ethnographic study of two Melbourne-based Shia youth groups, I look at the subjective accounts of multicultural\ncitizenship that youth group members shared in the course of the groups\u2019 weekly activities.

The paper concludes with an outline of the nature of the Islamic influence in Australia, a western nation in which Islam is one of the fastest growing religions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30893534, "asset_id": 2927218, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 999988, "first_name": "Wendy", "last_name": "Smith", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "WendySmith", "display_name": "Wendy A Smith", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/WendySmith?f_ri=12979", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/999988/1155618/1447263/s65_wendy.smith.jpg"}, {"id": 21431, "first_name": "Gary", "last_name": "Bouma", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "GaryBouma", "display_name": "Gary Bouma", "profile_url": "https://monash.academia.edu/GaryBouma?f_ri=12979", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/21431/1060688/1324384/s65_gary.bouma.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12979, "name": "Islam in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Australia?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 140943, "name": "Islamic ethics in the work commitment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_ethics_in_the_work_commitment?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 239534, "name": "Human Resources Management in Managing Diversity and Cultural Differences in Global Organizations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Resources_Management_in_Managing_Diversity_and_Cultural_Differences_in_Global_Organizations?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 258137, "name": "Managing cultural diversity in the workplace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Managing_cultural_diversity_in_the_workplace?f_ri=12979"}]}, {"id": 38373488, "title": "THE EARLY HISTORY OF MICRO AND MESO DIALOGUE BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND NON-MUSLIMS IN AUSTRALIA", "created_at": "2019-02-17T16:38:55.123-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/38373488/THE_EARLY_HISTORY_OF_MICRO_AND_MESO_DIALOGUE_BETWEEN_MUSLIMS_AND_NON_MUSLIMS_IN_AUSTRALIA?f_ri=12979", "dom_id": "work_38373488", "summary": "Interfaith dialogue has been touted as a means to solve many of the religious divisions that have arisen in an increasingly global and multifaith society. In Australia, now a multicultural and multi-faith society, a range of organisations facilitate this dialogue, most coming into existence after the 1960s. This article reviews the early dialogue and interactions between Muslims and non-Muslims (interfaith) as portrayed in the public record. It covers pre- and post-colonial Australia, up to the 1950s. As interfaith dialogue becomes more important in an increasingly global society, it examines how micro and meso level dialogue has influenced social harmony. By examining the public record and narratives surrounding the Macassans, Afghans and other early Muslims, this article first argues that micro and meso dialogue prior to the 1950s between Muslims immigrants and non-Muslims contributed to social harmony in Australia. Second, despite many attempts by Muslims, meso level dialogue was often ineffective and sometimes failed for a variety of reasons. This points to the need for further research to paint a complete picture of the levels of dialogue between Muslims and others throughout Australian history.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58427874, "asset_id": 38373488, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 66363952, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Sneddon", "domain_name": "acu-au", "page_name": "DavidSneddon", "display_name": "David Sneddon", "profile_url": "https://acu-au.academia.edu/DavidSneddon?f_ri=12979", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/66363952/22416095/21853084/s65_david.sneddon.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 12979, "name": "Islam in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_Australia?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 38097, "name": "Interfaith Dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interfaith_Dialogue?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3138008, "name": "Religion in Australia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion_in_Australia?f_ri=12979", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 78016666, "title": "Islam in Australia: A National Survey of Muslim Australian Citizens and Permanent Residents", "created_at": "2022-04-29T23:50:13.445-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/78016666/Islam_in_Australia_A_National_Survey_of_Muslim_Australian_Citizens_and_Permanent_Residents?f_ri=12979", "dom_id": "work_78016666", "summary": "This article presents the findings of a national survey on Islam in Australia based on responses of 1034 Muslim Australian citizens and permanent residents.

As the grandson of late Ottoman Mufti, being educated at the American Academy, a Baptist missionary school in Cyprus, clashed at times with his traditional upbringing based on Islam, service and Ottoman patriotism. \u0130brahim\u2019s parents, especially his mother, raised their son to be Osmanli Efendisi, an Ottoman gentleman. He was raised to be loyal to his faith and dedicated to his community. I met him in the late 80s in Sydney. I discovered that he was an important community leader, a \u2018living history\u2019, perhaps the most important figure in the Australian Muslim community since the mid-20th century. He is also one of the founders of the Carlton and Preston Mosques, which are the first places of worship that survived till today in Victoria. I wrote his biography and published it in 2010. However, later I found that he had more stories related to Australian Muslim heritage.   Firstly, this essay will analyse his untold stories which is from \u0130brahim\u2019s unrevealed archives that I collected. Secondly, \u0130brahim\u2019s traditional upbringing which is a combination of western education and Ottoman Efendisi will be critically evaluated. He successfully amalgamated Eurocentric education and Islamic way of life. Finally, his poetry which reflects his thoughts will be discussed.
