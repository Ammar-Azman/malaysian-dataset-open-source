One such group is the Eurasian \u201cIndo\u201d community that has its roots in the former Dutch East Indies, today\u2019s Indonesia. This article focuses on Tjalie Robinson, the intellectual leader of this community from the 1950s to the mid-1970s. The son of a Dutch father and a British-Javanese mother, Robinson became the leading voice of the diasporic Indo community in the Netherlands and later also in the United States. His engagement resulted in the foundation of the Indo magazine Tong Tong and the annual Pasar Malam Besar, what was to become the world\u2019s biggest Eurasian festival. Robinson played an essential role in the cultural awareness and self-pride of the eventually global Indo community through his elaboration of a hybrid and transnational identity concept. By placing his focus \u201ctussen twee werelden\u201d (in-between two worlds) and identifying \u201cmixties-schap\u201d (mestizaje) as the essential characteristic of Indo identity, Robinson anticipated debates on hybridity, transnationalism, and creolism that only much later would draw attention from scholars in the field of postcolonial studies. This article highlights Robinson\u2019s pioneering role in framing a deterritorialized hybrid alternative to nationalist essentialism in the postcolonial era.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

This relationship is presented from multiple perspectives and the essays cover, amongst other themes, cosmopolitanization in everyday life, the mediation of suffering, trauma studies, and researching cosmopolitanism from a non-Western perspective. \nSome of the essays explore existing research and theory about cosmopolitanism and apply it to specific case studies; others attempt to extend this theoretical framework and engage in a dialogue with the broader disciplines of media and cultural studies. Overall, this variety of approaches generates valuable insights into the central issue of the book: the role played by the media, in its various forms, in either encouraging or discouraging cosmopolitanist identifications among its audiences.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 62182648, "asset_id": 42056618, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 42955, "first_name": "Aris", "last_name": "Mousoutzanis", "domain_name": "brighton", "page_name": "ArisMousoutzanis", "display_name": "Aris  Mousoutzanis", "profile_url": "https://brighton.academia.edu/ArisMousoutzanis?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/42955/13878/14160381/s65_aris.mousoutzanis.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 928, "name": "Media Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 934, "name": "Media and Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 134694, "name": "Media and Communications", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Media_and_Communications?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1196959, "name": "Globalisation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 68605240, "title": "THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE", "created_at": "2022-01-18T05:42:39.114-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68605240/THE_UNIVERSAL_HOUSE_OF_JUSTICE?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_68605240", "summary": "This chapter describes the significance of the Universal House of Justice for the development of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community as well as for the well-being of humanity as a whole.

The chapter then discusses how the House of Justice was first established in 1963 and the manner in which it is regularly elected. Finally, it considers the unique station of the House of Justice as well as the powers and duties it exercises in guiding the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds around the world in their efforts to apply the teachings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and promote the unity of humankind.

Edited by Leslie Alexander & Walter Rucker. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO,\u00a02010. Pp. 224\u2013227 (Vol. 1).  \n\nABSTRACT\n\nHistory remembers Alain Locke (1885\u20131954) as the first African American Rhodes Scholar (1907) and, more famously, as the \u201cdean\u201d of the Harlem Renaissance (1919\u2013 1934). Locke edited The New Negro (1925), acclaimed as the \u201cfirst national book\u201d of African Americans. In this way, Locke\u2019s role is analogous to that of Martin Luther King: whereas King championed the civil rights of African Americans through nonviolent civil disobedience, Locke did so through a process known as \u201ccivil rights by copyright.\u201d In the Jim Crow era, when blacks had no effective political recourse, Locke used the arts as a strategy to win the respect of the white majority and to call to their attention the need to fully democratize democracy and Americanize America by extending full equality to all minorities. \n\nRecent scholarship has brought Locke back to life, and his philosophy of democracy, in particular, lends him renewed importance. Harvard, Harlem, Haifa\u2014place names that represent Locke\u2019s special involvement in philosophy, art, and religion\u2014are keys to understanding his life and thought. Harvard prepared Locke for distinction as the first black Rhodes Scholar in 1907 and, in 1918, awarded Locke his PhD in philosophy, thus securing his position as chair of the Department of Philosophy at Howard University from 1927 until his retirement in 1953. Harlem was the mecca of the Harlem Renaissance, whereby Locke, as a spokesman for his race, revitalized racial solidarity and fostered the group consciousness among African Americans that proved a necessary precondition of the Civil Rights movement. Haifa is the world center of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, the religion to which Locke converted in 1918, the same year he received his doctorate from Harvard. Until recently, this has been the least understood aspect of Locke\u2019s life. \n\nDuring the Jim Crow era, at a time when black people saw little possibility of interracial harmony, this new religious movement offered hope through its \u201crace amity\u201d efforts, which Locke was instrumental in organizing. These three spheres of activity\u2014the academy, the art world, and spiritual society\u2014converge to create a composite picture of Locke as an integrationist whose model was not assimilation, but rather \u201cunity through diversity\u201d (the title of one of his Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed World essays).

Edited by Jay Parini. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004. Vol. 2, 177\u2013181. \r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nRobert Hayden was made poet laureate of Senegal in 1966 and ten years later became America's first black poet laureate. Acclaimed as \"People's Poet\" early in his career, later he was severely criticized for refusing to call himself a \"Negro poet,\" even though he wrote some of the most powerful \"black history\" poems in the English language. Hayden transcended the identity politics of what W. E. B. Du Bois called \"art as propaganda\"-something that elite African-American artists (the Talented Tenth) were expected to produce. On the principle that race divides while a higher identity unifies, Hayden presented himself as an American poet rather than as a black poet. His greatness is that he was really both, and that his art was a fusion music of the American experience. \r\n\r\nFor Hayden, craftsmanship was essential \u2014 a marriage between matter and manner, as Gwendolyn Brooks once described it. With missionary zeal, Hayden experimented with forms and techniques in an effort to arrive at what he characterized as something distinctively individual, patterned, yet wild and free. This even included expanding the language itself, with such neologisms as \"soulscape,\" \"snowlight,\" \"lifeswawk,\" \"mimosa's fancywork,\" and \"Absolute Otherwhere.\" The reader encounters such expressions as \"moonstruck trees,\" \"auroral dark,\" \"famine fields,\" \"jazzbo strutting of a mouse,\" \"totemic flowers,\" \"paleocrystic ice,\" \"elegiac lace,\" \"glaucous poison jewels,\" and \"blazonry of farewell scarlet.\" \r\n\r\nAdaptation was Hayden's primary method of innovation. Form flowed from content. Protean in his technique, Hayden employed a range of poetic and rhetorical devices to evoke each experience he sought to create. He was a virtuoso of rhythm, tonality, repetition, irony, oxymoron, paradox, and symbolism. Using sense to intensify, Hayden primarily relied on visual and auditory images. His gift for visual imagery grew out of his handicapped sight. Sensitivity to sound, tone, and cadence sprang from a keen sense of hearing, which Hayden developed to compensate for his poor vision. His work is full of dramatic tension, edged by irony, and tempered by religious emotions as echoes of the human spirit. \r\n\r\nAs an American shaman, Hayden was an oracle mediating between gods and mortals. His poetry was medicinal. On a personal level, it provided psychic therapy, self-medication. Although he was not a confessional poet, his reminiscence poems were cathartic. Those Winter Sundays is the best example; at a number of his readings, people in the audience would be brought to tears by it. On a social level, his poems promoted racial healing. \r\n\r\nThe first African-American poet laureate, Hayden was decidedly transracial in that role at the American bicentennial. This is poignantly exemplified in the deliciously wry title poem of his last book, American Journal, in which the poet assumes the mask of an extraterrestrial, reporting his anthropological observations of Americans to his superiors, the Counselors. More human than racial, Hayden truly was an \"alien, at home.\"\r\n\r\nSee also: Christopher Buck, \u201cRobert Hayden\u2019s \u2018[American Journal]\u2019: A Multidimensional

edited, contributed to literary and cultural exchanges between Great Britain and Italy. The paper will focus on two figures of this cosmopolitan set : Theodosia Garrow Trollope, and Helen Zimmern.  Theodosia Garrow was connected through her marriage to the highly cosmopolitan and literary Trollope family. In addition to editing  the Tuscan Athenaeum (1848-49) in Florence, she translated the writings of Italian patriots and reported on the ongoing revolution in Italy for the main British reviews. Helen Zimmern \u2013 sister of the suffragist Alice Zimmern -  was the editor of the Florence and Italian Gazette (1890-1907) and a prolific writer and translator. The paper will focus on their work as editors, and discuss the cultural transfers they facilitated, the transnational cultural space they helped create as well as the gender dimension of cosmopolitanism.\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46074162, "asset_id": 25725441, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 781011, "first_name": "Isabelle", "last_name": "Richet", "domain_name": "univ-paris-diderot", "page_name": "IsabelleRichet", "display_name": "Isabelle Richet", "profile_url": "https://univ-paris-diderot.academia.edu/IsabelleRichet?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/781011/264275/15953809/s65_isabelle.richet.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2324, "name": "British History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_History?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1284811, "name": "Exile and Expatriation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile_and_Expatriation?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2471441, "name": "British and Itaky", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/British_and_Itaky?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 27718025, "title": "Symbols of Cosmopolitan and Consumer Culture as Characteristics of Chick-Lit in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary", "created_at": "2016-08-11T18:47:40.418-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27718025/Symbols_of_Cosmopolitan_and_Consumer_Culture_as_Characteristics_of_Chick_Lit_in_Bridget_Jones_s_Diary?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_27718025", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 47986655, "asset_id": 27718025, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 28304363, "first_name": "Alex", "last_name": "Heath", "domain_name": "ryerson", "page_name": "AlexHeath", "display_name": "Alex Heath", "profile_url": "https://ryerson.academia.edu/AlexHeath?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/28304363/12044181/50102333/s65_alex.heath.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6325, "name": "Consumerism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumerism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10453, "name": "Feminism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Feminism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 13666, "name": "Consumer Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Consumer_Culture?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 20631, "name": "Popular Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Popular_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 21625, "name": "Chick Lit", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Chick_Lit?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 49209, "name": "Material Culture and Consumerism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Material_Culture_and_Consumerism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 300495, "name": "Bridget Jones' Diary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bridget_Jones_Diary?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1191042, "name": "Helen Fielding", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Helen_Fielding?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 471221, "title": "The ways of Aristotle: Aristotelian phr\u00f3n\u00easis, Aristotelian philosophy of dialogue, and action research", "created_at": "2011-03-11T01:39:35.848-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/471221/The_ways_of_Aristotle_Aristotelian_phr%C3%B3n%C3%AAsis_Aristotelian_philosophy_of_dialogue_and_action_research?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_471221", "summary": "\"Table of Contents / Pagination is incorrect:\r\nTHE WAYS OF ARISTOTLE \u2013 ARISTOTELIAN PHR\u00d3N\u00caSIS, ARISTOTELIAN PHILOSOPHY OF DIALOGUE, AND ACTION RESEARCH\r\nOlav Eikeland \r\nPreface\t1\r\nPART 1 \u2013 ARISTOTLE, SOCIAL RESEARCH, AND ACTION RESEARCH\t3\r\n1.

Edited by Seena Fazel and John Danesh. Los Angeles: Kalimat\u00a0Press, 2004. Pp. 94\u2013158.\n\nAfrican American philosopher Alain Locke is arguably the most profound and important Western Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed philosopher to date. Except for one 1979 article in a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed periodical, scholarship on Locke has neither seriously taken into account his Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed identity nor the Faith\u2019s influence on his work. The present study, based largely on archival sources, contributes to research on this \u201cmissing\u201d dimension of Locke\u2019s complex life and thought. It examines Locke\u2019s worldview as a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, his secular perspective as a philosopher, and the synergy between his confessional and professional essays. This study also argues that Locke had a fluid hierarchy of values\u2014of loyalty, tolerance, reciprocity, cultural relativism and pluralism (the philosophical equivalent of \u201cunity in diversity\u201d)\u2014and that this hierarchy represents a progression and application of quintessentially Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed ideals. Locke\u2019s distinction as a \u201cBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed philosopher\u201d may therefore be justified on ideological as well as historical grounds. Locke \u201ctranslated\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed ideals \u201cinto more secular terms\u201d so that \u201ca greater practical range will be opened up for the application and final vindication of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed principles\u201d in order to achieve \u201ca positive multiplication of spiritual power.\u201d", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56547014, "asset_id": 4332734, "asset_type":

an old phenomenon. The last decade alone has marked the highest number of migrations in recorded history. Constrained by environmental, economic, and political instability, scores of people are on the move. But other sorts of changes\u2014from global tourism to undocumented labor\u2014have led to the fact that to some extent, we are all becoming migrants. The migrant has become the political figure of our time.\r\n\r\nRather than viewing migration as the exception to the rule of political fixity and citizenship, Thomas Nail reinterprets the history of political power from the perspective of the movement that defines the migrant in the first place. Applying his \"kinopolitics\" to several major historical conditions (territorial, political, juridical, and economic) and figures of migration (the nomad, the barbarian, the vagabond, and the proletariat), he provides fresh tools for the analysis of contemporary migration.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38817088, "asset_id": 15329910, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

The much longer history of colonial experience makes Kerala\u2019s engagement with modernity polyvalent and complex. Without understanding the multiple space-times of this region, it is impossible to make sense of the complexities of Kerala modernity beyond its general description as \u2018Malayalee modernity\u2019.\r\nFrom the colonial pepper trade and Narayana Guru\u2019s philosophical engagement with the question of caste, to the seemingly disparate elements that weave together an \u2018eclectic past\u2019  through the Muziris Heritage Project; from the debates on women\u2019s sexuality around the Suryanelli rape case, to the gendered constitution of public space during the mass annual Attukal Pongala ritual; from the changes in state attitude towards providing piped water supply to how Cochin port\u2019s inter-War history has scripted the story of urban modernity; from the shaping of the public sphere to the radical Left politics of the 1970s and the emergence of popular janapriya literature\u2014this book analyses the ideas, spaces and practices that intricately weave the region\u2019s experiences of modernity.\r\nKerala Modernity emphasizes the methodological need to re-examine the idea of \u2018region\u2019 as a discursive category to explore Kerala\u2019s regional modernity apart from Eurocentric and nation-centric frames of analyses. The interdisciplinary presentation\u2014complete with a Dalit critique of modernity in the Foreword\u2014will be an important contribution to literature on Kerala and the debates on alternative modernities in South Asia. It will be of interest to students and scholars of history, sociology and literary and cultural studies, as well as the interested general reader.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nList of Tables, Figures and Map\r\nFOREWORD : Gopal Guru \r\nAcknoweldgements\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION / Situating an Unbound Region: Reflections on Kerala Modernity\r\n     Satheese Chandra Bose and Shiju Sam Varughese \r\n\r\nCHAPTERS\r\n 01.

The intensification of globalizing processes across the course of the twentieth century redoubled the urgency of working this through. Whether it was the debates in Parliament of the World\u2019s Religions over a possible Western bias or the postmodern move to destabilize all foundations of ethical certainty, older lineages of philosophy and ethics were drawn into debates over the meaning of a global ethics.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this essay outlines important lineages and debates in global ethics. The second part of this essay, explores the philosophical and social foundations of a sense of global connectedness, beginning with Plato\u2019s allegory of the cave and moving across some basic positions from Emmanuel Kant to Martin Heidegger. The third section, \u2018Towards an Ethics of Global Relations\u2019, begins with a discussion of a philosopher writing in the 1970s who is still working out of a national framework, John Rawls. Because his work becomes so significant for a series of abstracted cosmopolitans who later take on a global remit, there can be no better starting point for illustrating the movement from the dominance of a national imaginary to a global imaginary.

The novel is also, however, a story about environmental and social injustice in a postcolonial space, about people massacred or forcefully evicted from what they consider their homes on the grounds of a dubious environmental policy. On all levels of the story, the forces of the global interact powerfully with the local, be that in ecological, economic, or cultural terms. The paper argues that in contrast to state dependency on global capital and disconnection from the local, the development of what ecocritic Ursula Heise describes as an eco-cosmopolitan consciousness allows those characters in the novel who evince it a deeper understanding of and connectedness with one other and with their natural environments. The Hungry Tide reminds us that cosmopolitanism can, in the last instance, not be meaningful without also being eco; and while an eco-cosmopolitan awareness cannot necessarily guarantee survival in the face of natural forces or unscrupulous governments, it does help fostering a deeper sense of meaning and solidarity.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35963678, "asset_id": 9788177,

illuminates the shadowy world of dockside prostitution in South Africa, focusing on the women of Cape Town and Durban who sell their hospitality to foreign sailors. Dockside \"sugar girls\" work at one of the busiest cultural intersections in the world. Through their continual interactions with foreign seamen, they become major traffickers in culture, ideas, languages, styles, goods, currencies, genes and diseases. Many learn the seamen's tongues, develop emotional relationships with them, have their babies and become entangled in vast webs of connection. In many ways, these South African mermaids are the ultimate cosmopolitans, the unsung sirens of globalisation. Based on fifteen months of research at the seamen's nightclubs, plus countless interviews with sugar girls, sailors, club owners, cabbies, bouncers and barmaids, this book provides a comprehensive account of dockside \"romance\" at the southern tip of Africa. Through stories, analysis and first-hand experiences, it reveals this gritty world in all its raw vitality and fragile humanity. Sugar Girls & Seamen is simultaneously racy and light, critical and profound.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 80085277, "asset_id": 164944, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download":

The question of whether realistic and symbolic factors affect attitudes toward immigration is widespread in the literature. The current study looks at a symbolic aspect of immigration attitudes, cosmopolitanism, defined as the belief that immigrants enrich a country\u2019s culture, and seeks to find determinants of it. Results of multivariate linear regressions indicate that perceived, subjective income is a better predictor of cosmopolitanism than objective measures. When education is included, the effect of objective income becomes insignificant and subjective income security becomes smaller.

Throughout the 20th century the influence of his practical philosophy has been growing. His \u00abnon-modernist\u00bb concept of phr\u00f3n\u00easis or practical wisdom is attracting increasing interest as an alternative to both \u00abmodernism\u00bb and \u00abpost-modernism\u00bb. This book is a meticulous study of Aristotle's phr\u00f3n\u00easis and its applications to the fields of personal development or character formation and of ethical virtues. It also relates phr\u00f3n\u00easis to the wider context of Aristotle's theoretical philosophy and of his different ways of knowing, and to both theoretical and practical concerns within modern social and action research. The whole of Aristotle's thinking is radically practice-based and directed. However, it never loses its theoretical focus. His theoretical philosophy is fundamentally dialogical. Hence, the relevance of Aristotelian thinking is striking for the current reconfigurations in the social organisation of learning and knowledge production.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id":

Managed by Franciscans, is considered as a model for this previously written words about Italian architecture in Alexandria.\n\nOne can introduce this church as an icon of the Italian arts in the cosmopolitan Alexandria, its miscellaneous kinds of art works deserve a loyal documentation and analysis, some of these arts were designed especially for the church, they were not just a copy of similar arts around Italy; there is a proof in the analysis of the art works that the Italian artists and artisans were very aware of the different environment of Egyptian cities like Alexandria.\nWorth mentioning too, that most of the artists or workshops names in my researches were not documented in any of known references, but were all observed directly from each art work or rarely from some neglected dusty documents in a building's basement or roof,  just in case it was allowed to go here or there.\n\nObjectives\nIn these papers, I try to present the Sacred Heart Church to be seen and observed, not just as a religious building that was realized as an Italian model, but to be seen in its precious details, details that are really making the core of the Sacred Heart church, because one cannot imagine this church without its arts whether exteriorly and of course and above all interiorly, and also because \u2013 and maybe this is more important \u2013 the lack of maintenance of this spectacular Italian artistic heritage in Egypt, it is obvious for the professional architects and artists that these kinds of arts are in great need for a continuous maintenance, which is not available anymore and since a long time, the matter that is putting them in great danger.\nThis danger has became clearer after the departure of the Italian or foreign Franciscan fathers & monks, they were more acquainted with the spirit of arts in churches than their Egyptian successors who seem to be more ascetic concerning the function of visual arts in such places; thus the way of treating these kinds of arts, especially the small and transportable pieces is unfortunately unbecoming; from here, this paper is taking its importance.\n\nKey words\nAlexandria \u2013 Egypt - Italian \u2013 architecture \u2013 arts \u2013 stained glass \u2013 mosaics \u2013 mural painting \u2013 sculpture \u2013 cosmopolitan \u2013 European \u2013 Mediterranean.\n\nResearcher contact\nhttp://www.facebook.com/zeinabnour.art\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55615986, "asset_id": 35741481, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 207521, "first_name": "Zeinab", "last_name": "Nour", "domain_name": "helwan", "page_name": "zeinabnour", "display_name": "Zeinab Nour", "profile_url": "https://helwan.academia.edu/zeinabnour?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/207521/228329/267154/s65_zeinab.nour.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1372, "name": "Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12537, "name": "Egypt", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Egypt?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 26558, "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Visual_Arts?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 214163, "name": "Alexandria", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alexandria?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 248112, "name": "Christianity and the Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Christianity_and_the_Arts?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 27912371, "title": "\u6279\u8a55\u5bb6\u30af\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1\u7cbe\u795e", "created_at": "2016-08-20T12:13:42.830-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/27912371/%E6%89%B9%E8%A9%95%E5%AE%B6%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%82%A6%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E3%83%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%83%83%E3%83%91%E7%B2%BE%E7%A5%9E?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_27912371", "summary": "Ernst Robert Curtius is well known as an advocate of European literature, which transcends national boundaries. Most importantly, he is recognized as a literary historian, who wrote European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages (Europ\u00e4ische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter, 1948). Nevertheless, Curtius published a lot of critical works during the inter-war years and after World War II. In order to consider the processes through which he developed a European spirit, I would like to focus on his literary critics concerning contemporary writers like Romain Rolland, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset. I pay particular attention to Curtius' network of friendships with these writers and try to reconsider the relation between his journalistic works and European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages.",

The book\u2019s concept is premised on a sense of belonging in a community of strangers; this comes from the firm conviction that theatre, by nature, prepares its audience to engage in a community which are both local and global. The vibrant Manila theatre scene is used as takeoff point in articulating this argument. The first part of the book provides a general picture of how cosmopolitanism is \u201cperformed\u201d by Filipinos. It investigates the specificity of Manila theatre as the site of the cosmopolitan experience. The second part is a series of analyses of plays that are about social issues while being realistic in their approach, but are, at the same time topicalized and editorialized\u2014much like television shows\u2014as social problems within the Philippine context against the massive backdrops of late capitalism and globalization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63804885, "asset_id": 42268585, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 228298, "first_name": "Sir Anril Pineda", "last_name": "TIATCO", "domain_name": "up-diliman", "page_name": "SirAnrilPinedaTiatco", "display_name": "Sir Anril Pineda TIATCO", "profile_url": "https://up-diliman.academia.edu/SirAnrilPinedaTiatco?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/228298/221369/4539877/s65_sir_anril_pineda.tiatco.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11354, "name": "Globalization And Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 73676, "name": "Cultural Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Globalization?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 488456, "name": "Contemporary Philippine Theatre", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Philippine_Theatre?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 516375, "name": "Contemporary Performance Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Contemporary_Performance_Practice?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1239582, "name": "Philippine Society and Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Society_and_Culture?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 2199773, "name": "Philippine Contemporary Arts", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philippine_Contemporary_Arts?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 40770652, "title": "Tolerance Principal Foundation of Cosmopolitan Society of Zanzibar (La Tolerancia d\u2019una cultura plural)", "created_at": "2019-10-28T16:11:11.731-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/40770652/Tolerance_Principal_Foundation_of_Cosmopolitan_Society_of_Zanzibar_La_Tolerancia_d_una_cultura_plural_?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_40770652", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 61050550, "asset_id": 40770652, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 122998062, "first_name": "Mohamed Ahmed", "last_name": "Saleh", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "SalehMohamedAhmed", "display_name": "Mohamed Ahmed Saleh", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/SalehMohamedAhmed?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/122998062/30914035/98205684/s65_mohamed_ahmed.saleh.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2089, "name": "Social Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Identity?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 10422, "name": "National Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/National_Identity?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 44466725, "title": "COSMOPOLITANISM IN HARD TIMES", "created_at": "2020-11-09T23:15:37.046-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/44466725/COSMOPOLITANISM_IN_HARD_TIMES?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_44466725", "summary": "This reference book provides the reader with an exhaustive array of epistemological, theoretical, and empirical explorations related to the field of cosmopolitanism studies.

In this unique contribution to conceptualizing, establishing, experiencing, and challenging cos-mopolitanism, each chapter seizes the paradoxical dialectic of opening up and closing up, of enlightenment and counter-enlightenment, of hope and despair at work in the global world, while the volume as a whole insists on the moral, intellectual, structural, and historical resources that still make cosmopolitanism a real possibility-and not just wishful thinking-even in these hard times.\n\nContributors include: John Agnew, Daniele Archibugi, Paul Bagguley, Esperan\u00e7a Bielsa, Estev\u00e3o Bosco, St\u00e9phane Chauvier, Daniel Chernilo, Vincenzo Cicchelli, Vittorio Cotesta, St\u00e9phane Dufoix, David Held, Robert Holton, Yasmin Hussain, David Inglis, Lauren Langman, Pietro Maffettone, Sylvie Mesure, Magdalena Nowicka, Sylvie Octobre, Delphine Pag\u00e8s-El Karaoui, Massimo Pendenza, Alain Policar, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ramel, Laurence Roulleau-Berger, Hiro Saito, Camille Schmoll, Bryan S.

Within this new scholarship, categories of migrancy are all seen through the same analytical lens. This book builds on, as well as critiques, past and present studies of mobility. In so doing, it challenges conceptual orientations built on binaries of difference that have impeded analyses of the interrelationship between mobility and stasis. These include methodological nationalism, which counterpoises concepts of internal and international movement and native and foreigner, and consequently normalises stasis. Instead, the book proposes a \u2018regimes of mobility\u2019 framework that addresses the relationships between mobility and immobility, localisation and transnational connection, experiences and imaginaries of migration, and rootedness and cosmopolitan openness. Within this framework and its emphasis on social fields of differential power, the various contributors to this collection ethnographically explore the disparities, inequalities, racialised representations and national mythscapes that facilitate and legitimate differential mobility and fixity. Although they examine nation-state building processes, the anthropological analysis is not confined by national boundaries.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33624535, "asset_id": 6955922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 33624543, "asset_id": 6955922, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2278, "first_name": "Noel B.", "last_name": "Salazar", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "NoelBSalazar", "display_name": "Noel B.

It is firmly established by historical experience that the human, as the subject of the former as well as the object of the latter, frequently interferes with the content of these concepts. If this intervention stems from ideological reasons, the implication is that the mechanism for providing legitimacy is involved with its focus on historiography. At this stage, the engine of historiography becomes an office for the approval of political power.\nWithin that context, the fictionalization of history transforms the knowledge of the past to a reproducible product. This understanding means a neglect of the motive to attain the reality of the past; instead, the aim is to become the social engineering required for the continuity of the ideology. In this concise text, alongside the ongoing philosophical debates as to what history is and how it should be laid out, the instrumentality of history in practical terms will be examined with a special focus on the Soviet Union paradigm.\nKeywords: Soviet historiography, Soviet nation-state, Territorial historiography, Soviet nationalism.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52788753, "asset_id":

Kant developed the universal right to hospitality in the context of late eighteenth-century colonialism. He claimed that non-European countries had a sovereign right over their territory and the conditions of foreigners' visits. This sovereign prerogative limited visitors' right to hospitality. The interconnected and complementary system of right he devised is influential today, but this article argues that maintaining the complementarity of the three realms involves reconsidering its application to contemporary immigration. It situates Kant's Perpetual Peace within the context of debates about conquest and colonialism and argues that Kant's strict conception of sovereignty is justified by his concern in maintaining a realm of sovereignty that is complementary with cosmopolitanism and his prioritization of mutual agreements in each of the realms, particularly in a context of international power asymmetry. In Kant's time, European powers appropriated cosmopolitan discourses to defend their right to visit other countries and it was necessary to strengthen non-Europeans' sovereign claims. The strength and hostility of the visitors made limited hospitality and strong sovereignty act in tandem to keep away conquerors, expanding cosmopolitanism. Today, individuals from poor countries migrate to wealthier ones where they are subject to a sovereign authority that excludes them. Sovereignty and cosmopolitanism no longer work complementarily, but rather strengthen powerful state actors vis-\u00e0-vis non-citizens subject to unilateral rule. Maintaining the pre-eminence of the right to freedom, the article suggests that only through the creation of \u2018cosmopolitan spaces\u2019 of politics can we reproduce today the complementarity that Kant envisioned.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35187257, "asset_id": 3792382, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3414476, "first_name": "In\u00e9s", "last_name": "Valdez", "domain_name": "osu", "page_name": "In\u00e9sValdez", "display_name": "In\u00e9s Valdez", "profile_url": "https://osu.academia.edu/In%C3%A9sValdez?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3414476/9594962/89012574/s65_in_s.valdez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 849, "name": "Kant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kant?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1198, "name": "Peace and Conflict Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peace_and_Conflict_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3843, "name": "Immigration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immigration?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 14730, "name": "Migration Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 16031, "name": "Immanuel Kant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immanuel_Kant?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 196885, "name": "Path to Perpetual Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Path_to_Perpetual_Peace?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 378616, "name": "Immanuel Kant Perpetual Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immanuel_Kant_Perpetual_Peace?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1019273, "name": "Colonialism and Imperialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism_and_Imperialism?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 599893, "title": "Education for democratic citizenship: a review of research, policy and practice 1995\u00962005", "created_at": "2011-05-19T17:52:05.424-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/599893/Education_for_democratic_citizenship_a_review_of_research_policy_and_practice_1995_2005?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_599893", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 51342051, "asset_id": 599893, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14615, "first_name": "Hugh", "last_name": "Starkey", "domain_name": "ioe-ac", "page_name": "HughStarkey", "display_name": "Hugh  Starkey", "profile_url": "https://ioe-ac.academia.edu/HughStarkey?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14615/4886/18603489/s65_hugh.starkey.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 922, "name": "Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1297, "name": "Democratic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratic_Education?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7413, "name": "Human Rights Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_Education?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9490, "name": "Education for Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_for_Citizenship?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 10722, "name": "Policy Development", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Development?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 56989, "name": "Latin America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_America?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 65835, "name": "Human right", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_right?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 77318, "name": "Primary School", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Primary_School?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 92599, "name": "Child Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_Rights?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 423532, "name": "Secondary School", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Secondary_School?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1453917, "name": "Policy Practice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Policy_Practice?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 15808852, "title": "Becoming cosmopolitan through traveling?

A number of \"cosmopolitanizing strategies\" are interrogated that position HRC concurrently within multiple registers: global, regional, and local. Examples of these crosscutting strategies include disruption, performance, and hybridization. The hybridity present in\r\nHRC, as a central cosmopolitanizing strategy, both incorporates but also reaches beyond the local.

This paper will give three examples of \"organic harmony\": Goethe and his idealistic morphology, Wilhelm von Humboldt's account of language, Herder's account of history. The thought of all three example key characteristics of \"organic harmony\": holism, particularism/perspectivism, and subjective judgment. This paper will show that Cassirer's own \"organic harmony\" is indebted to these thinkers. From the perspective of \"organic harmony\" we can make better sense of the pluralistic spirit of Cassirer's PSF as well as providing it with greater theoretical articulation. This paper also shows how the motif of organic harmony is the normative moment in his own challenge to 20 th c. fascism.

"work_42152103", "summary": "Although actively preparing for increased integration in the region in 2015, Thailand is often cited as one of ASEAN's most ethnically and linguistically homogeneous member. This article considers Javanese presence, and influence in Central Thai between the Ayutthaya period and early Bangkok period, asking whether Siam's captivation with Javanese cultural forms represent an anomaly or reflect Ayutthaya' cosmopolitan past. I begin by summarising references to Javanese presence in Ayutthaya and Bangkok in a range of primary and secondary sources. These confirm that, although located inland on a navigable river, Ayutthaya resembled the maritime city-states of the era. Drawing extensively on the work of Davisakd Puaksom, I consider the personalities and processes involved in the arrival, adoption, and adaption of the Javanese epic, Panji, best known in Thailand as Inao. Far from a cultural anomaly, I argue that Siam's Inao fetish is a reminder about the region's connectedness, and that Ayutthaya was strikingly similar to cosmopolitan Melaka.

consid\u00e8rent que l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du monde et de nos soci\u00e9t\u00e9s commande de rompre avec le \"nationalisme m\u00e9thodologique\" de la sociologie classique et de ses fondateurs, en vue de fonder une nouvelle sociologie cosmopolitique. Dans le m\u00eame temps, le regain d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat port\u00e9 en France \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e de Georg Simmel n\u2019aborde presque jamais directement l\u2019originalit\u00e9 et la pertinence de ses vues pour appr\u00e9hender les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes sociaux transnationaux. A cet \u00e9gard, on en reste encore bien souvent \u00e0 l\u2019embl\u00e9matique \"Excursus sur l\u2019\u00e9tranger\". Tout porte \u00e0 croire que le cosmopolitisme de la pens\u00e9e de Simmel, symbolis\u00e9 par ce texte, occulte la sociologie du cosmopolitisme \u00e0 laquelle il invite plus profond\u00e9ment par le reste de son oeuvre. Cet article propose alors une relecture de la Sociologie de 1908, ax\u00e9e en particulier sur le dixi\u00e8me et dernier chapitre, afin de montrer comment il est possible, contrairement \u00e0 ce que pense U. Beck, de prendre le cosmopolitisme pour objet et perspective d\u2019analyse sociologique sans pour autant rompre avec les traditions classiques de la sociologie, mais en restant au contraire fid\u00e8le \u00e0 la pens\u00e9e d\u2019un de ses plus \u00e9minents fondateurs.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 1924564, "asset_id": 409397, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 222801, "first_name": "G\u00e9r\u00f4me", "last_name": "Truc", "domain_name": "cnrs", "page_name": "G\u00e9r\u00f4meTruc", "display_name": "G\u00e9r\u00f4me Truc", "profile_url": "https://cnrs.academia.edu/G%C3%A9r%C3%B4meTruc?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/222801/50207/6528025/s65_g_r_me.truc.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 201, "name": "Political Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Sociology?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 209, "name": "Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Theory?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 11581, "name": "Classical Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Classical_Social_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 14782, "name": "Sociological Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociological_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 27258, "name": "Georg Simmel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georg_Simmel?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 42796544, "title": "Muslim AmeR\u00edcans: Puerto Rican Muslims in the USA and the Need for More Cosmopolitan Frames of Analysis in the Study of Islam and Muslim Communities in the Americas", "created_at": "2020-04-20T06:42:48.025-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/42796544/Muslim_AmeR%C3%ADcans_Puerto_Rican_Muslims_in_the_USA_and_the_Need_for_More_Cosmopolitan_Frames_of_Analysis_in_the_Study_of_Islam_and_Muslim_Communities_in_the_Americas?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_42796544", "summary": "This article seeks to contribute to the study of Islam and Muslims in Latin America and the Caribbean by considering broader geographies in the Americas and viewing these communities in light of hemispheric dynamics of movement, encounter, interaction, and exchange. This article seeks to do so in two distinct ways: first, by presenting the narratives of Puerto Rican Muslims\u2019 everyday cosmopolitan lives in the USA in the context of movement, migration, transnational connection, and solidarity between and across borders and boundaries in the Americas; second, by suggesting that telling such transnational tales not only expands our view of what it means to be Muslim in the Americas, but also that it helps broaden our understanding of what it means to be Muslim in a cosmopolitan age. To do so, this chapter highlights four different narratives from among Puerto Rican Muslims in the USA as a way to situate their significance in the narrative of Islam and Muslim communities in the Americas as a whole: first, that of Youssef Ali Abdullah in Staten Island; second, Danny Khalil \u201cal-Portorikani\u201d in Yonkers; third, the impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017 on the Puerto Rican Muslim community in the New York and New Jersey area as a whole; and fourth, through the story of the founding of Alianza Isl\u00e1mica in Spanish Harlem in the 1980s. These narratives were sourced during my fieldwork in New York City in summer 2016 and fall 2017 and as part of a broader ethnographic research project with Puerto Rican Muslims in the USA, in Puerto Rico, and online.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 63023698, "asset_id": 42796544, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 14026255, "first_name": "Ken", "last_name": "Chitwood", "domain_name": "iupui", "page_name": "KenChitwood", "display_name": "Ken Chitwood", "profile_url": "https://iupui.academia.edu/KenChitwood?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/14026255/4103765/31220951/s65_ken.chitwood.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 388, "name": "Latin American Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_American_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2793, "name": "Transnationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transnationalism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 15346, "name": "Puerto Rico", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Puerto_Rico?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 34165, "name": "The Americas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Americas?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 39436, "name": "Puerto Rican Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Puerto_Rican_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 56989, "name": "Latin America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Latin_America?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 159995, "name": "Am\u00e9rica Latina", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Am%C3%A9rica_Latina?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 233799, "name": "Puerto Ricans", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Puerto_Ricans?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 261499, "name": "Islam in the Carribean and Latin America", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam_in_the_Carribean_and_Latin_America?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 470271, "name": "Cosmopolitanization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanization?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 2561644, "name": "islam in latin america", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/islam_in_latin_america?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 9774519, "title": "Confronting the Stone Face: The Critical Cosmopolitanism of William Gardner Smith", "created_at": "2014-12-15T01:26:59.648-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9774519/Confronting_the_Stone_Face_The_Critical_Cosmopolitanism_of_William_Gardner_Smith?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_9774519", "summary": "Once believed to be on the verge of a great literary career, William Gardner Smith faded into obscurity after his death, and his work has received very little attention over the years from scholars of African American literature.

Not only is the novel one of few African American texts dealing with the complicated relationship of the black U. S. community in Paris to the so-called Algerian question; it is also an impressive exploration of the difficulties and complexities of intercultural understanding, and of the ways that cosmopolitan sentiments and attitudes are produced and expressed. Smith\u2019s little-known and underestimated novel deserves scholarly attention because it portrays the emergence of a critically cosmopolitan mind as the direct result of specific sociohistorical circumstances. It is important also because it challenges the supposed barriers between African American and postcolonial studies that scholars such as Paul Gilroy, John Cullen Gruesser, and others have declared unhelpful, encouraging us to see the crucial continuities between the two supposedly separate disciplines\u2014not least when it comes to the issue of cosmopolitanism.", "downloadable_attachments":

Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d\nMy Urban Legacy 15,482 words on 46 pages\nby Barie Fez-Barringten \nwww.bariefez-barringten.com\nIntroduction\n\nThesis and premises:\nHow many of you ever thought about urbanism (populate) as a culture (condition) or that urbanism could be cosmopolitan (universal)?\nThe title of these lectures is the \u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d because it aptly describes who we are and what we face. The sooner we understand our culture and its peculiar characteristics the sooner we can manage our lives and improve our living conditions. Increases in population and density culture our personal, family and business lives. We are cosmopolitan and urban as we agree, disagree, peruse common goals, tolerate stress and congestion, discern between community and privacy and distribute precious resources. For example, an urbanized person negotiates traffic, crowds, street signs, home mail delivery, and crowded places of public gatherings, ambulating, few stars due to bright skies, pollution, live entertainment, public transportation, and close proximity to neighbors. \nThe culture of cosmopolitan urbanism is both about those affected by population\u2019s dynamics and the way they are able to utilize these affects to facilitate further population growth. Like any culture it can be inherited and once experienced, it can be conveyed and inherited by others. It is the responsibility of persons that have been cultured by urbanism to convey that experience to others to preserve the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism.\n \nHow many have ever thought of themselves as being affected by their environment and that an urban background can affect the way you think and behave? \nCulture is the development of the intellect through training or education and the totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns including arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought. Dense population, crowds and opportunities breed specific kinds of social behavior and unique metaphors, which affect individual persons, families and institutions. These in tern conversely contribute to develop the social, cultural and built environment. It is a conversation between an increasing collective as they add and reject persons and institutions and the environment they form to support their individual and collective interests enabling us to mature, authenticate and develop our identity. We are one with our surroundings and expect them to perform. \n \nIn our time, we wonder what can be done to make the urbs feasible, livable, and desirable, what are the problems, and how can they be mitigated? \nSometime the problem looms before us. \n \nWhat can we do to make the urb everyone\u2019s identity, metaphor and home? \nI believe if we fit the city to the metaphors of the population and its diversity then more people will care and when more care, the city will greatly improve. After all, form should follow function, and the population will only care if the city is their metaphor. \n \nSo, who will do this and what can we do to foster urban quality?\nIs there one size fits all or are we already doing what\u2019s right by acclimating and adjusting to the variables of our demographics, geography, climate, and socio-political necessities?\n \nI believe when the A.I.A. asks, \u201cWhat can be done to make cities livable\u201d that the A.I.A. is taking responsibility for what they and others have neglected for several generations. I would put the question \u201cwhat can be done to make cities livable and worthy to be called home\u201d. \nThe Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d wants \u201clivability\u201d to be home.\n \nBut we don\u2019t always perceive our surroundings as home. Some would agree and others disagree that American rural, suburban and urban cities find themselves needing to mitigate the bad choices, carelessness and narrow vision of their past. Since I gave my fist lecture on metaphors and architecture at Yale University and established the Laboratories for Metaphoric Environments in New York City in 1970, I have watched as the rift widened between architects and planners and therefore cities further deteriorated. \nCan you identify any thing you do as having a particularly urban identity?\n\nThankfully, there are a few that simply love cities the way they are and accept the city with all there pros and cons, as a matter of fact the more the apparent contradictions, complexities and anomalies the better. \nIn these people are the seeds of hope but they are not usually the ones who take responsibility for shaping public policy, planning and design. \n \nHowever, without pride, a personal sense of ownership and overwhelming moral and ethical mind I have found that states and cities become corrupt, permissive and pedantic frustrating those that love and invest their identity in the city\u2019s metaphor and who believe their identity is authenticated and synonymous with the identity of the city and will accept most of any of its conditions. \n \nWhat is the one thing that we all want in our home?\nHowever romantic and interesting are war zones and circuses, man\u2019s interests cannot be nurtured and developed in such areas. We all agree that law and order by civilized behavior is desired and necessary. On the other hand, life is more than the maintaining law of order. \n \nFrom the farmhouse in Iowa to the penthouse in Manhattan, we all call our country, state, city, neighborhood, and community and house our home. It is the repository of all our metaphors, hopes and dreams. It is very precious, valuable and worthy of our attention despite the many who merely make a business and career out of profiting and policing agreements by consensus. \n \nI have learned that without passionate and urban educated professionals the choices presented is less often the better of two evils. And neither one of them engenders civic pride and ownership. In Florida, the problem is how to shift the pride away from a snowbirds city of origin to a persons\u2019 Florida home. For those in Florida where Florida is their home state, the problem is restoring and building their pride and interest in a quality city. As without a vision, a nation perishes so without a personal identity and affiliation of one\u2019s home we lose our initiative, creativity and authenticity. Already the implications have manifest themselves in avoidances and overwhelming acceptance of banality and boredom. Since form follows function, we all know we work harder for less and with limited choices. Our new gained affluence has provided us ways of maneuvering around in a very prescriptive and formulary life style. I believe, the more we have a point of view about this culture of cosmopolitan urbanism the more we can improve the way we live. \n\nSo, who\u2019s to blame?\nDespite the warnings, I find few that really care for the future and generations that will follow, I have seen many who believe that planning is really un-American, and look to destroy our past with little care for the future. Therefore, I believe it is the job of our institutions to educate and be the custodians of the urban metaphors, which will help us, choose and manage urban contexts. For years, learned journals have published my monographs on this subject and still universities and governments do not have a way of knowing the metaphors of their constituents save the markets of commercial developers and the public\u2019s reactions to infringements on their privacy. \n \nWhat can the individual do?\nI know that most are not in a position to choose large, medium or small urban contexts but rather to choose between rural and urban where these days\u2019 most non-agricultural families choose sub-urban or urban clusters. On the other hand, if one chooses an urban context we may find ourselves managing its renovation, expansion or reaping its benefits and failures. Weather and climate aside, I believe an urban person\u2019s first responsibility begins in choosing a city where he can find agreement and observe the qualities contributing to a better way of living. However, I observe that our society has come to rely on remedies and cures for everything hoping anything can be mitigated. \n \nDoes the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism make a difference?\nTake the extreme example of how New Orleanians persists in settling in below flood elevation areas as do homesteaders insist upon building in coastal flood areas. Such strong and determined will overcomes many natural obstacles and I have observed that in urban settings such people are a force for the right decisions. We can see the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism at work in the will that strives to overcome the inertia of the physical. The urban person strives to maintain the status quo. \n \nWhat is one of the ideals in any urban environment?\nAside from options and choices, our culture intuitively recognizes minimum standards that whatever the size, urban context is best balanced by a rural and undeveloped surround, which is often farming, mountains, forest, wetlands, or waterways. \n\nI believe it wrong when these lands are sub-urbanized reducing escape options and quality of life. It makes this new area subordinate to the urb and without its own identity. In this frustration and without a national policy I observe people continue to migrate to places where these choices are possible. I believe New Orleanians, as most urban places will be faced with arresting and reversing this very basic practice. As they do, urban densities will naturally increase and our culture will evolve a cosmopolitan set of values. \nWhat is the one word that means populating our surrounding land? \n \nAnd how does sprawl it affect us?\nSprawl dilutes personal identity\nWe already know that the sprawl of the city\u2019s structure and population damages urban lifestyle by adding time and expense to travel from the urb. For others, the only financially feasible option is the suburb because reasonable options are not locally available. So they surrender their urban for the sub-urban rather than downsize to a smaller urban. Such decisions are economically driven as mobile Americans find new employment, recreation, and business opportunities. I believe this is a disaster and while I am not in favor of birth control as a means of solving overpopulation, I am a believer in providing populations with quality urban contexts. \n \nThe problem has many vectors but because of population growth, immigration and migration urban mangers choose between permitting growth by new development on already platted urban and suburban land to accommodate that growth to consume undeveloped land. \n231\nWho are the parties that can correct the problem?\nIt is citizens, educators and elected officials who are both interested in our context that understand urbanism who make better choices. In the late eighties construction permitting came to a screeching halt when Lee county introduced concurrency legislation which required all developers to first develop supporting and affected infrastructure prior to adding faculties which would burden the existing areas. The results did not slow or curtail growth because developers were able to meet the requirements and pass the costs onto potential buyers. \n Has any one ever heard of concurrency legislation?\n\nBut concurrency only highlights how urban sprawl adds infrastructure instead of using existing. It also shows how, even with this condition many developers still prefer to exercise their business in rural counties than to build in urban centers. The important exceptions are New York City, Singapore, and Shanghai, which expedited developers in the building process. All of these cities were desperate to recover their lost income and contributing populations. While their decisions tapped into the existing city skyscraper and dense population, metaphors it brought people back into the city and away from the suburbs. \n\nMany of our \u201curbs\u201d that have sprawled now try to prevent growth by local town fathers following many European models, which keep the distance from the urb to the rural to a minimum. It is called \u201cno growth\u201d.\n \nI believe that this alone can stop sprawl and increase the quality of urban life. Many communities in New England practice this while others have lat the sprawl ooze out to connect many cities and form metropolitan areas; as a result, the urban clusters have deteriorated. \n217\nWhat is it that prevents leaders to change?\nWe do not convey our culture of cosmopolitan urbanism. \nHighly mobile and transient communities have lost their ability to manage urban cities, buildings, and neighborhoods within metropolitan urban areas so that no one values their social, iconic and economic contribution to the balance and opportunity that citizens needs to thrive and grow. All because we do not have a vision and will for our urbs and continue to allow our lands to be absorbed by aggressive private real estate interest. I am all in favor of real estate as a business as I my self was once a Texas real estate brokers. But in our highly transient society, it is up to individuals and their institutions to be the surrogate and agent for society\u2019s social ethos. Functional neighborhoods can be either victim or hero to combat the social and economic deterioration that contributes to the use of illegal drugs, crime, family separations and a much lower quality of life. \n\n\n\n\nExisting urban cities, buildings, and neighborhoods within metropolitan urban areas should be valued for there social, iconic and economic contribution to the balance and opportunity citizens needs to thrive and grow, all because we do not have a vision and will for our urbs and continue to allow our lands to be absorbed by aggressive private real estate interest. \n \nWhat are some of the pros and cons to increasing density?\nUrban sociology\nIn the urbs the social benefit to all income and socio-economic levels occurs when necessities dictates increasing densities and adding new buildings and communities. This benefits existing populations in poorer neighborhoods because it allow for entry-level citizens to make their neighborhoods relevant and personally metaphoric. As older occupants relocate to newer dwellings, others move and renovate. \nOften the neighborhoods become a mixture of people on differing socio-economic scales and diverse cultures. \n \nIt could even result in vest-pocket zone variances allowing for non-residential use where mixing both uses and economic social status often produces the best of both worlds for all citizens. But such a combination means mixing metaphors and aesthetics as well, which demands understanding the urban context. It is here where community verses privacy issues are identified, negotiated and sometimes reconciled. When they are not, the results are often disputes that result in violence and chaos as differing interest and tastes vie for their turf. \nIn 1967, to research for my thesis Precinct Police Station to earn my masters of architecture at Yale the patrol car I was in drove into an urban block in Brooklyn to face a heated gun battle with shots being fired from several buildings on either side of the street. While both officers left the vehicle they put the microphone in my hand and told me to lay on the floor in the back and tell headquarters what was happening, this was a dramatic repeat of the squabbles I experienced growing up in tenements in the Bronx. \n \nLater the officers told me that this was a daily occurrence and that it was caused by these neighbors inability to reconcile their claim to the neighborhood and their difference in life style and culture. \n\nI learned that to avoid such gun battles the metaphor of the urban city must be brought to the consumer to affect the way residents choose and influence public policy. They must either own, believe they own and be treated with the dignity and respect of a righteous citizen. \nFor new cities, and in light of the dependence on foreign oil in dangerous places, our dependence on foreign oil would be greatly reduced by simply accommodating population increases in urban rather than sub-urban settings because urban contexts can be made economic and metaphorically attractive. \nI believe an economic urban design is the antidote to sprawl, expensive highways, power generation, grids, bridges, automobiles and fuel. I believe that one of the reasons the Europeans are not very sympathetic to the plight of American cities is because Europeans have practiced conservation while observing Americans squander its land, productivity, and natural resources. \n \nWhat is being done now improve the urban experience?\nRecently I have observed an increasing number of responsible institutions initiating programs that encourage spatial beauty, complexity, contradictions, vulgarity, opportunity, and mixed uses and formed such initiatives as \u201cNew Urbanism\u201d, \u201cSmart Growth\u201d, \u201cBlueprint for America\u201d, \u201cPrinciples of Intelligent Urbanism (PIU) and in New York City in 1970 we formed the Laboratories for Metaphoric Environments. \n \nAmerica is as much a place as it is an idea and our cities are one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse demographic populations, which insist cities, is workable, fun and beautiful. Cities are often both recreational and exciting to even announce something like \u201cNew York is a Summer Festival\u201d! In America when a city or place in city does not work, it is abandoned and destroyed and the American culture moves on to create a better place.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCan we decide between right and wrong, provide options and still manage our environment?\nHope and Vision \nIt is for this reason I am optimistic and writing and lecturing on urbanism because I believe we can have the will if only we had the vision, and it is up to persons like myself to present this vision, a vision based on empirical models and workable ideals. I believe it is up to design professional\u2019s not disinterested bureaucrats, lawyers and accountants to create works of art, metaphors, and lifetime contexts while protecting the health, safety and welfare of the general public. Right now communities have grown up with the benefit of the talent and committed professional s needed to create livable cities. \nHowever nice is Tamiami Trail, it will never match the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es and why shouldn\u2019t it? \nAmerican architects have come to accept the \u201cstrip\u201d as a given in modern cities. \n \nWhat are the creative opportunities to foster a culture of cosmopolitan urbanism? \nRecently non-rural city-constituents insist on a government, which has an urban mind, and culture, with people who are passionately urban and have a cosmopolitan point of view. A point of view unencumbered with provincialism but filled with compassion, education, and professionalism. \nThe mass media and Internet condition populations to the extent that they are emerging to desire the things that only an urb can provide. \n \nHowever while there are many commonalties between one and another urb there are also remarkable differences. Obviously, since not all cities can be the same, makers of the urban metaphor makes the strange familiar and likens one urban-type in terms of another. \n \nThe urban creators must be more than a technical architect or planner but a profession that includes the commonalities and differences on many levels of issues and complexities; it needs a \u201cculture of cosmopolitan urbanism\u201d. \n \n\n\n\nIt is both a science and an art!\nSuch a culture knows the history of urbanism that deals with the increases in population and understands the urban mindset, providing intelligent choices so that citizens may choose and manage urban contexts in representative governments, their elected officials, bureaucrats and professional consultants. \n \nCommunities must ask whether their town-fathers, government leaders, elected officials, systems of government and laws are suitable for creating ideal cities, or, is it best left to the private sector which historically have been dictators, czars, pharaohs, feudal lords, and passionate industrialist who created most of the beautiful cities in the world by power and single-minded initiative. \nThey also created the most despotic unhealthy and unsafe cites the world has ever known. Few, if any city, when first began have a good beginning. \nIt is good that today, modern governments involve citizens to monitor decisions so that there can there be a city with the driving force of a people and their representative government, businessmen, corporations with a confluence of great and influential leaders. They debate whether to urbanize or not, to ruralize or not, to sub-urbanize or not, which is more appropriate and when, to extend or to renovate the existing, to build vertically rather than horizontally. \n \nWhat should be the mix of rental verses owned properties and should these be built in higher or low density? \nOften, the unspoken is about people\u2019s life-style metaphors and the diversity of populations, vocations, and backgrounds. \n \nSome ask about the very rich, while others debate the pros and cons to encourage, discourage, control or limit growth, zone or not to zone and plan or not to plan, other communities argue in favor of leaving such developments totally to chance and without anyone\u2019s intervention, for example, Houston does not have zoning. These are all valid debates and contribute to the increase of quality in the built environment, which is best for the majority of the affected population. \n \n \n \n\nSo, why aren\u2019t the leaders doing their job?\nFirst of all, we are not conveying the culture of urbanism to them, by its very nature culture lives when it is received and conveyed. \nAside from the checks and balances afforded by our democratic form of government, two party system and cultural diversity the plight of Southwest Florida is exacerbated by demeaning the primary professional whose education and calling it is to create and develop the built environment. Instead, the authority rests with planners who focus on infrastructure, politicians who focus on politics, and developers who are interested in profits, while one of the solutions would be a school of architecture, which educates and advocates. Yet another dilemma looms and that is a culture of pragmatism and precedence law, even with a version of statute of limitations it still is used to win variances to change approved plans. Everybody knows we are what we eat as we benefit when we choose the right foods we must build the right environments, both affect our being. \n \nWhat are the two different ways urbanism occurs?\nTo reify and convert the abstract concept of urbanism into a reality and identify some of the choices I have divided these two lectures on urbanism into two, one and a half hour (1 \u00bd) plus 1/2 hour of questions and discussions to include Natural and evolving and corporately created, synthetic and mass- produced urban forms. \n \nNatural cities include such cities as New York, Paris, Charleston, Leipzig, Florence, Madrid, Rome, Johannesburg, St, Petersburg, and hundreds of others. Cities which foster builders, general contractors and individual business to design and custom build on a small scale where individuals invest in apartment buildings, rental or condominium ownership. \n \nThis form of living is the metaphor of natural cities and their culture of cosmopolitan urbanism because people in natural cities gather together to: \n1. Extract and manufacture products form natural resources\n2. Exchange goods and services, \n3. Attack others to acquire resources\n4. Defend themselves from attack by a common enemy\n5. Enjoy entertainment, recreation, and quality of life, \n6. Farm and fish,\n7. Import and export goods and services.\n8. Pursue careers and work \nOn the other hand, synthetic city-types and clusters are corporately created and include New Towns, Planned Unit Developments, Commercial and Industrial Developments such as English Mountain, Sugar Tree, Al-Khobar, Reston, and industrial cities in China and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran, Abquiq, Jubail and Yanbu). Where land is developed, buildings designed and systematically mass-produced, manufactured on site or in factories as products according to pre-designed stock plans and specifications by large real estate development corporations. \n \nCan we plan for urbanization?\nPlanning for urbanization\nOrganic new town or the garden city is a type of planned urbanization based on an advance plan of the type prepared for military, aesthetic, economic or urban design reasons. Planned urbanization on a mega scale is the construction of new towns by the Housing Development Board of Singapore.\n \nUnplanned (organic) cities are the oldest form of urbanization. Examples can be seen in many ancient cities; although with exploration came the collision of nations, which meant that many invaded, cities took on the desired planned characteristics of their occupiers. \nMany ancient organic cities experienced redevelopment for military and economic purposes, new roads carved through the cities, and new parcels of land were cordoned off serving various planned purposes giving cities distinctive geometries. I believe that either can be workable depending on the scale and quality of the government and the professionals managing the urbanization process, of course, without a good board of directors setting good policy the mangers usually falter. \nI have an original study of the city of Baghdad which aptly describes the way the city was built by attaching one dwelling after another to each to form a gigantic honeycomb cluster. The west and the east both have different ways of forming their urbs. \n \n \n \n\n99\nUN agencies prefer to see an urban infrastructure installed before urbanization occurs. I recall studying a village in Peru where my best friends served in the Pease Corps, after a community effort planning a community the built the sewer, water and electric systems as well as the roads. They also started a system of making local building materials to build and trained laborers. Landscape planners are responsible for landscape infrastructure (public parks, sustainable urban drainage systems and greenways) which can be planned before urbanization takes place, or afterward to revitalize an area and create greater livability within a region.\n \nMy curiosity about \u201cwhy my environment is the way it is\u201d gave birth to a passion for urbanity, cities, architecture, and design long before I even knew my own identity. \nWhen I was a little boy, that curiosity was coupled with my building covered shelters out of a combination of blankets and wooden orange crates in our Hunts Point two-family house. \n \nI therefore became the student and creator of the very places, which I was later to call my world, and when I became a member of the American Institute of Architects, I also became an authority on urbanism.\nAs a young person, I did reconnaissance to find out where I was in this world and to make everything recognizable, familiar and gain control of my opportunities. \n \nFor me the city was a metaphor for my identity and I authenticated my self by these explorations and constructions. \nIn much, the same way as did primitive man builds his first shelter and soon combined them together to form villages and agreements to develop them into civilized societies. Early Baghdad, and our New England towns and villages are examples where populations settled because of natural resources, waterways ands trade crossings. \n \nHaving said all of this about urbanity, I have always been metaphorically romantic about rural and small town life. I even enjoyed living in two venues for the twenty years we lived and worked in Saudi Arabia. So I am familiar with the plight of the so-called \u201csnowbird\u201d. \n\nMy cosmopolitan involvement with urbanity is personal and peculiar to me. I am not trying to teach anyone here the basics of city planning but rather to encourage a love and passion for the built and created man- made environment and to hopefully provide a roadmap so that citizens may choose and manage urban contexts, we are in need of a culture of cosmopolitan urbanism. \n \nIn brief, to share the passion, I found myself involved in one of those basics that affect everyone but few give much thought, the culture of cities and urbanism. Armed with this passion it is possible for citizens to choose and manage urban contexts. Yes, the key is education. \nMuch the way we are managing our health care I believe we must also learn to manage our contexts. I believe my mission in this CLL program is to impart that passion, the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism.\n732 words\nWhat is the difference between cities and urban areas how is this distinction helpful to mange the control of cities?\nWhile urban is about city dwellers and being civilized to do so Urban is also the very \"characteristic of city life\u201d while urbane became restricted to manners and styles of expression. Urban renewal, euphemistic for \"slum clearance\u201d, is recorded from 1955. While a city is the result of the accord, agreements of citizens it may remain unurbanized. A part of cites may be urbanized while others remain undeveloped. There are many cites which have whole districts that remain under the control of one city or county municipality who choose to urbanize that land, for example, Fort Myers\u2019 relationship to Lee County. Also, some say they visit a city and do not get the sense that they are in an urban environment. The form of civilization may be different from theirs. As an example, my houseboy from Thailand chastised the Saudi Arabia custom of closing shops for prayers as in Thailand commercial time is so precious that most stores time shares a particular location to earn a living, when one proprietor leaves another sets up to sell his goods. \n \nThere are cities, which have a complete infrastructure but are not urban because its institutions, public facilities and limitations on public movement are limited and restricted. Before the iron curtain fell many cites under the Soviet Union were such cities, certain cites in Saudi Arabia are other such examples, they are apparently \u201cdead\u201d cities. \nIn this way urban is the life within the city while the city is the place and the urban is life or the structure, and things within the city.\nThe city is the agreements of accord and \u201crightness\u201d of the place and all those within are \u201cright\u201d while the urbs are what they build to supply their needs and necessities. For example with public funds, they may build highways, roads, rail and bus to encourage private developers to build places for commerce, industry and habitation. They also build sidewalks, parks and playgrounds for children. \n\nHow does an urban culture shape a city?\nTypically, culture is inherited and passed on from one to another generation to authenticate and both the new and last generation while enriching each person and the collective society. \n \nUrban culture is the culture of cities. Cities all over the world, past and present, have behaviors and cultural elements that separate them from otherwise comparable rural areas. Urban culture is any of the behavioral patterns of the various types of cities and urban areas, both past and present. \"Culture is the learned set of beliefs, values, norms and material goods shared by group members... Culture consists of everything we learn in groups during the life course-from infancy to old age.\u201d In terms of the behavioral psychologist and urban sociologist, it is the result of a person being conditioned by their surrounding context and its multiple specific experiences with the facilities in the context. Cities such as New Orleans, Galveston, Los Angeles, Butte, and Detroit come to mind. The epistemology of urbanism explains knowledge how do we know something is urban and not just a city and is they\u2019re any absolutes about what distinguishes a good from bad city. Scores of philosophers and urban scholars have tried to sort through these issues while civilizations settle and develop homesteads and build villages. \nI began my formal journey under the greatest epistemologist of our time, now deceased after 91 years, my friend and mentor, Dr. Paul Weiss. \nLike me, Dr. Weiss, a distinguished professor at Yale and then Catholic University, was born and raised in New York and he spoke with a distinct accent. I set out to prove that, as art was a metaphor so was architecture and therefore architecture was an art because it too makes metaphors. \n \nTo do this I had to first find an absolute definition of \u201cmetaphor\u201d and then demonstrate how elements of architecture performed this way. \nAfter years of research and many published monographs, I concluded that even culture is a metaphor. It is what people value and use to authenticate sustain and identify them. Their culture and the context of their culture are their \u201cbridge \u201c, address, and home root. It is their highpoint in a crowded world, which acts as beacon to guide them home and be their terminal to any journey. \n \nWhat kind of urban people make a difference?\nUrban people are enamored with the \u201ccity\u201d and although they disagree about many things, they do think about it but in their own empirical way. They can be introverted, petty, sophisticated or vulgar and share a vision of cooperating in a common vocabulary reaching for the sky and demonstrating their ability to be powerful and \u201cgod-like\u201d. Heroism in a heroic city is an expectation amongst its inhabitants. \nUrbanites welcome heroes where many great cities have urbanized under the horsepower of its home- grown heroes. Urbanites are the center of one place and \u201cevery-where \u2013else\u201d uses them as a model. \nThey, the city and the collective persons with the urban fabric are, not only right, but also possess a power of place and collective wisdom and resources. They seem to have a super-natural authority and collective self-righteousness. They know and can decide about the trends, fashion, arts, finance, products and consumer\u2019s needs and desires. These tycoons and entrepreneurs include Trumps, Vanderbilt, Morgan, Drake, Gates, Rockefellers, Astor\u2019s, Waldorf, Howard Hughes (Las Vegas), Henry Ford, Carnegie, Whitney, Ford, Mellon (Pittsburgh), and the Arabian Gulf King, Emirs and sheiks are some such people. \n\nIn fact, none of the above may bear it out, but the allusion to being god-like (trend setters) permeates and fans the flame of the fantasy. The urbanite envisions the world with them at its center, emanating rays of light, products, words, songs, sounds, ideas, force, design, engineering, science, technology, religion, medical cures, and healing. \nFor example, in 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan and the members of the Vanderbilt family. These people received and conveyed the culture of cosmopolitan culture.\n \n \n\n\n \n192\nIn cities like New York, Paris, Rome, Mumbai, Beijing, Los Angeles and then a year or even later things spring up in other smaller and secondary markets. \nCommerce plays an important part in giving a city its identity and vitality. It\u2019s not all about profit but more the opportunity to peruse dreams, careers, family and relationships. It is the seed of a universal view and globalization. Most cities start with commerce exploiting resources and geographical assets before being a magnet to large populations. One can control unwanted influx of populations by curtailing employment.\n\nAs citizens, we can choose to live in such a city made by others or ourselves be part of the driving force. Often this translates into electing officials who will carry out this job. In other cases, it is simply voting on legislation, which allows private developers to do this job in the private sector. For these very factors, many have abided in cities while others have deserted cities for want of calmer and more benign context. Some cities prosper under a strong and guiding mayor while other cities simply grow with a mayor who encourages others to lead. \n103\nDo urban persons affect the quality of the built environment?\nThe urban person is a believer in the world and its potential to keep and hold mankind. Art flourishes in the urban environment because it is where creative like- minded artisans and craftsman are born, raised and hone their craft on the challenges and demands of the market. \nAs Renaissance-kings and Queens hired and fostered artisans, so do the cities and urban populations provide fertile ground for invention, innovation, design, thought and ideas. Along with artisans, there are poets and writers who provide a libretto and describe the scenario of the urban context. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhat do urban minded persons build?\nPedestrian appurtenances such as sidewalks, plazas, walkways, ambulatories, parks and playgrounds, street furniture, covered bus stops, train and airplane terminals, lookouts, and monuments are but some of the distinctive of both the natural and the synthetic urban city, whereas rural and sub-urban developments are predominantly accessed by horse and buggies or automobiles while, the pedestrian ways have much less of a priority and few people ever use these. Authors and planners such as Jane Jacobs, Kevin Lynch and Louis Munford wrote extensively about these urban features. It seems our quest is to bring rural pedestrian\u2019s freedom into the city. \n \nSpace is another way of forming and perceiving cities where some cities are built as architectonic voids and solids, and others a series of free standing three dimensions solids perceived from the exteriors as shapes and forms as sculpture. \n \nMost of the cities in Europe and the mid east and big cities such as New York, Paris, Cambridge, Barcelona, Florence, Rome, Venice, and Chicago are cities of a series and hierarchy of enclosed and bounded spaces. Los Angeles, Jacksonville, Houston, Dallas, and Seattle are the largest examples of such of the sculptural cities. \n \nWhat does overpopulation mean and how is this mitigated? \nThe very idea of over population is a man made invention and its opposite in under population. It is only over when economists believe human, physical and financial resources cannot sustain a stable government. This is measured by a proportion of resources to the population and physically measured in scale. When a government is under populated, it usually means it has less people than it needs to meets its budget and maintains its programs. \n \nScale of cities can either attract or deter but in any case it is the scale of city\u2019s utilities, support services, energy supply, vertical and horizontal transportation, commerce, industry, institutions, communications, and residential variety that motivates societies to urbanize in as dense and compact way as possible. \n \n \nScale is a proportion of one thing in relation ship to another and the larger and more dense the city the greater is the proportion of all facilities city per person where each person has access to the greatest number, sizes and quality of resources. Even the poorest is \u201ccity-rich\u201d.\n \nWhat are the advantages of higher densities?\nOn the other hand, the more the density the more people share in the collective facilities and the more efficient is each support facility. \nFor example, high-rises increase the numbers of people using one square foot of land, one foot or road, pipe, sewer line, power plant, elevator, train, or bus. The efficiencies translate into lower taxes and potentially higher standard of living if standards are based on access to the city\u2019s amenities made possible and necessitated by scale such as hospitals, museums, parks, schools, universities, commerce, entertainment, rail and air transport and banking. It is on the matter of scale that Renaissance cities were designed and Mediterranean villages built. For example, my grandparents city of Rhodes, the city of Dubrovnik and the many shopping malls which have been designed to make the shopper at home. \nThe other side of scale is its disproportionate relationship to the single human individual. And, this is what characterizes the urban from the rural where the urban is naturally more general, cosmopolitan, individualistic, and not co-dependent having lived with so many to not be familiar with all but adjusted to being a stranger amongst many strangers, not familiar but a learned friendliness as civil to make the enormous scale work. \nUrbanites are at peace with not knowing their neighbor as not knowing the workings, contents and interests of the whole city. Accustomed to being a cog a great wheel minds their own business while politicians and government officials keep the city going. Just get on a crowded elevator in a New York City skyscraper and try saying hello.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n618\nWhat are the basic components of the urbs?\nArchitect\u2019s Urbs\nFrom an architectural point of view urban consists of structure, infrastructure, government, laws, agreements, ordinances, civilized society and civil behavior, consensus and concessions for public and private use, resources, and the provision of basic services, air, water, light, concerns for health and health services, tradesman and the ability to import and export as well as trade and exchange. \nUrban allow persons to ambulate and move about without infringing on the privacy, sanctity and sovereignty of persons, families and business interest. \nUrbs also harbor institutions created from the concerns for collective and ongoing remedies, and the development of the culture\u2019s ideals in education, science, and art, as well as government, justice and communications. \nAn institution in any city is an organization, establishment, foundation, society, or the like, devoted to the promotion of a particular cause or program, esp. one of a public, educational, or charitable character. While they have the form of a corporation, they are, importantly, not-for \u2013profit and their board is a cross section of the peers of that institution. \nUrban centers often have institutions, which not only serve their own nation, but other cities and causes throughout the world. They are the early-globalized models for the globalization of the world. \nOn the other hand, they are subject and scrutinized by the context in which they operate. \nIt is conditioned by its history, settlement patterns, heroes, battles and treatise, and because all of real (royal) estate is never really owned but for beneficial use taken by hostile actions. Urbs are limited and bound by agreements by adjacent and continuous domains and their resultant configurations are a result of negotiations or victories. \nJust look at maps and you will see that there are many states with jagged and messy boundaries while others are absolutely straight and angular. The later are those created by mandate of law while the former evolved and settled naturally. Even the way we buy and sell real estate today is by offer and acceptance to rights and privileges. \n\n \n\nWhat are the impacts of the government on urbanity?\nIn a democracy, urban is a city that function, works and changes by the will and effort of its collective inhabitants, as example the way in which the cities of Naples, Fort Myers, Bonita Springs and Cape Coral have incorporated their communal interest. It is inherently communal, social to tolerate, adjust and accommodate both the private and collective rights of its citizens. The citizens of an urban city know their place and how it works .In what ever form of government the city is quite self-sufficient and run by individual, business, corporate and governmental self interest perusing their self interest and exchanging goods and services. The best urban city is disproportionably self-run with the least government intervention. It is a kind of benevolent anarchy. \n \nHong Kong is a prime example of a centrally ruled government leaving its hands off the working of its urban city, Jeddah and other Arab, Indian, and Pakistani cities do likewise. \nFor an architect, as it was in Egypt, Greece and Rome the goal is to design and build a city which is the sum and substance of its citizens where constituents can achieve their hopes and dreams for both today and into the future. \nTo achieve these goals the architect must know not only the culture of the people but the systems and resources to limit and bound the spaces, programs and resources they will utilize. In urban cities, these include many cultures combined into one and multiple systems of transportation, communication and education. \nThe urban architect is a responsible, concerned professional doing serious and important work for the community he serves. \n119\nUrbanites use facilities as elevators, building lobbies, sidewalks, busses, trains, stores and shops, parks, and schools to culture, develop and mature. Urbanites are consumed and influenced by their environment the mass transit, massive buildings and vast complex of institutions.\n\nModern cities are a matrix of vehicle and people conveyance of goods and services, utility lines, sewage, water, electrify, and emergency vehicle access. Cities are a complex machine inhabited by people defying the proverb that form follows function. \n\n\n\nIt is more that people adopting to form while interior design mitigates the difference by adapting the form to fit the person. Education, Careers, Commerce, and Entertainment also mitigate the scale and visuals that mask the technology and scale of the city\u2019s structure.\n \nWhat is the crisis of urbanism in our culture?\n66\nThe culture of cosmopolitan urbanism is not being conveyed nor inherited from one to another generation. What was a legacy of from past generations coming from Europe or developing from within the USA is not being conveyed. In some societies the value of the urban experience is being eclipsed by other social structures. In other societies it is being exacerbated by mismanagement and rapid population growth. \n \nHistory of Urbanism\nUrbanism is a social, political, environmental, economic and geopolitical study affecting public policy, commerce and industry so that more colleges and universities are offering degrees in this important area of study and because of that I am pleased that many of Florida\u2019s county planning staff is increasing qualified. However, without a college of architecture in South West Florida their well-intended efforts are often over looked by the courts. A local college of architecture would be politically and socially entrenched in the context and more persuasive. \n \nJudges might think twice before overturning county staff\u2019s recommendations if the staff were indigenous and educated in the venue of the court. Such a school would also educate and influence public policy affecting town fathers and developers. \nWith such a school, the developers might even be the architects and local planners. And judges may even be former students and architects. \nEveryone but the real estate development industry and the farmer who may want to sell his land believe that urbanizing on undeveloped land is profitable. To both it is profitable but eventually it is profit at the expense of others. \n \n \n \n \n\nWhat is pragmatic side of urbanism?\nOn the other hand, taxpayers, consumers and hard-pressed governments know that existing cities and urban centers make it expensive, unwieldy and un-profitable to practice real estate development as developers can do on undeveloped land. \n \nAs a result in the forties residents seeking more square footage, and better quality living space at a lower cost in big cities across America relocated to subdivisions in what became known as the city\u2019s suburbs. In this way, federal and state policies governing agricultural property influences sub-urban sprawl. On the other hand, inner city urbanites left because of price and quality, developers, counties and manufactures found it profitable, and the start of a national industry. Highways got built, with low cost oil, oil companies built more refineries, automobile manufactures convinced every one to have a romance with his vehicle, mortgages and credit companies proliferated, and the corporations eclipsed many small businesses. On the other hand, there are millions of people now moving into urbs and even more that refuse to leave and endure some of hardships because they prefer the advantages. \n209\nDale Johnson in \u201cLost in the Suburb\u2019s described a cultural and political gap that occurred in New Jersey and Ontario in the early 1990s when suburban voters began to outnumber urban or rural voters, and began to perceive that they were paying taxes to provide urban areas with services that were not duplicated in their community. Meanwhile, suburban communities would export problems to the cities, typically in the form of drug addicts, homelessness, smog, prostitution and other crimes serving suburban residents, and the need to accommodate a large number of commuters and their sewage and parking requirements. \n \nAs downtown residents and suburban voters became estranged, each perceived themselves subsidizing the other, and accordingly a common solution, called in both New Jersey and Ontario the Common Sense Revolution, transferred funds from urban needs to suburban sprawl, triggering a decline in urban quality of life in both places, as population further spread out and downtowns became more hostile to suburban visitors, the city of Johannesburg in South Africa is such an example.\n\n \nTo reverse this trend major cites have provided developers and builders with tax incentives, free land on deteriorated and abandoned property, expedited zoning and permitting, financing instruments and special mortgages, and the means to market the units before construction.\n526\nIn other communities, cities, and towns have adopted no-growth policies and prohibited such development; either urban or other wise to occur while others have openly embraced the onslaught of developers to their undeveloped land. While I am in favor of representative government, I believe that without a steady stream of voices from continuants that urban blight is inevitable. We don\u2019t much discuss urban blight in Southwest Florida but it is the bane of every densely populated municipality particularly caused by disenfranchised residents who lack a culture of cosmopolitan urbanism. \n\nHowever, much of Florida is suffering under a good policy called \u201csmart growth\u201d which after all its town hall meetings municipal development plans encounter the courts which continue to permit the absorption of wetland, watershed and fragile eco-systems, not to mention the increased demand to build more power plants, roads, and water supply. It seems that precedence law, free enterprise and rights of corporations often prevail. \n\nOver recent years, not a few private groups, universities, professional associations have come out against these practices including my very own American Institute of Architects, while even more are still finding ways to rationalize and convince the federal, state and local governments that further development of raw land is good. All of this while thousand of cites, towns and suburbs are deteriorating and failing economically, socially and ecologically. I believe America is squandering its wealth. \n\nBecause urbanism is apparently hemorrhaging, coalitions are having an impact and public officials as they exert pressure to manage population growth, housing demands, immigration, transportation and affordability.\n\n\n\nStill the quality of the built environment is increasingly finding its ways to smaller elite who are over worked, over taxed and compelled to meet the cost of maintaining the metaphor of the cost of quality living units in existing urban centers, suburbs and emerging new towns and PUD (planned unit developments). \n\nLarge developers have adopted the means and ways of large corporations focusing on profits by standardizing plans, policies, procedures and franchise and subsidiary operations. \nThey are increasingly staffed with graduates of business management schools concerned with efficient ways of achieving customer satisfaction while maximizing profits. \nThey do all of this while the middle class is compelled to have at least two sources of income to pay for two cars, mortgage and high taxes to pay for highways, power grids, utilities and water and support the overhead of these large corporate developers. The voices of the small architectural practice, craftsman and builder are made obsolete and unfeasible. More of them turn to the large corporation while town fathers yield to the lure of cash flow into their communities. Even in cities without zoning regulations, the results of litigation often grant variances to the Comprehensive Development Plans and favorable zoning. What seemed like a more affordable solution has now become even more costly in taxes, transportation, schooling, and the house itself. \nThe question is would everyone live in high quality affordable and cost-effective big urban centers? Promoters exploit the house as castle myth to justify single-family house construction while others simply build tall buildings leaving lots of open space where the house as castle myth becomes a condominium. \n392\nWhat are some the ongoing things that are being done to deal with the crises?\nAll this having been said, throughout the formation of cities, there has always been a group of people that were favored to live inside the wall and others who lived outside, and the ones living outside had to build their own habitats in any way they could. \n \nIt is only recently that governments took an interest in the way the city and its outside city walls accommodated the citizenry. \n\nIn our time, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a good case in point where the government gives every subject an interest \u2013free loan toward the construction of a home. I harkens back to when the U.S. Federal government gave settlers free land. It depends on the objectives so that the ends justify the means. \nUnder various urban development acts and private initiatives, many big cities\u2019 urb and squalor is being converted to livable communities reflective of its local residents. \nOnce a person becomes a citizen he is entitled to the rights, privileges and protection afforded to citizens. Cities built inside the wall were fortresses and instruments of defense of the royal family and its treasures. \nGated communities, new towns and other forms of private developments with deed restrictions are ways of providing residents choice, ownership and management rights, which maintain the quality of that context. However, urban clusters in urban cities are managed by neighborhood development agencies, both have evolved as good ways to urbanize. The people are being protected. Security and defense is American, and the goal of every urban settlement, from country, to state, to city. Whether urban or rural we incorporate to first and foremost to pay for fire and police protection. \n However, cities still today repeat the same things as before where buildings outside the wall are influenced in styles, vocabulary and symbols by those inside the wall. Additionally, city layouts, building types and designs symbolically represent national and corporate beliefs in the forms of rooftops, finishes and models. Interior design, furniture, communication devices, media and the automobile have been great unifying factors. Houses are overbuilt with exaggerated multiple pitched roofs and exterior finishes likening them to castles, office buildings and hoses of worship. Just look at the advent of the boom in the computer designed pre-engineered truss industry in our SWFL counties. \n274\nHas current events had an impact on urbanization?\nBecause most civilized societies think of their city as a fortress and collective power the terrible human tragedy of 9/11 and the many global terrorist assaults impact the urban psyche. Cities are now seeking a new metaphor of their densely populated urbs and sprawling cities. \n\nNot to say that terrorist couldn\u2019t strike anywhere or at any remote place but suddenly dispersion of the population with bulky, uniform and inefficient vehicles have become very fashionable. People moving out of dense areas now believe they need bulky vehicles. \nIn fact, the advent of the airplanes and bombs made all cities vulnerable. Still, commerce and individuals have rethought their personal settlement based on these new realities. However, no matter neither where we settle nor how many computers we own, economy, access to resources, socialization, identity and life support remains the advantage of what the city provides, and the urban city provides this to even rural communities. \nEven our choices to have a private single family house as a sign of citizenry, or a corporation to have its own building identity all harkens back to our most primitive metaphorical instincts. \nThe anonymity of the urban multifamily dwelling for some is preferred over the ostentation of the merchant whose building roofline and form must rise above the others. Real Estate Developers and emerging political entities in urban\u2019s adjacent counties tap into these logos, mores and folkways to overwhelm town fathers and government officials with rightness and worthiness of the metaphors they say they provide. Even post 9/11 automobiles are designed to be anonymous by being similar regardless of brand and cost. \n \nIf over population of the earth means that the earth has more people than resources or that we cannot redistribute the wealth and the resources what affect does over population have to do with increasing populations to an one city? \n \nBecause development of civilization results in urbanization, does it necessarily mean the removal of the rural character of a town or area? \n \nAre we, as a members of the world\u2019s family liable and able to mange the increases in population? \nIs urbanity the only answer and how do we mitigate the inevitable?\n \nIt seems only rational that while many of us may value agricultural and rural communities, as products of the city and the urban process we choose and wish to continue to improve our urbs. \n\n \nDemographically, the term urbanize, denotes redistribution of populations from rural to urban settlements and these developments, which may or may not become cities. Rural to urban migration is the moving of people from rural areas into cities. When cities grow rapidly, as in Chicago in the late 19th century or Shanghai a century later, the movement of people from rural communities into cities is considered to be the main cause, the cause of the world\u2019s overpopulation. Many argue that it is cities that are causing the worlds over population and that urbanization is therefore inherently wrong. Because this kind of growth is especially commonplace in developing countries, they further argue that in order to reduce the growth of the world\u2019s over-population urbanization should be discouraged and made difficult. \n \nYet, rural migrants continue to be attracted by the possibilities that cities can offer, but often settle in shantytowns and experience extreme poverty. In Saudi Arabia, planners are diverting such increases to smaller towns building up their infrastructure and relocating business and industry, however, in their case, they still wish to increase their native population, however huge their unemployment of young Saudis. Since they are one of world\u2019s largest welfare states and able to financially support populations these population increases continue at a rapid rate as do the construction of urban centers. But there are many other countries whose urban developments do not keep pace or by political conflict displace millions into tent cities out side the confines of the urban support centers. Indeed, the culture of cosmopolitan urbanity is a very weighty matter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOne Hour Take a five-minute break: When we came back, we will examine Natural Cities. Break is only for 90 minute lecture.\n\nNatural Cities: \n5,070 words on 21 pages\nHow do natural cities form?\nNatural Cities are incorporated government entities formed by resident citizens with a confluence of circumstantial and haphazard events over a period of time; it is a city that has evolved over time. They can be tiny and small or mammoth and overpopulated. Yes, it once was created in a much smaller, rural, and primitive form and over time is renovated and adjusted to accommodate new policies, technologies and demographics. The city reflects the nature of its creators and subsequent inhabitants. \n \nTo live in such a place you have to be a pragmatist who constantly negotiates changing realities and expects challenges to the very basics of existence. You are on the cutting edge of growth, deterioration and the inspiration of man-made achievements.\n244\nYes, Lee County\u2019s City of Fort Myers and the City of Bonita Springs are such places. Whereas cities of Naples, Cape Coral and emerging Lehigh Acers are good examples of local synthetic man-made cities, not to be confused with local urban developments and enclaves. In today\u2019s planning terminology they are considered urban really wide spread sprawl with very costly infrastructure relative to their population, industry and tax base. Whereas a Natural city is real or genuine when it reflects the character, interest, personality and pecuniary, social and political interest of its authors. It is economical and efficient.\n\nWhat the privileges are enjoyed in cites?\nA Natural city is driven by inhabitants wanting refuge, righteousness and sanctuary from chaos and confusion so as to grow family, business and prosper, to have a civil life with not only law and order but also infrastructure, potential and power. They are alive and vibrant with their own self-interest, backed by their determination to profit, and have a happy and successful population for themselves and their supporters. \n\nThey create such cities as a monument to their greatness, which is often material, industrial, and commercial accomplishments, and are a legacy of their fortunes and fame. It is a variation of the way traditional cities were formed. \nAnd it is from this drive and vision that its inhabitants prosper and enjoy their life. The city turns them on. They are heirs of these creators and enjoy the legacy of their work. \n \nTo me a city is a toy and form of recreation and creativity to which I attribute many of life\u2019s joys and great moments of happiness. Having lived and visited hundreds of cities and many countries of both the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave-nots\u201d I am very grateful to have a blue passport, a great county and the blessings of cities. \n239\nFor example, a city is a metaphor when I say, \u201cI am a New Yorker\u201d. \nI mean, \u201cWere I a city I would be New York\u201d. \nSilly isn\u2019t it, but in the realm of ideas and matters of the heart, it is real.\nNatural cities lend themselves to metaphors that arise out convention because of the city\u2019s long history and deep-rooted ancestry. Because a metaphor makes the strange familiar and \u201ctalks about one thing in terms of another\u201d, one immediately characterizes a native New Yorker with the many images and values of the city, its\u2019 crime, delinquent garbage collection, gangs, traffic, crowds, vulgarities, and other mean things. Not the arts, high fashion, financial district, millions of office workers, universities, museums, great hospitals, publishers and intellects, entertainers, performers and artist, etc. in general, a conglomeration of hyper-over-achievers. \n\nNew York City is one America\u2019s and the world\u2019s great natural cities where over 200 years ago was the place of battles that won America\u2019s freedom and the city, which was the nation\u2019s first capital. \nTo a New Yorker, New York is a metaphor because the city is currency that makes us authentic and part of a New York reality. And, this can be said for many other cities. The city authenticates our labors, strivings and ambitions into a homogeneous context of brilliance and success. It is no wonder why many New Yorkers are architects, planners and urbanist, especially native New Yorkers. \n \nHow do cities maintain their grip on our imagination?\nIn a natural city, the reality may be all myth, hype and imagination but it is the very thing that theatre, baseball and football teams thrive as they identify their city and teams with their loyalty and pride. \nThe culture of the city is that which changes, nurtures and grows us out of our own to the city\u2019s nature. \nWhen I was a young man, I couldn\u2019t stop going from one theater, museum, zoo, building, and street to another acclimatizing and adopting the streets character and moods. One of the most read articles in every Daily News paper showed a corner of the city before and after in recognition of the city\u2019s ever-changing face. I was always attentive to see what the place looked like before. \nHowever, New York has not cornered the market on design professionals. Since every populated town is a kind of urban context many much smaller urban models have grown their version of architects and design professionals.\nWhen I first visited 72 natural European cities, I discovered that each city owned a separate and unique metaphor, description and uniqueness. In their own way, they were urban with many commonalities and distinctive differences. They were all sizes, locations and climate. Since then I have visited countless others to observe them evolve and adapt. \nNatural Cities manifest themselves in movies, books, poems, radio, stage shows, plays, songs, play, and games. In movies such as Casablanca, The East- Side Kids, Easter Parade, Detective stories such as the Mickey Spilane and the Mike Hammer series, Batman, Super Man and the Daily Planet, West Side Story, Rhapsody in Blue, and thousands of others. \nThose that love cities endure the rain, sleet and snow. They endure crime, dirt and filth. They endure interruptions of garbage collection, power failures, outrageous crime, and poverty. \n251\nWhat are the cities real support systems?\nUrbanization process\nWhether urbanity occurs in rural agricultural or urban industrial areas man\u2019s infrastructure prevails as the underlying base or foundation especially for an organization or system. Man\u2019s infrastructure is the basic facilities, services, and installations needed for the functioning of a community or society, such as transportation and communications systems, water and power lines, and public institutions including schools, post offices, and prisons. It is these that prevail, not the nature, and the amenities as they do in rural and suburban communities. \n \nIn rural communities, nature prevails. However, it is the urban infrastructure that has sewn me into the mind of urbanity and enclosed my vision of the whole of life. \nIt is the canvas upon which the city\u2019s form is woven and designed. Because of this city-type as an art form, one\u2019s life and world-context differs noticeably and is distinguished one from another. Yet when either is populated by a variety of families and diverse interests they must face the same issues but on different scales. \nIn rural settings, man\u2019s intervention is made by his personal relationships, dependence and handwork. In urban settings, such intervention is made by the overwhelming context and sheer volume of some trend, fashion, vocation, and opportunity. It\u2019s a matter of the proportion of the relationship of the manmade infrastructure to the nature. \nPeople from the old urban cities go to newly developing urban cities bringing experience. Warnings, passions and visions were what I brought to Saudi Arabia. \n \nWhat are the cities natural geographical derivatives? \n\u2022 River town\n\u2022 Trade route intersection\n\u2022 Terminal city; Shipping ports, Railroads and airports\n\u2022 Farming cities; Agricultural and cattle\n\u2022 Company town based on mining, manufacturing and industry.\n\u2022 Ocean cities and waterfront\nCan you name any others?\n\u2022 Resort cities\n\u2022 Results of victory of a war\n\u2022 Oil, coal and other mineral mining and exploration Cities\n\u2022 Tax-free districts in the Caribbean\n\u2022 Or there geographical location has been made redundant by another technology or geo-political event as the many river towns of the Mississippi and New England and resort cities on the Jersey Shore.\n \nWhat are the human elements that often cause the formation and development of a city? \nCities are heroic and made by heroes, entrepreneurs, and usually those whose interest lie in the place or circumstances surrounding, interesting and used by the place as trains, rails, ports, shipping, manufacturing, business, boat building, communications, telephone, telegraph, radio (Sarnoff), etc. \nCan you name some our area\u2019s heroes?\nEdison, Collier, Mann, Carter; all the names on streets (McGregor, Heitmann, Hendry, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026?\n329\nCities can be large, medium or small and have dominant specialty in commerce, oil, coal, steel, manufacturing, agriculture and depending on the population and geographic area can be disproportionately overwhelming making it out of scale so enormous that makes it impressive and powerful. \n \nNew York is an outstanding example of this enormous scale. Many people feel dwarfed, lonely and oppressed because of the scale of such a city. It is this scales that design professionals are trained to create and mitigate to relate to individuals. It is the very thing that Michelangelo did when he designed buildings in Italy. While planners and politicians organize, two-dimensional plans and diagrams. \nA natural city is urban for many reasons including its infrastructure but more importantly because of its confluence of institutions, artistic, scientific, spiritual and commercial culture. A city is by definition a people in agreement and both reflects and serves its citizens while an urban city favors its buildings, infrastructure and facilities over its pastoral connection to the land and its citizens favor residing in close quarters without separate buildings and so called single family homes, they share building living in separate dwellings. \n \nWhat are the pros and cons of a cosmopolitan city?\nA Cosmopolite has a universal, adoptable and diverse urban mind. But not all urban people are cosmopolitan and urban people can be very provincial. \n \nCosmopolitan persons are free from local, provincial, or national ideas, prejudices, or attachments, at home all over the world. Belonging to the entire world and not limited to just one part of the world, they are citizens of the world.\n \nI have been a cosmopolitan person in an urban context that later learned to live in any context with my cosmopolitan point of view. \nThink of science fiction stories where the context and characters are dealing with non-domestic technical issues away for the mundane politics of our own time and place. We like the cosmopolitan in our clergy, educators, government officials (bureaucrats), etc. \nWho implements the Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism?\nThe correct answer is everyone! \nBut, urbanist are a specialist in the study and planning of cities and New Urbanism is an urban design movement that burst onto the scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s and tries to bring urban values into new and existing building contexts, but Urbanist are different from a rural and sub-urban mind. \n \nNew Urbanism implements the \u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d\nby shifting design focus from the car-centric development of suburbia and the business park; to concentrate pedestrian and transit-centric, walk able, mixed-use communities. New Urbanism is an amalgamation of old-world design patterns, merged with present day demands. \n50\nIt is a backlash to the age of suburban sprawl, which splintered communities, and isolated people from each other, as well as had severe environmental impacts. Concepts for New Urbanism include people and destinations into dense, vibrant communities, and decreasing dependency on vehicular transportation as the primary mode of transit.\n \nNew Urbanist aim to reform all aspects of real estate development and their work affects regional and local plans. They are involved in new development, urban retrofits, and suburban infill. In all case, New Urbanist neighborhoods are walk able, and contain a diverse range of housing and jobs, they support regional planning to achieve open space, appropriate architecture and planning, and the balanced development of jobs and housing. \nThey believe these strategies are the best way to reduce how long people spend in traffic, to increase the supply of affordable housing, and to rein-in urban sprawl. Many other issues, such as historic restoration, safe streets, and green building are also covered in the Charter of the New Urbanism, the movement's seminal document.\n \nSo how does Natural Cities expand?\nThe answer depends on the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism as whether it will go vertical, horizontal, reconfiguration, co-habitation or sub dividing. There are many cultures where several families share one dwelling or apartments and dwellings are minimal sleeping rooms. \nIn America, traditional urbanization exhibits a concentration of human activities and settlements around the downtown area. When the residential area shifts outward, this is called suburbanization. \n136\nA number of researchers and writers suggest that suburbanization has gone so far to form new points of concentration outside the downtown. Some considers this networked, polycentric form of concentration an emerging pattern of urbanization. \n\nThey are simply reflecting how large natural urban centers evolved as they connected many population centers around industry, trade, transport, and ands commerce. Chicago, New York\u2019s boroughs, and Detroit are famous for their ethnic and commercial neighborhoods and districts. We saw Leipzig\u2019s new urbanist cluster neighborhoods shortly after the wall fell. A consortium of Saxon architect\u2019s landscape architects and planners planned these. Each cluster had its own design team and theme. It is called variously exurbia, edge city (Garreau, 1991), network city (Batten, 1995), or postmodern city (Dear, 2000). Los Angeles is the best-known example of this type of urbanization. \n \nSo who\u2019s minding the store? \nProfessional Urbanist\nWhile conveying the culture is really everyone\u2019s responsibility architects limit and bound space and make metaphors; they design and control overall concepts and all the details of the built environment inhabited by people. \n \nArchitects observe, program, plan, design, schedule, specify and supervise the construction process. An architect\u2019s education prepares him for managing being the arbiter between the occupant and those with the skills to construct. \nBecause an architect is skilled in making building metaphors for people an architect is inherently urban and an advocate for all that best benefits the individual and collective society. \nThe architect professes urbanity and is able to manage a variety of urban functions including being the mayor, city manager, councilman, commissioners, and real estate development. \n \n\nFor example, I not only planned cites and designed buildings in Saudi Arabia I also drew up business plans for billion dollar financial interest for members of the Royal Family and Saudi Arabia sheiks; I organized specific new ventures for Operations and Maintenance business, pipe manufacturing, fire suppression equipment, and medical and pharmaceutical facilities. \n \nWhat are the different professionals that design build and manage an urban entity? \nWhen I was teaching in Saudi Arabia, many of my graduated architectural students have become mayors and city managers in Lebanon, Syria, Dubai and Iran. My monographs on \u201carchitecture as the making of metaphors\u201d have been published in Saudi Arabia, England, U. S. of A., Lebanon, Turkey, and Finland. You can immediately tell the difference between cities designed by an architect by its spaces and three-dimensional solutions. Planners tend to think in two dimensions, linearly and abstractly. \n490\nProgrammer: The first job I had when I graduated Pratt was to develop the program of requirements for several New York City Multi \u2013million dollar interior design projects for New York City\u2019s skyscrapers in mid-town Manhattan. \n\nUrban Landscape Architects plan the location of buildings, roads, and walkways, and the arrangement of flowers, shrubs, and trees and this title was first used by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1863 who is famous for designing many well-known urban parks, including Central Park and Prospect Park in New York City. Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant was a French-born American architect and urban planner who designed the first street plan for the Federal City in the United States, now known as Washington, D.C.\nLandscape architects work for many types of organizations\u2014from real estate development firms starting new projects to municipalities constructing airports or parks. \nWorking with architects, surveyors, and engineers, landscape architects help determine the best arrangement of roads and buildings. Urban design includes town and city squares, waterfronts, pedestrian schemes, and parking lots.\n\nCity Planning is a department in many colleges and universities and is the activity of determining the: \n\u2022 Future physical arrangement and condition of a community involving an appraisal of the present condition, \n\u2022 A forecast of future requirements, \n\u2022 A plan for the fulfillment of these requirements, and \n\u2022 Proposals for constructional, legal, and financial programs to implement the plan.\n\nInterior Designers and Space Planners\nLater in the year, I will be teaching course in Interior Design. Urban interior designers are concerned about adopting spaces within residences, skyscrapers, malls, shopping centers and shops to the specifics of their occupants and really take up where most commercial architects leave off. Before I was an architect, I was an interior architect and designed buildings from the inside out. \nThat is an architect who designs most commercial buildings without knowing who will be the specific occupant. Most such work is referred to as \u201ctenant change\u201d -work and is the job of first a space planner who determines the feasibility of the space to its potential tenant and then the layout. \n\nOnce completed the interior designer begins the design work. Stores, malls, hospitals, banks, airports, railroad terminals and many other building types are the job of the interior architect otherwise known as the interior designer. You could think of much of their work as adopting the architectural standard building shell to the specific and peculiar requirements of the proposed occupant. \nInterior design is the process of shaping the experience of interior space and traffic flow through the manipulation of spatial volume as well as surface treatment. Not to be confused with interior decoration, interior design draws on aspects of environmental psychology, architecture, and product design in addition to traditional decoration. The distinction between interior design and 'interior decoration' is one relevant in the United States but not common elsewhere. In cities, residential interior design and decoration comprise a small but important field of work.\n\\\n\n\n\nWhat other professions form a city?\nAside from programmers, city planners, landscape architects and interior designers, Constitutional, corporate and governmental Attorneys and law assist people who are in one accord to agree and formulate agreements, ordinances, statues and the very governments and institutions by which to incorporate their municipalities and behave in civil and orderly manner within their societies. It is in this way that a collection of people are able to become countries, states, counties, villages, hamlets, townships, boroughs, cities, and metropolitan areas. It is they who can make laws, which can help government and the people, be both pragmatic and ideal. It is this combination that allows great ideas to flourish while fighting crime and garbage collection. \n \nHow did I become an urbanist?\nIn New York, I was a child explorer:\nFrom childhood, I have been curious as to why cities, building and streets are the way they are. I still ask how did they get that way, what is their make up and why were they formed. \nIn urban South Bronx, I lived in densely pullulated tenements, two family houses in a sparsely populated Industrial Hunts Point and medium dense Pelham Parkway and apartments in Manhattan, Tennessee, Austria, Puerto Rico, and Saudi Arabia, a loft in Manhattan and single family homes in Florida, Tennessee, Saudi Arabia, College Station, a town house in Houston and manufactured home in North Fort Myers. \nAnd now we live in a country club with a small town communal atmosphere and many facilities. Many gated communities are a resource for recreation, entertainment, food, and even home health care. \n \nAs urbanites work, they become embroiled in aspect of the city\u2019s support services. I practiced vocations, which bonded me to the city and its building types, commerce and industry. Because I hung drapes over a period of ten years, I worked in thousands of homes, for every ethnic and national background, on thousands of streets in hundreds of neighborhoods in every borough and nearby counties. I was a limousine driver for weddings and special events and delivered newspapers into many tenement buildings and neighborhoods. Likewise, I was a Good Humor Man in the streets of Brooklyn and conducted many Job searches in Manhattan and New Haven. \nI was a radio broadcaster, founded a New York Not for Profit community organization and founded two earth days with one on Union Square at Fourteenth Street and another in Central park. \nI designed and built large and small offices, lofts, lobbies, skyscrapers in Manhattan, and in Houston, Midland, Odessa, and Victoria Texas as well in Tennessee in Jackson, Severe and Walker counties, built all over Saudi Arabia; and, in Puerto Rico made an Island-wide plan for Public Libraries for all the municipalities as well as designing the Ron Rico Bottling Plant in Arecibo, El Mundo towers and other building in San Juan.\n \nI poured my best into every project believing that it would contribute to the betterment of the lives of their occupants. I remember one nursing home I designed for renovation I stared at the windows of the 15 stories building and knowing that the view from the window would probably be the last the occupants saw of the world and therefore assured for beautiful landscaping. This was based on the recollection I had of my grandfather\u2019s last moments waving to me from his Brooklyn Hospital\u2019s window before he died when I was six years old. \n 991\nAbout American cities, the architect Robert Venturi once proclaimed that, \u201cplazas are un-American\u201d and one of my mentors, Gerald Popiel, often noted how the highest building in medieval cities was the church and worship centers whereas the highest buildings in modern cities are the banks and commercial office buildings. \nAmerica cities, as many other of the world\u2019s well known cities have replaced and supplemented plazas with great boulevards and other expressions of consensus and agreement. Plazas and public meeting places are beginning to become a part of atrium malls, office buildings and office plazas. Even neighborhood commercial enters are focused around plazas as new urbanist make places for people to congregate. I was pleasantly surprised to see Washington\u2019s huge plaza in Georgetown on the river and of course Boston\u2019s Quincy market and its huge food plaza. These are all good urban features and attract people looking for the means to socialize. Of course in Manhattan, the Seagram building\u2019s plaza on Park Avenue designed by my former professor, Phillip Johnson. Yet all of these in world-class cities are often reminiscent of the village green, Town Square, and county fair ground in smaller urban models. \n\nWhat it takes to prepare an urban professional?\nUsing my self and my hometown as an example, I would like to explain what it takes to prepare an urban professional\n\nMy teachers and mentors:\nI have been very fortunate to have great teachers and mentors, who loved cities and urbanism such as:\n1. Paul Weiss, philosopher\n2. Buckminster Fuller, theorist and visionary\n3. Louis Kahn, architect\n4. Mies Van Der Rohe, architect and founder of the Bau-House\n5. King Louis Wu, Yale teacher and architect\n6. Christopher Tunnard (who taught me about modern planned cities), \n7. Paul Rudolf who was originally from Sarasota and \n8. Henry Pfisterer (Engineer for the Empire State Building),\n9. Vincent Scully was born in New Haven, was my faculty advisor\nwhen I studied at Yale where he taught History of Architecture and was one of my thesis jurors, he spent a lot of time with me because I was a native New Yorker from the streets he loved and he wrote many books which deal with urbanity, cities and New York such as:\nArchitecture; the Natural and the Manmade and\nAmerican Architecture and Urbanism,\n\nAnd I worked for such architects as:\n\u2022Kahn and Jacobs designing high-rise office buildings\n\u2022Edward Durrell Stone, designing the State University in Albany.\n\u2022Morris Lapidus assigned me to design and detail high-rise apartment buildings and hotels and finally used my drawing as examples of his offices work in his book. Morris Lapidus was born in 1902 and brought the ambience of Odessa Russia to create the curvy, flamboyant Neo-baroque modern hotels that defined the 1950s 'Miami Beach' resort hotel style. He died at the age of 98 in Miami Beach, Florida. As a young man, Lapidus toyed with theatrical set design and studied architecture at Columbia University where I met my wife Christina. \nTruly, an urban thinker Lapidus worked for 20 years as a retail designer before moving to Miami Beach in the 1940s and designing his first buildings. \n\n\n\nHe was a product and espoused urbanism in all his work. \nAfter a career in innovative retail interior design, his first large commission was the Miami Beach Sans Souci Hotel, followed closely by the Nautilus, the Di Lido, the Biltmore Terrace, and the Algiers, all along Collins Avenue, and amounting to the single-handed redesign of an entire district now known as South Beach. The hotels were an immediate popular success. Then in 1952 he landed the job of the largest luxury hotel in Miami Beach, the property he is most associated with, the Fontainebleau Hotel, which was followed the next year by the equally successful Eden Roc and the Americana (now the Sheraton Bal Harbor) in 1956. His son Alan who practices architecture in Fort Lauderdale survives him. \n\u2022Designs for Business and Gerald Luss assigned me to design very expensive huge interior spaces for banks, factoring companies and manufactures. \n\u2022Frederick Kiesler for whom I built the model for the Dome for the Dead Scrolls Museum in Israel.\n\u2022Serge Chermayeff for whom I did the graphics for his report using his theory of complementarities to the US bureau of Standards of Cites, campus and town planning. \n\u2022I was invited to teach Real Estate Development to Architectural students at the University of Houston and where ever I taught architecture in America I always urged students to get out of their suburbs and rural communities and learn \u201cNew York 101\u201d. They could not really be architects unless they learned the lesson New York had to teach, lessons, which I learned in the first 21 years of my life. \n\nWhat are the Events and Projects that shaped New York?\n1. Settlers after the Revolution\n2. Port for trade and shipbuilding\n3. Clearing up the squalor\n4. Fire codes\n5. Building codes\n6. Establishing the architectural profession and American Institute of \n Architects General Conditions between builders and Owners\n7. Subways: Irish and great engineering; tunnels\n8. Grand Central Station and Park Ave Railroad project\n9. Stock Exchange\n10. Air travel and airports\n11. Robert Moses: parks and recreation\n12. Quantity of wealthy merchants that settled and made their business \nin New York City such as Rockefeller, Astor, Mellon, Vanderbilt, Tiffany, etc. \n13. Landmarks Legislation and preservation\n14. Broadway, vaudeville, theatre, opera, ballet, museums, planetarium, parks,\n15. Central Park\n16. Consolidating the boroughs in to one city government\n17. Use of iron, steel and fireproofing. \n18. Invention of the Elevator brought the invention of the skyscrapers \nto Chicago and New York as well as the Eiffel tower to Paris. Indians learned to walk in the sky and the construction industry was unionized. \n19. Postal system delivering letters to every ones mailbox in every apartment, rain, sleet or snow. \n20. The attack on the World Trade Center\n Are there events and that caused a city you know to loose its\u2019 population or quality of life? \n\nHere are the Projects that negatively affected New York City.\n\u2022 Robert Moses and his highways, which destroyed/divided neighborhoods and reduced the values of building and occupancy\n\u2022 A combination of affluence by tenants increased demand for improvements to rental properties, which could not be met by landlords due to increased property taxes and cost of construction. Building owners, contractors and real-estate business found low priced and unrestricted properties in adjacent unincorporated counties on which to build low cost and attractive housing. This along with Government backed home mortgages and veteran\u2019s low-cost loans prompted the creation of what we call suburbs and later sub divisions, Planned Unit Developments, and New towns. The exodus out of the big cities devastated inner city neighborhoods and brought in drug dealers and crime. \n\u2022 The exodus nurtured itself as the more people left the worse things got. I remember how people would seek to go to Long Island and Westchester County to get bigger and more affordable housing.\n\u2022 \u201cProject\u201d buildings replaced \u201ctenements\u201d which destroyed neighborhoods and housed families within floors of large-scale buildings; the resulting anonymity became a perfect cover for the illegal sale of drugs.\n\u2022 Crime and narcotics moved into slums as Fort Apache #14 Precinct in the Bronx my old neighborhood in the Morrisania area of the South Bronx.\n\u2022 Low-cost new houses in the emerging suburbs were built off of unpaved roads in Long Island where you could buy a house with no-to-low interest VA loan for houses costing between $2,500 up to $6,000 made access possible by the construction of Triborough Bridge, Whitestone Bridge, the Long Island Expressway and the Grand Central Parkway. \n \nWhat are the inherent negatives about a big old city and the Urban State of Mind?\nDespite all the wonderful things in a city its scale, size and complexity brings, rats, roaches, gangs, crime, murder, rape, theft, security and problems meaning that everyone has to be cautious about the time of day and the streets and neighborhoods visited. \nThe city is not elegant but bawdy, vulgar and always on the cutting of edge of changing, de-construction, rebuilding as it adopts to new demands by commerce, demographics, economics and commercial opportunity. The city thrives on commerce and the labor of its inhabitants. It also is a self-redesigning, rebuilding and healing engine of humanity. \nAll of these provide anecdotal justifications for corporate developers to market to fleeing residents. \n \nWhat are the causes of renewed interest in urbanization?\n\u2022 Suburbs cost is becoming too high and unaffordable\n\u2022 Improved facilities for education and jobs in the city.\n\u2022 Quality of Life\n\u2022 Environmental, ecology and health \n\u2022 Education\n\u2022 Recreation, entertainment, and access\n\u2022 Commercial development and socialization \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs there an ideal urban natural city?\nMost ideal urban settings are broken down into communities and neighborhoods. In my neighborhoods we had immediate access to fresh produce markets, entertainment, recreation, socialization, schools in walking distance, public transportation including busses and subways, commercial development shops and shopping street, Cops on the beat, playgrounds, and a ethnically diverse neighborhood of friends and neighbors.\n \nThe key features of the apartment in the tenement in which we lived \nThese features originated with the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism, building codes and available technologies. \n\u2022Outside stoop\n\u2022Set back adjacent to the sidewalk\n\u2022Auto parking on the street\n\u2022The metal stairs down to the cellar in front of the building\n\u2022Place for coal deliveries and ash pick-up\n\u2022Cellar had a giant coal burning furnace and place for the pile of coal\n\u2022The vertical black painted iron grille\n\u2022The fire escapes on the front and rear of the building in front of most of the out facing windows.\n\u2022 The cornices on top of each building which form a frame to the line of the buildings, accentuate the line and evenness of the buildings, cap between the canyon formed by the buildings and the sky\n\u2022The mailbox area in back of the ground floor (We never changed it keep the rent control in place)\n\u2022The inner lobby with large glass doors and white marble steps and landing\n\u2022 The front door to our apartment, which was notably: \"A\u201d, being the first one on the ground floor directly facing the street but separated by an eight foot access way with steel stair leading to the basement and surrounded by black steel vertical guard rail.\n\u2022The gas stove in the kitchen\n\u2022The ice box and the first refrigerator with its leaking ammonia\n\u2022Window box pantry in the kitchen\n\u2022Cloths line into the alley from our kitchen window\n\u2022The alley\n\u2022Window with their stained glass clerestory windows. \n\u2022 Painted-over windows, which got stuck and were very difficult to open because of broken chains, weights and paint.\n\u2022Linoleum floors described elsewhere\n\u2022Parquet floors\n\u2022 French doors between living room and my bedroom\n\u2022 Radiators and steam heat with radiator covers to add humidity\n\u2022The cocker roaches and mice\n\u2022Garbage pails and sanitation trucks and collection\n\u2022 Police car and fire engine horns, bells and sirens\n\u2022 Painting the apartment every two years because the led paint would peal, fall on the floor and get dirty\n\u2022 Molding and baseboards on the walls\n\u2022 Bathtub with legs\n\u2022 Roof tops, entrances, tarpaper, and games and play areas.\n\u2022 Fire hydrants in the summer\n\u2022 Parking cars; alternate side of the street; snow; cleaning the car\n\u2022 Street games: tag, rig-a-leev-eo, hopscotch, stick- ball, skating, foot scooter, race box with skate wheels below\n\u2022 Fie-escapes\n\u2022 Loews Movie Theatres: All lived together in tight quarters and went to the Loews movie theaters, which were furnished and designed to look like palaces. \nIf you were to visit your favorite city what would be the places you would want to see? \n\nIf I were to visit New York today, I would want to be a pedestrian because being a pedestrian is what I miss most about not being in an urban context to go:\n\u2022 window-shopping on Fifth Avenue\n\u2022 Visit Henri Bendels, Tiffany\u2019s, Sacks, Bloomingdale\u2019s, etc.\n\u2022 Ambulate on the boulevards and side streets\n\u2022 Explore the subways \n\u2022 Climb the stairs of the train\u2019s elevated structures\n\u2022 Visit lobbies; see my old residences and streets\n\u2022 Snack pizzas and hot dogs as we walk \n\u2022 Visit Radio city Music Hall and Radio City underground\n\u2022 See the Rockefeller Center and Central Park ice skating rinks\n\u2022 Ride on the Staten Island Ferry\n\u2022 Visit the little mini-new town off of City Island\n\u2022 See my old schools\n\u2022 Walk down Southern Boulevard, Broadway and 42-nd streets\n\u2022 Visit central park\n\u2022 Visit the Bronx Zoo \n\u2022 Visit the new Hayden Planetarium\n\u2022 Visit Coney Island and get an Original Nathan\u2019s Frankfurter\n\u2022 Walk down some back alleys and side streets\n\nOne and a Half Hour has elapsed. Now there may be time (20 minutes) for questions and comments. \n\nConclusion:\nMy thesis that a \u201cCulture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d assumes that increases in population and density culture our personal, family and business. We are cosmopolitan and urban as we agree, disagree, peruse common goals, tolerate stress and congestion, discern between community and privacy and distribute precious resources. I hope I have shown \u201cwhat can be done to make cities livable and worthy to be called home\u201d. The Culture of Cosmopolitan Urbanism\u201d wants \u201clivability\u201d to be home. I believe the culture of cosmopolitan urbanism is life\u2019s experience and a legacy worth cherishing and conveying.\n \nAt the beginning, I asked if there was an urban issue you would like to discuss or question you\u2019d like to ask. Does anyone have an urban concern or solution? \nAs time may permit:\n\u2022 Are you now better prepared to understand, perceive and choose your urban context?\n\u2022 Do you have a vision for your home, block, neighborhood, community, county and city? \n\u2022Can you name some large, medium and small cities? \n\u2022Which is your favorite city and why?\n\u2022Can you identify cities with closed and bounded space?\n\u2022Can you identify cities with open and sculptural spaces?\n\u2022What makes you curious? Is it medicine, law, cities, politics, what?\n\u2022Do you see a role for yourself in the creation, reinvention and improvement of your city?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 25894013,

Kant's changing position has been the subject of extensive debates that have, however, not recognized the central place of colonialism in the political, economic, and military debates in Europe in which Kant was writing. Based on historical evidence not previously considered alongside Perpetual Peace, I suggest that Kant's leading concern at the time of writing is the negative effect of European expansionism and intra-European rivalry over colonial possessions on the possibility of peace in Europe. Because of the lack of affinity between colonial conflict and his philosophy of history, Kant must adjust his concept of antagonism to distinguish between war between particular dyads, in particular spaces, and with particular non-state actors. I examine the implications of this argument for Kant's system of Right and conclude that his anti-colonialism co-exists with hierarchical views of race.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 53109010, "asset_id": 32991589, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3414476, "first_name": "In\u00e9s", "last_name": "Valdez", "domain_name": "osu", "page_name": "In\u00e9sValdez", "display_name": "In\u00e9s Valdez", "profile_url": "https://osu.academia.edu/In%C3%A9sValdez?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3414476/9594962/89012574/s65_in_s.valdez.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 133, "name": "Military History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Military_History?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 135, "name": "Intellectual History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 813, "name": "Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Philosophy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 849, "name": "Kant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kant?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1166, "name": "International Relations Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1696, "name": "Political Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1911, "name": "International Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 2432, "name": "Critical Race Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 2575, "name": "International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Law?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3277, "name": "Race and Racism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Racism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3872, "name": "War Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/War_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 4486, "name": "Political Science", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_Science?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5231, "name": "Eighteenth Century History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Eighteenth_Century_History?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5247, "name": "Critical Race Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5321, "name": "International Human Rights Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Human_Rights_Law?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5960, "name": "Continental Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Continental_Philosophy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6027, "name": "Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Enlightenment?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6028, "name": "Kant-studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kant-studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6556, "name": "Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Colonialism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 7560, "name": "Public International Law", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Public_International_Law?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 7978, "name": "Political History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Political_History?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 8291, "name": "Kant's Practical Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kants_Practical_Philosophy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 9405, "name": "Post-Colonialism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Colonialism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 9465, "name": "Philosophy of History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_of_History?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 9690, "name": "Intellectual History of Enlightenment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intellectual_History_of_Enlightenment?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 14457, "name": "Emmanuel Kant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Emmanuel_Kant?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 15150, "name": "British Imperial and Colonial History (1600 -

In this new world order, great empires had to leave their autonomy to the nation-states, which arose within those empires. This conversion taking place at the beginning of the century was only a rebellion for Russian nations, which is limited to a change of regime. As a matter of fact the empires were destroyed, but the expected nation states did not emerge, or more precisely the Bolsheviks did not allow them to do so. These nations could only gain their independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the century. In order to consolidate the legitimacy of their delayed independence, the Turkish speaking nations among the Soviet communities redesigned the concepts of land, flag, language, history and similar elements that refer to the uniqueness of the nation and the state, on the basis of nationalism. In this respect, Azerbaijan, which made its political choice in favor of being a nation-state, started to redesign its history and identity with a national perspective. However, since this process developed in line with political upheaval, the national historiography of Azerbaijan could not adopt a permanent shape.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 44121070,

understand the global in recent times. His understanding of cosmopolitanism is rooted in how current academic discourse is concerned with theorising about the organisation and reconstruction of social and cultural life within a global framework. This essay seeks to address the cosmopolitan nature of Beck\u2019s \u2018Cosmopolitanism\u2019.  In other words, how cosmopolitan is Beck\u2019s \u2018Cosmopolitanism\u2019? The recent rise of postcolonial discourse has raised a number of objections to the way in which academia understands the cultures and histories of the \u2018Other\u2019 (Chakrabarty 1992). These objections point to the inadequacy of \u2018European\u2019 categories in understanding the \u2018Other\u2019. Beck\u2019s cosmopolitanism seeks to redress this inadequacy, but, as I shall argue below, he falls short in his remedial process and is guilty of the very same inadequacy that he seeks to amend.

Its aim is to provide an innovative understanding of youth studies in a global context based on multiscalar, multilevel, multisite, and multidisciplinary approaches. Young people both are affected by and are the actors of the globalization of everyday life. Drawing on both theoretical and empirical research, the journal explores how young people relate to globality and its outcomes. To open this discussion, the Journal starts with an issue devoted to understanding the global generation through the lenses of the cosmopolitan approach. It discusses four major criticisms and provides a counter position to. In the first case, cosmopol-itanism is too often considered as a natural consequence of globalization, while in the second as being too ethnocentric. In the third case, cosmopolitanism has been assimilated to the ideology of contemporary global capitalism and in the fourth case it is mocked as a mere utopia. The papers gathered here investigate values, norms, behaviors and practices related to esthetic, cultural, ethic and political cosmopolitanisms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 59452407,

It engages with a number of questions. What exactly constitutes \u201ccosmopolitanism\u201d today? Should we regard it as a term that describes a particular cast of mind, a geopolitical situation or an ethical obligation? How does it relate to globalization (another chameleon term) and other economies and discursive systems that have crossed national boundaries, such as colonialism and postcolonialism?  Is it reasonable to speak of cosmopolitanism in the singular or should we be talking about cosmopolitanisms plural? And do contemporary uses of the term have much in common with earlier understandings of what might constitute \u201ccosmopolitanism\u201d? The essay particularly concerns itself with the Western reception of postcolonial literary cosmopolitanisms and discusses work by Aravind Adiga, V.S. Naipaul, Derek Walcott and Michael Ondaatje.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55773426, "asset_id": 35893637, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 730704, "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Thieme", "domain_name": "eastanglia", "page_name": "JohnThieme", "display_name": "John Thieme", "profile_url": "https://eastanglia.academia.edu/JohnThieme?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/730704/249724/295128/s65_john.thieme.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2860, "name": "Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11354, "name": "Globalization And Postcolonial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_And_Postcolonial_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 12493, "name": "Derek Walcott", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Derek_Walcott?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 15863, "name": "Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 132900, "name": "Commonwealth and Postcolonial Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Commonwealth_and_Postcolonial_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 223407, "name": "V.s.

First, it will review the core presumption of the field of IIE, that being the demand for an inter- mission in the pursuit of a founding philosophy for IE in order to first address the philosophical biases of IE by western philosophy. Second, a history of the various philosophical streams of IIE will be outlined, including its literature and pioneering contributors. Lastly, a new synthesis of comparative philosophies in IIE will be offered, looking towards a future evolution of the field. Examining the interchange between contemporary information ethicists regarding the discipline of IIE, the review first outlines the previously established presumptions of the field of IIE that posit the need for an IE as grounded in western sensibilities. The author then addresses the implications of the foregoing presumption from several non-western viewpoints, arguing that IIE does in fact find roots in non-western philosophies as established in the concluding synthesis of western and eastern philosophical traditions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52314076, "asset_id": 9961776, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

Theories and Practices of Cultural Cosmopolitanism_ (co-edited by Didier Coste, Christina Kkona, and Nicoletta Pireddu; winner of the 2023 American Comparative Literature Association 'Ren\u00e9 Wellek Prize for the Best Edited Collection\") is a collection of innovative interdisciplinary essays on cosmopolitanism, written by leading scholars from different continents who engage with paramount aesthetic, ethical, political, historical, and pedagogical issues.\r\nAs the title implies, the volume discusses cosmopolitanism as an attitude and a thought process, but also as an object of fictional, documentary, and social representations, trying to move away from the divisive premise of radical difference, and implying, instead, that all communities are traversed by differentiations, oppositions and contradictions. Authors propose a solidarity of reason, able to craft interpretive norms and teaching methods that transcend exclusive localisms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74466047, "asset_id": 43962467, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 196955, "first_name": "Didier", "last_name": "COSTE", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "DidierCOSTE", "display_name": "Didier COSTE", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/DidierCOSTE?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/196955/90989/98965/s65_didier.coste.jpg"}, {"id": 2160367, "first_name": "Nicoletta", "last_name": "Pireddu", "domain_name": "georgetown", "page_name": "NicolettaPireddu", "display_name": "Nicoletta  Pireddu", "profile_url": "https://georgetown.academia.edu/NicolettaPireddu?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2160367/6994837/7886846/s65_nicoletta.pireddu.jpg"}, {"id": 4184626, "first_name": "Christina", "last_name": "Kkona", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "ChristinaKkona", "display_name": "Christina Kkona", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/ChristinaKkona?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4184626/1638891/12857263/s65_christina.kkona.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2308, "name": "Multilingualism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multilingualism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6694, "name": "Global Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 298157, "name": "Cosmopolitanism and Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism_and_Globalization?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 540217, "name": "Cosmopolitanism and Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism_and_Nationalism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 986275, "name": "Cosmopolitan Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Citizenship?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1302691, "name": "Cosmpolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmpolitanism?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 13448216, "title": "On Migrant Politics:  An Interview with Thomas Nail", "created_at": "2015-06-30T09:56:56.369-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/13448216/On_Migrant_Politics_An_Interview_with_Thomas_Nail?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_13448216", "summary": "An interview with Hostis: a Journal of Incivility on the politics of migration, revolution, and neoliberalism.

"The concept of the national is often perceived, both in public and academic discourse as the central obstacle for the realization of cosmopolitan orientations. Consequently, debates about the nation tend to revolve around its persistence or its demise. We depart from this either-or perspective by investigating the formation of the \u2018cosmopolitan nation\u2019 as a facet of world risk society. Modern collectivities are increasingly preoccupied with debating, preventing and managing risks. However, unlike earlier manifestations of risk characterized by daring actions or predictability models, global risks can no longer be calculated or forecast. Accordingly, more influence accrues to the perception of risk, largely constructed by media representations.\nCosmopolitanized risk collectivities are engendered through the anticipation of endangered futures which are, for the most part, communicated through an increasingly global media scape. While global media events produce shared exposure, risk conceptions retain distinctive political-cultural features as their respective meanings are prefigured by path-dependent pasts. Nevertheless, the promulgation of risk societies, we argue, results in a reimagination of nationhood which takes place in the context of: global norms (e.g. human rights); globalized markets; transnational migrations; global generations and their embeddedness in civil society movements; and the local interpenetration of world religions to name but a few of the global backdrops shaping new associational intersections. We develop our argument in four interrelated\nsteps. Contrary to essentialized notions of nationalism or universal versions of cosmopolitanism, we address the cosmopolitan reconfiguration of nationhood by differentiating between presumptions of thick belonging and the actual proliferation of cosmopolitan affiliations. In a second step we overcome the territorial fixation of the social sciences by shifting our attention to temporal dimensions, with a particular focus on competing conceptions of the future. In a third step we demonstrate how these cosmopolitan transformations of nationhood are taking place in the context of a world risk society regime that marshals a set of cosmopolitan imperatives situating the global other in our midst. In a fourth step we illustrate these developments by exploring how the mediatization of risk, and concomitant notions of the future, contribute to the reimagination of cosmopolitan risk collectivities.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36516745, "asset_id": 10514548, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15207659, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Levy", "domain_name": "sbsuny", "page_name": "DLevy", "display_name": "Daniel Levy", "profile_url": "https://sbsuny.academia.edu/DLevy?f_ri=3556", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 47830, "name": "Solidarity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Solidarity?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 952766, "name": "World Risk Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Risk_Theory?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 7734357, "title": "'Work, Freedom and National Dignity: Male unemployed graduate activists in post-revolutionary Tunis", "created_at": "2014-07-21T05:55:08.063-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7734357/Work_Freedom_and_National_Dignity_Male_unemployed_graduate_activists_in_post_revolutionary_Tunis?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_7734357", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 34256409, "asset_id": 7734357, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5410655, "first_name": "Touraj", "last_name": "Eghtesad", "domain_name": "vu-nl", "page_name": "TourajEghtesad", "display_name": "Touraj Eghtesad", "profile_url": "https://vu-nl.academia.edu/TourajEghtesad?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/5410655/2377293/2768947/s65_touraj.eghtesad.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 17123, "name": "Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democracy?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 41608, "name": "Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Citizenship?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 50883, "name": "Anthropology of Civil Society", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Civil_Society?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 107582, "name": "Transition to Democracy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Transition_to_Democracy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 198038, "name": "Graduate unemployment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Graduate_unemployment?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 221196, "name": "Tunisian Revolution-Arab Spring", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Tunisian_Revolution-Arab_Spring?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 230948, "name": "Youth Unemployment", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Youth_Unemployment?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 770991, "name": "Anthropology of Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_of_Social_Movements?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 2487837, "title": "Cosmopolitanism and international trade unionism: Managerial and mobilising forms", "created_at": "2013-01-29T22:40:47.293-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/2487837/Cosmopolitanism_and_international_trade_unionism_Managerial_and_mobilising_forms?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_2487837", "summary": "This conceptual article argues that the well-established sociological concept of cosmopolitanism has been inadequately applied to organised labour, and specifically to international activities of trade unions.

In answer to the first question, it seeks to show how the development of cosmopolitanism assumes radically different forms among union members and managerial elites. In answer to the second question, it typologises international trade unionism using two categories termed \u2018managerial\u2019 and \u2018mobilising\u2019 internationalisms.

From the colonial pepper trade and Narayana Guru\u2019s philosophical engagement with the question of caste, to the seemingly disparate elements that weave together an \u2018eclectic past\u2019 through the Muziris Heritage Project; from the debates on women\u2019s sexuality around the Suryanelli rape case, to the gendered constitution of public space during the mass annual Attukal Pongala ritual; from the changes in state attitude towards providing piped water supply to how Cochin port\u2019s inter-War history has scripted the story of urban modernity; from the shaping of the public sphere to the radical Left politics of the 1970s and the emergence of popular janapriya literature\u2014this book analyses the ideas, spaces and practices that intricately weave the region\u2019s experiences of modernity. Kerala Modernity emphasizes the methodological need to re-examine the idea of \u2018region\u2019 as a discursive category to explore Kerala\u2019s regional modernity apart from Eurocentric and nation-centric frames of analyses. The interdisciplinary presentation\u2014complete with a Dalit critique of modernity in the Foreword\u2014will be an important contribution to literature on Kerala and the debates on alternative modernities in South Asia. It will be of interest to students and scholars of history, sociology and literary and cultural studies, as well as the interested general reader.

Daniel Chernilo reassesses social theory's universalistic orientation and explains its origins in natural law theory, using an impressive array of classical and contemporary sources that include, among others, Habermas, Leo Strauss, Weber, Marx, Hegel, Rousseau and Hobbes. The Natural Law Foundations of Modern Social Theory challenges previous accounts of the rise of social theory, recovers a strong idea of humanity, and revisits conventional arguments on sociology's relationship to modernity, the enlightenment and natural law. It reconnects social theory to its scientific and philosophical roots, its descriptive and normative tasks and its historical and systematic planes. Chernilo\u2019s defense of universalism for contemporary social theory will surely engage students of sociology, political theory and moral philosophy alike.

They substantiate the idea that cosmopolitanism is no privilege of the rich and well-connected and that physical or spatial mobility is not a necessary condition to become cosmopolitan. Paradoxically, the guides\u2019 dreams of becoming more cosmopolitan (and more modern and Western) can only materialise if they represent to tourists their lifeworld, including themselves, as frozen in both time and space, because it is exactly this kind of imaged and imagined difference tourism sells to tourists for the build-up of their own cosmopolitan capital.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7576939, "asset_id": 1199184, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2278, "first_name": "Noel B.", "last_name": "Salazar", "domain_name": "kuleuven", "page_name": "NoelBSalazar", "display_name": "Noel B.

Through an ethnography of Chinese-Indonesian female migrants in Perth, Western Australia and their dances, this paper provides a window into understanding an intertwining of 'glocal' affiliations and cosmopolitan self-representations. Representing the largest visible group of Indonesian migrants in Australia, the Chinese 'descend-ants' (keturunan) perform as Indonesian traditional dancers on the Australian multicultural stage, to 'celebrate the institutions of the state(s) in which [they] live' (Appiah 1997, 633). Nevertheless and perhaps inevitably, this cosmopatriot identity was often tinted with uncertainty due to the ambiguity surrounding their positioning as a legally and culturally accepted ethnic group in Indonesia. When viewed as 'ethnic' dancers from Jakarta, these women were seen as 'legitimate' cultural representatives; the Indonesian migrant community accepted the discourse of Chinese historical settlement in Jakarta, creating a cultural syncretic influence. However, their own internal sense of belonging was disrupted, particularly due to the lingering memory of the violent 'May Riots' of 1998, which targeted Chinese-Indonesians. For many, the uncertainty generated by this violent episode became the reason for migration and settlement in Perth. Migration, the Australian multicultural stage, and a cosmopolitan worldview thus provide the spaces for Chinese Indonesians to express a cosmopatriotic affiliation with Indonesia despite the traumas of the riots and the realities of being in a neighbouring country.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 50632073, "asset_id": 30174313, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 686807, "first_name": "Monika", "last_name": "Winarnita", "domain_name": "deakin", "page_name": "MonikaWinarnita", "display_name": "Monika S Winarnita", "profile_url": "https://deakin.academia.edu/MonikaWinarnita?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/686807/355117/29226196/s65_monika.winarnita.png"}, {"id": 12397674, "first_name": "Natalie", "last_name": "Araujo", "domain_name": "latrobe", "page_name": "NatalieAraujo", "display_name": "Natalie Araujo", "profile_url": "https://latrobe.academia.edu/NatalieAraujo?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/12397674/3548453/14454423/s65_natalie.araujo.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3499, "name": "Social and Cultural Anthropology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_and_Cultural_Anthropology?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9043, "name": "Performance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Performance?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 12162105, "title": "To Know the World is to Advocate for it", "created_at": "2015-04-30T01:23:48.072-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/12162105/To_Know_the_World_is_to_Advocate_for_it?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_12162105", "summary": "This paper is a response to the graduate seminar on Cosmopolitan Anthropology\u00a0convened by Kristin Kuutma at the University of Tartu, Estonia on the 14th and 15th of\u00a0January 2015. The three presenters at the seminar were Nigel Rapport (University of St\u00a0Andrews), Huon Wardle (University of St Andrews) and Andrew Irving (University of\u00a0Manchester).\n\nThe goal behind this review is to outline some of the core ideas associated with \"Cosmopolitan Anthropology\", its case for ethnography, and its political contribution. \n\nThe paper concludes the following: \n\nWe, as researchers, author the world. We do not pretend that our ethnographies are a re-presentation, a one-to-one translation of reality. Our ethnographies are mediated through a long list of conditions, which question any direct line of authorship. Perhaps a more productive way would be to address our ethnographies not as mirror images of the world, bare descriptions, analyses of the world, or the products of our society, but to see them as constitutive elements of the world. That what we offer to our readers is not an exegesis of the world but an appropriation of it, the proposal of a context rather than an illustration of a pre-existing one. If there is a lesson that I get from cosmopolitanism is the possibility that the world is made of itself and we are constitutive parts of it. As such, to know the world is to acknowledge it and advocate for it.\u00a0", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37464878, "asset_id": 12162105, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

the lives of female prostitutes in Durban's dockside sex sector. They solicit at a nightclub catering to foreign sailors. The paper considers their experiences as sex workers and how they deal with stigmatization, family concerns, chemical abuse, moral dilemmas, diseases, and violence. It assesses their fears and frustrations. And it ponders their dreams and longings for what they hope to achieve through this work.\r\n\r\nThe article concludes with the idea that dockside women are relatively empowered compared to their streetwalking & brothel-working counterparts. Since most hail from upcountry locales, they successfully live \"double lives\" that protect them from family and communal reprisal. Since their clients are foreign transients, the men pose no threat to their identities (they have no social power outside the dockside world). Since the women solicit from a safe nightclub, they retain the right of refusal. And because they're the knowledgeable locals, they choose the location of sex, which enhances their power to insist on condom-use.\r\n\r\nIronically, these upcountry women are perhaps the most cosmopolitan citizens of Durban as they entertain dozens of nationalities every evening.\"", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 86108, "asset_id": 164946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}, {"id": 31326614, "asset_id": 164946, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 18297, "first_name": "Henry", "last_name": "Trotter", "domain_name": "yale", "page_name": "HenryTrotter", "display_name": "Henry Trotter", "profile_url": "https://yale.academia.edu/HenryTrotter?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/18297/6152/13648428/s65_henry.trotter.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 379, "name": "African Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 975, "name": "Sex and Gender", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex_and_Gender?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2825, "name": "Power (social)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Power_social_?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3165, "name": "Maritime History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime_History?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3896, "name": "African History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/African_History?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 4571, "name": "Sex", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sex?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 4714, "name": "Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 4917, "name": "Gender and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5273, "name": "Class", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Class?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5947, "name": "Anthropology and Sexuality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Anthropology_and_Sexuality?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 9163, "name": "Shipping", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Shipping?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 12958, "name": "South Africa (History)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/South_Africa_History_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 14998, "name": "Gender and Sexuality Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gender_and_Sexuality_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 21003, "name": "Sexuality And Culture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sexuality_And_Culture?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 24920, "name": "Prostitution & Trafficking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Prostitution_and_Trafficking?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 30708, "name": "Indian Ocean Ports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Indian_Ocean_Ports?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 31619, "name": "Ports and Harbours", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ports_and_Harbours?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 53238, "name": "Race", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 60807, "name": "Maritime", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Maritime?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 63770, "name": "Seafarers", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Seafarers?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 272236, "name": "Durban", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Durban?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 280310, "name": "Ports", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ports?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 66962492, "title": "Kerala Modernity: Ideas, Spaces and Practices in Transition", "created_at": "2022-01-03T09:31:31.020-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/66962492/Kerala_Modernity_Ideas_Spaces_and_Practices_in_Transition?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_66962492", "summary": "The southwest coast of India has always been a significant site within the global network of relations through trade and exchange of ideas, commodities, technologies, skills and labour. The much longer history of colonial experience makes Kerala\u2019s engagement with modernity polyvalent and complex. Without understanding the multiple space-times of this region, it is impossible to make sense of the complexities of Kerala modernity beyond its general description as \u2018Malayalee modernity\u2019. From the colonial pepper trade and Narayana Guru\u2019s philosophical engagement with the question of caste, to the seemingly disparate elements that weave together an \u2018eclectic past\u2019 through the Muziris Heritage Project; from the debates on women\u2019s sexuality around the Suryanelli rape case, to the gendered constitution of public space during the mass annual Attukal Pongala ritual; from the changes in state attitude towards providing piped water supply to how Cochin port\u2019s inter-War history has scripted the story of urban modernity; from the shaping of the public sphere to the radical Left politics of the 1970s and the emergence of popular janapriya literature\u2014this book analyses the ideas, spaces and practices that intricately weave the region\u2019s experiences of modernity. Kerala Modernity emphasizes the methodological need to re-examine the idea of \u2018region\u2019 as a discursive category to explore Kerala\u2019s regional modernity apart from Eurocentric and nation-centric frames of analyses. The interdisciplinary presentation\u2014complete with a Dalit critique of modernity in the Foreword\u2014will be an important contribution to literature on Kerala and the debates on alternative modernities in South Asia. It will be of interest to students and scholars of history, sociology and literary and cultural studies, as well as the interested general reader.

It studies the transition from national to cosmopolitan memory cultures. Cosmopolitanism refers to a process of \u2018internal globalization\u2019 through which global concerns become part of local experiences of an increasing number of people. Global media representations, among others, create new cosmopolitan memories, providing new epistemological vantage points and emerging moral-political interdependencies. The article traces the historical roots of this transformation and outlines the theoretical foundations for the emergence of cosmopolitan memories through an examination of how the Holocaust has been remembered in Germany, Israel and the USA in the course of the last fifty years. It is precisely\r\nthe abstract nature of \u2018good and evil\u2019 that symbolizes the Holocaust, which contributes to the extra-territorial quality of cosmopolitan memory.

significant site within the global network of relations through trade and exchange of ideas, commodities, technologies, skills and labour. The much longer history of colonial experience makes Kerala\u2019s engagement with modernity polyvalent and complex. Without understanding the multiple space-times of this region, it is impossible to make sense of the complexities of Kerala modernity beyond its general description as \u2018Malayalee modernity\u2019. From the colonial pepper trade and Narayana Guru\u2019s philosophical engagement with the question of caste, to the seemingly disparate elements that weave together an \u2018eclectic past\u2019 through the Muziris Heritage Project; from the debates on women\u2019s sexuality around the Suryanelli rape case, to the gendered constitution of public space during the mass annual Attukal Pongala ritual; from the changes in state attitude towards providing piped water supply to how Cochin port\u2019s inter-War history has scripted the story of urban modernity; from the shaping of the public sphere to the radical Left politics of the 1970s and the emergence of popular janapriya literature\u2014this book analyses the ideas, spaces and practices that intricately weave the region\u2019s experiences of modernity. Kerala Modernity emphasizes the methodological need to re-examine the idea of \u2018region\u2019 as a discursive category to explore Kerala\u2019s regional modernity apart from Eurocentric and nation-centric frames of analyses. The interdisciplinary presentation\u2014complete with a Dalit critique of modernity in the Foreword\u2014will be an important contribution to literature on Kerala and the debates on alternative modernities in South Asia. It will be of interest to students and scholars of history, sociology and literary and cultural studies, as well as the interested general reader.

However, before we plough into the theoretical abyss that awaits us, we first need to find the answer to the question: How does a cosmopolitan think? The answer to this is not as straightforward as one may imagine. Of course, we could have a simple triadic model of cosmopolitanism beginning with an ultimate unit of analysis, say, humanity, that this is an absolute claim, that is that it impartially applied, and from this we have the possibility of the cosmopolitan imagination. This imagination, it is claimed by many cosmopolitan thinkers and activists gives us a platform to see beyond parochial concerns to instead focus on wider worldly issues. However, as was discussed in the introduction the moral history of cosmopolitanism gives rise to concern of its assimilatory proclivities. Therefore, rather than set out a conjunctive conceptual format that draws on global resources, itself an honourable tradition, one needs to be aware about what thinking like a cosmopolitan is really like.

These strategies, however, are incredibly diverse and often directly antagonistic of one another. Thus, this paper argues that in order to make sense of the seemingly multiple and contradictory political strategies deployed in the operation of the US/Mexico border wall, we have to understand the coexistence and intertwinement of at least three distinct types of power at work there: the sovereign exclusion of illegal life, the disciplinary detention of surveilled life, and the biopolitical circulation of migratory life. By doing so this paper offers an original contribution to two major areas of study: in Foucault studies this paper expands the existing literature on Foucault by analyzing the crossroads of power particular to the US/Mexico border wall, which has not yet been done, and in border studies this Foucauldian approach offers a unique political analysis that goes beyond the critique of sovereignty and toward an analysis of coexisting strategies of power.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 30731507, "asset_id": 2762648, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}],

This does not, on the other hand, imply that extensive forms of constitutional ordering do not exist outside the realm of states. Instead, the evolution of world society has been characterized by a protracted dual movement where the expansion and densification of statehood and autonomous forms of transnational ordering gradually emerged in a mutually constitutive fashion. One implication of this is that neither the concept of the state nor the concept of nonstate transnational entities is adequately capable of delineating the object of constitutional analysis. Instead, the concept of normative orders has been introduced as an overarching category capable of identifying the contexts within which constitutional ordering emerges. \r\nSubsequently, a distinction between the internal and external dimensions of the law of normative orders has been introduced, specifying them as respectively oriented towards establishing internal condensation of a given normative order and external compatibility between different normative orders. With this background, a framework for the analysis of constitutional frameworks of normative orders is developed. The central element is a distinction among three dimensions: First, a constitution implies a coupling between a constitutional object, in the form of a hierarchical organization of a given normative order capable of reproducing an autonomous source of authority, and a concordant legal framework. Second, constitutionalization implies a coupling between an internal reconstruction of an external constitutional subject within the constitutional object, and the register of legal rights, establishing a framework for exchanges between the constitutional object and the wider world as represented by the constitutional subject. Third, constitutionalism denotes the institutionalization of a double function, in the form of a principle-based and legally fortified striving toward universal inclusion, providing a sense of direction in time through an articulated form of constitutional consciousness. \r\nThe insights developed are briefly illustrated by the case of the global Fairtrade Certification System.\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 42709500, "asset_id": 5337301, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1103134, "first_name": "Poul F.", "last_name": "Kjaer", "domain_name": "cbs", "page_name": "PoulFKjaer", "display_name": "Poul F.

Place-making, as Doreen Massey (2005) and other social geographers remind us is a social process of human construction within a nexus of power. To understand migration as an ongoing site of creativity is to step outside of dominant discourses about migration that see migrants or migration as a social problem capable of threatening the very foundations of our society. The migrants as threat perspective makes the fundamental divide in the modern nation-state between natives and migrants. In contrast we ask : \u2018How do we go about singing a new song about migration?\u2018 That is to say, is there a way in which we can study migration as a contemporary and a historical phenomenon that is part of the social process that shapes all our lives? To approach migration this way would be to say that migration is part of what it has always meant to be human. \n\nThe question posed by this article is how all of us\u2014scholars, musicians, citizens of the world can step out of the migrant/native divide and still leave room to study and theorize creative processes that bring together the intertwining of cultural influences. How we can discard a concept of hybridity with its implications of a prior state of native purity and address the ongoing mutual interactions that unfold within migration processes. This is an ever pressing question for cultural theory in a world in which there is widespread migration and a cyberspace environment of multiple interconnections. Migration provides a base for theorizing cultural processes that extend beyond the specificity of people crossing borders.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 7230189, "asset_id": 1172034,

As evidence of that, Prime Minister Abe speech promoting Tokyo for the 2020 Olympic Games emphasized the  fact that the city was one of the safest in the world. However, dissatisfaction amongst Japans youth has frequently appeared in my  ethnography.  How  can  this  dissatisfaction  coexist  with  the  image  of  cohesion  and obedience that Japan sustains? In order to elaborate on this topic, this paper  introduces narratives from the dissatisfied youth in Japan that, due to seeing no prospect of change in  the  country,  have  opted  out  of  Japan  altogether,  preferring  to  live  their  lives  in countries  they  see  as  fitting  their  lifestyle  best.  More  than  discussing  this  phenomena through  the  lenses  of  class  privileges,  this  paper  also  sees  the  issues  surrounding  the choices   made   by   the   dissatisfied   young   Japanese   not   so   much   as   a   source   of cosmopolitan  subjectivity,  but  instead  as  a  condition  made possible  by  a  neoliberal ideology.  Such  ideology  commodifies  identities  and  notions  of  belonging,  shaping  the way the Japanese youth deal with dissent into more consumer oriented logics than those of  collective  politics  and  mobilization.  It  is  this  shift  from  the  citizen  to  the  consumer that, this paper argues, is behind the choice for escape rather than change.

period, factors such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or class made a number of American writers feel marginalized in U.S. society. Cosmopolitan Minds focuses on a core of transnational writers\u2014Kay Boyle, Pearl S. Buck, William Gardner Smith, Richard Wright, and Paul Bowles\u2014who found themselves prompted to seek experiences outside of their home country, experiences that profoundly changed their self-understanding and creative imagination as they encountered alternative points of views and cultural practices in Europe, Asia, and Africa. \r\n\r\nAlexa Weik von Mossner offers a new perspective on the affective underpinnings of critical and reflexive cosmopolitanism by drawing on theories of emotion and literary imagination from cognitive psychology, philosophy, and cognitive literary studies. She analyzes how physical dislocation, and the sometimes violent shifts in understanding that result from our affective encounters with others, led Boyle, Buck, Smith, Wright, and Bowles to develop new, cosmopolitan solidarities across national, ethnic, and religious boundaries. She also shows how, in their literary texts, these writers employed strategic empathy to provoke strong emotions such as love, sympathy, compassion, fear, anger, guilt, shame, and disgust in their readers in order to challenge their parochial worldviews and practices. Reading these texts as emotionally powerful indictments of institutionalized racism and national violence inside and outside of the United States, Weik von Mossner demonstrates that our emotional engagements with others\u2014real and imagined\u2014are crucially important for the development of transnational and cosmopolitan imaginations.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 39014522,

a space between two social structures, neither disconnected and separate from the previous, nor fully accepted and entered into the next. Globalisation reinforces the legacies of colonialism by imposing a new system of capitalist hierarchies and privileges, a system that Derrida argues displays a \u201ctendency to obstruct\u201d, and acts as a barrier to those without the vocabulary that enables access to hegemonic dis- courses of power and wealth. Traditionally, the postcolonial hybrid subject occupies this position of liminality, yet with the dismantling of imperialistic western ideas of empire and the changing ideas of decolonisation in both the fin de si\u00e8cles, representations of the Occident\u2019s cultural concerns and aesthetic preoccupations reveal its subjects to be struggling with the tensions between their allegiance to nationalistic scaffolds of identity formation and the emerging moral relativism of cosmopolitanism, a tension between city and State, the local and the global.

Lawrence and Samuel Beckett this tension, it will be argued, has characterised the West\u2019s engagement with the Other, and the consequent representations of Western subjectivity.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 37409556, "asset_id": 4951400, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 316937, "first_name": "Niven", "last_name": "Kumar", "domain_name": "mq", "page_name": "NivenKumar", "display_name": "Niven Kumar", "profile_url": "https://mq.academia.edu/NivenKumar?f_ri=3556", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7299, "name": "Victorian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Victorian_Literature?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8444, "name": "Modernist Literature (Literary Modernism)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Modernist_Literature_Literary_Modernism_?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 630949, "name": "Representations of Self", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Representations_of_Self?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 68897470, "title": "Mahimahi Musubi: Cosmopolitanizing Strategies in Hawaiian Regional Cuisine", "created_at": "2022-01-20T16:44:02.358-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/68897470/Mahimahi_Musubi_Cosmopolitanizing_Strategies_in_Hawaiian_Regional_Cuisine?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_68897470", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 79206428, "asset_id": 68897470, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6681541, "first_name": "W.

This trajectory allows readers to\nappreciate new historical, theoretical, aesthetic, and practical implications of cosmopolitanism that pertain to multiple genres\nand media, under different modes of production and reception.\nIn the de-territorialized landscape of Migrating Minds, mental and sentimental mobility, rather than the legacy of place, is the key\nto an efficient, humanist response to deadening globalization.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 74524748, "asset_id": 61514523, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 196955, "first_name": "Didier", "last_name": "COSTE", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "DidierCOSTE", "display_name": "Didier COSTE", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/DidierCOSTE?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/196955/90989/98965/s65_didier.coste.jpg"}, {"id": 4184626, "first_name": "Christina", "last_name": "Kkona", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "ChristinaKkona", "display_name": "Christina Kkona", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/ChristinaKkona?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/4184626/1638891/12857263/s65_christina.kkona.jpg"}, {"id": 2160367, "first_name": "Nicoletta", "last_name": "Pireddu", "domain_name": "georgetown", "page_name": "NicolettaPireddu", "display_name": "Nicoletta  Pireddu", "profile_url": "https://georgetown.academia.edu/NicolettaPireddu?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2160367/6994837/7886846/s65_nicoletta.pireddu.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 658, "name": "World Literatures", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Literatures?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1712, "name": "Globalisation and cultural change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalisation_and_cultural_change?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4195, "name": "Cultural Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 4850, "name": "Migration", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migration?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 13995, "name": "Postcolonial Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Postcolonial_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 15008, "name": "World Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 16088, "name": "Creolization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Creolization?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 16201, "name": "Ecocriticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ecocriticism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 19356, "name": "Universals", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Universals?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 28743, "name": "Comparative Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Education?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 34611, "name": "Exile Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 236190, "name": "Dissidence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Dissidence?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 308879, "name": "Cosmopolitismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitismo?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 58633688, "title": "The elusive woman", "created_at": "2021-10-17T11:02:20.204-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/58633688/The_elusive_woman?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_58633688", "summary": "to submit a paper for this seminar.

Barbara Antoniazzi's The Wayward Woman. Progressivism, Prostitution, and Performance in the United States, 1888-1917, despite its narrow scope, has the merit of being one of the rare works recasting the gender question at the turn of the century while addressing the association of female mobility with female sexuality. From early 20 th century modernism to postmodern, African-American and postcolonial literature, the revival of representations of female errancy, fugitivity and rebelliousness compose a great specter of antihegemonic poetics across different ethnic literatures, genres, and media. From Colette's The Vagabond (1910) to Proust's The Fugitive (1925) and Djuna Barnes' Nightwood (1936), and from Kateb Yacine's Nedjma (1952) to Tony Morisson's Beloved (1987), female wanderers and runaways reveal the literary, cultural and political relevance of a hitherto unstudied \"character,\" the male variants of which peopled the picaresque novel.

Palabras clave: Mario Vargas Llosa, El Para\u00edso en la otra esquina, globalizaci\u00f3n, libe-ralismo, novela hist\u00f3rica. \n\nAbstract \nThis paper analyzes El Para\u00edso en la otra esquina (2003), a historical novel that traces the socialist and nationalist trajectories of major figures of the nineteenth century. Vargas Llosa's notion of global citizenship is far from communist or socialist articulations, and emphasizes his well-known liberal positions. My reading shows that the parallel trajectories of Flora Trist\u00e1n and Paul Gauguin end tragically due to their ideological shortcomings. I contend that Vargas Llosa rewrites the Latin American historical novel by deterritorializing it, that is, by introducing figures and histories that transcend the continent. His re-articulation of this literary genre allows him to discuss contemporary ideas brought about by the era of globalisation, and tackle present-day issues.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58751127, "asset_id": 38670598, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3223051, "first_name": "Annik", "last_name": "Bilodeau", "domain_name": "majapasovic", "page_name": "AnnikBilodeau", "display_name": "Annik Bilodeau", "profile_url": "https://majapasovic.academia.edu/AnnikBilodeau?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3223051/1060510/25288799/s65_annik.bilodeau.jpeg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1439, "name": "Globalization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3302, "name": "The Historical Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Historical_Novel?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4568, "name": "Liberalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberalism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 28754, "name": "Georg Luck\u00e1cs", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Georg_Luckacs?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 44011, "name": "Peruvian Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Peruvian_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 84715, "name": "Mario Vargas Llosa", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Mario_Vargas_Llosa?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 84716, "name": "Literatura peruana", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literatura_peruana?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 107145, "name": "Globalizaci\u00f3n", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalizaci%C3%B3n?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 146616, "name": "Liberalismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Liberalismo?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 308879, "name": "Cosmopolitismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitismo?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 377059, "name": "Cosmopoitanism Liberalism Global Justice", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopoitanism_Liberalism_Global_Justice?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 476780, "name": "New Historical Novel", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Historical_Novel?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1376517, "name": "Literatura Peruana Contempor\u00e1nea", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Literatura_Peruana_Contemporanea?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 35469322, "title": "'Humanity at Large?': The Contesting Tropes of Patriotism and Cosmopolitan in Orhan Pamuk's The Silent House, The White Castle and Snow", "created_at": "2017-12-19T09:22:27.406-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/35469322/Humanity_at_Large_The_Contesting_Tropes_of_Patriotism_and_Cosmopolitan_in_Orhan_Pamuks_The_Silent_House_The_White_Castle_and_Snow?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_35469322", "summary": "\u2014In today's world, when no nation or culture can remain isolated and pure, it is imperative to expand the concentric circles of belonging to the global level. Cosmopolitanism, as Nussbaum believes means to expand one's allegiance from local, ethnic and expand it from national through international. This is the possible way to hormonise the world under one \" global village. \" The paper analyses three novels of Orhan Pamuk\u2014The White Castle, Snow and The Silent House\u2014through the perspective of \" cosmopolitanism \" as propagated by Martha C Nussbaum. The paper works on the proposition that Orhan Pamuk deals with the cultural tropes that zero down to the cosmopolitan worldview as a solution to the conflicts and chaos in the Turkish Post-Kemalist socio-political scenario. Pamuk's characters are complex, representing different concentric circles of allegiance and ideologies, yet there are many characters in his novels who are embodiment of international belongingness as well as rootedness in one's national identity. Turkish nationalism, as is evident from her modern history, is a matter of multiple ideologies, such as, Islamist nationalism, Left-wing nationalism, Extreme Right wing nationalism, Modernist nationalism and many other subnational identities and ideologies like Armenian and Kurdish ones. In this paper, it will be an andeavour to analyse the nationalism in Turkey and trace out the 'international' and 'cosmopolitan' to see how far Pamuk's novels take such ideas that contest against one another; and how far does Pamuk make his characters to \" imagine others \" that would expand their imaginations to \" humanity at large \" as propounded by the thinkers right from the Stoic philosophy of the ancient Greeks through the enlightenment thinkers to the modern ones like Nussbaum and others.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55331639, "asset_id": 35469322, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 20404621, "first_name": "Nasir", "last_name": "Butt", "domain_name": "nitsrinagar", "page_name": "NasirButt", "display_name": "Nasir F Butt", "profile_url": "https://nitsrinagar.academia.edu/NasirButt?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/20404621/5664210/38595942/s65_nasir.butt.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 36947, "name": "Orhan Pamuk", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orhan_Pamuk?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 30253349, "title": "\u201cSeltsam, weiblich, aus bescheidenem Haus:  Gabriela Mistral und die Herausforderungen eines kosmopolitischen Lebens\u00bb", "created_at": "2016-12-05T03:09:58.062-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/30253349/_Seltsam_weiblich_aus_bescheidenem_Haus_Gabriela_Mistral_und_die_Herausforderungen_eines_kosmopolitischen_Lebens_?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_30253349", "summary": "in Bernhard Gi\u00dfibl and Isabella L\u00f6hr (eds.), Bessere Welten: Kosmopolitismus in den Geschichtswissenschaften, Campus Verlag 2017, p. 253-279.

As such, global citizenship is often enacted through humanitarianism. GCE, at least in its more typical \u201csoft\u201d varieties (Andreotti 2006), invites youth to become \u201cagents of change\u201d who \u201cmake a difference.\u201d Such uncritical forms of global citizenship reflect the legacy of colonial ideology, in that the global citizen undertakes a \u201cburden\u201d to uplift others. Unlike earlier overtly Euro-centric articulations of humanitarian benevolence, however, today\u2019s global citizen aspires to be \u2018post-racial\u2019 (Jefferess 2011; 2015); GCE increasingly emphasizes the importance of valuing ideas, philosophies, or ideals attributed to people classified as \u2018non-Western\u2019 (Jefferess 2011; 2015).[i] In this chapter, I examine the prominence of two such philosophies or ideals within discourses of global citizenship and/as humanitarianism:  the southern African notion of ubuntu and the popular statement, \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world,\u201d which is attributed to Mohandas K. Gandhi.\n \nI contend that Ubuntu and \u201cBe the Change\u201d have become so prominent within global citizenship discourse because they are so easily incorporated into the familiar registers of humanitarianism. They authenticate global citizenship as cosmopolitan or intercultural, but are also used to affirm dominant Western biases within GCE. To conclude the chapter, I reflect on the larger problem of easy incorporations of \u201cnon-Western\u201d or Indigenous knowledge into GCE by engaging with the work of Jeannette Armstrong, whose articulation of Sylix/Okanagan conceptions of relation invite learning and transformation, or what I term in the chapter \"being/change\".\n\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 48542711, "asset_id": 28227076, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 33206, "first_name": "David", "last_name": "Jefferess", "domain_name": "universityofbritishcolumbia", "page_name": "DavidJefferess", "display_name": "David  Jefferess", "profile_url": "https://universityofbritishcolumbia.academia.edu/DavidJefferess?f_ri=3556", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2593, "name": "Humanitarianism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanitarianism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 4992, "name": "Global Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Citizenship?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 18070, "name": "Ubuntu", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ubuntu?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 68735, "name": "Gandhian theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gandhian_theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 77315, "name": "Post-Racial Discourse", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Post-Racial_Discourse?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 84773, "name": "Global Citizenship Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Citizenship_Education?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 107951, "name": "Travelling ideas-discourses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Travelling_ideas-discourses?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 117861, "name": "Gandhian Thought", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gandhian_Thought?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 133242, "name": "Gandhian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Gandhian_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 373360, "name": "Ubuntu philosophy, Ubuntu , Applied Ubuntu;

We distinguish this localizing educational strategy from the established network of international schools designed to serve the families of corporate expatriates. Instead, our research subjects consist of self-initiated expatriates, or \u2018middling transnationals\u2019, who have chosen to prioritize immersion in the language and culture of China by sending their children to local schools. This localized, or Sinocentric, model exposes non-Chinese children to a challenging and nationalistic Chinese curriculum. Our analysis of these practices as a form of cosmopolitan education challenges both the goal of teaching a universal and placeless ethical cosmopolitanism and the assumption that a meaningful cosmopolitan education must take place in the idealized setting of a liberal cosmopolitan school system. We also highlight the difficulties families face in this approach, describing this as an \u2018entangled cosmopolitanism\u2019, an enriching but uncomfortable engagement with both local and

via the digital age is upon us, demanding a new ethics and an intercultural awareness while the dialectics of globalism and cyberspace mandate a committed reflection on what the synthesis between the digital realm and global citizenship entails. In many ways, the borders that previously separated us as citizens physically and culturally have begun to dissipate, replaced by a call for an intercultural accountability and a form of global citizenship that, on one hand, surpasses borders, patriotism, and nationalism alike, but while on the other, demands an understanding and respect for the cultural idiosyncrasies among us, acknowledging the unique existential paradox of universal citizenship that posits each of us as both stranger and citizen on a commonly shared globe.\r\n\r\nWhat is cosmopolitan in the digital age? Is a global digital citizen the same as merely a digital citizen? While talk of digital citizenship has increased in recent years, usually centered on a capitalist drive, encouraging a full electronic participation in society and a responsibility to digital commerce, many questions remain unanswered.  Is the netizen the citizen of a democratic state, and of digital democracy? As a citizen of the world interacting online, how will one\u2019s \u201crights\u201d and \u201cduties\u201d be determined? And are these \u201crights\u201d universal, and in such a case, what does \u201cuniversal\u201d mean? What are the legal parameters of netizenship, and what will they be as globalization further takes hold? Is democracy critical to citizenship, or is it not? What are the political landscapes of global citizenship in the digital age? And last of all, is the concept of digital citizenship even tangible? Is it real?\r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35178471, "asset_id": 8837870, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 1776652, "first_name": "Jared",

Drawing on neglected archival materials, the author explores the rise of new musical tastes and social divisions in late twentieth century Italy.\n\nThe book reconstructs the emergence of pop music magazines in Italy and offers the first in-depth investigation of the role of critics in global music cultures. It explores how class, gender, race and geographical location shaped the production and consumption of music magazines, as well as critics\u2019 struggle over notions of expertise, cultural value and cosmopolitanism.\n\nGlobalization, Music and Cultures of Distinction provides an innovative framework for studying how globalization transforms cultural institutions and aesthetic hierarchies, thus breaking new ground for sociological and historical research. It will be essential reading for scholars and students interested in cultural sociology, popular music, globalization, media and cultural studies, social theory and contemporary Italy.\n\nEndorsements:\n\n\u201cVarriale provides a compelling analysis of the field of Italian pop music criticism [\u2026] By outlining the particular struggles that occupied Italian pop music critics, the book offers general insights into the transnational dimensions of artistic legitimation and aesthetic hierarchy in a way that will be both accessible to newcomers and intriguing to experts.\u201d - Vaughn Schmutz, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, USA\n\n\u201cWith this nuanced, detailed and clever study of Italian pop-rock criticism, Varriale enriches cultural sociology with a sophisticated and highly original contribution. [\u2026] This brilliant study [\u2026] is a very welcome addition to the growing literature on world pop-rock, a genuine contribution to cultural sociology at large, and to the study of current

cosmopolitanism are shaped through a mutually constitutive set of cultural dispositions and institutional practices that emerge at the interstices of global human right norms and local legal practices. Converging pressures of \u2018cosmopolitan imperatives\u2019 and the multiplicity of particularized manifestations are co-evolving in the context of intercrossings during which distinctive cosmopolitanisms are established. This complex relationship of global normative expectations and their local appropriations is elucidated through\r\nthe dynamic of recursive cosmopolitization. Suggesting that, local problems are resolved with recourse to global prescriptions while local solutions are inscribed in international institutions consolidating the global Human Rights Regime. The\r\nArgentinean case carries conceptual and empirical weight as it underscores the recursivity of cosmopolitization by calibrating the tensions of universalism and particularism at the intersection of global, national and regional scales. Argentina is a paradigmatic instantiation for how cosmopolitanism can emanate in the\r\nperiphery as local problems are globalized. This, in turn, has resulted in the institutionalization of a global Human Rights Regime which exercises normative and political\u2013legal pressures on how states legitimately deal with human rights abuses.\r\nIt is this cosmopolitan balance, rather than presuppositions of universalistic exogenous pressures or particularistic national exceptions, which is shaping the cultural and political relevance of human rights norms.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 36515367, "asset_id": 10511293, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 15207659, "first_name": "Daniel", "last_name": "Levy", "domain_name": "sbsuny", "page_name": "DLevy", "display_name": "Daniel Levy", "profile_url": "https://sbsuny.academia.edu/DLevy?f_ri=3556", "photo": "/images/s65_no_pic.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 2592, "name": "Human Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}]}, {"id": 9659155, "title": "El cosmos parisino de Jacques Tati en Playtime", "created_at": "2014-12-07T06:15:22.869-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/9659155/El_cosmos_parisino_de_Jacques_Tati_en_Playtime?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_9659155", "summary": null, "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 35856812, "asset_id": 9659155, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 3406239, "first_name": "Jo\u00e3o", "last_name": "Mascarenhas Mateus", "domain_name": "utl", "page_name": "Jo\u00e3oMascarenhasMateus", "display_name": "Jo\u00e3o  Mascarenhas Mateus", "profile_url": "https://utl.academia.edu/Jo%C3%A3oMascarenhasMateus?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/3406239/2017206/3249409/s65_jo_o.mascarenhas_mateus.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7725, "name": "Urban Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Urban_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9578, "name": "Cosmopolitan Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Urbanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 11471, "name": "Cinema and Memory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema_and_Memory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 19258, "name": "Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 21978, "name": "Cinema and the City", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema_and_the_City?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 25109, "name": "Cinema and Architecture", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema_and_Architecture?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 52745, "name": "Cinema Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 85316, "name": "Architecture and urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_urbanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 90714, "name": "Cinema and History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cinema_and_History?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 91839, "name": "Paris", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Paris?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 115615, "name": "Jacques Tati", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jacques_Tati?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 270341, "name": "Architecture and Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Urban_Planning?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 292493, "name": "Architecture and Cinematic Space", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Architecture_and_Cinematic_Space?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 308879, "name": "Cosmopolitismo", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitismo?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 816093, "name": "History and Cinema", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_and_Cinema?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 868673, "name": "Playtime (Film)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Playtime_Film_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1706099, "name": "Monsieur Hulot", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Monsieur_Hulot?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 6053585, "title": "(2014) Mobile mediators and inbetweener importers: The normalization of strangeness in Muslim Southeast Asia.

In Aceh, for example, did recently arrived Arabs from Aden play key roles in the processes of \"Islamisation?\" While few claim rank outsiders to have been crucial in chapters of significant religious change, in this paper I argue that neither are individuals\u23afalbeit inadequately\u23afdescribed as insiders. Accounts provided by historians done with dissecting the dynamics of religious change note the presence of multi-lingual and mobile mediators, who have been described as \"inbetweeners\", who were adept at importing new ideas\u23afincluding ways of dealing with the divine. Commerce across the Indian Ocean both before and after the rise in European presence centred on ports where being different was normal. Pre-colonial port-cities produced ethnolinguistical \u201ccreole\u201d or \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d communities whose comfort with ethnoreligious diversity is lamentable scarce in present-day South and Southeast Asia. This paper considers the role of \u201cmobile mediators\u201d and \u201cinbetweeners\u201d in the importation of a range of Islamic movements in Thailand. I make suggestions about the personalities and processes through which ideas espoused by Imam Al-Ghazali (1058\u20131111), Sheikh Ahmad Ibn Idris (1760-1837), and Muhammad \u2018Abduh (1849-1905) become known in Thai/Malay Peninsula. I describe the contributions and discuss the identity of local luminaries including Shaykh Ahmad al-Fatani, Ishmael Lutfi Japakiya, Direk Kulsriswasd, and Conrad Laurens Coolen to the spread of mystical, modernist, reformist, and revivalist Christian and Muslim movements.

somewhat holistic montage of the phenomena concerned with and surrounding Indigeneity, cosmopolitanism, nationalism, internationalism, and everything in between. \n\nRather than pushing a particular view, the montage attempts to cut off all avenues that attempt to simplify  the complexity of the phenomena under discussion by ignoring certain realities and exaggerating others. Rather the aim is to extend the comprehension of the possibilities and prevent premature totalisation. In short we are deliberately blocking a diversion into ideological simplification by providing disturbance, actual  evidence and sometimes even truth, expanding our views.

Working with novels, poems, essays, travel narratives and historical documents, Siskind reads the way Latin American literary modernity was produced as a global relation, from the rise of planetary novels in the 1870s and the cosmopolitan imaginaries of modernism at the turn of the century, to the global spread of magical realism.

The introductory chapter, with notes, covering the scope of the book and its major arguments. \n\nThe Lost History of Cosmopolitanism: The Early Modern Origins of the Intellectual Ideal  (London: Bloomsbury, 2021).\n\nHere's the blurb:\nThe Lost History of Cosmopolitanism challenges our most basic assumptions about the history of an ideal at the heart of modernity. Beginning in antiquity and continuing through to today, Leigh T.I. Penman examines how European thinkers have understood words like 'kosmopolites', 'cosmopolite', 'cosmopolitan' and its cognates. The debates over their meanings show that there has never been a single, stable cosmopolitan concept, but rather a range of concepts-sacred and secular, inclusive and exclusive-all described with the cosmopolitan vocabulary.\n\nWhile most scholarly attention in the history of cosmopolitanism has focussed on Greek and Roman antiquity or the Enlightenments of the 18th century, this book shows that the crucial period in the evolution of modern cosmopolitanism was early modernity. Between 1500 and 1800 philosophers, theologians, cartographers, jurists, politicians, alchemists and heretics all used this vocabulary, shedding ancient associations, and adding new ones at will. The chaos of discourses prompted thinkers to reflect on the nature of the cosmopolitan ideal, and to conceive of an abstract 'cosmopolitanism' for the first time.\n\nThis meticulously researched book provides the first intellectual history of an overlooked period in the evolution of a core ideal. As such, The Lost History of Cosmopolitanism is an essential work for anyone seeking a contextualised understanding of cosmopolitanism today.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 68345916, "asset_id": 50312592, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 5383210, "first_name": "Leigh T.I.", "last_name": "Penman", "domain_name": "monash", "page_name": "LeighTIPenman", "display_name": "Leigh T.I.

Rather the aim is to extend the comprehension of the possibilities and prevent premature totalisation. In short we are deliberately blocking a diversion into ideological simplification by providing disturbance, actual  evidence and sometimes even truth, expanding our views. The aim is to foster inclusive dialogue and conversation concerning the phenomena, rather than to distort our analysis in order to persuade people to our comfortable position, whatever that is.

Democracy, Power, Antagonism\" offers a deconstructive reading of the articulation between violence and legitimacy, with a focus on democratic politics and critical IR theory.\n\nThe violence-legitimacy \"couple\" is a traditional staple in dominant strands of political theory, relying as they do on the possibility to distinguish rigorously between legitimate violence (power) and illegitimate violence. By contrast, and drawing on Derrida's deconstructive approach to performativity, I argue that violence and legitimacy are co-constitutive, both originating from the violence of an \"originary performativity.\" This originary force implies a redefinition of the articulation between violence and legitimacy, now exceeding hermeneutics of power and metaphysics of presence.\nThe bulk of my thesis consists in contrasting this deconstructive reading of performativity to critical strands of political theory which posited the partition between legitimate power and illegitimate violence in the context of democratic politics: Marx & Engels' theory of ideology, Weber's sociology of legitimacy, Schmitt's onto-theological politics, Foucault's critical epistemology, Mouffe's radical democracy, and Balibar's dialectics of Gewalt.\n\nThis text was initially established as brief summary of my PhD thesis.

Most contemporary commentators have concurred that cosmopolitanism as a form of ethical practice is associated with a conscious openness to the world and the potential for a relational dialogue with people and things that are culturally different (Delanty, 2009; Hannerz, 1990; Thompson and Tambyah, 1999). The cosmopolitanism question is essentially whether or not people develop feelings of solidarity and responsibility for widening circles of strangers, seek to understand and be changed by incorporating others\u2019 viewpoints and practices which are apparently unlike their own, and feel responsible for environments far away from them (Appiah, 2007; Cheah, 2006; Stevenson, 2002). \n\nWhile researchers currently grapple with the abstract philosophical dimensions of the concept, they also seek to understand how everyday, vernacular forms of cosmopolitanism work, and how people acquire and learn cosmopolitan competencies and habits (Woodward and Skrbis, 2013). In this context, it is not an exaggeration to observe that consumption opportunities and practices constitute a large part of people\u2019s engagements with diversity and cultural difference (Germann Molz, 2011). But, in what ways does this consumption matter to diffusing cosmopolitan cultures, and in what ways might it complicate them, or even deform them? And, in what ways can scholarship from diverse disciplinary perspectives work with each other to shed light on these questions? \n\nThe purpose of this book is to examine the consequences of cosmopolitan ideals and cosmopolitanisation processes for consumption and market practices on a global scale. By discussing not only the positive side of cosmopolitanism but also the problems and challenges related to it, this book takes an informed, critical look at issues and practices of cosmopolitan consumption and markets. The goals of the book are to: \n\u2022\tproduce a collected work of high scholarly quality that has an enduring impact on the way researchers understand and conceptualise the cosmopolitan possibilities of consumption \n\u2022\tbe the first major collection to frame and directly address controversies and questions around the relationship between consumption and cosmopolitan ethics\n\u2022\tdevelop a cross-disciplinary research conversation for understanding how consumption practices and processes relate to cosmopolitanism, in what ways they might or might not contribute to cosmopolitan processes and through what symbolic, cultural and economic processes this occurs", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 38943846, "asset_id": 16324997, "asset_type": "Work",

Under the Ottomans focuses on one of the most pressing topics in this field, namely the question why cities formerly known for their multiethnic and multi- religious composition became increasingly marked by conflict in the 19th century. \r\n\r\nThis collection of essays represents the result of an intense process of discussion among many of the authors, who have been invited to combine theoretical considerations on the question sketched above, with concrete case studies based upon original archival research. From Istanbul to Aleppo, and from the Balkans to Jerusalem, what emerges from the book is a renewed image of the imperial and local mechanisms of coexistence, and of their limits and occasional dissolution in times of change and crisis.\r\n\r\nRaising questions of governance and changes therein, as well as epistemological questions regarding what has often been termed 'cosmopolitanism', this book calls for a closer investigation of incidents of both peaceful coexistence, as well as episodes of violence and conflict. A useful addition to existing literature, this book will be of interest to scholars and researchers in the fields of Urban Studies, History and Middle Eastern Studies.\r\n\r\n1 Introduction: Cosmopolitanism and Conflicts: Chances and Challenges in Ottoman Urban Governance \r\n\r\nPart I: The ottoman Urban Governance from Old regime to the Tanzimat Era \r\n\r\n2 Ottoman Reform and Urban Government in the District of Jerusalem, 1867-1917 \u2013 Johann Bussow\r\n3 Social Stratification and Change in Herzogovinian Urban Life in the Tanzimat Era - Hannes Grandits \r\n4 [A Quest for] The Bourgeoisie of Istanbul \u2013 Edhem Eldem\r\n5 The Role of Labour Migration for the Urban Economy and Governance of Nineteenth Century Istanbul \u2013 Florian Riedler \r\n6 North to South Migration in the Imperial Era: Workers and Vagabonds between Vienna and Constantinople \u2013 Malte Fuhrmann \r\n\r\nPart II: Questions on Ottoman Urban Cosmopolitanism \r\n\r\n7 Did Cosmopolitanism Exist in Eighteenth-century Istanbul?

Its global, regional, national, and thematic events have gathered since 2001 millions of participants and thousands of civil society and social movement organisations. Its cosmopolitan vision is built on resistance to the planetary domination by neo-liberal globalisation. This paper unpacks WSF\u2019s cosmopolitan project and reflects on its vision of emancipated individuals, convivial communities, and a just planetary society in harmony with the environment. In its open organisational space, WSF\u2019s cosmopolitan project develops while in the process of political action rather than prior to that. At the same time, power dynamics, ideological cleavages, and pragmatic concerns about organisation and strategy challenge WSF\u2019s ability to pursue its goals. However, it is these internal tensions that make WSF\u2019s cosmopolitan project both more difficult to achieve and more realistic than claims of universal unity among all its participants.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 52416762, "asset_id": 32182347, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 237930, "first_name": "Giuseppe", "last_name": "Caruso", "domain_name": "helsinki", "page_name": "GiuseppeCaruso", "display_name": "Giuseppe Caruso", "profile_url": "https://helsinki.academia.edu/GiuseppeCaruso?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/237930/52075/5076578/s65_giuseppe.caruso.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 208, "name": "Social Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Movements?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5091, "name": "Democratization", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratization?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 8994, "name": "Social Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Social_Activism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 36402, "name": "Activism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Activism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 46393, "name": "World Social Forums", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/World_Social_Forums?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 202047, "name": "Globalization, Alter-Globalization, Antiglobalization, Globalization from Below, World Social Forum, Terrorism, New Media, Ecology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_Alter-Globalization_Antiglobalization_Globalization_from_Below_World_Social_Forum_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 784132, "name": "Globalization and resistance: Transnational dimensions of social movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Globalization_and_resistance_Transnational_dimensions_of_social_movements?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 804152, "name": "Global Justice and Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Justice_and_Resistance?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 885286, "name": "Global Governance and Resistance", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Global_Governance_and_Resistance?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 24354775, "title": "Aux sources de l'int\u00e9gration europ\u00e9enne : l'Alsacien Curtius et la Luxembourgeoise Aline Mayrisch", "created_at": "2016-04-13T00:58:39.088-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/24354775/Aux_sources_de_lint%C3%A9gration_europ%C3%A9enne_lAlsacien_Curtius_et_la_Luxembourgeoise_Aline_Mayrisch?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_24354775", "summary": "Juste avant la publication de Franz\u00f6sische Kultur (1930), Curtius \u00e9crit \u00e0 son amie fran\u00e7aise Catherine Pozzi: \u00abSi j\u2019\u00e9tais Fran\u00e7ais, ch\u00e8re Karin, je ne verrais pas la France comme je le fais.

But while there are many normative theories of cosmopolitanism, as well as some cosmopolitan theories of globalization, there has been little attempt to grapple systematically with fundamental questions of structure and action from a \u2018cosmopolitan point of view.\u2019 Drawing on Kant\u2018s cosmopolitan writings and Habermas\u2018s critical theory of society, Brian Milstein argues that, before we are members of nations or states, we are participants in a \u2018commercium\u2019 of global interaction who are able to negotiate for ourselves the terms on which we share the earth in common with one another. He marshals a broad range of literature from philosophy, sociology, and political science to show how the modern system of sovereign nation-states destructively constrains and distorts these relations of global interaction, leading to pathologies and crises in present-day world society. The result is a novel approach to thinking about the constitution of the modern world order, the challenges it poses us, and our potential to meet those challenges.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 46180188, "asset_id": 7568234, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2474849, "first_name": "Brian", "last_name": "Milstein", "domain_name": "limerick", "page_name": "BrianMilstein", "display_name": "Brian Milstein", "profile_url": "https://limerick.academia.edu/BrianMilstein?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/2474849/774286/12927335/s65_brian.milstein.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 8, "name": "Critical Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Theory?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 797, "name": "International Relations", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1166, "name": "International Relations Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/International_Relations_Theory?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3661, "name": "Sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sovereignty?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5293, "name": "State Formation", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Formation?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5340, "name": "Jurgen Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Jurgen_Habermas?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5878, "name": "Nationalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 8291, "name": "Kant's Practical Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kants_Practical_Philosophy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 10495, "name": "Nationalism And State Building", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nationalism_And_State_Building?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 10672, "name": "State Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 16031, "name": "Immanuel Kant", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Immanuel_Kant?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 25243, "name": "Kant's Political Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kants_Political_Philosophy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 26995, "name": "Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Habermas?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 59927, "name": "Communicative action", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Communicative_action?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 82489, "name": "State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 98376, "name": "J\u00fcrgen Habermas", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 101074, "name": "Nation-State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nation-State?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 222887, "name": "Alexander Wendt's Social Theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Alexander_Wendts_Social_Theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 347292, "name": "State sovereignty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/State_sovereignty?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 602128, "name": "Sociology of the State", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology_of_the_State?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 988031, "name": "Kant's Cosmopolitan Theory of Law and Peace", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Kants_Cosmopolitan_Theory_of_Law_and_Peace?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1019277, "name": "Nation building and State making", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nation_building_and_State_making?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 16394973, "title": "The Artist Carl Abrahams and the Cosmopolitan Work of Centring and Peripheralizing the Self (J.B.

Responding to Gell's argument that art should be thought of as a \u2018technology of enchantment\u2019, and to a wider approach that seeks to explain art by reference to cultural context, the article takes Abrahams's own Weltkenntnis, or world-knowledge, as its focus. The Weltkenntnis of an artist, or indeed any person, is often at odds both with their surrounding cultural situation and the technical means they have to express themselves. It is never entirely possible to reduce a particular form of self-expression either to the wider worldview or to a particular set of technical effects. The article explores the conceptual tensions involved in Abrahams's claims to be a cosmopolitan artist and his work of centring and peripheralizing himself in colonial and postcolonial Jamaica.\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 L'auteur examine la vie et l\u2019\u0153uvre de Carl Abrahams, artiste jama\u00efcain et \u00ab\u00a0citoyen du monde\u00a0\u00bb. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 Gell, selon qui l'art doit \u00eatre pens\u00e9 comme une \u00ab\u00a0technologie de l'enchantement\u00a0\u00bb, et \u00e0 une approche plus large qui tente d'expliquer l'art en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au contexte culturel, l'article est ax\u00e9 sur la vision du monde, la Weltkenntnis propre d'Abrahams.

The contributors explore the implications of applying the cosmopolitan ideals of obligation to others and respect for cultural difference to archaeological practice, showing that those ethics increasingly demand the rethinking of research agendas. While cosmopolitan archaeologies must be practiced in contextually specific ways, what unites and defines them is archaeologists\u2019 acceptance of responsibility for the repercussions of their projects, as well as their undertaking of heritage practices attentive to the concerns of the living communities with whom they work. These concerns may require archaeologists to address the impact of war, the political and economic depredations of past regimes, the livelihoods of those living near archaeological sites, or the incursions of transnational companies and institutions.\r\nThe contributors describe various forms of cosmopolitan engagement involving sites that span the globe. They take up the links between conservation, natural heritage and ecology movements, and the ways that local heritage politics are constructed through international discourses and regulations. They are attentive to how communities near heritage sites are affected by archaeological fieldwork and findings, and to the complex interactions that local communities and national bodies have with international sponsors and universities, conservation agencies, development organizations, and NGOs. Whether discussing the toll of efforts to preserve biodiversity on South Africans living near Kruger National Park, the ways that UNESCO\u2019s global heritage project universalizes the ethic of preservation, or the Open Declaration on Cultural Heritage at Risk that the Archaeological Institute of America sent to the U.S. government before the Iraq invasion, the contributors provide nuanced assessments of the ethical implications of the discursive production, consumption, and governing of other people\u2019s pasts.\r\n\r\nEdited by Lynn Meskell.\r\n\r\nContributors: O.

It is contended that such relations are regularly asserted through cosmopolitan appeals, which are premised on the assumption that a cosmos, a world, a universal, pre-exists its articulation, and, that it is the task of reason and of science to adjust the citizen-subject to this already-present condition. This paper argues that this is a flawed position because it assumes, in fact, what is required to be built: a world in common. In defence of this proposition, two recent declarations of museum cosmopolitanism are explored: ICOM\u2019s declaration on the \u2018universal museum\u2019, which focuses on the unity of the cultural heritage of humankind; and the Buffon Declaration, which concerns institutions of natural history and the imperilment of humanity\u2019s biospheric inheritance. Subsequently, the paper turns to what might be called the empirics of the cosmopolitanism of the museum visitor. This examines the qualitative investigation of banal or everyday cosmopolitanism, which is largely ignored by such museum declarations. These different museological articulations of a common world are, in turn, reviewed through the juxtaposition of two sociologies: Ulrich Beck\u2019s cosmopolitanism and Bruno Latour\u2019s cosmopolitics. It is in contrasting these various mobilizations of the cosmopolitan \u2013 the museological, the empirical and the sociological \u2013 that the paper advances its proposition: namely, that these cosmopolitan claims are based on the assumption that a common world exists prior to its assemblage as such.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 33144261, "asset_id": 6302991, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 6206782, "first_name": "Ben", "last_name": "Dibley", "domain_name": "westernsydney", "page_name": "BenDibley", "display_name": "Ben Dibley", "profile_url": "https://westernsydney.academia.edu/BenDibley?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/6206782/3072453/3613930/s65_ben.dibley.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 188, "name": "Cultural Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 957, "name": "Cultural Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Sociology?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1512, "name": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 1657, "name": "Museum Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2132, "name": "Cultural Heritage", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Heritage?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3407, "name": "Environmental Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Environmental_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 21503, "name": "Climate Change Discourses", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Climate_Change_Discourses?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 24016, "name": "Museology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museology?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 78350, "name": "Museum and Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Museum_and_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 545153, "name": "Critical Heritage Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Heritage_Studies?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 7032631, "title": "Negative Cosmopolitanism with Turkish Students in the German Classroom (GSA 2014)", "created_at": "2014-05-13T02:58:38.523-07:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/7032631/Negative_Cosmopolitanism_with_Turkish_Students_in_the_German_Classroom_GSA_2014_?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_7032631", "summary": "\"The German classroom presented in Nurkan Erpulat\u2019s play Verr\u00fccktes Blut (2010) presents a challenge to contemporary German literature and society. The failed German education system vis-a-vis Turkish students has been thematized in German literature for decades, notably since Alev Tekinay\u2019s Deutschpr\u00fcfung in 1990. Two recent popularly received works, Nurkan Erpulat\u2019s play Verr\u00fccktes Blut (2010) and Bora Da\u011ftekin\u2019s movie Fack Ju G\u00f6hte (2013) continue this theme in a twenty-first century context by portraying a Turkish-German teacher at the head of the classroom. These recent Turkish-German productions question the ostensible cosmopolitan space of the German classroom, a space historically framed by enlightenment ideals. \r\nThe representations of Erpulat and Dagtekin take the German teacher with Turkish descent as the new reality; however, Erpulat\u2019s vision sees Turks caught in a circle of violence in the German classroom. Verr\u00fccktes Blut centers on the hyperbolic violence of the classroom, symbolized by a German teacher who forces her Turkish students to engage with a Schiller text at gun point. Mocking the current integration debate, the teacher screams at the students to relate the piece to their lives as well as to pronounce the words correctly. At the end of the play the students are model Germans, just like their teacher who turns out to be Turkish-German herself. Following the intellectual legacy of Adorno and Horkheimer, the playwright Erpulat sees enlightenment thinking as the foundation of the violence in his imagined classroom.

We employ a cosmopolitan encounters framework to explore the reflexive openness people perform and the ethical reasoning they draw on to get along with each other. In particular, we look beyond pleasurable cosmopolitan pursuits to consider encounters that cause frictions or require notable efforts to bridge differences as an occasion for cosmopolitan conviviality. Based on qualitative interviews conducted in Australia, we aim to sharpen the demarcation between cosmopolitan encounters and those in which diversity is strategically negotiated by enacting practices of civility. We argue that cosmopolitanism emerges from interactions in encounters between individuals when they reflect on their positionality within unequal power relationships and their actions are guided by a cosmopolitan ethics. The ethical framework we propose is grounded in reflexive acts of sharing going beyond notions of giving and performing hospitality within a host/guest dyad.", "downloadable_attachments": [], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 103798, "first_name": "Ian", "last_name": "Woodward", "domain_name": "southerndenmark", "page_name": "IanWoodward", "display_name": "Ian  Woodward", "profile_url": "https://southerndenmark.academia.edu/IanWoodward?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/103798/28575/811426/s65_ian.woodward.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 184, "name": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Sociology?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 898, "name": "Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multiculturalism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 5453, "name": "Race and Ethnicity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Race_and_Ethnicity?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 8400, "name": "Cultural Encounters", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Encounters?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 9578, "name": "Cosmopolitan Urbanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Urbanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 10006, "name": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnic_and_Racial_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 14787, "name": "Reflexivity  (Sociology)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Reflexivity_Sociology_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 16069, "name": "Critical Race Theory and Whiteness theory", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Race_Theory_and_Whiteness_theory?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 28235, "name": "Multidisciplinary", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Multidisciplinary?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 33323, "name": "Intercultural Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Competence?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 33562, "name": "Intercultural dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_dialogue?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 45318, "name": "Cosmopolitics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 188521, "name": "Cosmopolitan ethics", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_ethics?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 953669, "name": "Routledge", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Routledge?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 72836264, "title": "Explicit intercultural education in foreign language courses at introductory level : a methodological challenge", "created_at": "2022-03-02T14:23:37.995-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/72836264/Explicit_intercultural_education_in_foreign_language_courses_at_introductory_level_a_methodological_challenge?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_72836264", "summary": "One of the main institutional goals at a European international liberal arts college is to create graduates who are world citizens. In that context, there has been a shift towards explicit intercultural education through language and culture courses, with a foreign language requirement serving as &amp;#39;a window on a different culture&amp;#39;. Developing intercultural communication skills demands more than living in a multicultural international environment; explicit intercultural education is needed. This paper describes a project that defined intercultural competence and translated it into intended learning outcomes for &amp;#39;Language and Culture&amp;#39; courses at our liberal arts college. One of the intended learning outcomes is stated as: &amp;#39;A student has the tools needed for the ongoing reflection on intercultural contact and the further development of intercultural skills in general&amp;#39;. The biggest challenge was to integrate explicit intercultural education in courses at the introductory level, where students are absolute beginners in the target language.

As convincingly demonstrated by J. Gil Harris in The First Firangis, such defectors to the cultural \"other\" do not necessarily become true and permanent hybrids, but they toss and mix identity components, whether these are complementary, merely compatible or conflictive. No role playing of this kind leaves subjects unchanged. The resulting fluid personality can be said to perform a narrative identity that is typical of the cosmopolitan experience. The present paper aims to study and interpret the mimetic desire at work in the paradoxically nativised text of a narrator situated on the border of two and more cultural worlds. Lev Nussimbaum, aka Essad Bey and Kurban Said, now better known as \"The Orientalist\" after the title of Tom Reiss's biography of this author, offers at least three different versions of attempted cosmopolitan formations in and through historical and geographical margins between \"Asia\" and \"the West,\" and between beliefs, knowledges and ways of life respectively labelled traditional and modern: the best-known version, in Ali and Nino (1937), is tragic, the other two are respectively in the comic mode (The Girl from the Golden Horn, 1938) and pseudo-factual in the early reports and essays on Baku and the Caucasus. The four works analysed on the comparative background of other exoticist/orientalist narratives of the period between wars as well as some older and contemporary fabulations develop rhetorical strategies that anticipate postcolonial discourse almost prophetically in terms of irony, estrangement and entangled (re-)inscription. They exhibit a deep dissatisfaction with forced displacement and the global pressures that were already relegating stable outlooks, life styles and sentiments to an obsolete \"museum of innocence,\" but, at the same time, they use this irrevocable passing as a motor of narrative meaning-in lieu of the sense that had been supposedly lost. The exiled migrating mind that tries to wend its way between a lost cosmopolitanism (previous forms of multiculturalism), and a new cosmopolitanism that would grow from the nostalgia of the old one and go global instead of native, casts a very original light on the native/national cultural unconscious as well as on the cosmopolitan unconscious in both its negative, cynical form, and its universalist, humanist intentions.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 58829791, "asset_id": 38742687, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 196955, "first_name": "Didier", "last_name": "COSTE", "domain_name": "u-bordeaux3", "page_name": "DidierCOSTE", "display_name": "Didier COSTE", "profile_url": "https://u-bordeaux3.academia.edu/DidierCOSTE?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/196955/90989/98965/s65_didier.coste.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 659, "name": "Comparative Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Literature?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 662, "name": "German Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/German_Literature?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 6996, "name": "Migrant Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Migrant_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 34611, "name": "Exile Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exile_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 48134, "name": "History of Azerbaijan", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Azerbaijan?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 51334, "name": "Orientalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Orientalism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 74889, "name": "Nativism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Nativism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 115950, "name": "Exoticism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Exoticism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 227125, "name": "Authorship of novel Ali and Nino", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Authorship_of_novel_Ali_and_Nino?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 308108, "name": "Azerbaijan Literature", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Azerbaijan_Literature?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 592045, "name": "Hybridity and Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Hybridity_and_Cultural_Identity?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1317422, "name": "Lev Nussimbaum", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Lev_Nussimbaum?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 2621163, "name": "Caucasus and Central Asia", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Caucasus_and_Central_Asia?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 37889721, "title": "Provincialised Cosmopolitanisms: Jehangir P.

It designates 1) essentialist\nunderstandings of the world, such as racist ideologies, as well as 2) practices of minor cultures, threatened by\nthe homogenizing politics of globalization. However, \u201cnative\u201d (indigenous, autochthon, aboriginal, \u201cfirst\nnations\u201d, traditional, regional, etc.) cultural products may constitute a powerful translation of the universal into\nexperiential truth. Neither national nor international, this \u201cremedial\u201d nativism often seeks its values in the\nvernacular, the folklore or a fantasy of a return to primitive or sacred sources addressing at the same time a\nclaim to cosmopolitanism.\nThe same can be said of \u201ccosmopolitanism\u201d, which can be both seen as a positive and open form of\nmulticulturalism, or, in a nationalistic and closed perspective, as the loss of a national identity and its socalled\n\u201cvalues\u201d.\nNativism and cosmopolitanism therefore appear to be, albeit paradoxically, closely linked, either as\ncomplementary expressions of a cultural, social and historical complex identity, or on the contrary, as radical\nopposites, used by both sides to define their respective territories.\nHowever, these terms evoke also a wide range of connected notions (borders, local, global, national and\ntransnational, etc.), which must be taken into account when analyzing the narrations and representations\nproduced within these frames.\nAnalyzing both terms in their multiple nuances, this seminar seeks to explore their possible intersections,\nconflicting or complicit, through the comparative study of specific literary works of different eras and\nlocations. Is the notion of nativism in its double meaning relevant to literary studies? Is it possible to talk about\na universalizing nativism? In that case, what connects it with or differentiates it from romantic nationalisms?\nOur aim is not to exclusively focus on questions of postcolonial, nonEuropean\nor minor literatures\u037e we also\nencourage papers that address the ambiguities of European and NorthAmerican\nliteratures with a strong local\nor regional claim.\nThe seminar will seek to explore the following questions:\n1) How can literature reach transhistoric or planetary levels through local/ethic rootedness?\n25/07/2018 Intersections between Nativism and Cosmopolitanism | American Comparative Literature Association\nhttps://www.acla.org/intersections-between-nativism-and-cosmopolitanism 2/2\n2) How do literary works depict or promote world citizenship without falling into abstractions or turning the\ncosmopolitan experience into mere heritage?\n3) What kinds of narratives revolve around the idea of the \u00ab native \u00bb, either as a locally specific beingintheworld\nor as confinement within or exclusion from a specific community?\n4) Do modern rewritings or parodies of foundational texts make a plea for the universal or for distinctive\nlocal/regional values?\n5) Is the notion of the \u201cglocal\u201d just another name for hybridity or a complacent oxymoron that aims to hide the\nfundamental incompatibility between nativism and cosmopolitanism, or can it still be unravelled in a\nproductive fashion?", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 57066483, "asset_id": 37114863, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 196955, "first_name":

Based on my research in Almere, I problematize this dichotomy and discuss the existence of cosmopolitanism in suburbia. In the paper I look beyond the bias of strictly city perspectives when discussing cosmopolitanism, and I investigate the repertoires of internationally mobile persons who find themselves in a suburban environment. The case is Almere, a Dutch new town 30km east of Amsterdam, a place that is rapidly diversifying but also demographically stagnating. In the paper I analyze interviews with international migrants who moved to Almere within the past few years, and I focus on their mobility, experiences and aspirations, alluding ultimately to anti-urban cosmopolitan repertoires.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 55107374, "asset_id": 35247738, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 2877899,

Das Versprechen eines kurzfristigen Ausstiegs adressieren sie ebenso wie Entw\u00fcrfe einer alternativen Wirklichkeit oder die \u00dcberwindung der Immanenz der Geschichte. Und oft liegt dabei der Reiz des Entkommens weniger in der Ausrichtung auf ein Ziel als in der spontanen und irrationalen Absetzbewegung selbst \u2026\r\n\r\nTheater, Kino, Fernsehen und Internet, s\u00e4mtliche Medien und K\u00fcnste werden in den hier vorliegenden Arbeiten als Umschlagpl\u00e4tze angesehen, die zum Entkommen verf\u00fchren oder Szenarien des Entkommens realisieren. Dabei wird zweierlei deutlich: Zum einen ist das Entkommen in vielfacher Hinsicht an Technologien des Imagin\u00e4ren gekn\u00fcpft.

In Frankfurt, the original epicentre of this particular school of thought, this has however come to an end. Contemporary Frankfurt theorists essentially have abandoned the sociological and descriptive dimension and re-casted what is left of the Frankfurt School into a subdivision of Anglo-American analytical political philosophy. As apparent from the book under review and his entire oeuvre, Hauke Brunkhorst, the last of the Mohicans of real Frankfurt style critical theory, have always resented this development. He has therefore found himself in internal exile at the University of Flensburg, the intellectual equivalent of Siberia in the German academic context, for the last decades. The exceptionally brilliance of the book under review thereby confirms the old insight, which has been illustrated again and again throughout history, that the best books tend to be written in exile. Written by authors who did not correspond with the prevailing Zeitgeist but who nonetheless choose to stick to their guns.\r\nThe book literally begins by the dawn of man and ends with an analysis of the pressing problems and challenges characterizing contemporary society. As such the book also reads as a history of the world in its entirety at the same time as the its main focus is on four revolutionary processes: The Papal Revolution of the 11th and 12th centuries, the Protestant revolution of the 16th century; The Atlantic Revolution of the late 18th century and the Euro-Asian (in particular but not only the Chinese and Russian revolutions) of the early 20th century. Finally, as a fifth wave, the global transformations which came about through decolonisation and the transitions from authoritarianism and totalitarianism to democracy and human rights in the latter half of the 20th century are analysed.

Following the publication of the Crick Report, citizenship education was introduced to secondary schools in 2002 as a statutory subject. Primary schools are also required to show, through inspection, how they are preparing learners for citizenship. The implementation of citizenship as a National Curriculum subject in England is taking place during a period of constitutional reform and was the most significant innovation of curriculum 2000. Recent parallel initiatives in EDC are taking place elsewhere in the UK, in Europe and internationally. In both established democracies and newly established democratic states, such as those of Eastern and Central Europe and Latin America, there is a recognition that democracy is essentially fragile and that it depends on the active engagement of citizens, not just in voting, but in developing and participating in sustainable and cohesive communities. The paper examines the role of EDC in responding to these political challenges, setting national policy developments in both European and international contexts and exploring the growing international consensus on human rights as the underpinning principles of EDC. It identifies some key themes within the research, such as diversity and unity; global and cosmopolitan citizenship; children as citizens; democratic schooling; students' understandings of citizenship and democracy; the complementary roles of schools and communities; European citizenship; and the practicalities of implementing EDC at school level. It identifies some gaps in the research literature and concludes by proposing an on-going agenda for research.  \r\nKeywords: Children's rights; Democratic schooling; Diversity; Europe; Globalization; Human rights  \r\n", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 724072, "asset_id": 215879, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 37987, "first_name": "Audrey", "last_name": "Osler", "domain_name": "independent", "page_name": "AudreyOsler", "display_name": "Audrey Osler", "profile_url": "https://independent.academia.edu/AudreyOsler?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/37987/12625/11844/s65_audrey.osler.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 1297, "name": "Democratic Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Democratic_Education?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 7413, "name": "Human Rights Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Human_Rights_Education?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 9490, "name": "Education for Citizenship", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Education_for_Citizenship?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 92599, "name": "Child Rights", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Child_Rights?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 409419, "title": "Le cosmopolitisme sous le coup de l\u2019\u00e9motion.

What characterizes each of them is the way in which the scripter defines his relation to the victims, how he responds to the question : in what respect the victims and me are alike ? If that is because they live together in Madrid or Spain, he will resort to a \u201ccommunitarian register\u201d. If that is because they belong to mankind, he will turn towards a \u201cpacifist register\u201d. If that is because they are singulars persons, his reaction can find an expression through a \u201ccosmopolitan register\u201d.

The analysis shows how these professionals draw on cosmopolitanism to define themselves as \u2018non-nationals\u2019.

Seven theses describe some characteristics of the Pananthropoi. Arguing that humans&#39; capacity to crossing borders (in a metaphorical and literal sense) is greater than the desire for its opposite, I interpret the long duree of global history as a process of overall societal convergence. The asymmetry of &quot;unsocial sociability&quot; of the conditio humana, with sociability prevailing over the capacity to disconnect, drives humanity gradually towards one society dawning on the

have been reinvigorated alongside contem- porary processes of globalization, transna- tional mobilities, and multicultural urban- ism, spanning a range of disciplinary approaches and debates.

Vincenzo Cicchelli\u2019s Plural and Shared: The Sociology of a Cosmopolitan World makes an important contribution to this emerging field by providing sociologists with conceptual tools grounded in well- established sociological approaches for understanding the cosmopolitan world we live in, as well as the ways in which people experience that world.

This critical thinking exercise confirms that the relationship between place, collective identity and socio-cultural processes of identification is a contested aspect of social theory.

The book identifies cosmopolitanism as a fundamentally universal moral approach, meaning it sees the concern as attaching equally to every person. Eleven contributors, mostly professors in political science from North America, Europe, and Australia, explore the roles that institutional rules and agents can play in a cosmopolitan approach. The book is divided in three sections. The first section advocates compatibility between sovereign state systems and the interests of humanity; the second section presents more skeptical arguments about the compatibility of the two; and the final section is primarily concerned with the compatibility of some non-state agents with cosmopolitanism. The contributors do not share the same level of conceptualization; chapters vary from formal analyses to analytical narratives, the latter as case studies or in comparative context.

Precisely because it takes this approach, Udo Schaefer\u2019s Beyond the Clash of Religions: The Emergence of a New Paradigm is an important contribution to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed studies. . . .\n\nIn the final pages of this essay, Schaefer introduces the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith as offering a \u201cnew paradigm\u201d (42) anchored in revelation, in which the will of God for the world today is apprehended and affirmed by faith, and a universal value system is offered. In contrast to \u201cthe old ecclesiastical paradigm\u201d of Christian salvation, \u201cthe new paradigm depicts a divine economy of salvation\u201d (46), according to Schaefer. The nature of this \u201ceconomy\u201d is paradigmatically different from traditional Christianity.\n\nThe nature of this new paradigm is developed in the second essay, \u201cOn the Diversity and Unity of Religions\u201d (51\u2013150). This essay begins with a \u201cPrefatory Note on the Concept of Paradigm,\u201d in which the author assimilates Thomas Kuhn\u2019s definition of \u201cparadigm\u201d as \u201cthe entire constellation of beliefs, values, techniques, and so on shared by a member [sic; read \u201cthe members\u201d ] of a given community\u201d (Kuhn, apud Schaefer, 55; cf. 26, n. 41). Schaefer then speaks of the \u201cunity paradigm\u201d central to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed belief and praxis. . . .\n\nThe concluding part of the book begins at section IX, \u201cThe New Paradigm: Progressive Revelation\u201d (106\u2013150). Interestingly, Schaefer speaks of the vertical and horizontal dimensions of religion. The former is \u201cconstant,\u201d while the latter is \u201cvariable\u201d (138). That is to say, the heart of religion\u2014in its \u201cvertical\u201d relationship to the Holy\u2014is essentially mystical and unchanging, while the \u201chorizontal\u201d dimension is socially referenced and thus in a state of flux, conditioned by historical exigencies. \n\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith is referenced to modernity. It represents a veritable \u201cparadigm-shift\u201d in religious history, in which all religions are viewed federally as integral to history. The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith thus offers a unique, teleological theory of civilization that \u201cmakes sense\u201d of history by defining the past in terms of the present. There is a certain acquisitive nature to revelation in that it is a \u201cprogressive\u201d unfoldment of spiritual verities in direct proportion to humanity\u2019s capacity for cognisance of spiritual reality. . . .\n\nBeyond the Clash of Religions: The Emergence of a New Paradigm contributes to an emergent, extracanonical Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed ethos. It is an intellectually respectable articulation of a distinctively Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed world view. This book is recommended as an introduction to the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed religion for educated or intellectually-inclined audiences. More significantly, Udo Schaefer has effectively adapted Kuhn\u2019s concept of \u201cparadigm\u201d and \u201cparadigm-shift\u201d from the history of science to the history of religion. There is every probability that Udo Schaefer\u2019s approach will gain wide currency throughout the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed world.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 56281449, "asset_id": 36371942, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 184507, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Buck", "domain_name": "psu-us", "page_name": "ChristopherBuck", "display_name": "Christopher Buck", "profile_url": "https://psu-us.academia.edu/ChristopherBuck?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/184507/1953985/8181236/s65_christopher.buck.png"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 106, "name": "Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Religion?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 120, "name": "New Religious Movements", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Religious_Movements?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 122, "name": "Comparative Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Comparative_Religion?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 128, "name": "History", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 803, "name": "Philosophy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 902, "name": "Philosophy Of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Philosophy_Of_Religion?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 1302, "name": "Theology", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Theology?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 2059, "name": "History of Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religion?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3348, "name": "Baha'i studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Bahai_studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 7093, "name": "New Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/New_Religions?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 7833, "name": "Study of Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Study_of_Religions?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 10099, "name": "History of Religions", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/History_of_Religions?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 11150, "name": "Islamic Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islamic_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 15866, "name": "Islam", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Islam?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 23482, "name": "Thomas S.

In that context, there has been a shift towards explicit intercultural education through language and culture courses, with a foreign language requirement serving as 'a window on a different culture'. Developing intercultural communication skills demands more than living in a multicultural international environment; explicit intercultural education is needed. This paper describes a project that defined intercultural competence and translated it into intended learning outcomes for 'Language and Culture' courses at our liberal arts college. One of the intended learning outcomes is stated as: 'A student has the tools needed for the ongoing reflection on intercultural contact and the further development of intercultural skills in general'. The biggest challenge was to integrate explicit intercultural education in courses at the introductory level, where students are absolute beginners in the target language. Relevant questions were whether to use the target language exclusively or to make use of the class language (in our case English), and language proficiency would be affected if we dedicated less time to language acquisition. The model discussed was developed for the course Introduction to Italian Studies, which aimed to combine language instruction with intercultural reflection. While presenting the course design and some of the class activities that have been used the rationale behind the choices will be discussed, together with some constrains and an evaluation of the module.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 43452758, "asset_id": 22915777, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 866304, "first_name": "Tatiana", "last_name": "Bruni", "domain_name": "uu", "page_name": "TatianaBruni", "display_name": "Tatiana Bruni", "profile_url": "https://uu.academia.edu/TatianaBruni?f_ri=3556", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/866304/310951/21465580/s65_tatiana.bruni.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 930, "name": "Intercultural Communication", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Communication?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 938, "name": "Critical Discourse Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 972, "name": "Self and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Self_and_Identity?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 2221, "name": "Italian Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italian_Studies?f_ri=3556", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 3392, "name": "Critical Pedagogy", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Pedagogy?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 3556, "name": "Cosmopolitan Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitan_Studies?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 4474, "name": "Critical Thinking", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Thinking?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5272, "name": "Identity (Culture)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_Culture_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 5991, "name": "Intercultural Education", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Education?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 6579, "name": "Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 9650, "name": "Cultural Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Cultural_Identity?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 10633, "name": "Critical Discourse Analysis", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Discourse_Analysis?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 13197, "name": "Language and Identity", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Identity?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 31877, "name": "Italian (Languages And Linguistics)", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italian_Languages_And_Linguistics_?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 33323, "name": "Intercultural Competence", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_Competence?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 33562, "name": "Intercultural dialogue", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Intercultural_dialogue?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 106306, "name": "Interculturality", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Interculturality?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 120708, "name": "Identity and Cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Identity_and_Cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 223022, "name": "Italiano", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Italiano?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 266559, "name": "Critical cosmopolitanism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_cosmopolitanism?f_ri=3556"}, {"id": 781717, "name": "Critical Thinking Skills In Language Classess", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Critical_Thinking_Skills_In_Language_Classess?f_ri=3556"}]}, {"id": 10066978, "title": "Cosmopolitanism and Antagonism in Marx, Schmitt, Balibar, Derrida: Heterogeneous Universalities, Deracination, and Plurality of Worlds", "created_at": "2015-01-08T00:30:55.454-08:00", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/10066978/Cosmopolitanism_and_Antagonism_in_Marx_Schmitt_Balibar_Derrida_Heterogeneous_Universalities_Deracination_and_Plurality_of_Worlds?f_ri=3556", "dom_id": "work_10066978", "summary": "After a long period of suspicion towards universalism, the notion of cosmopolitanism has received a renewed interest from critical theorists in the early 2000s.
