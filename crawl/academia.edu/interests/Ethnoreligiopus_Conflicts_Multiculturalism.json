The material presented is ethnographic, based on the author\u2019s ten years living and working among bilingual urban Malays, and a year making regular visits to rural communities in Narathiwat. One of the few things that informed analysts of South Thailand agree on is that a range of factors contributed to the resumption of violence in 2004. In addition to the role of political legitimacy, there is consensus that progress towards peace is complicated by the involvement of uncivil constituencies from two highly ethnicised religious communities. Despite the importance of ethnoreligious issues this paper argues that ethnolinguistic dynamics\uf0bespecifically language loyalty, loss, and angst\uf0behave much to contribute to the return of peaceful co-existence and reconciliation. Although religious freedom in Thailand is promised and present, few minority languages in Thailand are strong now than they were before policies promulgated in the 1930s. I introduce the range of positions on the role of language and multi-lingualism in the construction of difference and the achievement of peaceful co-existence. I describe the range mono-lingual and bilingual communities in South Thailand. I also recount the variety of ways that Southern Malays have responded to the decline of Malay and the importance of Thai for those wishing to engage in Thai modernity. There is a need to as informed by ethno-linguistic angst as ethno-religious rebellion.", "downloadable_attachments": [{"id": 87631332, "asset_id": 5999051, "asset_type": "Work", "always_allow_download": false}], "ordered_authors": [{"id": 667449, "first_name": "Christopher", "last_name": "Joll", "domain_name": "victoria", "page_name": "ChristopherJoll", "display_name": "Christopher M Joll", "profile_url": "https://victoria.academia.edu/ChristopherJoll?f_ri=259953", "photo": "https://0.academia-photos.com/667449/851788/1060921/s65_cm.joll.jpg"}], "research_interests": [{"id": 15473, "name": "Muslims in Southern Thailand", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Muslims_in_Southern_Thailand?f_ri=259953", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 23643, "name": "Language and Religion", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_and_Religion?f_ri=259953", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 102363, "name": "Malay Studies", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Malay_Studies?f_ri=259953", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 259953, "name": "Ethnoreligiopus Conflicts, Multiculturalism", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Ethnoreligiopus_Conflicts_Multiculturalism?f_ri=259953", "nofollow": false}, {"id": 625059, "name": "Language Loyalty", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loyalty?f_ri=259953"}, {"id": 654841, "name": "Language Loss", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Loss?f_ri=259953"}, {"id": 1015170, "name": "The Malay World", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/The_Malay_World?f_ri=259953"}, {"id": 1280499, "name": "Language Grief", "url": "https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Language_Grief?f_ri=259953"}]}]
